The GIY-YIG nuclease domain has been identified in homing endonucleases, DNA repair and recombination enzymes, and restriction endonucleases. The Type II restriction enzyme Eco29kI belongs to the GIY-YIG nuclease superfamily and, like most of other family members, including the homing endonuclease I-TevI, is a monomer. It recognizes the palindromic sequence 5′-CCGC/GG-3′ (“/” marks the cleavage position) and cuts it to generate 3′-staggered ends. The Eco29kI monomer, which contains a single active site, either has to nick sequentially individual DNA strands or has to form dimers or even higher-order oligomers upon DNA binding to make a double-strand break at its target site. Here, we provide experimental evidence that Eco29kI monomers dimerize on a single cognate DNA molecule forming the catalytically active complex. The mechanism described here for Eco29kI differs from that of Cfr42I isoschisomer, which also belongs to the GIY-YIG family but is functional as a tetramer. This novel mechanism may have implications for the function of homing endonucleases and other enzymes of the GIY-YIG family.
