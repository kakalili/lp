Nucleosomes exert a repressive influence on the biological functions of DNA by restricting the access of proteins to DNA. To investigate how intrinsic properties of nucleosomes modulate DNA-accessibility in vivo, we studied DNA repair by photolyase in the yeast URA3 gene. Formation of DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, CPDs) and photolyase activity are controlled precisely by light. Preceding work revealed that photolyase repairs nucleosome-free DNA rapidly, while repair of nucleosomes is inhibited severely. The high-resolution data presented here show slow repair in the center of nucleosomes and a gradual increase towards the periphery. This pattern was observed in all nucleosomes and demonstrates that dynamic properties facilitate DNA accessibility. Since the URA3 nucleosomes can occupy alternate positions, the repair data are most consistent with nucleosome mobility that moves CPDs in linker DNA where they are repaired rapidly. A partial and transient unfolding or disruption of nucleosomes, however, may not be excluded.In addition, repair heterogeneity was found between closely spaced sites, indicating that structural properties of nucleosomes contribute to damage processing. Moreover, nucleosome-specific modulation of photolyase was found on the transcribed and non-transcribed strand. This is in contrast to homogeneous repair of the transcribed strand by nucleotide excision repair, and reveals fundamental differences in how both repair systems interact with nucleosomes and transcription.
