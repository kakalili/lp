structural basis for simultaneous binding of two carboxy terminal peptides of plant glutamate decarboxylase to calmodulin
activation of glutamate decarboxylase gad by calcium bound calmodulin cam is required for normal plant growth through regulation of  aminobutyrate and glutamate metabolism the interaction of cam with the c terminal domain of gad is believed to induce dimerization of the enzyme an event implicated for ca  dependent enzyme activation here we present the solution structure of cam in complex with a dimer of peptides derived from the c terminus of petunia hybrida gad the  kda ternary complex is pseudo symmetrical with each domain of cam bound to one of the two antiparallel gad peptides which form an x shape with an interhelical angle of    to accommodate the dimeric helical gad target the two domains of cam adopt an orientation markedly different from that seen in other cam  target complexes although the dimeric gad domain is much larger than previously studied cam binding peptides the two cam domains appear closer together and make a number of interdomain contacts not observed in earlier complexes the present structure of a single cam molecule interacting with two target peptides provides new evidence for the conformational flexibility of cam as well as a structural basis for the ability of cam to activate two enzyme molecules simultaneously
