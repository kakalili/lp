rbbp interacts with multifunctional protein yb  through its ring finger domain leading to ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of yb
rbbp  retinoblastoma binding protein  is a   kda multifunctional protein that interacts with both p  and prb and has been implicated in mrna processing it has also been identified as a putative e ubiquitin ligase due to the presence of a ring finger domain although no substrate has been identified up to now using the ring finger domain as bait in a yeast two hybrid screen we identified yb  y box binding protein  as a binding partner of rbbp  localising the interaction to the last  residues of yb  we showed furthermore that both full length rbbp and the isolated ring finger domain were able to ubiquitinate yb  resulting in its degradation in the proteosome as a result rbbp was able to suppress the levels of yb  in vivo and to reduce its transactivational ability in the light of the important role that yb  appears to play in tumourigenesis our results suggest that rbbp may be a relevant target for therapeutic drugs aimed at modifying the activity of yb
