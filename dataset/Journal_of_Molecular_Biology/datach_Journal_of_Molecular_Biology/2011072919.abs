secondary structure of the hiv reverse transcription initiation complex by nmr
initiation of reverse transcription of genomic rna is a key early step in replication of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv upon infection of a host cell viral reverse transcriptase initiates from a specific rna  rna complex formed between a host transfer rna trnalys  and a region at the   end of genomic rna the   end of the trna acts as a primer for reverse transcription of genomic rna we report here the secondary structure of the hiv genomic rna  human trnalys initiation complex using heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance methods we show that both rnas undergo large scale conformational changes upon complex formation formation of the  bp primer helix with the   end of trnalys drives large conformational rearrangements of the trna at the   end while maintaining the anticodon loop for potential loop  loop interactions hiv rna forms an intramolecular helix adjacent to the intermolecular primer helix this helix which must be broken by reverse transcription likely acts as a kinetic block to reverse transcription
