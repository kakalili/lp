the escherichia coli tatabc system and a bacillus subtilis tatac type system recognise three distinct targeting determinants in twin arginine signal peptides
the tat system transports folded proteins across bacterial and thylakoid membranes in gram negative organisms it is encoded by tatabc genes and the system recognizes substrates bearing signal peptides with a conserved twin arginine motif most gram positive organisms lack a tatb gene indicating major differences in organisation and or mechanism here we have characterized the essential targeting determinants that are recognized by a bacillus subtilis tatac type system tatadcd substitution by lysine of either of the twin arginine residues in the tora signal peptide can be tolerated but the presence of twin lysine residues blocks export completely we show that additional determinants can be as important as the twin arginine motif replacement of the   serine by alanine in either the tora or dmsa signal peptide almost blocks export by either the b subtilis tatadcd or escherichia coli tatabc systems firmly establishing the importance of this   residue in these signal peptides surprisingly the  leucine in the dmsa signal peptide sequence srrglv appears to play an equally important role and substitution by alanine or phenylalanine blocks export by both the b subtilis and e coli systems these data identify three distinct determinants whose importance varies depending on the signal peptide in question the data also show that the b subtilis tatadcd and e coli tatabc systems recognize very similar determinants within their target peptides and exhibit surprisingly similar responses to mutations within these determinants
