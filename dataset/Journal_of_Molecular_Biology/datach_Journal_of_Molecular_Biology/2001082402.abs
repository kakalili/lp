snapping up functionally related genes based on context information a colinearity free approach edited by j thornton
we describe a computational approach for finding genes that are functionally related but do not possess any noticeable sequence similarity our method which we call snap similarity neighborhood approach  reveals the conservation of gene order on bacterial chromosomes based on both cross genome comparison and context information the novel feature of this method is that it does not rely on detection of conserved colinear gene strings instead we introduce the notion of a similarity neighborhood graph sn graph  which is constructed from the chains of similarity and neighborhood relationships between orthologous genes in different genomes and adjacent genes in the same genome respectively an sn cycle is defined as a closed path on the sn graph and is postulated to preferentially join functionally related gene products that participate in the same biochemical or regulatory process we demonstrate the substantial non randomness and functional significance of sn cycles derived from real genome data and estimate the prediction accuracy of snap in assigning broad function to uncharacterized proteins examples of practical application of snap for improving the quality of genome annotation are described
