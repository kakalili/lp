Complement receptor type 2 (CR2, CD21) is a cell surface protein that links the innate and adaptive immune response during the activation of B-cells through its binding to C3d, a cleavage fragment of the major complement component C3. The extracellular portion of CR2 comprises 15 or 16 short complement regulator (SCR) domains in a partially folded-back but flexible structure. Here, the effect of C3d binding to CR2 was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and X-ray scattering. The sedimentation coefficient of unbound CR2 is 4.03 S in 50 mM NaCl. Because this agrees well with a value of 3.93 S in 137 mM NaCl, the overall CR2 structure is unaffected by change in ionic strength. Unbound C3d exists in monomer-dimer and monomer-trimer equilibria in 50 mM NaCl, but as a monomer only in 137 mM NaCl. In c(s) size-distribution analyses, an equimolar mixture of the CR2–C3d complex in 50 mM NaCl revealed a single peak shifted to 4.52 S when compared to unbound CR2 at 4.03 S to show that the complex had formed. The CR2–C3d complex in 137 mM NaCl showed two peaks at 2.52 S and 4.07 S to show that this had dissociated. Solution structural models for the CR2 SCR-1/2 complex with C3d and CR2 SCR-1/15 were superimposed. These gave an average sedimentation coefficient of 4.57 S for the complex, in good agreement with the observed value of 4.52 S. It is concluded that CR2 does not detectably change conformation when C3d is bound to it. Consistent with previous analyses, its C3d complex is not formed in physiological salt conditions. The implications of these solution results for its immune role are discussed. To our knowledge, this is the first solution structural study of a large multidomain SCR protein CR2 bound to its physiological ligand C3d.
