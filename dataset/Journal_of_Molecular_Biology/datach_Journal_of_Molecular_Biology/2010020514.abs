single molecule study of dna polymerization activity of hiv  reverse transcriptase on dna templates
hiv  rt human immunodeficiency virus  reverse transcriptase is a multifunctional polymerase responsible for reverse transcription of the hiv genome including dna replication on both rna and dna templates during reverse transcription in vivo hiv  rt replicates through various secondary structures on rna and single stranded dna ssdna templates without the need for a nucleic acid unwinding protein such as a helicase in order to understand the mechanism of polymerization through secondary structures we investigated the dna polymerization activity of hiv  rt on long ssdna templates using a multiplexed single molecule dna flow stretching assay we observed that hiv  rt performs fast primer extension dna synthesis on single stranded regions of dna    nt s and switches its activity to slow strand displacement synthesis at dna hairpin locations    nt s  furthermore we found that the rate of strand displacement synthesis is dependent on the gc content in hairpin stems and template stretching force this indicates that the strand displacement synthesis occurs through a mechanism that is neither completely active nor passive that is the opening of the dna hairpin is driven by a combination of free energy released during dntp deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis and thermal fraying of base pairs our experimental observations provide new insight into the interchanging modes of dna replication by hiv  rt on long ssdna templates
