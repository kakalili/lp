directed evolution of an enhanced and highly efficient foki cleavage domain for zinc finger nucleases
zinc finger nucleases zfns are powerful tools for gene therapy and genetic engineering the high specificity and affinity of these chimeric enzymes are based on custom designed zinc finger proteins zfps  to improve the performance of existing zfn technology we developed an in vivo evolution based approach to improve the efficacy of the foki cleavage domain fcd  after multiple rounds of cycling mutagenesis and dna shuffling a more efficient nuclease variant sharkey was generated in vivo analyses indicated that sharkey is gt  fold more active than wild type fcd on a diverse panel of cleavage sites further a mammalian cell based assay showed a three to sixfold improvement in targeted mutagenesis for zfns containing derivatives of the sharkey cleavage domain we also identified mutations that impart sequence specificity to the fcd that might be utilized in future studies to further refine zfns through cooperative specificity in addition sharkey was observed to enhance the cleavage profiles of previously published and newly selected heterodimer zfn architectures this enhanced and highly efficient cleavage domain will aid in a variety of zfn applications in medicine and biology
