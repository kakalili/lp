structural insights into fibronectin type iii domain mediated signaling
the alternatively spliced type iii extradomain b eiiib of fibronectin fn is expressed only during embryogenesis wound healing and tumorigenesis the biological function of this domain is unclear we describe here the first crystal structure of the interface between alternatively spliced eiiib and its adjacent fn type iii domain  fn b   the opened cc  loop of eiiib and the rotation and tilt of eiiib allow good access to the fg loop of fn  which is normally hindered by the cc  loop of fn  in addition the agegip sequence of the cc    loop of eiiib replaces the ngqqgn sequence of the cc  loop of fn  finally the cc    loop of eiiib forms an acidic groove with fn  these structural findings warrant future studies directed at identifying potential binding partners for fn b  interface linking eiiib to skeletal and cartilaginous development wound healing and tumorigenesis respectively
