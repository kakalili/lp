the hiv plus strand transfer reaction determination of replication competent intermediates and identification of a novel lentiviral element the primer over extension sequence edited by d draper
current retroviral replication models propose that during   strand synthesis the initial    strand trna primer is partially replicated to reproduce the  nt primer binding site pbs  subsequent removal of the trna primer from the    strand template exposes the pbs which anneals to complementary sequences on a dna acceptor template to enable   strand transfer we used model templates composed of primed    strand dna covalently linked with post transcriptionally modified trna lys along with natural sequence human immunodeficiency virus hiv acceptor dna to study the generation of the   strand strong stop intermediate and the subsequent   strand transfer reaction the rate of formation of the   strand transfer reaction products was modestly increased threefold by inclusion of nucleocapsid protein suggesting an ancillary role for this protein in this stage of retroviral replication in addition to the well known stop site opposite g  of the trna primer we detected two additional stop sites opposite   and at a  kinetic analysis showed that only the intermediates formed by stops opposite g  and   were active in the subsequent   strand transfer reaction the surprising discovery of the longer viable   strand interaction intermediate prompted us to survey retroviral sequences for a region complementary to the additional donor dna nucleotides involved in this over extension indeed complementary sequences that could support this over extension were found a strong consensus sequence is immediately adjacent to and downstream of the pbs in lentiviruses and spumaviruses this consensus sequence was not found in other genera of retroviruses we have named this element the  primer over extension sequence   pos  and propose that it provides a complementary sequence for strand transfer reactions proceeding from intermediates that extend beyond the standard  nt complement of the pbs
