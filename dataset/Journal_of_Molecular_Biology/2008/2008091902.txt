To understand whether 5′ and 3′ structural elements of the region corresponding to the mature tRNA affect the expression of the tRNA, we examined several bacterial genomes for tRNA genes where the expression might be potentially affected by structural elements located outside of the mature tRNA. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, our analysis suggested that the tRNATrp is transcribed together with a putative stem–loop structure followed by a uridine tract immediately downstream of the tRNA region. This structural element, resembling a Rho-independent transcription terminator, might therefore influence the expression and processing of tRNATrp. Moreover, the secondary structure suggested that the discriminator base in the tRNATrp precursor can pair with either the C at position −1, the 3′ terminal residue in the 5′ leader, or the C immediately 5′ of the uridine tract of the putative Rho-independent transcription terminator. Here, we present in vivo data demonstrating the importance of residue −1 and the positioning of the putative transcription terminator for the expression of correctly 5′ processed P. aeruginosa tRNATrp in Escherichia coli. Interestingly, we also detected a difference in the appearance of correctly 5′ processed P. aeruginosa tRNATrp in E. coli compared to the situation in P. aeruginosa.
