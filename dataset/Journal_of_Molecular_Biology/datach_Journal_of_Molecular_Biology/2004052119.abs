a structural informatics approach for tracing  sheets building pseudo c  traces for  strands in intermediate resolution density maps
we report the development of two computational methods to assist density map interpretation at intermediate resolutions sheettracer for building pseudo c  models of  sheets and a deconvolution method for enhancing features attributed to major secondary structural elements sheettracer is tightly coupled with sheetminer which was developed to locate sheet densities in intermediate resolution density maps the results from sheetminer are used as inputs to sheettracer which employs a multi step ad hoc morphological analysis of sheet densities to trace individual strands of  sheets the methods were tested on simulated density maps from  protein crystal structures that represent a reasonably complete sampling of sheet morphology the sheet tracing results were quantitatively assessed in terms of sensitivity specificity and rms deviations furthermore sheettracer and the deconvolution method were rigorously tested on experimental maps of the   protein of reovirus at resolutions of    and     our results clearly demonstrate the capability of sheettracer in building pseudo c  models of  sheets in intermediate resolution density maps and the power of the deconvolution method in enhancing the performance of sheettracer these computational methods along with other related ones should facilitate recognition and analysis of folding motifs from experimental data at intermediate resolutions
