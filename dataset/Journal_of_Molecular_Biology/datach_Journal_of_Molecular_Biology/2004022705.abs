genomic organisation chromosomal localisation tissue distribution and developmental regulation of the pr  b  regulatory subunits of protein phosphatase a in mice
protein phosphatase a pp a is a major serine threonine specific phosphatase playing central roles in development cell growth and transformation regulation is largely accomplished by the regulatory b subunits which determine substrate specificity subcellular localisation and catalytic activity the b  family also known as the pr  family is the most diverse consisting of five genes       and   that give rise to a number of splice variants we deduced the sequences of the different pr  proteins in mice and found evidence for the expression of pr               and   we report the genomic organisation and localisation of the murine pr  genes ppp r a ppp r e  this information will be useful for the future realisation of pr  knockouts using northern blotting we examined the expression of the five pr  isoforms in different tissues a brain specific function can be expected for the pr   protein based on the high expression levels observed in murine brain in situ hybridisation analysis of the adult brain revealed a distinct and partially overlapping pattern of mrna expression of the various pr  isoforms the pr  mrna expression during embryonic development was examined by northern blotting the pr  transcripts were differentially expressed suggesting a specific function for each of the pr  proteins during embryonic development and or adult life
