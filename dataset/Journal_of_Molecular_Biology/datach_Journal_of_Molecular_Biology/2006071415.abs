probing the mechanism of gsh activation in schistosoma haematobium glutathione s transferase by site directed mutagenesis and x ray crystallography
during turnover the catalytic tyrosine residue tyr  of the sigma class schistosoma haematobium wild type glutathione s transferase is expected to switch alternately in and out of the reduced glutathione binding site g site  the tyrout  conformer forms a  cation interaction with the guanidinium group of arg  as in other similar glutathione s transferases the catalytic tyr has a low pka of   in order to investigate the catalytic role of tyr  and the structural and functional roles of arg  we carried out structural studies on two arg  mutants r l and r q and a tyr  mutant y f our crystallographic data for the two arg  mutants indicate that only the tyrout  conformation is populated thereby excluding a role of arg  in the stabilisation of the out conformation however arg  was confirmed to be catalytically important and essential for the low pka of tyr  upon comparison with structural data generated for reduced glutathione bound and inhibitor bound wild type enzymes it was observed that the orientations of tyr  and arg  are concerted and that upon ligand binding minor rearrangements occur within conserved residues in the active site loop these rearrangements are coupled to quaternary rigid body movements at the dimer interface and alterations in the localisation and structural order of the c terminal domain
