identification of a conserved aggregation prone intermediate state in the folding pathways of spc sh amyloidogenic variants
we compared the folding pathways of selected mutational variants of the  spectrin sh domain spc sh  by using a continuum model that combines a full atomistic protein representation with the g  potential experimental data show that the n g mutant shows very little tendency to aggregate while the n a and triple mutant d g y are both amyloidogenic with the latter being clearly more aggregation prone we identified a strikingly similar native like folding intermediate across the three mutants in which strand   is totally unstructured and more than half of the major hydrophobic core residues are highly solvent exposed results from extensive docking simulations show that the ability of the intermediates to dimerize is largely driven by strand   and is consistent with the in vitro aggregation behavior reported for the corresponding mutants they further suggest that residues  and   which are key players in the nucleation  condensation mechanism of folding are also important triggers of the aggregation process
