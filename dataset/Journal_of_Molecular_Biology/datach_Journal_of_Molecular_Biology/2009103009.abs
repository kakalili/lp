ligand induced conformational rearrangements promote interaction between the escherichia coli enterobactin biosynthetic proteins ente and entb
siderophores are small molecule iron chelators that many bacteria synthesize and secrete in order to survive in iron depleted environments biosynthesis of enterobactin the escherichia coli catecholate siderophore requires adenylation of   dihydroxybenzoic acid   dhb by the cytoplasmic enzyme ente the dhb amp product is then transferred to the active site of holo entb subsequent to formation of an ente  entb complex here we investigate the binding of   dhb to ente and how dhb binding affects ente  entb interaction we overexpressed and purified recombinant forms of ente and entb with n terminal hexahistidine tags h ente and h entb  isothermal titration calorimetry showed that   dhb binds to h ente with a   stoichiometry and a kd of    m fluorescence spectra revealed enhanced   dhb emission at   nm  ex   nm when bound to h ente due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret between ente intrinsic fluorophore donors and bound   dhb acceptor a fret signal was not observed when h ente was mixed with either   dihydroxybenzoic acid or   dihydroxybenzoic acid the h ente    dhb fret signal was quenched by h entb in a concentration dependent manner from these data we were able to determine the ec  of ente  entb interaction to be approximately    m we also found by fluorescence and cd measurements that h entb can bind   dhb resulting in conformational changes in the protein additional alterations in h entb near uv and far uv cd spectra were observed upon mixture with h ente and   dhb suggesting that further conformational rearrangements occur in entb upon interaction with substrate loaded ente we also found that h entb as a bait protein pulled down a higher concentration of chromosomally expressed ente in the presence of exogenous   dhb taken together our results show that binding of   dhb to ente and entb primes these proteins for efficient complexation thus facilitating direct channeling of the siderophore precursor   dhb amp
