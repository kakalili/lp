backbone engineering within a latent  hairpin structure to design inhibitors of polyglutamine amyloid formation
candidates for the toxic molecular species in the expanded polyglutamine polyq repeat diseases range from various types of aggregates to  misfolded  monomers one way to vet these candidates is to develop mutants that restrict conformational landscapes previously we inserted two self complementary  hairpin enhancing motifs into a short polyq sequence to generate a mutant here called   hp   that exhibits greatly improved amyloid nucleation without measurably enhancing  structure in the monomer ensemble we extend these studies here by introducing single backbone h bond impairing modifications  n methyl gln or l pro at key positions within  hp modifications predicted to allow formation of a fully h bonded  hairpin at the fibril edge while interfering with h bonding to the next incoming monomer exhibit poor amyloid formation and act as potent inhibitors in trans of simple polyq peptide aggregation in contrast a modification that disrupts intra  hairpin h bonding within  hp while also aggregating poorly is ineffective at inhibiting amyloid formation in trans the inhibitors constitute a dynamic version of the edge protection negative design strategy used in protein evolution to limit unwanted protein aggregation our data support a model in which polyq peptides containing strong  hairpin encouraging motifs only rarely form  hairpin conformations in the monomer ensemble but nonetheless take on such conformations at key steps during amyloid formation the results provide insights into polyq solution structure and fibril formation while also suggesting an approach to the design of inhibitors of polyq amyloid growth that focuses on conformational requirements for fibril and nucleus elongation
