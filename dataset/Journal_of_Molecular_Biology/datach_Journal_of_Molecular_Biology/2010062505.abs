molecular mechanism of polypeptide translocation catalyzed by the escherichia coli clpa protein translocase
the removal of damaged or unneeded proteins by atp dependent proteases is crucial for cell survival in all organisms integral components of atp dependent proteases are motor proteins that unfold stably folded proteins that have been targeted for removal these protein unfoldases polypeptide translocases use atp to unfold the target proteins and translocate them into a proteolytic component despite the central role of these motor proteins in cell homeostasis a number of important questions regarding the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed protein unfolding and translocation remain unanswered here we demonstrate that escherichia coli clpa in the absence of the proteolytic component clpp processively and directionally steps along the polypeptide backbone with a kinetic step size of    amino acids independent of the concentration of atp with a rate of    amino acids s   at saturating concentrations of atp in contrast to earlier studies by others we have developed single turnover fluorescence stopped flow methods that allow us to quantitatively examine the molecular mechanism of the motor component clpa decoupled from the proteolytic component clpp for the first time we reveal that in the absence of clpp clpa translocates polypeptides directionally processively and in discrete steps similar to other motor proteins that translocate vectorially on a linear lattice such as nucleic acid helicases and kinesin we believe that the methods employed here will be generally applicable to the examination of other aaa    protein translocases involved in a variety of important biological functions where the substrate is not covalently modified for example membrane fusion membrane transport protein disaggregation and protein refolding
