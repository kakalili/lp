Single-strand-selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) belongs to Family 3 of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) superfamily. Here, we report that a bacterial SMUG1 ortholog in Geobacter metallireducens (Gme) and the human SMUG1 enzyme are not only UDGs but also xanthine DNA glycosylases (XDGs). In addition, mutational analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Gme SMUG1 identify important structural determinants in conserved motifs 1 and 2 for XDG and UDG activities. Mutations at M57 (M57L) and H210 (H210G, H210M, and H210N), both of which are involved in interactions with the C2 carbonyl oxygen in uracil or xanthine, cause substantial reductions in XDG and UDG activities. Increased selectivity is achieved in the A214R mutant of Gme SMUG1, which corresponds to a position involved in base flipping. This mutation results in an activity profile resembling a human SMUG1-like enzyme as exemplified by the retention of UDG activity on mismatched base pairs and weak XDG activity. MD simulations indicate that M57L increases the flexibility of the motif 2 loop region and specifically A214, which may account for the reduced catalytic activity. G60Y completely abolishes XDG and UDG activity, which is consistent with a modeled structure in which G60Y blocks the entry of either xanthine or uracil to the base binding pocket. Most interestingly, a proline substitution at the G63 position switches the Gme SMUG1 enzyme to an exclusive UDG as demonstrated by the uniform excision of uracil in both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA and the complete loss of XDG activity. MD simulations indicate that a combination of a reduced free volume and altered flexibility in the active-site loops may underlie the dramatic effects of the G63P mutation on the activity profile of SMUG1. This study offers insights on the important role that modulation of conformational flexibility may play in defining specificity and catalytic efficiency.
