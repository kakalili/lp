oligomeric states along the folding pathways of   microglobulin kinetics thermodynamics and structure
the transition of proteins from their soluble functional state to amyloid fibrils and aggregates is associated with the onset of several human diseases protein aggregation often requires some structural reshaping and the subsequent formation of intermolecular contacts therefore the study of the conformation of excited protein states and their ability to form oligomers is of primary importance for understanding the molecular basis of amyloid fibril formation here we investigated the oligomerization processes that occur along the folding of the amyloidogenic human protein   microglobulin the combination of real time two dimensional nmr data with real time small angle x ray scattering measurements allowed us to derive thermodynamic and kinetic information on protein oligomerization of different conformational states populated along the folding pathways in particular we could demonstrate that a long lived folding intermediate i state has a higher propensity to oligomerize compared to the native state our data agree well with a simple five state kinetic model that involves only monomeric and dimeric species the dimers have an elongated shape with the dimerization interface located at the apical side of   microglobulin close to pro  the residue that has a trans conformation in the i state and a cis conformation in the native n state our experimental data suggest that partial unfolding in the apical half of the protein close to pro  leads to an excited state conformation with enhanced propensity for oligomerization this excited state becomes more populated in the transient i state due to the destabilization of the native conformation by the trans pro  configuration
