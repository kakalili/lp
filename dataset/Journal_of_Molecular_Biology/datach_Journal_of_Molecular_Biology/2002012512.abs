the upper cytokine binding module and the ig like domain of the leukaemia inhibitory factor lif receptor are sufficient for a functional lif receptor complex edited by m yaniv
to elucidate the function of the two cytokine binding modules cbm of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor lifr  receptor chimeras of lifr and the interleukin  receptor il r were constructed either the nh terminal chimera rillif i or the cooh terminal lifr cbm chimera rillif ii were replaced by the structurally related cbm of the il r which does not bind lif chimera rillif i is functionally inactive whereas rillif ii binds lif and mediates signalling as efficiently as the wild type lifr deletion mutants of the lifr revealed that both the nh terminal cbm and the ig like domain of the lifr are involved in lif binding presumably via the lif site iii epitope the main function of the cooh terminal cbm of the lifr is to position the nh terminal cbm and the ig like domain so that these can bind to lif in analogy to a recently published model of the il r complex a model of the active lifr complex is suggested which positions the cooh terminal cbm at lif site i and the nh terminal cbm and the ig like domain at site iii an additional contact is postulated between the ig like domain of gp  and the nh terminal cbm of the lifr
