structural basis of rxr dna interactions edited by p e wright
the  cis retinoic acid receptor rxr binds dna effectively as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other nuclear receptors the dna binding sites for these rxr complexes are direct repeats of a consensus sequence separated by one to five base pairs of intervening space here we report the    crystal structure of the rxr dna binding domain as a homodimer in complex with its idealized direct repeat dna target the structure shows how a gene regulatory site can induce conformational changes in a transcription factor that promote homo cooperative assembly specifically an alpha helix in the t box is disrupted to allow efficient dna binding and subunit dimerization rxr displays a relaxed mode of sequence recognition interacting with only three base pairs in each hexameric half site the structure illustrates how site selection is achieved in this large eukaryotic transcription factor family through discrete protein protein interactions and the use of tandem dna binding sites with characteristic spacings
