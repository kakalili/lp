ultrasonication dependent acceleration of amyloid fibril formation
amyloid fibrils similar to crystals form through nucleation and growth because of the high free energy barrier of nucleation the spontaneous formation of amyloid fibrils occurs only after a long lag phase ultrasonication is useful for inducing amyloid nucleation and thus for forming fibrils while the use of a microplate reader with thioflavin t fluorescence is suitable for detecting fibrils in many samples simultaneously combining the use of ultrasonication and microplate reader we propose an efficient approach to studying the potential of proteins to form amyloid fibrils with   microglobulin an amyloidogenic protein responsible for dialysis related amyloidosis fibrils formed within a few minutes at ph    even under neutral ph conditions fibrils formed after a lag time of   h the results propose that fibril formation is a physical reaction that is largely limited by the high free energy barrier which can be effectively reduced by ultrasonication this approach will be useful for developing a high throughput assay of the amyloidogenicity of proteins
