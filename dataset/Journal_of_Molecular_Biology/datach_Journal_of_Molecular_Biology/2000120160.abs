crystal structure of escherichia coli udpmurnac tripeptide d alanyl d alanine adding enzyme murf at    resolution edited by i wilson
murf is required to catalyze the final step in the synthesis of the cytoplasmic precursor of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan rendering it an attractive target for antibacterial drug development the crystal structure of the murf apo enzyme has been determined using the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined to    resolution it contains three consecutive open    sheet domains in comparison with the complex crystal structures of murd and its substrates the topology of the n terminal domain of murf is unique while its central and c terminal domains exhibit similar mononucleotide and dinucleotide binding folds respectively the apo enzyme of murf crystal structure reveals an open conformation with the three domains juxtaposed in a crescent like arrangement creating a wide open space where substrates are expected to bind as such catalysis is not feasible and significant domain closure is expected upon substrate binding
