structural changes in a hydrophobic domain of the prion protein induced by hydration and by ala  val and pro  leu substitutions edited by p e wright
x ray diffraction was used to study the structure of assemblies formed by synthetic peptide fragments of the prion protein prp that include the hydrophobic domain implicated in the gerstmann str ussler scheinker gss mutation p  l  the effects of hydration on polypeptide assembly and of ala  val substitutions in the hydrophobic domain were characterized synthetic peptides included  i syrian hamster sha hydrophobic core sha     ktnmkhmagaaaagavv  ii sha     a v  with a  v mutations at     and   kpktnmkhmvgvaavgavv  iii mouse mo wild type sequence of the n terminal hydrophobic domain mo   wt and iv the same mouse sequence with leucine substitution for proline at residue number   mo    p  l  samples of sha    that formed assemblies while drying under ambient conditions showed x ray patterns indicative of    thick slab like structures having extensive h bonding and intersheet stacking by contrast lyophilized peptide that was equilibrated against    relative humidity showed assemblies with only a few layers of  sheets the ala  val substitutions in sha    and mo    p  l resulted in the formation of    wide cross  fibrils observation of similar size  sheet fibrils formed by peptides sha     a v and the longer mo    p  l supports the notion that the hydrophobic sequence forms a template or core that promotes the  folding of the longer peptide the substitution of amino acids in the mutants e g  a  v and p  l enhances the folding of the peptide into compact structural units significantly enhancing the formation of the extensive  sheet fibrils
