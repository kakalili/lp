the bzip like motif of hnrnp c directs the nuclear accumulation of pre mrna and lethality in yeast edited by j karn
the hnrnp c protein tetramer cooperatively binds   nt increments of pre mrna in vitro in a salt resistant manner and is located along the length of vertebrate transcripts in vivo based on these and other findings it has been suggested that hnrnp c functions as a chaperonin to maintain long lengths of rna topologically single stranded and accessible to splicing factors we report here that human c protein is lethal when expressed in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae through a series of fluorescent immunolocalization studies lethality was observed to be associated with the rapid nuclear accumulation of both c protein and yeast pre mrna studies using various protein constructs and the two hybrid assay reveal that these events are dependent on the basic  residue high affinity rna binding domain and its contiguous leucine zipper like motif the bzlm residues      additionally equilibrium binding studies have shown that the bzlm is the determinant of c protein  s salt resistant rna binding mode taken together these findings further distinguish the bzip like domain as the major determinant of c protein  s high affinity interaction with rna oligomerization and its highly cooperative rna binding activity finally these findings indicate that yeast and vertebrates may possess a conserved mechanism for general import of rnp although a true homolog to vertebrate c protein appears not to exist in yeast lethality is likely due to the absence in yeast of specific mechanisms for the removal of human c protein from nascent transcripts
