hamlet forms annular oligomers when deposited with phospholipid monolayers
recently the anticancer activity of human  lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells hamlet has been linked to its increased membrane affinity in vitro at neutral ph and ability to cause leakage relative to the inactive native bovine  lactalbumin bla protein in this study atomic force microscopy resolved membrane distortions and annular oligomers aos produced by hamlet when deposited at neutral ph on mica together with a negatively charged lipid monolayer bla bamlet hamlet s bovine counterpart and membrane binding peptide c corresponding to bla residues      also form ao like structures under these conditions but at higher subphase concentrations than hamlet the n terminal peptide a which binds to membranes at acidic but not at neutral ph did not form aos this suggests a correlation between the capacity of the proteins peptides to integrate into the membrane at neutral ph  as observed by liposome content leakage and circular dichroism experiments  and the formation of aos albeit at higher concentrations formation of aos which might be important to hamlet s tumor toxic action appears related to the increased tendency of the protein to populate intermediately folded states compared to the native protein the formation of which is promoted by but not uniquely dependent on the oleic acid molecules associated with hamlet
