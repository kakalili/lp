a hydrophobic filter confers the cation selectivity of zygosaccharomyces rouxii plasma membrane na h antiporter
na h antiporters may recognize all alkali metal cations as substrates but may transport them selectively plasma membrane zygosaccharomyces rouxii sod   antiporter exports na and li  but not k  the molecular basis of this selectivity is unknown we combined protein structure modeling site directed mutagenesis phenotype analysis and cation efflux measurements to localize and characterize the cation selectivity region a three dimensional model of the zrsod   transmembrane domain was generated based on the x ray structure of the escherichia coli nhaa antiporter and primary sequence alignments with homologous yeast antiporters the model suggested a close proximity of thr   ala  and val  from transmembrane segments   and   respectively forming a hydrophobic hole in the putative cation pathway s core a series of mutagenesis experiments verified the model and showed that structural modifications of the hole resulted in altered cation selectivity and transport activity the triple zrsod   mutant t  s a  t v  i gained k transport capacity the point mutation a  t restricted the antiporter substrate specificity to li and reduced its transport activity while serine at this position preserved the native cation selectivity the negative effect of the a  t mutation can be eliminated by introducing a second mutation t  s or t  a in the preceding transmembrane domain our experimental results confirm that the three residues found through modeling play a central role in the determination of cation selectivity and transport activity in z rouxii na h antiporter and that the cation selectivity can be modulated by repositioning a single local methyl group
