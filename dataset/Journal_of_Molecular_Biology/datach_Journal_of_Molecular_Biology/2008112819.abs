a single mutation in the if n terminal domain perturbs the fidelity of translation initiation at three levels
bacterial translation initiation factor  if  is involved in the fidelity of translation initiation at several levels including start codon discrimination mrna translation and initiator trna selection the if c terminal domain ctd is required for binding to the  s ribosomal subunit n terminal domain ntd function is less certain but likely contributes to initiation fidelity point mutations in either domain can decrease initiation fidelity but c terminal domain mutations may be indirect here the y n substitution mutation in the ntd is examined in vitro and in vivo if y n protein binds  s subunits normally but is defective in start codon discrimination inhibition of initiation on leaderless mrna and initiator trna selection thereby establishing a direct role for the if ntd in these initiation processes a model illustrating how if modulates an inherent function of the  s subunit is discussed
