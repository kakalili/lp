a cytosolic trna with an unmodified adenosine in the wobble position reads a codon ending with the non complementary nucleoside cytidine edited by d draper
out of more than   sequenced cytosolic trnas there is only one with an unmodified adenosine in the wobble position position   the reason for this rare occurrence of a  is that it is mostly deaminated to inosine   i   i  is a common constituent in the wobble position of trnas and has a decoding capacity different from that of a  we have isolated a mutant prol   of salmonella typhimurium in which the wobble nucleoside g  has been replaced by an unmodified a in trnagggpro which is the only trna that normally reads the ccc codon thus this mutant apparently has no trna that is considered cognate for the codon ccc despite this the mutant grows normally as expected pro trna selection at the ccc codon in the a site in a mutant deleted for the prol gene which encodes the trnagggpro was severely reduced however in comparison this rate of selection was only slightly reduced in the prol  mutant with its a  containing trnaaggpro suggesting that this trna reads ccc moreover measurements of the interference by a trna residing in the p site on the apparent termination efficiency at the a site indicated that indeed the a  containing trna reads the ccc codon we conclude that a  in a cytosolic trna is not detrimental to the cell and that the mutant trnaaggpro is able to read the ccc codon like its wild type counterpart trnagggpro we suggest that the decoding of the ccc codon by a   agg   anticodon occurs by a wobble base pair between a protonated a  and a c in the mrna
