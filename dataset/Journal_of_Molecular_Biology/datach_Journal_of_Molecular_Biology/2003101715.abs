fourteen protomers compose the oligomer iii of the proton rotor in spinach chloroplast atp synthase
three fundamentally different chloroplast atp synthase samples of increasing complexity were visualized by atomic force microscopy the samples are distinguishable in respect to the isolation technique the detergent employed and the final subunit composition the homo oligomer iii was isolated following sds treatment of atp synthase the proton turbine iii iv was obtained by blue native electrophoresis and complete cfo was isolated by anion exchange chromatography of nascn splitted atp synthase in all three atp synthase subcomplexes  and only  circularly arranged subunits iii composed the intact transmembrane rotor therefore   protomers built the membrane resident proton turbine the observed stoichiometry of  is not a biochemical artifact or affected by natural growth variations of the spinach as previously suggested a correlation between the presence of subunit iv in the imaged sample and the appearance of a central protrusion in the narrower orifice of the oligomeric cylinder iii  has been observed in contrast to current predictions in chloroplast fo the subunit iv can be found inside the cylinder iii  and not at its periphery at least in the reconstituted d arrays imaged
