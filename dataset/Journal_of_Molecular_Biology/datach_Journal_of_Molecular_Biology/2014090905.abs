structure of a c perfringens enterotoxin mutant in complex with a modified claudin  extracellular loop
cpe clostridium perfringens enterotoxin is the major virulence determinant for c perfringens type a food poisoning the second most common bacterial food borne illness in the uk and usa after binding to its receptors which include particular human claudins the toxin forms pores in the cell membrane the mature pore apparently contains a hexamer of cpe claudin and possibly occludin the combination of high binding specificity with cytotoxicity has resulted in cpe being investigated with some success as a targeted cytotoxic agent for oncotherapy in this paper we present the x ray crystallographic structure of cpe in complex with a peptide derived from extracellular loop  of a modified cpe binding claudin  together with high resolution native and pore formation mutant structures our structure provides the first atomic resolution data on any part of a claudin molecule and reveals that claudin s cpe binding fingerprint nplvp is in a tight turn conformation and binds as expected in cpe s c terminal claudin binding groove the leucine and valine residues insert into the binding groove while the first residue asparagine tethers the peptide via an interaction with cpe s aspartate   and the two prolines are required to maintain the tight turn conformation understanding the structural basis of the contribution these residues make to binding will aid in engineering cpe to target tumor cells
