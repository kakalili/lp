conformational changes in adeno associated virus type  induced by genome packaging
adeno associated virus aav is frequently used as a vector for gene therapy the viral capsid consists of three structural proteins vp  vp  and vp  that have a common c terminal core vp  with n terminal extensions of increasing length in vp and vp  the capsid encloses a single stranded genome of up to   kb which is packaged into empty capsids the n terminal extension of vp carries a phospholipase domain that becomes accessible during infection in the endosomal pathway we have used cryo electron microscopy and image reconstruction to determine subnanometer resolution structures of recombinant aav that has packaged different amounts of a    kb recombinant genome the maps show that the aav capsid undergoes continuous conformational changes upon packaging of the genome the rearrangements occur at the inner capsid surface and lead to constrictions of the pores at the  fold symmetry axes and to subtle movements of the  sheet regions of the capsid proteins in fully packaged particles the genome forms stem like features that contact the inner capsid surface at the  fold symmetry axes we think that the reorganization of the inner surface has an impact on the viral life cycle during infection preparing the externalization of phospholipase domains through the pores at the  fold symmetry axes and possibly genome release
