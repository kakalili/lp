biosynthesis of riboflavin structure and properties of   diamino  ribosylamino  h pyrimidinone   phosphate reductase of methanocaldococcus jannaschii
the pyrimidine reductase of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway mjared specified by the open reading frame mj   of methanocaldococcus jannaschii was expressed in escherichia coli using a synthetic gene the synthetic open reading frame that was optimized for expression in e coli directed the synthesis of abundant amounts of the enzyme with an apparent subunit mass of   kda the enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity and was shown to catalyze the conversion of   diamino  ribosylamino  h pyrimidinone   phosphate into   diamino  ribitylamino  h pyrimidinone   phosphate at a rate of    mol min   mg   at ph   and at    c the protein is a homodimer as shown by sedimentation equilibrium analysis and sediments at an apparent velocity of   s the structure of the enzyme in complex with the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was determined by x ray crystallography at a resolution of     the folding pattern resembles that of dihydrofolate reductase with the thermotoga maritima ortholog as the most similar structure the substrate   diamino  ribosylamino  h pyrimidinone   phosphate was modeled into the putative active site the model suggests the transfer of the pro r hydrogen of c  of nadph to c   of the substrate
