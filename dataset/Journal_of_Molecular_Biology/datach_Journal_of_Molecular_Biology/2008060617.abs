time resolved infrared spectroscopy of ph induced aggregation of the alzheimer a     peptide
aggregation of the alzheimer s disease related a     peptide was induced by a rapid sub millisecond ph jump and monitored by time resolved infrared spectroscopy on the millisecond to second time scale the release of protons was induced by the photolysis of a caged compound    nitrophenyl ethyl sulfate npe sulfate  the ph jump generated in our experimental setup is used to model the a  peptide structural conversions that may occur in the acidic endosomal lysosomal cell compartment system the aggregation of the a     peptide induced by the ph jump from   to lt  yields an antiparallel  sheet structure the kinetics of the structural transition is biphasic showing an initial rapid phase with a transition from random coil to an oligomeric  sheet form with a time constant of   s this phase is followed by a second slower transition which yields larger aggregates during    s
