structural dynamics of archaeal small heat shock proteins
small heat shock proteins shsps are a widespread and diverse class of molecular chaperones in vivo shsps contribute to thermotolerance recent evidence suggests that their function in the cellular chaperone network is to maintain protein homeostasis by complexing a variety of non native proteins one of the most characteristic features of shsps is their organization into large sphere like structures commonly consisting of  or  subunits here we investigated the functional and structural properties of hsp   an shsp from archaeoglobus fulgidus in comparison to its relative hsp   from methanocaldococcus jannaschii hsp   is active in suppressing the aggregation of different model substrates at physiological and heat stress temperatures electron microscopy showed that hsp   forms two distinct types of octahedral oligomers of slightly different sizes indicating certain structural flexibility of the oligomeric assembly by three dimensional analysis of electron microscopic images of negatively stained specimens we were able to reconstitute d models of the assemblies at a resolution of     under conditions of heat stress the distribution of the structurally different hsp   assemblies changed and this change was correlated with an increased chaperone activity in analogy to hsp   hsp   oligomers displayed structural dynamics and exhibited increased chaperone activity under conditions of heat stress thus temperature induced conformational regulation of the activity of shsps may be a general phenomenon in thermophilic archaea
