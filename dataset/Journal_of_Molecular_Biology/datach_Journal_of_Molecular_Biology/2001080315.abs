domain shuffling as a tool for investigation of protein function substitution of the cysteine rich region of raf kinase and pkc  for that of yeast pkc p edited by a r fersht
with the completion of the sequences of entire genomes the need for functional characterisation of proteins and their domains is becoming acute conserved regions within proteins often share overlapping functions but despite this conservation may fulfil quite different tasks in different species in this work we investigated the cysteine rich motif c domain of yeast protein kinase c pkc p as a model to establish a test system for domain function c domains activate kinases through binding of either diacylglycerol and or phosphatidylserine as in many members of the protein kinase c pkc family or by binding small gtpases as in raf kinase in contrast to other members of the protein kinase c superfamily pkc p of saccharomyces cerevisiae is activated via binding of the small g protein rho p to its c domain we developed a system for domain shuffling to establish the function of c domains from human raf kinase and rat pkc  in yeast only the c domain from raf kinase enabled the chimeric enzyme to bind rho p when substituted for the native yeast domain accordingly a chimeric pkc p carrying the c from raf kinase but not that from pkc   was able to partially complement the phenotypes of a yeast pkc deletion mutant we interpret these data as further evidence that interaction with a small gtpase is the main regulatory function of the c domain in yeast
