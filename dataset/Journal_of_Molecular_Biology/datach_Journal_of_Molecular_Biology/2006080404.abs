crystal structure of dps  a functionally distinct dps protein from deinococcus radiodurans
dna protection during starvation dps proteins play an important role in protecting cellular macromolecules from damage by reactive oxygen species ros  unlike most orthologs that protect dna by a combination of dna binding and prevention of hydroxyl radical formation by ferroxidation and sequestration of iron dps  from the radiation resistant deinococcus radiodurans fails to protect dna from hydroxyl radical mediated cleavage through a mechanism inferred to involve continuous release of iron from the protein core to address the structural basis for this unusual release of fe  the crystal structure of d radiodurans dps  was determined to     resolution two of four strong anomalous signals per protein subunit correspond to metal binding sites within an iron uptake channel and a ferroxidase site common features related to the canonical functions of dps homologs similar to lactobacillus lactis dps a metal binding site is found at the n terminal region unlike other metal sites this site is located at the base of an n terminal coil on the outer surface of the dodecameric protein sphere and does not involve symmetric association of protein subunits intriguingly a unique channel like structure is seen featuring a fourth metal coordination site that results from  fold symmetrical association of protein subunits through   helices the presence of this metal binding site suggests that it may define an iron exit channel responsible for the continuous release of iron from the protein core this interpretation is supported by substitution of residues involved in this ion coordination and the observation that the resultant mutant protein exhibits significantly attenuated iron release therefore we propose that d radiodurans dps  has a distinct iron exit channel
