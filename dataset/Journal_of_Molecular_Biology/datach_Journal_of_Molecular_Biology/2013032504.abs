localized structural fluctuations promote amyloidogenic conformations in transthyretin
the process of transthyretin ttr misfolding and aggregation including amyloid formation appears to cause a number of degenerative diseases during amyloid formation the native protein undergoes a tetramer to folded monomer transition followed by local unfolding of the monomer to an assembly competent amyloidogenic intermediate here we use nmr relaxation dispersion to probe conformational exchange at physiological ph between native monomeric ttr the f m l  m variant and a small population of a transiently formed amyloidogenic intermediate the dispersion experiments show that a majority of the residues in the  sheet containing  strands d a g and h undergo conformational fluctuations on microsecond to millisecond timescales exchange broadening is greatest for residues in the outer  strand h which hydrogen bonds to  strand h  of a neighboring subunit in the tetramer but the associated structural fluctuations propagate across the entire  sheet fluctuations in the other  sheet are limited to the outer  strand f which packs against strand f  in the tetramer while the b c and e  strands of this sheet remain stable the structural changes were also investigated under more forcing amyloidogenic conditions ph      where  strand d and regions of the d  e and e  f loops were additionally destabilized increasing the population of the amyloidogenic intermediate and accelerating amyloid formation strands b c and e appear to maintain native like conformations in the partially unfolded amyloidogenic state of wild type ttr in the case of the protective mutant t  m the conformational fluctuations are suppressed under both physiological and mildly acidic conditions indicating that the dynamic properties of ttr correlate well with its aggregation propensity
