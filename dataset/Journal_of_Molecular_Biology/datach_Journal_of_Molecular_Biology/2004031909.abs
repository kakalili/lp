the molecular defect leading to fabry disease structure of human  galactosidase
fabry disease is an x linked lysosomal storage disease afflicting  in    males with chronic pain vascular degeneration cardiac impairment and other symptoms deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme  galactosidase   gal causes an accumulation of its substrate which ultimately leads to fabry disease symptoms here we present the structure of the human  gal glycoprotein determined by x ray crystallography the structure is a homodimer with each monomer containing a     domain with the active site and an antiparallel  domain n linked carbohydrate appears at six sites in the glycoprotein dimer revealing the basis for lysosomal transport via the mannose  phosphate receptor to understand how the enzyme cleaves galactose from glycoproteins and glycolipids we also determined the structure of the complex of  gal with its catalytic product the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme is revealed by the location of two aspartic acid residues d  and d   which act as a nucleophile and an acid base respectively as a point mutation in  gal can lead to fabry disease we have catalogued and plotted the locations of   missense and nonsense mutations in the three dimensional structure the structure of human  gal brings fabry disease into the realm of molecular diseases where insights into the structural basis of the disease phenotypes might help guide the clinical treatment of patients
