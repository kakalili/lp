structural signatures of enzyme binding pockets from order independent surface alignment a study of metalloendopeptidase and nad binding proteins
detecting similarities between local binding surfaces can facilitate identification of enzyme binding sites and prediction of enzyme functions and aid in our understanding of enzyme mechanisms constructing a template of local surface characteristics for a specific enzyme function or binding activity is a challenging task as the size and shape of the binding surfaces of a biochemical function often vary here we introduce the concept of signature binding pockets which captures information on preserved and varied atomic positions at multiresolution levels for proteins with complex enzyme binding and activity multiple signatures arise naturally in our model forming a signature basis set that characterizes this class of proteins both signatures and signature basis sets can be automatically constructed by a method called solar signature of local active regions  this method is based on a sequence order independent alignment of computed binding surface pockets solar also provides a structure based multiple sequence fragment alignment to facilitate the interpretation of computed signatures by studying a family of evolutionarily related proteins we show that for metzincin metalloendopeptidase which has a broad spectrum of substrate binding signature and basis set pockets can be used to discriminate metzincins from other enzymes to predict the subclass of metzincins functions and to identify specific binding surfaces studying unrelated proteins that have evolved to bind to the same nad cofactor we constructed signatures of nad binding pockets and used them to predict nad binding proteins and to locate nad binding pockets by measuring preservation ratio and location variation our method can identify residues and atoms that are important for binding affinity and specificity in both cases we show that signatures and signature basis set reveal significant biological insight
