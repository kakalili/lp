catalytic role of the substrate defines specificity of therapeutic l asparaginase
type ii bacterial l asparaginases l asp have played an important therapeutic role in cancer treatment for over four decades yet their exact reaction mechanism remains elusive l asp from escherichia coli deamidates asparagine asn and glutamine with an   higher specificity kcat km for asparagine despite only one methylene difference in length through a sensitive kinetic approach we quantify competition among the substrates and interpret its clinical role to understand specificity we use molecular simulations to characterize enzyme interactions with substrates and a product aspartate  we present evidence that the aspartate product in the crystal structure of l asp exists in an unusual  cooh protonation state consequently the set of enzyme  product interactions found in the crystal structure which guided prior mechanistic interpretations differs from those observed in dynamic simulations of the enzyme with the substrates finally we probe the initial nucleophilic attack with ab initio simulations the unusual protonation state reappears suggesting that crystal structures wild type and a t v mutant represent intermediate steps rather than initial binding also a proton transfers spontaneously to asn advancing a new hypothesis that the substrate s  carboxyl serves as a proton acceptor and activates one of the catalytic threonines during l asp s nucleophilic attack on the amide carbon that hypothesis explains for the first time why proximity of the substrate  coo  group to the carboxamide is absolutely required for catalysis the substrate s catalytic role is likely the determining factor in enzyme specificity as it constrains the allowed distance between the backbone carboxyl and the amide carbon of any l asp substrate
