bacteriophage t capsid a unique platform for efficient surface assembly of macromolecular complexes
we report the first description of a macromolecular complex display system using bacteriophage t  decorated with two dispensable outer capsid proteins hoc   copies and soc   copies  the   nm   nm t capsid particle offers a unique binding site rich platform for surface assembly of hetero oligomeric complexes to display the   kda anthrax toxin complex two bipartite functional fusion proteins lf hoc and lfn soc were constructed using a defined in vitro binding system sequential assembly was performed by first attaching lf hoc and or lfn soc to hoc  soc  phage saturating the hoc and soc binding sites trypsin nicked pa  was then assembled into heptamers through specific interaction with the capsid exposed lfn domain ef was then attached to the unoccupied sites of pa  heptamers completing the assembly of the tripartite anthrax toxin negative electron microscopy showed decoration of each capsid with a layer of heptameric pa  rings up to   anthrax toxin complexes equivalent to a total of   protein molecules and a mass of about   mda   times the mass of capsid shell  were anchored on a single particle making it the highest density display reported on any virus the phage t capsid lattice provides a stable biological platform allowing maximum display of large hetero oligomeric complexes in vitro and offers insights for developing novel vaccines analysis of protein  protein interactions and structure determination of complexes
