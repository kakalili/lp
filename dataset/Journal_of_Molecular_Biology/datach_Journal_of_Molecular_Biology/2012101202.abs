chemical reactivity of brome mosaic virus capsid protein
viral particles are biological machines that have evolved to package protect and deliver the viral genome into the host via regulated conformational changes of virions we have developed a procedure to modify lysine residues with s methylthioacetimidate across the ph range from   to   lysine residues that are not completely modified are involved in tertiary or quaternary structural interactions and their extent of modification can be quantified as a function of ph this procedure was applied to the ph dependent structural transitions of brome mosaic virus bmv  as the reaction ph increases from   to   the average number of modified lysine residues in the bmv capsid protein increases from  to   correlating well with the known ph  dependent swelling behavior of bmv virions the extent of reaction of each of the capsid protein s lysine residues has been quantified at eight ph values using coupled liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry each lysine can be assigned to one of three structural classes identified by inspection of the bmv virion crystal structure several lysine residues display reactivity that indicates their involvement in dynamic interactions that are not obvious in the crystal structure the influence of several capsid protein mutants on the ph dependent structural transition of bmv has also been investigated mutant h q exhibits an altered swelling transition accompanying solution ph increases the h q capsids show increased reactivity at lysine residues  and   residues distal from the dimer interface occupied by h  across the entire ph range
