d structure and interaction of p   and p   golgi dynamics domains implication for p  complex formation and cargo transport
the p  family consists of four subfamilies p   p   p   and p    and the proteins are thought to form hetero oligomeric complexes for efficient transport of cargo proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the golgi apparatus the proteins possess a conserved luminal golgi dynamics gold domain whose functions are largely unknown here we present structural and biochemical studies of p   and p   gold domains use of gold domain deleted mutants revealed that the gold domain of p   is required for proper p  hetero oligomeric complex formation and efficient transport of gpi anchored proteins the p   and p   gold domains share a common  sandwich fold with a characteristic intrasheet disulfide bond the gold domain of p   crystallized as dimers allowing the analysis of a homophilic interaction site surface plasmon resonance and solution nmr analyses revealed that p   and p   gold domains interact weakly kd     m  bi protein titration provided interaction site maps we propose that the heterophilic interaction of p  gold domains contributes to the formation of the p  hetero oligomeric complex and to efficient cargo transport
