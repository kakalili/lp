calmodulin disrupts the structure of the hiv  ma protein
the ma protein from hiv  is a small multifunctional protein responsible for regulating various stages of the viral replication cycle to achieve its diverse tasks ma interacts with host cell proteins and it has been reported that one of these is the ubiquitous calcium sensing calmodulin cam  which is up regulated upon hiv  infection the nature of the cam  ma interaction has been the subject of structural studies using peptides based on the ma sequence that have led to conflicting conclusions the results presented here show that cam binds intact ma with   stoichiometry in a ca  dependent manner and that the complex adopts a highly extended conformation in solution as revealed by small angle x ray scattering alterations in tryptophan fluorescence suggest that the two buried tryptophans w  and w  located in the first two alpha helices of ma mediate the cam interaction major chemical shift changes occur in the nmr spectrum of ma upon complex formation whereas chemical shift changes in the cam spectrum are quite modest and are assigned to residues within the normal target protein binding hydrophobic clefts of cam the nmr data indicate that cam binds ma via its n and c terminal lobes and induces a dramatic conformational change involving a significant loss of secondary and tertiary structure within ma circular dichroism experiments suggest that ma loses    of its  helical content upon cam binding thus cam binding is expected to impact upon the accessibility of interaction sites within ma that are involved in its various functions
