the crystal structure of cupriavidus necator nitrate reductase in oxidized and partially reduced states
the periplasmic nitrate reductase napab from cupriavidus necator is a heterodimeric protein that belongs to the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family of mononuclear mo containing enzymes and catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite the protein comprises a large catalytic subunit napa   kda containing the molybdenum active site plus one  fe  s cluster as well as a small subunit napb   kda  which is a diheme c type cytochrome involved in electron transfer crystals of the oxidized form of the enzyme diffracted beyond     at the european synchrotron radiation facility this is the highest resolution reported to date for a nitrate reductase providing true atomic details of the protein active center and this showed further evidence on the molybdenum coordination sphere corroborating previous data on the related desulfovibrio desulfuricans napa the molybdenum atom is bound to a total of six sulfur atoms with no oxygen ligands or water molecules in the vicinity in the present work we were also able to prepare partially reduced crystals that revealed two alternate conformations of the mo coordinating cysteine this crystal form was obtained by soaking dithionite into crystals grown in the presence of the ionic liquid c mim cl   in addition uv  vis and epr spectroscopy studies showed that the periplasmic nitrate reductase from c necator might work at unexpectedly high redox potentials when compared to all periplasmic nitrate reductases studied to date
