real time visualization of phospholipid degradation by outer membrane phospholipase a using high speed atomic force microscopy
phospholipases are abundant in various types of cells and compartments where they play key roles in physiological processes as diverse as digestion cell proliferation and neural activation in gram negative bacteria outer membrane phospholipase a ompla is involved in outer membrane lipid homeostasis and bacterial virulence although the enzymatic activity of ompla can be probed with an assay relying on an artificial monoacyl thioester substrate only little is known about its activity on diacyl phospholipids here we used high speed atomic force microscopy hs afm to directly image enzymatic phospholipid degradation by ompla in real time in the absence of ca  reconstituted ompla diffused within a phospholipid bilayer without revealing any signs of phospholipase activity upon the addition of ca  ompla was activated and degraded the membrane with a turnover of  phospholipid molecules per second and per ompla dimer until most of the membrane phospholipids were hydrolyzed and the protein became tightly packed
