the rna i motif edited by j a wells
oligodeoxynucleotides with stretches of cytidine residues associate into a four stranded structure the i motif in which two head to tail intercalated parallel stranded duplexes are held together by hemiprotonated c c pairs we have investigated the possibility of forming an i motif structure with c rich ribonucleic acids the four c rich rnas studied r uc  r c  r c u and r uc  associate into multiple intercalated structures at acidic ph r uc  forms two i motif structures that differ by their intercalation topologies we report on a structural study of the main form and we analyze the small conformational differences found by comparison with the dna i motif the stacking topology of the main structure avoids one of the six   oh   oh repulsive contacts expected in a fully intercalated structure the c   endo pucker of the rna sugars and the orientation of the intercalated c c pairs result in a modest widening of the narrow grooves at the steps where the hydroxyl groups are in close contact the free energy of the rna i motif on average   kj mol   per c c pair is half of the value found in dna i motif structures
