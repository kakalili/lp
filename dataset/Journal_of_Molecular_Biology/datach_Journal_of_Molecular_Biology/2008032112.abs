vacuolar protein sorting two different functional states of the aaa atpase vps p
the vacuolar protein sorting vps pathway in which vps class i aaa atpases play a central role regulates growth factor receptors immune response and developmental signaling and participates in tumor suppression apoptosis and retrovirus budding we present the first atomic structure of the nucleotide free yeast his  nvps p dimer and its amppnp    adenylyl    imidodiphosphate bound tetradecamer derived from a cryo electron microscopy map vps p dimers form two distinct heptameric rings and accommodate aaa cassettes in a head to head  not in a head to tail  fashion as in class ii aaa atpases our model suggests a mechanism for disassembling escrt endosomal sorting complex required for transport complexes by movements of substrate binding domains located at the periphery of the tetradecamer during atp hydrolysis in one ring followed by translocation through the central pore and atp hydrolysis in the second ring
