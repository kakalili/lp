structural basis of tbx  dna recognition the t box domain in its dna bound and unbound form
tbx  a member of the t box transcription factor family plays an important role in heart and limb development more than  single point or deletion mutations of human tbx are associated with holt  oram syndrome that manifests itself as heart and limb malformations in  out of     live births the majority of these mutations are located in the tbx t box domain we solved the crystal structures of the human tbx t box domain in its dna unbound form and in complex with a natural dna target site allowing for the first time the comparison between unbound and dna bound forms our analysis identifies a   helix at the c terminus of the t box domain as an inducible recognition element critically required for the interaction with dna as it only forms upon dna binding and is unstructured in the dna unbound form using circular dichroism we characterized the thermal stability of six tbx mutants containing single point mutations in the t box domain m v g r w  g g  r t  m and r  w and compared them with wild type protein mutants g r and w  g show drastically reduced thermal stability while the other mutants only show a marginal stability decrease for all tbx mutants binding affinities to specific and nonspecific dna sequences were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry all tbx mutants show reduced binding affinities to a specific dna target site although to various degrees interestingly all tested tbx mutants differ in their ability to bind unspecific dna indicating that both sequence specific and unspecific binding might contribute to the misregulation of target gene expression
