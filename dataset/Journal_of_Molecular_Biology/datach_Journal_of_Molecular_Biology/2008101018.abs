crystal structure of the intact archaeal translation initiation factor  demonstrates very high conformational flexibility in the   and  subunits
in eukarya and archaea translation initiation factor  eif aif  which contains three subunits     and   is pivotal for binding of charged initiator trna to the small ribosomal subunit the crystal structure of the full sized heterotrimeric aif from sulfolobus solfataricus in the nucleotide free form has been determined at    resolution superposition of four molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal and the comparison of the obtained structures with the known structures of the aif   and aif   heterodimers revealed high conformational flexibility in the   and  subunits in fact the full sized aif consists of a rigid central part formed by the  subunit domain  of the  subunit and the n terminal  helix of the  subunit and two mobile  wings   formed by domains  and  of the  subunit the central part and the zinc binding domain of the  subunit high structural flexibility of the wings is probably required for interaction of aif with the small ribosomal subunit comparative analysis of all known structures of the  subunit alone and within the heterodimers and heterotrimers in nucleotide bound and nucleotide free states shows that the conformations of switch  and switch  do not correlate with the assembly or nucleotide states of the protein
