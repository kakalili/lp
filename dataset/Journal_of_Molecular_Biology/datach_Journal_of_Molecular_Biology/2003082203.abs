coactivator binding promotes the specific interaction between ligand and the pregnane x receptor
the pregnane x receptor pxr detects the presence of a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds and is a master regulator of the expression of genes central to drug metabolism and excretion we present the    crystal structure of the human pxr ligand binding domain lbd in complex with the cholesterol lowering compound sr   and a  amino acid residue fragment of the human steroid receptor coactivator  src  containing one lxxll motif pxr crystallizes as a homodimer in the asymmetric unit in this structure and possesses a novel   helix adjacent to its ligand binding cavity the src  peptide forms two distinct helices and binds adjacent to the ligand dependent transactivation af  helix on the surface of pxr in contrast with previous pxr structures in which sr   bound in multiple orientations the small sr   agonist in this structure binds in a single unique orientation within the receptor s ligand binding pocket and contacts the af  helix thermal denaturation studies reveal that the sr   ligand and src  coactivator peptide each stabilize the lbd of pxr and that together they exert an additive effect on the stability of the receptor these results indicate that the binding of coactivator to the surface of pxr limits the ability of this promiscuous receptor to  breathe  and helps to trap a single active conformation of sr    they further reveal that specificity is required for pxr activation
