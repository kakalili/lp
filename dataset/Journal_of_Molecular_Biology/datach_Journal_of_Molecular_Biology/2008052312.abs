escherichia coli rnase p rna substrate ribose modifications at g  but not nucleotide     base pairing affect the transition state for cleavage chemistry
the temperature dependence of processing of precursor trnagly ptrnagly variants carrying a single   och or locked nucleic acid lna modification at g  by escherichia coli endoribonuclease p rna was studied at rate limiting chemistry we show for the first time that these ribose modifications at nucleotide  increase the activation energy and alter the activation parameters for the transition state of hydrolysis at the canonical c  cleavage site between nucleotides   and   the modified substrates particularly the one with lna at g  caused an increase in the activation enthalpy  h   which was partly compensated for by a simultaneous increase in the activation entropy  s   nmr imino proton spectra of model acceptor stems derived from the same ptrna variants unveiled that a ribot or u at   forms two hydrogen bonds with u   thus extending the acceptor stem by  bp the non canonical base pair is substantially stabilized by lna substitution at nucleotides   or   to address if the activation energy increase owing to lna at g  stems from dissociation of the u     u   base pair as a prerequisite for interaction of u   with u  in endoribonuclease p rna we tested a ptrnagly variant that is capable of forming an extra c     g   watson  crick base pair however compared with a control ptrna c at    u at    no significant change in activation parameters was observed for this ptrna thus our results argue against the possibility that breaking of an additional base pair at the end of the acceptor stem may present an energetic barrier for reaching the transition state of the chemical step for cleavage at the canonical c  phosphodiester
