the spliceosomal protein sf b is a novel component of drosophila saga that functions in gene expression independent of splicing
the interaction between splicing factors and the transcriptional machinery provides an intriguing link between the coupled processes of transcription and splicing here we show that the two components of the sf b complex sf b and sf b  that form part of the u small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle snrnp are also subunits of the spt ada gcn acetyltransferase saga transcriptional coactivator complex in drosophila melanogaster whereas sf b had previously been identified as a human saga subunit sf b had not been identified as a component of saga in any species we show that sf b and sf b bind to saga independent of rna and interact with multiple saga subunits including sgf  and spt in a yeast two hybrid assay through analysis of sf b mutant flies we show that sf b is necessary for proper development and cell viability but not for histone acetylation although sf b does not appear to function in saga s histone modifying activities sf b is still required for expression of a subset of saga regulated genes independent of splicing thus our data support an independent function of sf b in saga s transcription coactivator activity that is separate from its role in splicing
