The turnover of native collagen has been ascribed to different members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family. Here, the mechanisms by which neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8), gelatinase A (MMP-2), and the ectodomain of MT1-MMP (ectMMP-14) degrade fibrillar collagen were examined. In particular, the hydrolysis of type I collagen at 37 °C was investigated to identify functional differences in the processing of the two α–chain types of fibrillar collagen. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were used for a quantitative comparison of the binding, unwinding, and hydrolysis of triple helical collagen. We demonstrate that the MMP family has developed at least two distinct mechanisms for collagen unwinding and cleavage. MMP-8 and ectMMP-14 display a similar mechanism (although with different catalytic parameters), which is characterized by binding (likely through the hemopexin-like domain) and cleavage of α–1 and/or α–2 chains without distinguishing between them and keeping the gross conformation of the triple helix (at least during the first cleavage step). On the other hand, MMP-2 binds preferentially the α–1 chains (likely through the fibronectin-like domain, which is not present in MMP-8 and ectMMP-14), grossly altering the whole triple helical arrangement of the collagen molecule and cleaving preferentially the α–2 chain. These distinctive mechanisms underly a drastically different mode of interaction with triple helical fibrillar collagen I, according to which the MMP domain is involved in binding. These findings can be related to the different role exerted by these MMPs on collagen homeostasis in the extracellular matrix.
