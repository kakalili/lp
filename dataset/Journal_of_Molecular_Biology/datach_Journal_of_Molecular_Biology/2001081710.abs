crystal structure of the  s proteasome tmc  a complex a non covalent proteasome inhibitor edited by i a wilson
the  s proteasome core particle cp  a multicatalytic protease is involved in a variety of biologically important processes including immune response cell cycle control metabolic adaptation stress response and cell differentiation therefore selective inhibition of the cp will be one possible way to influence these essential pathways recently a new class of specific proteasome inhibitors tmc  s was investigated and we now present a biochemical and crystallographic characterisation of the yeast proteasome core particle in complex with the natural product tmc  a this unusual heterocyclic compound specifically blocks the active sites of cps non covalently without modifying the nucleophilic thr residue the inhibitor is bound to the cp by specific hydrogen bonds with the main chain atoms of the protein analysis of the crystal structure of the complex has revealed which portions of tmc  s are essential for binding to the proteasome this will form the basis for the development of synthetic selective proteasome inhibitors as promising candidates for anti tumoral or anti inflammatory drugs
