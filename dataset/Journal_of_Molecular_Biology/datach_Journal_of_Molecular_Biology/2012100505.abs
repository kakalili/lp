immature and mature human astrovirus structure conformational changes and similarities to hepatitis e virus
human astroviruses hastvs are a major cause of gastroenteritis hastv assembles from the structural protein vp  and undergoes a cascade of proteolytic cleavages cleavage to vp  is required for release of immature particles from cells and subsequent cleavage by trypsin confers infectivity we used electron cryomicroscopy and icosahedral image analysis to determine the first experimentally derived three dimensional structures of an immature vp  virion and a fully proteolyzed infectious virion both particles display t  icosahedral symmetry and nearly identical solid capsid shells with diameters of     globular spikes emanate from the capsid surface yielding an overall diameter of     while the immature particles display  dimeric spikes the mature capsid only displays  spikes located on the icosahedral  fold axes loss of the  peripentonal spikes likely plays an important role in viral infectivity in addition immature hastv bears a striking resemblance to the structure of hepatitis e virus hev like particles as previously predicted from structural similarity of the crystal structure of the astrovirus spike domain with the hev p domain dong j  dong l  m ndez e  amp tao y     crystal structure of the human astrovirus capsid spike proc natl acad sci usa           similarities between their capsid shells and dimeric spikes and between the sequences of their capsid proteins suggest that these viral families are phylogenetically related and may share common assembly and activation mechanisms
