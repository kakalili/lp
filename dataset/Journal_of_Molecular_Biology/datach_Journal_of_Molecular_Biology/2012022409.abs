an analog of bix    selectively inhibits a family of histone h lysine  jumonji demethylases
bix    and its analogs were originally identified and subsequently designed as potent inhibitors against histone h lysine  h k  methyltransferases g a and g a like protein here we show that bix    and its analog e  can also inhibit h k jumonji demethylase kiaa   with half maximal inhibitory concentrations in low micromolar range crystallographic analysis of kiaa   jumonji domain in complex with e  indicated that the benzylated six membered piperidine ring was disordered and exposed to solvent removing the moiety generating compound e   has no effect on the potency against kiaa   but unexpectedly lost inhibition against g a like protein by a factor of    furthermore e  and e   have no effect on the activity against histone h lysine  h k  demethylase jarid c thus our study provides a new avenue for designing and improving the potency and selectivity of inhibitors against h k jumonji demethylases over h k methyltransferases and h k demethylases
