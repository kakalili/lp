controllable activation of nanoscale dynamics in a disordered protein alters binding kinetics
the phosphorylation of specific residues in a flexible disordered activation loop yields precise control of signal transduction one paradigm is the phosphorylation of s  s  in the intrinsically disordered tail of the multi domain scaffolding protein nherf  which affects the intracellular localization and trafficking of nherf assembled signaling complexes using neutron spin echo spectroscopy nse  we show salt concentration dependent excitation of nanoscale motion at the tip of the c terminal tail in the phosphomimic s  d s  d mutant the  tip of the whip  that is unleashed is near the s  s  phosphorylation site and flanks the hydrophobic ezrin binding motif the kinetic association rate constant of the binding of the s  d s  d mutant to the ferm domain of ezrin is sensitive to buffer salt concentration correlating with the excited nanoscale dynamics the results suggest that electrostatics modulates the activation of nanoscale dynamics of an intrinsically disordered protein controlling the binding kinetics of signaling partners nse can pinpoint the nanoscale dynamics changes in a highly specific manner
