drosophila act f indirect flight muscle specific actin is not n terminally acetylated a mutation in n terminal processing affects actin function edited by j karn
many eukaryotic proteins are co and post translationally modified at their n termini by removal of one or two amino acid residues and n  acetylation actins show two different forms of n terminal processing dependent on their n terminal sequence in class ii actins which include muscle actins the common primary sequence of met cys asp actin is processed to acetyl asp actin the functional significance of this in vivo is unknown we have studied the indirect flight muscle specific actin act f of drosophila melanogaster our results show that act f is n terminally processed in vivo as a class ii actin by removal of the first two amino acid residues met and cys  but that uniquely the n terminus is not acetylated in addition we show that act f is methylated probably at his  flies carrying the mod  mutation fail to complete post translational processing of act f we propose that the mod gene product is normally responsible for removing n acetyl cysteine from actin the biological significance of this process is demonstrated by observations that retention of the n acetyl cysteine in act f affects the flight muscle function of mod  flies this suggests that the extreme n terminus affects actomyosin interactions in vivo a proposal we have examined by in vitro motility assays of act f f actin from mod  flies the mod  actin only moves in the presence of methylcellulose a viscosity enhancing agent where it moves at velocities slightly but significantly reduced compared to wild type these data confirm that n acetyl cysteine at the n terminus affects actomyosin interactions probably by reducing formation of the initial actomyosin collision complex a process known to involve the actin n terminus
