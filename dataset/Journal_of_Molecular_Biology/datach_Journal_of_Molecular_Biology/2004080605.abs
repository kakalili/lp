crystal structure of the reaction complex of  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase from thermotoga maritima refines the catalytic mechanism and indicates a new mechanism of allosteric regulation
deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase dahps catalyzes the first reaction of the aromatic biosynthetic pathway in bacteria fungi and plants the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate pep and d erythrose  phosphate e p with the formation of dahp crystals of dahps from thermotoga maritima dahpstm were grown in the presence of pep and metal cofactor cd  and then soaked with e p at   c where the catalytic activity of the enzyme is negligible the crystal structure of the  frozen  reaction complex was determined at    resolution the subunit of the dahpstm homotetramer consists of an n terminal ferredoxin like fl domain and a     barrel domain the active site located at the c end of the barrel contains cd  pep and e p the latter bound in a non productive conformation the productive conformation of e p is suggested and a catalytic mechanism of dahps is proposed the active site of dahpstm is nearly identical to the active sites of the other two known dahps structures from escherichia coli dahpsec and saccharomyces cerevisiae dahpssc  however the secondary tertiary and quaternary structures of dahpstm are more similar to the functionally related enzyme  deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase kdops from e coli and aquiflex aeolicus than to dahpsec and dahpssc although dahpstm is feedback regulated by tyrosine and phenylalanine it lacks the extra barrel segments that are required for feedback inhibition in dahpsec and dahpssc a sequence similarity search revealed that dahpss of phylogenetic family i  possess a fl domain like dahpstm while those of family i  have extra barrel segments similar to those of dahpsec and dahpssc this indicates that the mechanism of feedback regulation in dahpstm and other family i  enzymes is different from that of family i  enzymes most likely being mediated by the fl domain
