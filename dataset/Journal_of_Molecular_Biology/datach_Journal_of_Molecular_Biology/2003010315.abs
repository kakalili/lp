functional analysis of the glutathione s transferase  from onchocerca volvulus ov gst   a parasite gst confers increased resistance to oxidative stress in caenorhabditis elegans
this study examined the genomic organisation of the coding region of the glutathione s transferase  ov gst  from the human parasitic nematode onchocerca volvulus alternative splicing leads to three different transcripts ov gst   ov gst   and ov gst    since the expression of ov gst  is inducible by oxidative stress it is assumed that it is involved in the defense against reactive oxygen species ros resulting from cellular metabolism furthermore we suggest that ov gst  plays an important role in the protection of the parasite against ros derived from the host s immune system to experimentally investigate these speculations we generated caenorhabditis elegans lines transgenic for ov gst  ak  and examined their resistance to artificially generated ros the ak worms extrachromosomal and integrated lines were found to be much more resistant to internal juglone and external hypoxanthine xanthine oxidase oxidative stress than wild type c elegans worms rna interference experiments targeted to the ov gst  transcripts resulted in decreased resistance confirming that this effect is due to the transgenic expression of ov gst  these results clearly demonstrate that the ov gst  gene confers an increased resistance to oxidative stress this study also shows the applicability of c elegans as a model organism for the functional characterization of genes from parasitic nematode species which are not accessible to genetic manipulations
