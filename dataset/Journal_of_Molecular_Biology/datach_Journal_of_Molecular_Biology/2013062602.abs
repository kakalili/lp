design of synthetic autonomous vh domain libraries and structural analysis of a vh domain bound to vascular endothelial growth factor
we compared the capacity of an autonomous heavy chain variable vh domain vh b a to support diversity within its antigen binding site relative to the conventional antigen binding fragment fab from which it was derived we find that vh b a can tolerate significant diversity within all three complementarity determining regions cdrs and also within framework  and thus vh b a and the fab are similar in terms of the regions of the antigen binding site that can tolerate diversity without compromising stability we constructed libraries of synthetic vh domains and isolated binders with moderate affinity for vascular endothelial growth factor vegf from a library in which only cdr was randomized one binder was subjected to affinity maturation to derive an autonomous vh domain vh v a that recognized both human and mouse vegf with high affinity kd  nm or  nm respectively  structural analysis revealed that vh v a binds to an epitope that is distinct from the epitopes of a natural vegf receptor and six different anti vegf fabs moreover vh v a recognizes vegf by using an unusual paratope consisting predominantly of cdr but with significant contributions from framework residues within the former light chain interface these results suggest that vh b a and other autonomous vh domains may be useful scaffolds to support both conventional libraries with antigen binding sites built from the three cdr loops and also nonconventional libraries with antigen binding sites built from cdr and the former light chain interface
