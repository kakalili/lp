genetic basis of common human disease insight into the role of missense snps from genome wide association studies
recent genome wide association studies gwas have led to the reliable identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms snps at a number of loci associated with increased risk of specific common human diseases each such locus implicates multiple possible candidate snps for involvement in disease mechanism a variety of mechanisms may link the presence of an snp to altered in vivo gene product function and hence contribute to disease risk here we report an analysis of the role of one of these mechanisms missense snps mssnps in proteins in seven complex trait diseases linkage disequilibrium information was used to identify possible candidate mssnps associated with increased disease risk at each of   loci for the seven diseases two computational methods were used to estimate which of these snps has a significant impact on in vivo protein function   of the loci have at least one candidate mssnp and   have at least one predicted high impact mssnp in some cases these snps are in well established disease related proteins such as mst  macrophage stimulating  for crohn s disease in others they are in proteins identified by gwas as likely candidates for disease relevance but previously without known mechanism such as adamts  adam metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type  motif   for coronary artery disease in still other cases the missense snps are in proteins not previously suggested as disease candidates such as tubb  tubulin beta  class vi for hypertension together these data support a substantial role for this class of snps in susceptibility to common human disease
