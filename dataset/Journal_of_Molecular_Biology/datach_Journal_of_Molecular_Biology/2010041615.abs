lactose binding to galectin  modulates structural dynamics increases conformational entropy and occurs with apparent negative cooperativity
galectins are a family of lectins with a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain that interacts with  galactosides by binding cell surface glycoconjugates galectin  gal  is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes and is an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis here we used heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and molecular modeling to investigate lactose binding to gal  and to derive solution nmr structures of gal  in the lactose bound and unbound states structure analysis shows that the  strands and loops around the lactose binding site which are more open and dynamic in the unbound state fold in around the bound lactose molecule dampening internal motions at that site and increasing motions elsewhere throughout the protein to contribute entropically to the binding free energy cd data support the view of an overall more open structure in the lactose bound state analysis of heteronuclear single quantum coherence titration binding data indicates that lactose binds the two carbohydrate recognition domains of the gal  dimer with negative cooperativity in that the first lactose molecule binds more strongly k       m   than the second k       m    isothermal calorimetry data fit using a sequential binding model present a similar picture yielding k        m   and k          m   molecular dynamics simulations provide insight into structural dynamics of the half loaded lactose state and together with nmr data suggest that lactose binding at one site transmits a signal through the  sandwich and loops to the second binding site overall our results provide new insight into gal  structure  function relationships and to protein  carbohydrate interactions in general
