the novel protein complex with smarcad kiaa   binds to the vicinity of tss
the smarcad kiaa   protein is structurally classified into the swi snf superfamily of dna dependent atpases that are catalytic subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes although the importance of other members of the swr like subfamily in chromatin remodeling ep   inoc  and srcap has already been elucidated the biological function of smarcad kiaa   in transcriptional regulation remains to be clarified to gain insight into the role of this protein we generated a specific antibody against smarcad kiaa   and used it for chromatin and protein immunoprecipitation assays we employed high resolution genome tiling microarrays in chromatin immunoprecipitation and found the binding sites of smarcad kiaa   in the vicinity of the transcriptional start site of  candidate target genes in the protein immunoprecipitation assay we found that endogenous smarcad kiaa   binds with trim  a recently highlighted transcriptional regulator in the cancer field from these findings we propose a novel model for gene regulation via the smarcad kiaa   protein complex
