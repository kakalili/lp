a thermophilic mini chaperonin contains a conserved polypeptide binding surface combined crystallographic and nmr studies of the groel apical domain with implications for substrate interactions edited by a r fersht
a homologue of the escherichia coli groel apical domain was obtained from thermophilic eubacterium thermus thermophilus the domains share   sequence identity   out of   residues  the thermal stability of the t thermophilus apical domain tm gt   c as evaluated by circular dichroism is at least   c greater than that of the e coli apical domain tm   c  the crystal structure of a selenomethione substituted apical domain from t thermophilus was determined to a resolution of     using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing the structure is similar to that of the e coli apical domain root mean square deviation     based on main chain atoms  the thermophilic structure contains seven additional salt bridges of which four contain charge stabilized hydrogen bonds only one of the additional salt bridges would face the  anfinsen cage  in groel high temperatures were exploited to map sites of interactions between the apical domain and molten globules nmr footprints of apical domain protein complexes were obtained at elevated temperature using n h correlation spectra of n labeled apical domain footprints employing two polypeptides unrelated in sequence or structure an insulin monomer and the sry high mobility group box each partially unfolded at   c are essentially the same and consistent with the peptide binding surface previously defined in e coli groel and its apical domain peptide complexes an additional part of this surface comprising a short n terminal  helix is observed the extended footprint rationalizes mutagenesis studies of intact groel in which point mutations affecting substrate binding were found outside the  classical  peptide binding site our results demonstrate structural conservation of the apical domain among groel homologues and conservation of an extended non polar surface recognizing diverse polypeptides
