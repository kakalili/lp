the structure of rhamnose isomerase from escherichia coli and its relation with xylose isomerase illustrates a change between inter and intra subunit complementation during evolution
using a new expression construct rhamnose isomerase from escherichia coli was purified and crystallized the crystal structure was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined to a crystallographic residual of    at    resolution rhamnose isomerase is a tight tetramer of four     barrels a comparison with other known structures reveals that rhamnose isomerase is most similar to xylose isomerase alignment of the sequences of the two enzymes based on their structures reveals a hitherto undetected sequence identity of   suggesting that the two enzymes evolved from a common precursor the structure and arrangement of the     barrels of rhamnose isomerase are very similar to xylose isomerase each enzyme does however have additional  helical domains which are involved in tetramer association and largely differ in structure the structures of complexes of rhamnose isomerase with the inhibitor l rhamnitol and the natural substrate l rhamnose were determined and suggest that an extended loop which is disordered in the native enzyme becomes ordered on substrate binding and may exclude bulk solvent during catalysis unlike xylose isomerase this loop does not extend across a subunit interface but contributes to the active site of its own subunit it illustrates how an interconversion between inter and intra subunit complementation can occur during evolution in the crystal structure although not necessarily in vivo rhamnose isomerase appears to bind zn  at a  structural  site in the presence of substrate the enzyme also binds mn  at a nearby  catalytic  site an array of hydrophobic residues not present in xylose isomerase is likely to be responsible for the recognition of l rhamnose as a substrate the available structural data suggest that a metal mediated hydride shift mechanism which is generally favored for xylose isomerase is also feasible for rhamnose isomerase
