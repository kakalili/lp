dynamic simulations of  tata variants refine kinetic hypotheses of sequence activity relationships edited by b honig
the fundamental relationship between dna sequence deformability and biological function has attracted numerous experimental and theoretical studies a classic prototype system used for such studies in eukaryotes is the complex between the tata element transcriptional regulator and the tata box binding protein tbp  the recent crystallographic study by burley and co workers demonstrated the remarkable structural similarity contrasted to different transcriptional activity of  tbp dna complexes in which the dnas differed by single base pairs by simulating these tata variants and two other single base pair variants that were not crystallizable we uncover sequence dependent structural energetic and flexibility properties that tailor tata elements to tbp interactions complementing many previous studies by refining kinetic hypotheses on sequence activity correlations the factors that combine to produce favorable elements for tbp activity include overall flexibility minor groove widening as well as roll rise and shift increases at the ends of the tata element untwisting within the tata element accompanied by large roll at the tata element ends and relatively low maximal water densities around the dna these features accompany the severe deformation induced by the minor groove binding protein which kinks the tata element at the ends and displaces local water molecules to form stabilizing hydrophobic contacts interestingly the preferred bending direction itself is not a significant predictor of activity disposition although certain variants such as wild type admlp    tata g    and inactive a     ta g    exhibit large preferred bends in directions consistent with their activity or inactivity major groove and minor groove bends respectively  these structural flexibility and hydration preferences identified here and connected to a new crystallographic study of a larger group of dna variants than reported to date highlight the profound influence of single base pair dna variations on dna motion our refined kinetic hypothesis suggests the functional implications of these motions in a kinetic model of tata tbp recognition inviting further theoretical and experimental research
