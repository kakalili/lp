the cop signalosome mediates  catenin degradation by deneddylation and blocks adenomatous polyposis coli destruction via usp
the wnt  catenin signalling pathway has important roles in normal cellular proliferation development and angiogenesis many malignant transformations including sporadic colorectal tumours are caused by constitutive activation of the wnt route due to mutations in the tumour suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli apc or the  catenin oncogene ultimately resulting in reduced  catenin degradation by the ubiquitin ub proteasome system ups  the cop signalosome csn regulates the ups by controlling cullin ring ub ligases crls  we show here that the csn and the  catenin destruction complex cooperate in targeting  catenin for degradation by the ups together with the crl that ubiquitinates  catenin they form a supercomplex responsible for  catenin degradation wnt a glycogen synthase kinase   inhibitors or mutation of csn mediated deneddylation induce the disassembly of the supercomplex and the accumulation of  catenin likewise downregulation of the csn in hela cells leads to retarded degradation of  catenin additionally we found that the knockdown of the csn causes accelerated proteolysis of apc an essential component of the  catenin destruction complex which is degraded by the ups as  catenin we show here that apc is stabilised by the ub specific protease   usp  associated with the csn this is demonstrated by over expression of sirna oligonucleotides against usp  or by over expression of an usp  mutant which is unable to degrade poly ub chains thus the csn controls the wnt  catenin signalling by assisting the assembly of  catenin degrading supercomplexes by deneddylation and simultaneously by stabilising apc via csn associated usp  the csn regulates the balance between  catenin and apc disturbance of this balance can cause cancer by driving cell transformation tumour angiogenesis and metastasis a model is provided that proposes a role of csn mediated deneddylation in the formation of the  catenin degrading supercomplex and the protection of complex bound apc via csn associated usp
