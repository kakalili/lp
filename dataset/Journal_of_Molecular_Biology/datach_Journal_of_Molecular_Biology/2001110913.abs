molecular anatomy of ccr engagement by physiologic and viral chemokines and hiv  envelope glycoproteins differences in primary structural requirements for rantes mip   and vmip ii binding edited by p e wright
molecular analysis of ccr  the cardinal coreceptor for hiv  infection has implicated the n terminal extracellular domain n ter and regions vicinal to the second extracellular loop ecl  in this activity it was shown that residues in the n ter are necessary for binding of the physiologic ligands rantes ccl  and mip   ccl  vmip ii encoded by the kaposi  s sarcoma associated herpesvirus is a high affinity ccr antagonist but lacks efficacy as a coreceptor inhibitor therefore we compared the mechanism for engagement by vmip ii of ccr to its interaction with physiologic ligands rantes mip   and vmip ii bound ccr at high affinity but demonstrated partial cross competition characterization of  ccr alanine scanning mutants of charged extracellular amino acids revealed that alteration of acidic residues in the distal n ter abrogated binding of rantes mip   and vmip ii whereas mutation of residues in ecl of ccr dramatically reduced the binding of rantes and mip   and their ability to induce signaling interaction with vmip ii was not altered by any mutation in the exoloops of the receptor paradoxically monoclonal antibodies to n ter epitopes did not block chemokine binding but those mapped to ecl were effective inhibitors a ccr chimera with the distal n ter residues of cxcr bound mip   and vmip ii with an affinity similar to that of the wild type receptor engagement of ccr by vmip ii but not rantes or mip   blocked the binding of monoclonal antibodies to the receptor providing additional evidence for a distinct mechanism for viral chemokine binding analysis of the coreceptor activity of randomly generated mouse human ccr chimeras implicated residues in ecl between h  and v  in this function rantes but not vmip ii blocked ccr m tropic coreceptor activity in the fusion assay the insensitivity of vmip ii binding to mutations in ecl provides a potential rationale to its inefficiency as an antagonist of ccr coreceptor activity these findings suggest that the molecular anatomy of ccr binding plays a critical role in antagonism of coreceptor activity
