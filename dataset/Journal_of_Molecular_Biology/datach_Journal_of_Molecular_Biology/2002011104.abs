loop inserted and thermostabilized structure of p p   cleaved ovalbumin mutant r  t edited by r huber
ovalbumin is a member of a superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors known as the serpins it is however non inhibitory towards serine proteinases and lacks the loop insertion mechanism common to the serpins due to unknown structural factors mutant ovalbumin r  t in which the p  hinge residue is replaced was produced and analyzed for its thermostability and three dimensional structure differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the mutant ovalbumin but not the wild type protein undergoes a marked thermostabilization  tm     c following the p p   cleavage furthermore the crystal structure solved at    resolution clearly proved that the p p   cleaved form assumes the fully loop inserted conformation as seen in serpin that possess inhibitory activity we therefore conclude that ovalbumin acquires the structural transition mechanism into the loop inserted thermostabilized form by the single hinge mutation the mutant protein does not however possess inhibitory activity the solved structure displays the occurrence of specific interactions that may prevent the smooth motion relative to sheet a of helices e and f and of the loop that follows helix f these observations provide crucial insights into the question why r  t is still non inhibitory
