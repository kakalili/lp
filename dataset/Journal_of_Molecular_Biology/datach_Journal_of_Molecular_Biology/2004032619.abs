anchoring a cationic ligand the structure of the fab fragment of the anti morphine antibody b and its complex with morphine
the crystal structures of an anti morphine antibody b  to    resolution and its complex with morphine to    resolution are reported the morphine binding site is described as a shallow depression on the protein surface an unusual topology for a high affinity ka   m   antibody against a small antigen the polar part of the ligand is exposed to solvent and the cationic nitrogen atom of the morphine molecule is anchored at the bottom of the binding site by a salt bridge to a glutamate side chain additional affinity is provided by a double cation   interaction with two tryptophan residues comparison of the morphine complex with the structure of the free fab shows that a domain closure occurs upon binding of the ligand
