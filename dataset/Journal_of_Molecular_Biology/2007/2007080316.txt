Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) carries a variety of host proteins in addition to virus-encoded structural proteins, both in its envelope and inside the viral particle. Previous studies have reported that the HIV-1 life-cycle is affected by such virus-associated host cell surface proteins. The nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-1 (NTPDase1), also known as CD39, is a plasma membrane-bound ectoenzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP to AMP. It has been shown that CD39 inhibits platelet function, and is thus a critical thromboregulatory molecule. We demonstrate here that host-derived CD39 is acquired by both laboratory-adapted and clinical variants of HIV-1 produced in cellular reservoirs of the virus. Moreover, purified CD39-bearing virions, but not isogenic viruses lacking CD39, display strong ATPase and ADPase activities. It is of particular interest that virions bearing this cellular enzyme can inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation, an effect blocked by an NTPDase inhibitor. On the basis of published and the present data on the functionality of human cellular proteins embedded within HIV-1, it can be proposed that these proteins might contribute to some of the immunologic deficiencies seen in infected individuals.
