modulation of antigenicity related to changes in antibody flexibility upon lyophilization edited by w baumeister
lyophilization is frequently used to increase the shelf life of biopharmaceuticals containing antibodies a case in which an anti idiotypic antibody mma   substantially lost its in vivo immunogenic properties although the protein was not degraded is investigated the scanning transmission electron microscope allowed the mma   fab and fc moieties to be resolved by averaging the single antibodies the angle between the fab moieties can be calculated non lyophilized antibodies displayed a wider range of shapes than their reconstituted lyophilized counterparts accordingly the angle between the two fab fragments varied more indicating greater flexibility the tryptophan steady state fluorescence intensity steady state fluorescence anisotropy and fluorescence lifetime were smaller for the lyophilized antibodies these were also more resistant towards thermal denaturation aggregation circular dichroism spectra detected temperature dependent differences between the two antibody types in the   nm region the subtle but reproducible structural changes induced by lyophilization may be related to the loss of in vivo immunogenic properties
