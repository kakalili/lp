the crystal structure of human phosphoglucose isomerase at    resolution implications for catalytic mechanism cytokine activity and haemolytic anaemia edited by r huber
phosphoglucose isomerase pgi is a multifunctional protein which inside the cell functions as a housekeeping enzyme of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and outside the cell exerts wholly unrelated cytokine properties we have determined the structure of human pgi to a resolution of    using x ray crystallography the structure is highly similar to other pgis especially the architecture of the active site fortuitous binding of a sulphate molecule from the crystallisation solution has facilitated an accurate description of the substrate phosphate binding site comparison with both native and inhibitor bound rabbit pgi structures shows that two loops move closer to the active site upon binding inhibitor interestingly the human structure most closely resembles the inhibitor bound structure suggesting that binding of the phosphate moiety of the substrate may trigger this conformational change we suggest a new mechanism for catalysis that uses glu  as the base catalyst for the isomerase reaction rather than his  as proposed previously the human pgi structure has also provided a detailed framework with which to map mutations associated with non spherocytic haemolytic anaemia
