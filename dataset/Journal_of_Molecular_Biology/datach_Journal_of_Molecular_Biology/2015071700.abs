a direct interaction with rna dramatically enhances the catalytic activity of the hiv  protease in vitro
though the steps of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  virion maturation are well documented the mechanisms regulating the proteolysis of the gag and gag pro pol polyproteins by the hiv  protease pr remain obscure one proposed mechanism argues that the maturation intermediate p nc must interact with rna for efficient cleavage by the pr we investigated this phenomenon and found that processing of multiple substrates by the hiv  pr was enhanced in the presence of rna the acceleration of proteolysis occurred independently from the substrate s ability to interact with nucleic acid indicating that a direct interaction between substrate and rna is not necessary for enhancement gel shift assays demonstrated the hiv  pr is capable of interacting with nucleic acids suggesting that rna accelerates processing reactions by interacting with the pr rather than the substrate all hiv  prs examined have this ability however the hiv  pr does not interact with rna and does not exhibit enhanced catalytic activity in the presence of rna no specific sequence or structure was required in the rna for a productive interaction with the hiv  pr which appears to be principally though not exclusively driven by electrostatic forces for a peptide substrate rna increased the kinetic efficiency of the hiv  pr by an order of magnitude affecting both turnover rate kcat and substrate affinity km  these results suggest that an allosteric binding site exists on the hiv  pr and that hiv  pr activity during maturation could be regulated in part by the juxtaposition of the enzyme with virion packaged rna
