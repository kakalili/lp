mechanistic insights into the role of val  of hiv  reverse transcriptase in misinsertion and mispair extension fidelity of dna synthesis
the side chain of val  stabilizes the fingers subdomain of the human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase rt  while its peptide backbone interacts with the single stranded dna template at nucleotide   and with the peptide backbone of gln   specific dna polymerase activities of mutant rts bearing amino acid substitutions at position   i e  v a v f v i v l v m v s and v t were relatively high primer extension experiments carried out in the absence of one deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate suggested that mutations did not affect the accuracy of the rt except for v a v f v i and to a lesser extent v t the fidelity of rts bearing mutations v f and v i increased   and  fold respectively as measured by the m  lacz  forward mutation assay while v a showed   fold decreased accuracy steady and pre steady state kinetics demonstrated that the increased fidelity of v i and v f was related to their decreased ability to extend mismatched template  primers while misincorporation efficiencies were not significantly affected by mutations the increased mispair extension fidelity of mutant v i rt could be attributed to the nucleotide affinity loss observed in reactions with mismatched template  primers altogether these data suggest that val  interactions with the   template overhang are important determinants of fidelity
