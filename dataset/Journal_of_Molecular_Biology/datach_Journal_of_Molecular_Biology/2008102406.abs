signal discrimination by differential regulation of protein stability in quorum sensing
quorum sensing qs is a communication mechanism exploited by a large variety of bacteria to coordinate gene expression at the population level in gram negative bacteria qs occurs via synthesis and detection of small chemical signals most of which belong to the acyl homoserine lactone class in such a system binding of an acyl homoserine lactone signal to its cognate transcriptional regulator r protein often induces stabilization and subsequent dimerization of the r protein which results in the regulation of downstream gene expression existence of diverse qs systems within and among species of bacteria indicates that each bacterium needs to distinguish among a myriad of structurally similar chemical signals we show using a mathematical model that fast degradation of an r protein monomer can facilitate discrimination of signals that differentially stabilize it furthermore our results suggest an inverse correlation between the stability of an r protein and the achievable limits of fidelity in signal discrimination in particular an unstable r protein tends to be more specific to its cognate signal whereas a stable r protein tends to be more promiscuous these predictions are consistent with experimental data on well studied natural and engineered r proteins and thus have implications for understanding the functional design of qs systems
