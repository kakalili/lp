We present an analysis of the residues directly involved in catalysis in 178 enzyme active sites. Specific criteria were derived to define a catalytic residue, and used to create a catalytic residue dataset, which was then analysed in terms of properties including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, flexibility, conservation, quaternary structure and function. The results indicate the dominance of a small set of amino acid residues in catalysis and give a picture of a general active site environment. It is hoped that this information will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in catalysis and a heuristic basis for predicting catalytic residues in enzymes of unknown function.
