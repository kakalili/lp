structure and specificity of a binary tandem domain f lectin from striped bass morone saxatilis
the plasma of the striped bass morone saxatilis contains a fucose specific lectin msafbp  that consists of two f type carbohydrate recognition domains crds in tandem the crystal structure of the complex of msafbp  with l fucose reported here shows a cylindrical     long and     wide trimer divided into two globular halves one containing n terminal crds n crds and the other containing c terminal crds c crds  the resulting binding surfaces at the opposite ends of the cylindrical trimer have the potential to cross link cell surface or humoral carbohydrate ligands the n crds and c crds of msafbp  exhibit significant structural differences suggesting that they recognize different glycans analysis of the carbohydrate binding sites provides the structural basis for the observed specificity of msafbp  for simple carbohydrates and suggests that the n crd recognizes more complex fucosylated oligosaccharides and with a relatively higher avidity than the c crd modeling of msafbp  complexed with fucosylated glycans that are widely distributed in prokaryotes and eukaryotes rationalizes the observation that binary tandem crd f type lectins function as opsonins by cross linking  non self  carbohydrate ligands and  self  carbohydrate ligands such as sugar structures displayed by microbial pathogens and glycans on the surface of phagocytic cells from the host
