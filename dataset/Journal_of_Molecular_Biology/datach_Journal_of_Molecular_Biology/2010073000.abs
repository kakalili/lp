molecular modeling on inhibitor complexes and active site dynamics of cytochrome p  c  a target for prostate cancer therapy
a molecular model for the p  enzyme cytochrome p  c  cyp  is presented based on sequence alignments of multiple template structures and homology modeling this enzyme plays a central role in the biosynthesis of testosterone and is emerging as a major target in prostate cancer with the recently developed inhibitor abiraterone currently in advanced clinical trials the model is described in detail together with its validation by providing structural explanations to available site directed mutagenesis data the cyp  molecule in this model is in the form of a triangular prism with an edge of      and a thickness of      it is predominantly helical comprising    helices interspersed by six   helices and    sheets multinanosecond molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent have been carried out and principal components analysis has been used to reveal the details of dynamics around the active site coarse grained methods have also been used to verify low frequency motions which have been correlated with active site gating the work also describes the results of docking synthetic inhibitors including the drug abiraterone and the natural substrate pregnenolone in the cyp  active site together with molecular dynamics simulations on the complexes
