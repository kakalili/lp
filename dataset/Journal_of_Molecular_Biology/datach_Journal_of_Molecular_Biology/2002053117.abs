crystal structure of the autocatalytic initiator of glycogen biosynthesis glycogenin
glycogen is an important storage reserve of glucose present in many organisms from bacteria to humans its biosynthesis is initiated by a specialized protein glycogenin which has the unusual property of transferring glucose from udp  glucose to form an oligosaccharide covalently attached to itself at tyr   glycogen synthase and the branching enzyme complete the synthesis of the polysaccharide the structure of glycogenin was solved in two different crystal forms tetragonal crystals contained a pentamer of dimers in the asymmetric unit arranged in an improper non crystallographic  fold relationship and orthorhombic crystals contained a monomer in the asymmetric unit that is arranged about a  fold crystallographic axis to form a dimer the structure was first solved to    using the tetragonal crystal form and a three wavelength se  met multi wavelength anomalous diffraction mad experiment subsequently an apo enzyme structure and a complex between glycogenin and udp  glucose mn  were solved by molecular replacement to    using the orthorhombic crystal form glycogenin contains a conserved d d motif and an n terminal     rossmann like fold that are common to the nucleotide binding domains of most glycosyltransferases although sequence identity amongst glycosyltransferases is minimal the overall folds are similar in all of these enzymes the d d motif is essential for coordination of the catalytic divalent cation most commonly mn  we propose a mechanism in which the mn  that associates with the udp  glucose molecule functions as a lewis acid to stabilize the leaving group udp and to facilitate the transfer of the glucose moiety to an intermediate nucleophilic acceptor in the enzyme active site most likely asp   following transient transfer to asp   the glucose moiety is then delivered to the final acceptor either directly to tyr  or to glucose residues already attached to tyr   the positioning of the bound udp  glucose far from tyr  in the glycogenin structure raises questions as to the mechanism for the attachment of the first glucose residues possibly the initial glucosylation is via inter dimeric catalysis with an intra molecular mechanism employed later in oligosaccharide synthesis
