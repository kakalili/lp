olfactory marker protein omp exhibits a  clam fold in solution implications for target peptide interaction and olfactory signal transduction
olfactory marker protein omp is a ubiquitous cytoplasmic protein found in mature olfactory receptor neurons of all vertebrates electrophysiological and behavioral studies demonstrate that it is a modulator of the olfactory signal transduction pathway here we demonstrate that the solution structure of omp as determined by nmr studies is a single globular domain protein comprised of eight  strands forming two  sheets oriented orthogonally to one another thus exhibiting a    clam  or    sandwich  fold   sheet  is comprised of            and  sheet  contains            insertions include two long  helices located on opposite sides of the  clam and three flexible loops the juxtaposition of  strands                        forms a continuously curved surface and encloses one side of the  clam the  cleft  formed by the two  sheets is opposite to the closed end of the  clam using a peptide titration series we have identified this cleft as the binding surface for a peptide derived from the bex protein the highly conserved  loop structure adjacent to the bex peptide binding surface found in omp may be the site of additional omp  protein interactions related to its role in modulating olfactory signal transduction thus the interaction between the omp and bex proteins could facilitate the interaction between omp and other components of the olfactory signaling pathway
