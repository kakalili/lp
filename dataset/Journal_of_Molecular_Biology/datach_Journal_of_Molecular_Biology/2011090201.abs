enzyme inhibition by allosteric capture of an inactive conformation
all members of the human herpesvirus protease hhv pr family are active as weakly associating dimers but inactive as monomers a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus protease kshv pr traps the enzyme in an inactive monomeric state where the c terminal helices are unfolded and the hydrophobic dimer interface is exposed nmr titration studies demonstrate that the inhibitor binds to kshv pr monomers with low micromolar affinity a    resolution x ray crystal structure of a c terminal truncated kshv pr  inhibitor complex locates the binding pocket at the dimer interface and displays significant conformational perturbations at the active site     from the allosteric site nmr and cd data suggest that the small molecule inhibits human cytomegalovirus protease via a similar mechanism as all hhv prs are functionally and structurally homologous the inhibitor represents a class of compounds that may be developed into broad spectrum therapeutics that allosterically regulate enzymatic activity by disrupting protein  protein interactions
