solution structure and dynamics of an open  sheet glycolytic enzyme monomeric   kda phosphoglycerate mutase from schizosaccharomyces pombe edited by m f summers
the structure and backbone dynamics of a double labelled  n  c monomeric    kd phosphoglycerate mutase pgam from schizosaccharomyces pombe have been investigated in solution using nmr spectroscopy a set of   noe derived distance restraints   restraints representing inferred hydrogen bonds and   values of jhnh  were used in the structure calculation the mean rmsd from the average structure for all backbone atoms from residues     in the best  calculated structures was     the core of the enzyme includes an open twisted six stranded  sheet flanked by four  helices and a short   helix an additional smaller domain contains two short antiparallel  strands and a further pair of  helices the c  atoms of the s pombe pgam may be superimposed on their equivalents in one of the four identical subunits of saccharomyces cerevisiae pgam with an rmsd of         if only the  sheet is considered  small differences between the two structures are attributable partly to the deletion in the s pombe sequence of a  residue loop involved in stabilising the s cerevisciae tetramer analysis of  n relaxation parameters indicates that pgam tumbles isotropically with a rotational correlation time of   ns and displays a range of dynamic features of   residues analysed only  could be fitted without invoking terms for fast internal motion or chemical exchange and out of the remainder   required a chemical exchange term significantly   of the slowly exchanging milli to microsecond residues lie in helices and these account for two thirds of all analysed helix residues on the contrary only one  sheet residue required an exchange term in contrast to other analyses of backbone dynamics reported previously residues in slow exchange appeared to correlate with architectural features of the enzyme rather than congregating close to ligand binding sites
