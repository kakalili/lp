The E. coli NusA transcription elongation protein (NusAEc), identified because of its requirement for transcription antitermination by the N protein, has an Arg-rich S1 RNA-binding domain. A complex of N and NusA with other host factors binding at NUT sites in the RNA renders RNA polymerase termination-resistant. An E. coli haploid for nusA944, having nine different codons replacing four normally found in the Arg-rich region, is defective in support of N action. Another variant, haploid for the nusAR199A allele, with a change in a highly conserved Arg codon in the S1 domain, effectively supports N-mediated antitermination. However, nusAR199A is recessive to nusA944, while nusAEc is dominant to nusA944 for support of N-mediated antitermination, suggesting a competition between NusA944 and NusAR199A during complex formation. Complex formation with the variant NusA proteins was assessed by mobility gel shifts. NusAR199A, unlike NusAEc and NusA944, fails to form a complex with N and NUT RNA. However, while NusAR199A, like wild-type NusA, forms an enlarged complex with NUT RNA, N, RNA polymerase, and other host proteins required for efficient N-mediated antitermination, NusA944 does not form this enlarged complex. Consistent with the in vivo results, NusA944 prevents NusAR199A but not NusAEc from forming the enlarged complex. The simplest conclusion from these dominance studies is that in the formation of the complete active antitermination complex in vivo, NusA and N binding to the newly synthesized NUT RNA precedes addition of the other factors. Alternative less effective routes to the active complex that allows bypass of this preferred pathway may also exist.
