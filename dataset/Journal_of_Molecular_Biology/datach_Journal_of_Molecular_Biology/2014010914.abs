the extracellular protein vlse is destabilized inside cells
we use u os cells as in vivo  test tubes  to study how the same cytoplasmic environment has opposite effects on the stability of two different proteins protein folding stability and kinetics were compared by fast relaxation imaging which combines a temperature jump with fluorescence microscopy of fret f rster resonance energy transfer labeled proteins while the stability of the cytoplasmic enzyme pgk phosphoglycerate kinase increases in cells the stability of the cell surface antigen vlse which presumably did not evolve for stability inside cells decreases vlse folding also slows down more than pgk folding in cells relative to their respective aqueous buffer kinetics our fret measurements provide evidence that vlse is more compact inside cells than in aqueous buffer two kinetically distinct protein populations exist inside cells making a connection with previous in vitro crowding studies in addition we confirm previous studies showing that vlse is stabilized by  mg ml of the carbohydrate crowder ficoll even though it is destabilized in the cytoplasm relative to aqueous buffer we propose two mechanisms for the observed destabilization of vlse in u os cells long range interactions competing with crowding or shape dependent crowding favoring more compact states inside the cell over the elongated aqueous buffer native state
