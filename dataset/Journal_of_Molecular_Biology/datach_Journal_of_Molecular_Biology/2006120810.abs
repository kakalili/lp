cognate ligand domain mapping for enzymes
here we present an automatic assignment of potential cognate ligands to domains of enzymes in the cath and scop protein domain classifications on the basis of structural data available in the wwpdb this procedure involves two steps firstly we assign the binding of particular ligands to particular domains secondly we compare the chemical similarity of the pdb ligands to ligands in kegg in order to assign cognate ligands we find that use of the enzyme commission ec numbers is necessary to enable efficient and accurate cognate ligand assignment the procognate database currently has cognate ligand mapping for       protein structures and      superfamilies as described by the cath and scop databases respectively we find that just under half of all ligands are only and always bound by a single domain with   bound by more than one domain and the remainder of the ligands showing a variety of binding modes this finding has implications for domain recombination and the evolution of new protein functions domain architecture or context is also found to affect substrate specificity of particular domains and we discuss example cases the most popular pdb ligands are all found to be generic components of crystallisation buffers highlighting the non cognate ligand problem inherent in the pdb in contrast the most popular cognate ligands are all found to be universal cellular currencies of reducing power and energy such as nadh fadh and atp respectively reflecting the fact that the vast majority of enzymatic reactions utilise one of these popular co factors these ligands all share a common adenine ribonucleotide moiety suggesting that many different domain superfamilies have converged to bind this chemical framework
