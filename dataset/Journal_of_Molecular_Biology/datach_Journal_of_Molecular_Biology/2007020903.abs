the structure of the alzheimer amyloid     peptide probed through replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent
the conformational states sampled by the alzheimer amyloid       a     peptide were probed using replica exchange molecular dynamics remd simulations in explicit solvent the a     peptide is a fragment of the full length a     peptide that possesses many of the amyloidogenic properties of its full length counterpart under physiological temperature and pressure our simulations reveal that the a     peptide does not possess a single unique folded state rather this peptide exists as a mixture of collapsed globular states that remain in rapid dynamic equilibrium with each other this conformational ensemble is dominated by random coil and bend structures with insignificant presence of an  helical or  sheet structure the d structure of a     is seen to be defined by a salt bridge formed between the side chains of k  and d  this salt bridge is also observed in a  fibrils and our simulations suggest that monomeric conformations of a     contain pre folded structural motifs that promote rapid aggregation of this peptide
