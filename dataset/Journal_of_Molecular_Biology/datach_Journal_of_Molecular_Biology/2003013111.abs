purification characterization and gene expression of all sigma factors of rna polymerase in a cyanobacterium
the expression of rna polymerase rnap sigma factor genes and proteins was characterized as a first step toward understanding their functions in a unicellular cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc    which can perform photosynthesis all nine sigma factors group  siga group  sigb to sige and group  sigf to sigi and each rnap core subunit rpoa rpob rpoc and rpoc  were overproduced and purified from escherichia coli cells then polyclonal antibodies were prepared western blot and primer extension analyses revealed that the intracellular levels of group  and  sigma factors ranged from  fmol to  fmol per microgram of the total protein under conditions of steady state growth and that growth phase dependent or constitutive transcripts were observed interestingly no group  sigma factor proteins were detected under normal physiological conditions whereas their transcripts were robust implying a possible regulation of translational attenuation and or protein instability phylogenetic analysis also revealed that group  sigma factor homologues of cyanobacteria are conserved with evolutionary or functionary divergence among them in vitro and in vivo results indicated significant evidence of high light responsive sigd expression and its promoter recognition of the photosynthesis gene psba on the other hand autoregulated sigb transcription a dramatically increased sigb expression upon the exposure of cells to heat shock and specific promoter recognition by sigb with redundancy of other sigma factors on the heat shock hspa promoter were observed these findings clearly indicated that sigb is a heat shock responsive sigma factor the unique promoter architecture and expression of the relevant sigma factor gene are also discussed herein
