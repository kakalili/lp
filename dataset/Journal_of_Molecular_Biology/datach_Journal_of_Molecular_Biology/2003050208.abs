exhaustive enumeration of protein domain families
domains are considered as the basic units of protein folding evolution and function decomposing each protein into modular domains is thus a basic prerequisite for accurate functional classification of biological molecules here we present adda an automatic algorithm for domain decomposition and clustering of all protein domain families we use alignments derived from an all on all sequence comparison to define domains within protein sequences based on a global maximum likelihood model in all   of domain boundaries are predicted within   of domain size when compared with the manual domain definitions given in the scop database a representative database of     protein sequences were decomposed into     domains these domains were clustered on the basis of sequence similarities into    domain families containing at least two members with less than   sequence identity validation against family definitions in the manually curated databases scop and pfam indicates almost perfect unification of various large domain families while contamination by unrelated sequences remains at a low level the global survey of protein domain space by adda confirms that most large and universal domain families are already described in pfam and or smart however a survey of the complete set of mobile modules leads to the identification of   new interesting domain families which shuffle around in multi domain proteins the data are publicly available at ftp  ftp ebi ac uk pub contrib heger adda
