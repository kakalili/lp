rapid collapse precedes the fast two state folding of the cold shock protein
the cold shock protein bc csp folds very rapidly in a reaction that is well described by a kinetic two state mechanism without intermediates we measured the shortening of six intra protein distances during folding by f rster resonance energy transfer fret in combination with stopped flow experiments single tryptophan residues were engineered into the protein as the donors and single   acetylamino ethyl amino naphthalene  sulfonate aedans residues were placed as the acceptors at solvent exposed sites of bc csp their r value of about   was well suited for following distance changes during the folding of this protein with a high sensitivity the mutagenesis and the labeling did not alter the refolding kinetics the changes in energy transfer during folding were monitored by both donor and acceptor emission and reciprocal effects were found in two cases the donor  acceptor distances were similar in the unfolded and the folded state and as a consequence the kinetic changes in energy transfer upon folding were very small for four donor acceptor pairs we found that    of the increase in energy transfer upon folding occurred prior to the rate limiting step of folding this reveals that about half of the shortening of the intra molecular distances upon folding has occurred already before the rate limiting step and suggests that the fast two state folding reaction of bc csp is preceded by a very rapid collapse
