structure and function of amtr in mycobacterium smegmatis implications for post transcriptional regulation of urea metabolism through a small antisense rna
soil dwelling bacteria of the phylum actinomycetes generally harbor either glnr or amtr as a global regulator of nitrogen metabolism mycobacterium smegmatis harbors both of these canonical regulators glnr regulates the expression of key genes involved in nitrogen metabolism while the function and signal transduction pathway of amtr in m smegmatis remains largely unknown here we report the structure and function of the m smegmatis amtr and describe the role of amtr in the regulation of nitrogen metabolism in response to nitrogen availability to determine the function of amtr in m smegmatis we performed genome wide expression profiling comparing the wild type versus an  amtr mutant and identified significant changes in the expression of  genes including an operon involved in urea degradation an amtr consensus binding motif ctgtc n gacag was identified in the promoter region of this operon and ligand independent high affinity amtr binding was validated by both electrophoretic mobility shift assays and surface plasmon resonance measurements we confirmed the transcription of a cis encoded small rna complementary to the gene encoding amtr under nitrogen excess and we propose a post transcriptional regulatory mechanism for amtr the three dimensional x ray structure of amtr at    revealed an overall tetr like dimeric structure and the alignment of the m smegmatis amtr and corynebacterium glutamicum amtr regulatory domains showed poor structural conservation providing a potential explanation for the lack of m smegmatis amtr interaction with the adenylylated pii protein taken together our data suggest an amtr repressor glnr activator competitive binding mechanism for transcriptional regulation of urea metabolism that is controlled by a cis encoded small antisense rna
