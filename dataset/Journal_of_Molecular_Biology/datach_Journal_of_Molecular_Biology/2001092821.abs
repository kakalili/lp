sequencing and two dimensional structure prediction of a phospholipase a inhibitor from the serum of the common tiger snake notechis scutatus  edited by r huber
a phospholipase a inhibitor has been identified in the serum of the common tiger snake notechis scutatus  the inhibitor is composed of two chains an  chain and a  chain that form a non covalently associated complex capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of all phospholipase a enzymes it was tested against the  and  chains have been purified to homogeneity digested and sequenced from the peptide sequence generated degenerate pcr primers were designed and used to elucidate the complete cdna sequence of the chains using   and   race pcr a total of three  chain isoforms were identified only one isoform of the  chain was detected the two dimensional structure of the three  chains and one  chain were predicted using five prediction programs discrimination of secondary structure class nearest neighbour secondary structure profile network from heidelberg self optimised prediction method from multiple alignment sspal  for each protein chain a consensus prediction was generated results are discussed in relation to the function of the protein and how they may influence the three dimensional structure of the inhibitor additionally the sequences of several snake phospholipase a inhibitors were used as the input for a motif prediction algorithm meme  the results are discussed in relation to the activity of these proteins
