apo and holo structures of an nadp h dependent cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase from saccharomyces cerevisiae
the crystal structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae scadh p has been solved using the anomalous signal from the two zinc atoms found per subunit and it constitutes the first structure determined from a member of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase family scadh p subunits exhibit the general fold of the medium chain dehydrogenases reductases mdr but with distinct specific characteristics in the three crystal structures solved two trigonal and one monoclinic  scadh p molecules appear to be structural heterodimers composed of one subunit in the apo and the second subunit in the holo conformation between the two conformations the relative disposition of domains remains unchanged while two loops cys  asn  and ile  lys   experience large movements the apo apo structure is disfavoured because of steric impairment involving the loop ile  lys   while in the holo holo conformation some of the hydrogen bonds between subunits would break apart these suggest that the first nadp h molecule would bind to the enzyme much more tightly than the second in addition fluorimetric analysis of nadph binding demonstrates that only one cofactor molecule binds per dimer therefore scadh p appears to function according to a half of the sites reactivity mechanism resulting from a pre existing prior to cofactor binding tendency for the structural asymmetry in the dimer the specificity of scadh p towards nadp h is mainly due to the tripod like interactions of the terminal phosphate group with ser   arg  and lys   the size and the shape of the substrate binding pocket correlate well with the substrate specificity of scadh p towards cinnamaldehyde and other aromatic compounds the structural relationships of scadh p with other mdr structures are analysed
