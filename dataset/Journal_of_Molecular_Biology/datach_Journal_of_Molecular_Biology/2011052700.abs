the architecture and conservation pattern of whole cell control circuitry
the control circuitry that directs and paces caulobacter cell cycle progression involves the entire cell operating as an integrated system this control circuitry monitors the environment and the internal state of the cell including the cell topology as it orchestrates orderly activation of cell cycle subsystems and caulobacter s asymmetric cell division the proteins of the caulobacter cell cycle control system and its internal organization are co conserved across many alphaproteobacteria species but there are great differences in the regulatory apparatus functionality and peripheral connectivity to other cellular subsystems from species to species this pattern is similar to that observed for the  kernels  of the regulatory networks that regulate development of metazoan body plans the caulobacter cell cycle control system has been exquisitely optimized as a total system for robust operation in the face of internal stochastic noise and environmental uncertainty when sufficient details accumulate as for caulobacter cell cycle regulation the system design has been found to be eminently rational and indeed consistent with good design practices for human designed asynchronous control systems
