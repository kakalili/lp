To address the structure–function relationship of discrete regions within the gp41 ectodomain, 70-residue peptide constructs corresponding to the N-terminal subdomain of the HIV-1 gp41 ectodomain were examined in a membrane-associated context. These fragments encompass both fusion peptide (FP) and N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) regions, and model the N-terminal half of the pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI), which is believed to be the target of the potent entry inhibitor DP-178, recently approved by the FDA. Using mutants, we attempted to map the structural organization of the N-terminal subdomain. Our results suggest that the N-terminal subdomain contains two discrete structural regions: the FP adopts a β-sheet conformation and the NHR is α-helical. This structural make-up is essential for fusogenic function, since loss of function mutants exhibit both a significant reduction in region-specific secondary structure as well as significant impairment in lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles. Our results, delineating membrane-associated structure of the FP region differ from previous ones by inclusion of the autonomous oligomerization domain (NHR), which likely contributes to stabilization of the FP structure. Correspondingly, the α-helical structure for the NHR, in context of the FP, correlates with structural predictions for this region in both the hairpin and PHI conformations during fusion. Based on our results, we postulate how oligomerization of regions in this sub-domain is essential for fusion pore formation.
