slipped ctg  cag repeats of the myotonic dystrophy locus surface probing with anti dna antibodies
at least  human diseases have been associated with the length dependent expansion of gene specific ctg  cag repeats including myotonic dystrophy dm  and spinocerebellar ataxia type  sca  repeat expansion is likely to involve unusual dna structures we have structurally characterized such dna with ctg n  cag n repeats of varying length n      by high resolution gel electrophoresis and have probed their surfaces with anti dna antibodies of known specificities we prepared homoduplex s dnas which are ctg x  cag y where x y and heteroduplex si dnas which are hybrids where x gt y or x lt y s dnas formed many different species of slipped isomers as indicated by its multiple electrophoretic species in contrast si dnas formed distinct structures as indicated by the limited electrophoretic species for all possible repeat length pairings sister si dnas with an excess of cag repeats always migrated slower than their sister si dnas with an excess of ctg repeats strikingly both the propensity to form slipped structures and the pattern of s dnas but not si dnas varied for similar lengths of ctg cag repeats between the dm and sca loci highlighting a role for flanking cis elements in s dna but not si dna formation slipped structures bound structure and nucleotide specific anti dna antibodies binding of anti b dna antibodies was reduced for both s dnas and si dnas relative to their linear forms si dnas bound anti z dna antibodies while both s and si dnas bound anti cruciform antibodies revealing shared characteristics between the corresponding dna structures and slipped dnas such features of the repeats may be recognized by cellular proteins known to bind such structures
