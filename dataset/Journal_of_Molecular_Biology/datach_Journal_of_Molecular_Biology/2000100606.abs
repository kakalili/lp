catalysis of decarboxylation by a preorganized heterogeneous microenvironment crystal structures of abzyme  d  edited by d rees
antibody  d catalyzes the solvent sensitive decarboxylation of  carboxybenzisoxazoles the crystal structure of chimeric fab  d with and without hapten at     and     respectively together with computational analysis shows how a melange of polar and non polar sites are exploited to achieve both substrate binding and acceleration of a reaction normally facilitated by purely aprotic dipolar media the striking similarity of the decarboxylase and a series of unrelated esterase antibodies also highlights the chemical versatility of structurally conserved anion binding sites and the relatively subtle changes involved in fine tuning the immunoglobulin pocket for recognition of different ligands and catalysis of different reactions
