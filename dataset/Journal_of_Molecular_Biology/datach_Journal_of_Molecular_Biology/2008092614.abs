differential unfolding of   and   chains in type i collagen and collagenolysis
collagenolysis plays a central role in many disease processes and a detailed understanding of the mechanism of collagen degradation is of immense interest while a considerable body of information about collagenolysis exists the details of the underlying molecular mechanism are unclear therefore to further our understanding of the precise mechanism of collagen degradation we used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the structure of human type i collagen in the vicinity of the collagenase cleavage site since post translational proline hydroxylation is an important step in the synthesis of collagen chains we used the dna sequence for the   and   chains of human type i collagen and the known amino acid sequences for bovine and chicken type i collagen to infer which prolines are hydroxylated in the vicinity of the collagenase cleavage site simulations of type i collagen in this region suggest that partial unfolding of the   chain is energetically preferred relative to unfolding of   chains localized unfolding of the   chain leads to the formation of a structure that has disrupted hydrogen bonds n terminal to the collagenase cleavage site our data suggest that this disruption in hydrogen bonding pattern leads to increased chain flexibility thereby enabling the   chain to sample different partially unfolded states surprisingly our data also imply that   chain unfolding is mediated by the non hydroxylation of a proline residue that is n terminal to the cleavage site in   chains these results suggest that hydroxylation on one chain    can affect the structure of another chain    and point to a critical role for the non hydroxylation of proline residues near the collagenase cleavage site
