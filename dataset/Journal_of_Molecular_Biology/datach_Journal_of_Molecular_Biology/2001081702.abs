microsecond exchange of internal water molecules in bacteriorhodopsin edited by p e wright
the proton conducting pathway of bacteriorhodopsin br contains at least nine internal water molecules that are thought to be key players in the proton translocation mechanism here we report the results of a multinuclear  h  h  o magnetic relaxation dispersion mrd study with the primary goal of determining the rate of exchange of these internal water molecules with bulk water this rate is of interest in current attempts to elucidate the molecular details of the proton translocation mechanism the relevance of water exchange kinetics is underscored by recent crystallographic findings of substantial variations in the number and locations of internal water molecules during the photocycle moreover internal water exchange is believed to be governed by conformational fluctuations in the protein and can therefore provide information about the thermal accessibility of functionally important conformational substates the present h and  o mrd data show that at least seven water molecules or more if they are orientationally disordered in br have residence times inverse exchange rate constant in the range      s at   k at least five of these water molecules have residence times in the more restrictive range       s these results show that most or all of the deeply buried water molecules in br exchange on a time scale that is short compared to the rate limiting step in the photocycle the mrd measurements were performed on br solubilized in micelles of octyl glucoside from the mrd data the rotational correlation time of detergent solubilized br was determined to  ns at   k consistent with a monomeric protein in complex with about   detergent molecules the solubilized protein was found to be stable in the dark for at least eight months at   k
