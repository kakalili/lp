the structure of rseb a sensor in periplasmic stress response of e coli
an elegant network of signal transduction has evolved in the bacterial cell envelope to respond to environmental stress it is initiated by sensing unfavourable and harmful changes in the periplasm the stress signal is then transmitted by a controlled degradation of the transmembrane anti  factor rsea that leads to the activation of the alternative sigma factor  e the periplasmic protein rseb exerts a crucial role in modulating the stability of rsea rseb from escherichia coli has been crystallized and crystal structures were determined at     and at     resolution the protein forms a homodimer with the monomer composed of two domains the large domain resembles an unclosed  barrel that is structurally remarkably similar to a protein family capable of binding the lipid anchor of lipoproteins the small c terminal domain connected to the large domain by a partially unstructured loop is responsible for interaction with rsea on the basis of the structure of rseb we suggest that it acts as a sensor of periplasmic stress with a dual functionality it detects mislocalized lipoproteins and propagates the signal to induce the  e response
