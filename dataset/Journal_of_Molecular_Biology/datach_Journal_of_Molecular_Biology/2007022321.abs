cryptochrome  from arabidopsis thaliana structural and functional analysis of its complex with a folate light antenna
cryptochromes are almost ubiquitous blue light receptors and act in several species as central components of the circadian clock despite being evolutionary and structurally related with dna photolyases a class of light driven dna repair enzymes and having similar cofactor compositions cryptochromes lack dna repair activity cryptochrome  from the plant arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the dash type subfamily its crystal structure determined at     resolution shows cryptochrome  in a dimeric state with the antenna cofactor   methenyltetrahydrofolate mthf bound in a distance of     to the u shaped fad chromophore spectroscopic studies on a mutant where a residue crucial for mthf binding e   was replaced by site directed mutagenesis demonstrate that mthf acts in cryptochrome  as a functional antenna for the photoreduction of fad
