structure and evolution of n domains in aaa metalloproteases
metalloproteases of the aaa atpases associated with various cellular activities family play a crucial role in protein quality control within the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and the inner membrane of eukaryotic organelles these membrane anchored hexameric enzymes are composed of an n terminal domain with one or two transmembrane helices a central aaa atpase module and a c terminal zn  dependent protease while the latter two domains have been well studied so far little is known about the n terminal regions here in an extensive bioinformatic and structural analysis we identified three major non homologous groups of n domains in aaa metalloproteases by far the largest one is the ftsh like group of bacteria and eukaryotic organelles the other two groups are specific to yme  one found in plants fungi and basal metazoans and the other one found exclusively in animals using nmr and crystallography we determined the subunit structure and hexameric assembly of escherichia coli ftsh n exhibiting an unusual    fold and the conserved part of fungal yme n from saccharomyces cerevisiae revealing a tetratricopeptide repeat fold our bioinformatic analysis showed that uniquely among these proteins the n domain of yme from the cnidarian hydra vulgaris contains both the tetratricopeptide repeat region seen in basal metazoans and a region of homology to the n domains of animals thus it is a modern day representative of an intermediate in the evolution of animal yme from basal eukaryotic precursors
