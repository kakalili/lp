α-Conotoxins are small disulfide-constrained peptides from cone snails that act as antagonists at specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The 13-residue peptide α-conotoxin RgIA (α-RgIA) is a member of the α-4,3 family of α-conotoxins and selectively blocks the α9α10 nAChR subtype, in contrast to another well-characterized member of this family, α-conotoxin ImI (α-ImI), which is a potent inhibitor of the α7 and α3β2 nAChR subtypes. In this study, we have altered side chains in both the four-residue and the three-residue loops of α-RgIA, and have modified its C-terminus. The effects of these changes on activity against α9α10 and α7 nAChRs were measured; the solution structures of α-RgIA and its Y10W, D5E, and P6V analogues were determined from NMR data; and resonance assignments were made for α-RgIA [R9A]. The structures for α-RgIA and its three analogues were well defined, except at the chain termini. Comparison of these structures with reported structures of α-ImI reveals a common two-loop backbone architecture within the α-4,3 family, but with variations in side-chain solvent accessibility and orientation. Asp5, Pro6, and Arg7 in loop 1 are critical for blockade of both the α9α10 and the α7 subtypes. In loop 2, α-RgIA [Y10W] had activity near that of wild-type α-RgIA, with high potency for α9α10 and low potency for α7, and had a structure similar to that of wild type. By contrast, Arg9 in loop 2 is critical for specific binding to the α9α10 subtype, probably because it is larger and more solvent accessible than Ala9 in α-ImI. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis for antagonism of the α9α10 nAChR subtype, which is a target for the development of analgesics for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain.
