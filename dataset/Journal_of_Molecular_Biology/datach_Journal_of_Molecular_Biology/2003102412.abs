mechanism of c toxin inhibition by fluphenazine and related compounds investigation of their binding kinetics to the c ii channel using the current noise analysis
the binding component c ii of the binary actin adp ribosylating c toxin from clostridium botulinum is essential for intoxication of target cells activation by a protease leads to channel formation and this is presumably required for the transport of the toxic c i component into cells the c ii channel is cation selective and contains a binding site for fluphenazine and structurally related compounds ion transport through c ii and in vivo intoxication is blocked when the sites are occupied by the ligands c ii was reconstituted into artificial lipid bilayer membranes and formed ion permeable channels the binding constant of chloroquine primaquine quinacrine chloropromazine and fluphenazine to the c ii channel was determined using titration experiments which resulted in its block the ligand induced current noise of the c ii channels was investigated using fast fourier transformation the noise of the open channels had a rather small spectral density which was a function of the inverse frequency up to about   hz upon addition of ligands to the aqueous phase the current through c ii decreased in a dose dependent manner simultaneously the spectral density of the current noise increased drastically and its frequency dependence was of lorentzian type which was caused by the on and off reactions of the ligand mediated channel block the ligand induced current noise of c ii was used for the evaluation of the binding kinetics for different ligands to the channel the on rate constant of ligand binding was between   and  m  s   and was dependent on the ionic strength of the aqueous phase the off rate varied between about  s   and   s   and depended on the structure of the ligand the role of structural requirements for the effective block of c ii by the different ligands is discussed
