crystal structure of an adp dependent glucokinase from pyrococcus furiosus implications for a sugar induced conformational change in adp dependent kinase
adp dependent kinases are used in the modified embden  meyerhoff pathway of certain archaea our previous study has revealed a mechanism for adp dependent phosphoryl transfer by thermococcus litoralis glucokinase tlgk  and its evolutionary relationship with atp dependent ribokinases and adenosine kinases pfkb carbohydrate kinase family members  here we report the crystal structure of glucokinase from pyrococcus furiosus pfgk in a closed conformation complexed with glucose and amp at    resolution in comparison with the tlgk structure the pfgk structure shows significant conformational changes in the small domain and a region around the hinge suggesting glucose induced domain closing a part of the large domain next to the hinge is also shifted accompanied with domain closing in the pfgk structure glucose binds in a groove between the large and small domains and the electron density of o atoms for both the  and  anomer configurations was observed the structural details of the sugar binding site of adp dependent glucokinase were firstly clarified and then site directed mutagenesis analysis clarified the catalytic residues for adp dependent kinase such as arg  and asp  of tlgk homology search and multiple alignment of amino acid sequences using the information obtained from the structures reveals that eucaryotic hypothetical proteins homologous to adp dependent kinases retain the residues for the recognition of a glucose substrate
