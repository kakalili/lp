structural and calorimetric studies demonstrate that xeroderma pigmentosum type g xpg can be imported to the nucleus by a classical nuclear import pathway via a monopartite nls sequence
xeroderma pigmentosum type g xpg proteins are involved in dna lesion recognition and promotion of nucleotide excision repair specific mutations in these proteins may lead to cockayne syndrome in which the patients may display severe developmental retardation and neurological abnormalities no structural information is available for their spacer region or the c terminal domain which are important respectively for specific nucleotide excision repair activity and substrate specificity as well as nuclear translocation immunofluorescence studies suggested two specific regions of the xpg c terminus as potential bipartite nuclear localization sequences which would be responsible for its translocation to the nucleus by the classical nuclear import pathway mediated by the importin    imp   thus in order to test these hypotheses and gain insight into the structural basis for the nuclear import process for the xpg protein we solved the crystal structures of complexes formed by the imp  and peptides corresponding to both putative nuclear localization signal nls sequences xpg and xpg  and performed isothermal titration calorimetry assays to determine their binding affinities structural experiments confirm the binding of both nls peptides to imp  but unexpectedly they bind to the receptor as monopartite nlss the isothermal titration calorimetry assays demonstrated that xpg and xpg peptides bind to two separate binding sites but with high affinity to the major nls binding site of the imp  resembling classical monopartite sv  tag nls the results lead to insights about what distinguishes monopartite and bipartite nlss as well as the differential roles of xpg and xpg nlss in the nuclear localization of xpg
