Prefoldin (PFD) is a hexameric chaperone that captures a protein substrate and transfers it to a group II chaperonin (CPN) to complete protein folding. We have studied the interaction between PFD and CPN using those from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus strain KS-1 (T. KS-1). In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the T. KS-1 PFDβ2 subunit and characterized the interactions between T. KS-1 CPNs (CPNα and CPNβ) and T. KS-1 PFDs (PFDα1–β1 and PFDα2–β2). As predicted from its amino acid sequence, the PFDβ2 subunit conforms to a structure similar to those of the PFDβ1 subunit and the Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 PFDβ subunit, with the exception of the tip of its coiled-coil domain, which is thought to be the CPN interaction site. The interactions between T. KS-1 CPNs and PFDs (CPNα and PFDα1–β1; CPNα and PFDα2–β2; CPNβ and PFDα1–β1; and CPNβ and PFDα2–β2) were analyzed using the Biacore T100 system at various temperatures ranging from 20 to 45 ºC. The affinities between PFDs and CPNs increased with an increase in temperature. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from association constants showed that the interaction between PFD and CPN is entropy driven. Among the four combinations of PFD–CPN interactions, the entropy difference in binding between CPNβ and PFDα2–β2 was the largest, and affinity significantly increased at higher temperatures. Considering that expression of PFDα2–β2 and CPNβ subunit is induced upon heat shock, our results suggest that PFDα1–β1 is a general PFD for T. KS-1 CPNs, whereas PFDα2–β2 is specific for CPNβ.
