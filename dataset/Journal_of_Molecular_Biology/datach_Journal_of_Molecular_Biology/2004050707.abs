interaction of the trp rna binding attenuation protein trap with anti trap
the trp rna binding attenuation protein trap negatively regulates expression of the tryptophan biosynthesis genes of bacillus subtilis in the presence of tryptophan trap is activated to bind to the   leader region of the trp mrna resulting in termination prior to the structural genes in addition accumulation of uncharged trnatrp induces synthesis of anti trap at  which binds to trap and inhibits its function both of these proteins consist of oligomers of identical subunits here we characterize the self association of each of these proteins and the trap  at interaction in free solution using equilibrium and velocity analytical ultracentrifugation trap exists as a stable  mer in the absence and in the presence of tryptophan tryptophan binding induces a conformational change in trap at exists in a reversible equilibrium between trimer and dodecamer with an equilibrium constant of      m   about   of the trimer is incompetent to form dodecamer the at equilibrium is slow on the time scale of the velocity experiment formation of trap  at complexes occurs only in the presence of tryptophan a complex containing one trap  mer and one at  mer forms with high affinity at higher ratios of trap at complexes containing two trap  mers and one at  mer are detected a model for the structure of the complex is proposed
