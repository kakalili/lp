a new algorithm for rna secondary structure design
the function of many rnas depends crucially on their structure therefore the design of rna molecules with specific structural properties has many potential applications e g in the context of investigating the function of biological rnas of creating new ribozymes or of designing artificial rna nanostructures here we present a new algorithm for solving the following rna secondary structure design problem given a secondary structure find an rna sequence if any that is predicted to fold to that structure unlike the pseudoknot free secondary structure prediction problem this problem appears to be hard computationally our new algorithm   rna secondary structure designer rna ssd   is based on stochastic local search a prominent general approach for solving hard combinatorial problems a thorough empirical evaluation on computationally predicted structures of biological sequences and artificially generated rna structures as well as on empirically modelled structures from the biological literature shows that rna ssd substantially outperforms the best known algorithm for this problem rnainverse from the vienna rna package in particular the new algorithm is able to solve structures consistently for which rnainverse is unable to find solutions the rna ssd software is publically available under the name of rna designer at the rnasoft website www rnasoft ca
