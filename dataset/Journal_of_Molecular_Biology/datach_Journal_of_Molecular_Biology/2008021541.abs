comparative analysis of structural and dynamic properties of the loaded and unloaded hemophore hasa functional implications
a heme acquisition system present in several gram negative bacteria requires the secretion of hemophores these extracellular carrier proteins capture heme and deliver it to specific outer membrane receptors the serratia marcescens hasa hemophore is a monodomain protein that binds heme with a very high affinity its    structure as that of its binding pocket has no common features with other iron or heme binding proteins heme is held by two loops l and l and coordinated to iron by an unusual ligand pair h  y  two independent regions of the hemophore  sheet are involved in hasa  hasr receptor interaction here we report the  d nmr structure of apohasa and the backbone dynamics of both loaded and unloaded hemophore while the overall structure of hasa is very similar in the apo and holo forms the hemophore presents a transition from an open to a closed form upon ligand binding through a large movement of up to     of loop l bearing h  comparison of loaded and unloaded hasa dynamics on different time scales reveals striking flexibility changes in the binding pocket we propose a mechanism by which these structural and dynamic features provide the dual function of heme binding and release to the hasr receptor
