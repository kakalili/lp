molecular dissection of the inhibitor binding pocket of mitotic kinesin eg reveals mutants that confer resistance to antimitotic agents
the mitotic kinesin eg plays an essential role in establishing the bipolar spindle recently several antimitotic inhibitors have been shown to share a common binding region on eg  considering the importance of eg as a potential drug target for cancer chemotherapy it is essential to understand the molecular mechanism by which these agents block eg activity and to determine the  key residues  crucial for inhibition eleven residues in the inhibitor binding pocket were mutated and the effects were monitored by kinetic analysis and mass spectrometry mutants r  a d  a p  a i  a v  a y  a and l  a abolish the inhibitory effect of monastrol results for w  a and r  a are less striking but inhibitor constants are still considerably modified compared to wild type eg  only one residue leu   was found to be essential for inhibition by stlc w  a d  a v  a lead to increased kiapp values but binding of stlc is still tight r  a p  a y  a and r  a convert stlc into a classical rather than a tight binding inhibitor with increased inhibitor constants these results demonstrate that monastrol and stlc interact with different amino acids within the same binding region suggesting that this site is highly flexible to accommodate different types of inhibitors the drug specificity is due to multiple interactions not only with loop l  but also with residues located in helices   and   these results suggest that tumour cells might develop resistance to eg inhibitors by expressing eg point mutants that retain the enzyme activity but prevent inhibition a feature that is observed for certain tubulin inhibitors
