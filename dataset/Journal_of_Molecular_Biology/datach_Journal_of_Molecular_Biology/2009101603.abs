structural comparison of two cspg binding dbl domains from the var csa protein important in malaria during pregnancy
severe malaria during pregnancy is associated with accumulation of parasite infected erythrocytes in the placenta due to interactions between var csa protein expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes and placental chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans cspg  var csa contains multiple cspg binding domains including dbl x and dbl   previous structural studies of dbl x suggested cspg to bind to a positively charged patch and sulfate binding site on the concave surface of the domain here we present the structure of the dbl  domain from var csa this domain displays the same overall architecture and secondary structure as that of dbl x but differs in loop structures disulfide bond positions and surface charge distribution in particular despite binding to cspg dbl  lacks the key features of the cspg binding site of dbl x instead dbl  binds to cspg through a positively charged surface on the distal side of subdomain  that is exposed in intact var csa on the erythrocyte surface finally unlike intact var csa both dbl x and dbl  bind to various carbohydrates with greatest affinity for ligands with high sulfation and negative charge these studies provide further insight into the structure of dbl domains and suggest a model for the role of individual domains in cspg binding by var csa in placental malaria
