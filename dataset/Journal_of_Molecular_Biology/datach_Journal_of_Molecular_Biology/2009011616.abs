essential role of pact mediated pkr activation in tunicamycin induced apoptosis
cellular stresses such as disruption of calcium homeostasis inhibition of protein glycosylation and reduction of disulfide bonds result in accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum er and lead to cell death by apoptosis tunicamycin which is an inhibitor of protein glycosylation induces er stress and apoptosis in this study we examined the involvement of double stranded rna dsrna activated protein kinase pkr and its protein activator pact in tunicamycin induced apoptosis we demonstrate for the first time that pact is phosphorylated in response to tunicamycin and is responsible for pkr activation by direct interaction furthermore pact induced pkr activation is essential for tunicamycin induced apoptosis since pact as well as pkr null cells are markedly resistant to tunicamycin and show defective eif  phosphorylation and c ebp homologous protein chop also known as gadd   induction especially at low concentrations of tunicamycin reconstitution of pkr and pact expression in the null cells renders them sensitive to tunicamycin thus demonstrating that pact induced pkr activation plays an essential function in induction of apoptosis
