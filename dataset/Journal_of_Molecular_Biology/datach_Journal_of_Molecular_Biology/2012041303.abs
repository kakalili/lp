the structures of coiled coil domains from type iii secretion system translocators reveal homology to pore forming toxins
many pathogenic gram negative bacteria utilize type iii secretion systems t sss to alter the normal functions of target cells shigella flexneri uses its t ss to invade human intestinal cells to cause bacillary dysentery shigellosis that is responsible for over one million deaths per year the shigella type iii secretion apparatus is composed of a basal body spanning both bacterial membranes and an exposed oligomeric needle host altering effectors are secreted through this energized unidirectional conduit to promote bacterial invasion the active needle tip complex of s flexneri is composed of a tip protein ipad and two pore forming translocators ipab and ipac while the atomic structure of ipad has been elucidated and studied structural data on the hydrophobic translocators from the t ss family remain elusive we present here the crystal structures of a protease stable fragment identified within the n terminal regions of ipab from s flexneri and sipb from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium determined at     and     limiting resolution respectively these newly identified domains are composed of extended length     in ipab and    in sipb coiled coil motifs that display a high degree of structural homology to one another despite the fact that they share only   sequence identity further structural comparisons also reveal substantial similarity to the coiled coil regions of pore forming proteins from other gram negative pathogens notably colicin ia this suggests that these mechanistically separate and functionally distinct membrane targeting proteins may have diverged from a common ancestor during the course of pathogen specific evolutionary events
