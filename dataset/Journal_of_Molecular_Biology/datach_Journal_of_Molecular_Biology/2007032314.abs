pwwp module of human hepatoma derived growth factor forms a domain swapped dimer with much higher affinity for heparin
hepatoma derived growth factor hhdgf related proteins hrps comprise a new growth factor family sharing a highly conserved and ordered n terminal pwwp module residues     previously referred to as a hath domain and a variable disordered c terminal domain we have shown that the pwwp module is responsible for heparin binding and have solved its structure in solution here we show that under physiological conditions both the pwwp module and hhdgf can form dimers surface plasmon resonance spr studies revealed that the pwwp dimer binds to heparin with affinity that is two orders of magnitude higher kd   nm than that of the monomeric pwwp module kd    m  the monomer  dimer equilibrium properties and nmr structural data together suggest that the pwwp dimer is formed through a domain swapping mechanism the domain swapped pwwp dimer structures were calculated on the basis of the nmr data the results show that the two pwwp protomers exchange their n terminal hairpin to form a domain swapped dimer the two monomers in a dimer are linked by the long flexible l loops a feature supported by nmr relaxation data for the monomer and dimer the enhanced heparin binding affinity of the dimer can be rationalized in the framework of the dimer structure
