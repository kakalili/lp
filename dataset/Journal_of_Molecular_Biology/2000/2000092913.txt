Thermodynamic properties, stability, and structure of the toxin-like molecule colicin E1 were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism to determine the number of structurally independent domains, and the interdomain interactions necessary for colicin import into the Escherichia coli cell. Analysis of denaturation profiles of the 522 residue colicin E1, together with fragments of 342 and 178 residues that contain subsets of the domains, showed three stable cooperative blocks that differ in thermal stability and correspond to three major functional domains of the colicin: (i) the COOH-terminal channel-forming (C) domain with the highest thermal stability; (ii) the BtuB receptor binding (R) domain; and (iii) the N-terminal translocation (T) domain that has the smallest stabilization enthalpy and thermal stability. Interdomain interactions were described in which T-R interactions stabilize R, and T-C and R-C interactions stabilize R and T, but destabilize C. The R and T domains behaved in a similar way as a function of pH and ionic strength. Interacting extended helices of the R domain, possibly a coiled-coil, were implied by: (i) the very high (&gt;90 %) α-helical content of the R domain, (ii) cooperative decreases in α-helical content near the Ttr of thermal denaturation of the R domain; (iii) a large denaturation enthalpy, implying extensive H-bond and van der Waals interactions.The R domain was inferred, from the extended network of interacting helices, large ΔH, and steep temperature dependence of its stabilization energy to have a dominant role in determining the conformation of other domains. It is proposed that cellular import starts with the R domain binding to the BtuB receptor, followed by unfolding of the R domain coiled-coil and thereby of the T domain, which then interacts with the TolC receptor-translocator.
