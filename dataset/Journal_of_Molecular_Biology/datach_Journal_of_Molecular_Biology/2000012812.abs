post translational modification of p  protein in response to ionizing radiation analyzed by mass spectrometry edited by m yaniv
the p  tumor suppressor protein promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in response to dna damage and other forms of stress p  protein functions as a transcription factor by binding to specific dna sequences and regulating the transcription of target genes this activity of p  is reported to be regulated by phosphorylation and acetylation occuring at various sites on the molecule here we have used a direct and non radioactive approach involving mass spectrometric analysis of p  protein to identify sites that are covalently modified in vivo either constitutively or in response to ionizing radiation following partial purification by immuno affinity chromatography and enzymatic in gel digestion the resulting p  peptides were analyzed by maldi tof and nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry mass spectrometry analyses identified four sites at the n terminus that were phosphorylated in response to irradiation a single constitutive phosphorylation site at serine   and several acetylation sites
