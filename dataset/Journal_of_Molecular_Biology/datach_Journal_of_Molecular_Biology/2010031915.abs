structural basis for featuring of steroid isomerase activity in alpha class glutathione transferases
glutathione transferases gsts are abundant enzymes catalyzing the conjugation of hydrophobic toxic substrates with glutathione in addition to detoxication human gst a  displays prominent steroid double bond isomerase activity e g transforming   androstene   dione into   androstene   dione ad  this chemical transformation is a crucial step in the biosynthesis of steroids such as testosterone and progesterone in contrast to gst a   the homologous gst a  does not show significant steroid isomerase activity we have solved the d structures of human gsts a  and a  in complex with ad in the gst a  crystal structure ad was bound in an orientation suitable for the glutathione gsh mediated catalysis to occur in gst a   however ad was bound in a completely different orientation with its reactive double bond distant from the gsh binding site the structures illustrate how a few amino acid substitutions in the active site spectacularly alter the binding mode of the steroid substrate in relation to the conserved catalytic groups and an essentially fixed polypeptide chain conformation furthermore ad did not bind to the gst a  gsh complex altogether these results provide a first time structural insight into the steroid isomerase activity of any gst and explain the   fold difference in catalytic efficiency between gsts a  and a   more generally the structures illustrate how dramatic diversification of functional properties can arise via minimal structural alterations we suggest a novel structure based mechanism of the steroid isomerization reaction
