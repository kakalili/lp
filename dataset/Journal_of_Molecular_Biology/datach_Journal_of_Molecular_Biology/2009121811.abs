experimentally approaching the solvent accessible surface area of a protein insights into the acid molten globule of bovine  lactalbumin
each conformational state of a protein is inextricably related to a defined extent of solvent exposure that plays a key role in protein folding and protein interactions however accurate measurement of the solvent accessible surface area asa is difficult for any state other than the native n state we address this fundamental physicochemical parameter through a new experimental approach based on the reaction of the photochemical reagent diazirine dzn with the polypeptide chain by virtue of its size dzn is a reasonable molecular mimic of aqueous solvent here we structurally characterize nonnative states of the paradigmatic protein  lactalbumin covalent tagging resulting from unspecific methylene  ch  reaction allows one to obtain a global estimate of asa and to map out solvent accessibility along the amino acid sequence by its mild apolar nature dzn also reveals a hydrophobic phase in the acid stabilized state of  lactalbumin in which there is clustering of core residues accessible to the solvent in a fashion reminiscent of the n state this acid stabilized state also exhibits local regions where increased ch labeling indicates its nonhomogenous nature likely pointing to the existence of packing defects by contrast the virtual absence of a defined long range organization brings about a featureless labeling pattern for the unfolded state overall  ch labeling emerges as a fruitful technique that is able to quantify the asa of the polypeptide chain thus probing conformational features such as the outer exposed surface and inner cavities as well as revealing the existence of noncompact apolar phases in nonnative states
