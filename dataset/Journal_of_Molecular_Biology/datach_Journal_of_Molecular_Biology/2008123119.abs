crystal structure of the arginine repressor protein in complex with the dna operator from mycobacterium tuberculosis
the arginine repressor argr from mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb is a gene product encoded by the open reading frame rv   it regulates the l arginine concentration in cells by interacting with arg boxes in the promoter regions of the arginine biosynthesis and catabolism operons here we present a    structure of mtbargr in complex with a  bp dna operator in the absence of arginine a biological trimer of the protein  dna complex is formed via the crystallographic  fold symmetry axis the n terminal domain of mtbargr has a winged helix  turn  helix motif that binds to the major groove of the dna this structure shows that in the absence of arginine the argr trimer can bind three arg box half sites it also reveals the structure of the whole mtbargr molecule itself containing both n terminal and c terminal domains
