ultrafast redistribution of e coli ssb along long single stranded dna via intersegment transfer
single stranded dna binding proteins ssbs selectively bind single stranded dna ssdna and facilitate recruitment of additional proteins and enzymes to their sites of action on dna ssb can also locally diffuse on ssdna which allows it to quickly reposition itself while remaining bound to ssdna in this work we used a hybrid instrument that combines single molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy to directly visualize the movement of escherichia coli ssb on long polymeric ssdna long ssdna was synthesized without secondary structure that can hinder quantitative analysis of ssb movement the apparent diffusion coefficient of e coli ssb thus determined ranged from    to    nt s which is at least   times higher than that determined from ssb diffusion on short ssdna oligomers and is within the range of values reported for protein diffusion on double stranded dna our work suggests that ssb can also migrate via a long range intersegment transfer on long ssdna the force dependence of ssb movement on ssdna further supports this interpretation
