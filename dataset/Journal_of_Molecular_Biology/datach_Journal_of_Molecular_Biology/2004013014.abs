structural basis of oligomannose recognition by the pterocarpus angolensis seed lectin
the crystal structure of a man glc specific lectin from the seeds of the bloodwood tree pterocarpus angolensis  a leguminous plant from central africa has been determined in complex with mannose and five manno oligosaccharides the lectin contains a classical mannose specificity loop but its metal binding loop resembles that of lectins of unrelated specificity from ulex europaeus and maackia amurensis as a consequence the interactions with mannose in the primary binding site are conserved but details of carbohydrate binding outside the primary binding site differ from those seen in the equivalent carbohydrate complexes of concanavalin a these observations explain the differences in their respective fine specificity profiles for oligomannoses while man    man and man    man    man bind to pal in low energy conformations identical with that of cona man    man is required to adopt a different conformation man    man can bind only in a single binding mode in sharp contrast to cona which creates a higher affinity for this disaccharide by allowing two binding modes
