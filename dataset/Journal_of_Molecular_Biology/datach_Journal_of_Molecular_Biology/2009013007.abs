the capsid proteins of a large icosahedral dsdna virus
chilo iridescent virus civ is a large       diameter insect virus with an icosahedral t   capsid a double stranded dna dsdna genome and an internal lipid membrane the structure of civ was determined to    resolution by means of cryoelectron microscopy cryoem and three dimensional image reconstruction a homology model of p  the civ major capsid protein mcp  was built based on its amino acid sequence and the structure of the homologous paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  vp  mcp this model was fitted into the cryoem density for each of the  trimeric civ capsomers per icosahedral asymmetric unit a difference map in which the fitted civ mcp capsomers were subtracted from the civ cryoem reconstruction showed that there are at least three different types of minor capsid proteins associated with the capsomers outside the lipid membrane   finger  proteins are situated at many but not all of the spaces between three adjacent capsomers within each trisymmetron and  zip  proteins are situated between sets of three adjacent capsomers at the boundary between neighboring trisymmetrons and pentasymmetrons based on the results of segmentation and density correlations there are at least eight finger proteins and three dimeric and two monomeric zip proteins in one asymmetric unit of the civ capsid these minor proteins appear to stabilize the virus by acting as intercapsomer cross links one transmembrane  anchor  protein per icosahedral asymmetric unit which extends from beneath one of the capsomers in the pentasymmetron to the internal leaflet of the lipid membrane may provide additional stabilization for the capsid these results are consistent with the observations for other large icosahedral dsdna viruses that also utilize minor capsid proteins for stabilization and for determining their assembly
