a single mutation in framework  of the heavy variable domain improves the properties of a diabody and a related single chain antibody
excellent results regarding improved therapeutic properties have been often obtained through the conversion of a single  chain variable fragment scfv into a noncovalent dimeric antibody diabody via peptide linker shortening we utilized this approach to obtain a dimeric version of the human scfv   f which was originally engineered to neutralize the cn toxin of centruroides noxius scorpion venom however some envenoming symptoms remained with diabody   f diabody   f was subjected to directed evolution to obtain a variant capable of eliminating envenoming symptoms after two rounds of biopanning diabody d was isolated it exhibited a single mutation e g in framework  of the heavy  chain variable domain diabody d displayed an increase in tm thermal transition midpoint temperature of   c compared with its dimeric precursor the importance of the e g mutation was tested in the context of the human scfv lr a highly efficient antibody against cn  which was previously generated by our group ria o umbarila l  contreras ferrat g  olamendi portugal t  morelos ju rez c  corzo g  possani l d and becerril b     j biol chem           the new variant scfv ler displayed an increase in tm of   c and was capable of neutralizing  ld  of cn toxin with no detectable symptoms when injected into mice at a   toxin to antibody molar ratio these results showed that the e g mutation might increase the therapeutic properties of these antibody fragments molecular modeling and dynamics results suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrogen bonding network near the e g mutation could explain the improved functional stability and neutralization properties of both the diabody d and scfv ler
