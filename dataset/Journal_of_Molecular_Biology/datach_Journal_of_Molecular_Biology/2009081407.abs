two structurally independent domains of e coli nusg create regulatory plasticity via distinct interactions with rna polymerase and regulators
nusg is a conserved regulatory protein that interacts with elongation complexes ecs of rna polymerase dna and rna to modulate transcription in multiple and sometimes opposite ways in escherichia coli nusg suppresses pausing and increases elongation rate enhances termination by e coli  and phage hk  nun protein and promotes antitermination by  n and in ribosomal rna operons we report nmr studies that suggest that e coli nusg consists of two largely independent n and c terminal structural domains ntd and ctd respectively based on tests of the functions of the ntd and ctd and variants of nusg in vivo and in vitro we find that ntd alone is sufficient to suppress pausing and enhance transcript elongation in vitro however neither domain alone can enhance  dependent termination or support antitermination indicating that interactions of both domains with ecs are required for these processes we propose that the two domains of nusg mediate distinct interactions with ecs the ntd interacts with rna polymerase and the ctd interacts with  and other regulators providing nusg with different combinations of interactions to effect different regulatory outcomes
