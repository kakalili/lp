the molecular basis for the inverse temperature transition of elastin edited by a r fersht
elastin undergoes an  inverse temperature transition  such that it becomes more ordered as the temperature increases to investigate the molecular basis for this behavior molecular dynamics simulations were conducted above and below the transition temperature simulations of a  residue elastin peptide  vpgvg   with explicit water molecules were performed at seven different temperatures between  and   c for a total of  ns beginning from an idealized  spiral structure hydrophobic collapse was observed over a narrow temperature range in the simulations moreover simulations above and below elastin  s transition temperature indicate that elastin has more turns and distorted  structure at higher temperatures water was critical to the inverse temperature transition and elastin associated water molecules can be divided into three categories those closely associated with  ii turns those that form hydrogen bonds with the main chain groups and those hydrating the hydrophobic side chains water swollen monomeric elastin above the transition temperature is best described as a compact amorphous structure with distorted  strands fluctuating turns buried hydrophobic residues and main chain polar atoms that participate in hydrogen bonds with water below the transition temperature elastin is expanded with     local  spiral structure overall the simulations are in agreement with experiment and therefore appear to provide an atomic level description of the conformational properties of elastin monomers and the basis for their elastomeric properties
