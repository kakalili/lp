The 900 tetraloop that caps helix 27 of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is amongst the most conserved regions of rRNA. This tetraloop forms a GNRA motif that docks into the minor groove of three base-pairs at the bottom of helix 24 of 16S rRNA in the 30S subunit. Both the tetraloop and its receptor in helix 24 contact the 23S rRNA, forming the intersubunit bridge B2c. Here, we investigated the interaction between the 900 tetraloop and its receptor by genetic complementation. We used a specialized ribosome system in combination with an in vivo instant evolution approach to select mutations in helix 24 compensating for a mutation in the 900 tetraloop (A900G) that severely decreases ribosomal activity, impairing subunit association and translational fidelity. We selected two mutants where the G769-C810 base-pair of helix 24 was substituted with either U-A or C·A. When these mutations in helix 24 were investigated in the context of a wild-type 900 tetraloop, the C·A but not the U-A mutation severely impaired ribosome activity, interfering with subunit association and decreasing translational fidelity. In the presence of the A900G mutation, both mutations in helix 24 increased the ribosome activity to the same extent. Subunit association and translational fidelity were increased to the same level. Computer modeling was used to analyze the effect of the mutations in helix 24 on the interaction between the tetraloop and its receptor. This study demonstrates the functional importance of the interaction between the 900 tetraloop and helix 24.
