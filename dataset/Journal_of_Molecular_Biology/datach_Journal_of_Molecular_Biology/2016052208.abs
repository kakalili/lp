ef g activation by phosphate analogs
elongation factor g ef g is a universally conserved translational gtpase that promotes the translocation of trna and mrna through the ribosome ef g binds to the ribosome in a gtp bound form and subsequently catalyzes gtp hydrolysis the contribution of the ribosome stimulated gtp hydrolysis by ef g to trna mrna translocation remains debated here we show that while ef g  gdp does not stably bind to the ribosome and induce translocation ef g  gdp in complex with phosphate group analogs bef   and alf   promotes the translocation of trna and mrna furthermore the rates of mrna translocation induced by ef g in the presence of gtp and a non hydrolyzable analog of gtp gdp  bef   are similar our results are consistent with the model suggesting that gtp hydrolysis is not directly coupled to mrna trna translocation hence gtp binding is required to induce the activated translocation competent conformation of ef g while gtp hydrolysis triggers ef g release from the ribosome
