the antibiotic microcin b  is a dna gyrase poison characterisation of the mode of inhibition edited by j karn
microcin b  is a   kda bactericidal peptide the putative target of this antibiotic is dna gyrase microcin b  has no detectable effect on gyrase catalysed dna supercoiling or relaxation activities in vitro and is unable to stabilise dna cleavage in the absence of nucleotides however in the presence of atp or the non hydrolysable analogue   adenylyl    imidodiphosphate microcin b  stabilises a gyrase dependent dna cleavage complex in a manner reminiscent of quinolones ca  or the bacterial toxin ccdb the pattern of dna cleavage produced by gyrase in the presence of microcin b  is different from that produced by quinolones and more closely resembles ca  mediated cleavage several gyrase mutants including well known quinolone resistant mutants are cross resistant to microcin induced dna cleavage we suggest that microcin exerts its effects through a mechanism that has similarities to those of both the bacterial toxin ccdb and the quinolone antibacterial agents
