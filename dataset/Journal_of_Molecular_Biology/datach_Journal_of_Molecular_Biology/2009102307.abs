thermodynamic profiling of hiv rreiib rna  zinc finger interactions
the interactions between the hiv rev responsive element rre rna and the hiv regulatory protein rev are crucial for the hiv life cycle earlier we showed that single c h zinc fingers znfs have the same binding site as the rev peptide and exhibit nanomolar affinity in this study the specific role of amino acid side chains and molecular processes involved with complex formation were investigated by perturbation of the binding energetics via changes in temperature ph buffers and salt concentrations as well as znf and rna mutations by isothermal titration calorimetry interestingly despite the large cationic charge on the znfs the number of interactions with the rna phosphate backbone was lower than intuitively expected the presence of binding induced protonation was established by itc and localized by nmr to a histidine on the znf  sheet the  cp of znf  rna binding was observed to be substantially negative and could not be accounted for by conventional solvent accessible surface area models an alternative model based on the extent of hydrogen bond changes as a result of differences in ligand induced water displacement at the binding site provided reasonable explanation of the trends in  cp as well as  h and  s our studies show that incorporation of favorable interactions at the solvent excluded binding interface can be used to alleviate the unfavorable enthalpic penalties of displacing water molecules from the hydrated rna surface
