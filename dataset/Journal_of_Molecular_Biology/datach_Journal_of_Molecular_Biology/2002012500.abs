manipulating conformational equilibria in the lactose permease of escherichia coli edited by g von heijne
a mechanism proposed for lactose h symport by the lactose permease of escherichia coli indicates that lactose permease is protonated prior to ligand binding moreover in the ground state the symported h is shared between his   helix x and glu   helix viii  while glu   helix x is charge paired with arg   helix ix  substrate binding at the outer surface between helices iv glu   and v arg   cys   induces a conformational change that leads to transfer of the h to glu  and reorientation of the binding site to the inner surface after release of substrate glu  is deprotonated on the inside due to re juxtapositioning with arg   the conservative mutation glu    asp causes a    fold decrease in substrate binding affinity and markedly reduced active lactose transport as well as decreased rates of equilibrium exchange and efflux gly scanning mutagenesis of helix viii was employed systematically with mutant glu    asp in an attempt to rescue function and two mutants with increased activity are identified and characterized mutant thr    gly met    gly glu    asp binds ligand with increased affinity and catalyzes active lactose transport with a marked increase in rate however little improvement in efflux or equilibrium exchange is observed in contrast mutant gly    ala glu    asp exhibits no improvement in ligand binding but a small increase in the rate of active transport however an increase in the steady state level of accumulation as well as efflux and equilibrium exchange is observed remarkably when the two sets of mutations are combined all translocation reactions are rescued to levels approximating those of wild type permease the findings support the contention that glu  plays a pivotal role in the mechanism of lactose h symport moreover the results suggest that the two classes of mutants rescue activity by altering the equilibrium between outwardly and inwardly facing conformations of the permease such that impaired protonation and or h transfer is enhanced from one side of the membrane or the other when the two sets of mutants are combined the equilibrium between outwardly and inwardly facing conformations and thus protonation and h transfer are restored
