structure of the large subunit of class ib ribonucleotide reductase from salmonella typhimurium and its complexes with allosteric effectors
the three dimensional structure of the large subunit of the first member of a class ib ribonucleotide reductase r e of salmonella typhimurium has been determined in its native form and together with three allosteric effectors the enzyme contains the characteristic ten stranded    barrel with catalytic residues at a finger loop in its center and with redox active cysteine residues at two adjacent barrel strands structures where the redox active cysteine residues are in reduced thiol form and in oxidized disulfide form have been determined revealing local structural changes the r e enzyme differs from the class ia enzyme escherichia coli r  by not having an overall allosteric regulation this is explained from the structure by differences in the n terminal domain which is about  residues shorter and lacks the overall allosteric binding site r e has an allosteric substrate specificity regulation site and the binding site for the nucleotide effectors is located at the dimer interface similarly as for the class ia enzymes we have determined the structures of r e in the absence of effectors and with dttp datp and dctp bound the low affinity for atp at the specificity site is explained by a tyrosine which hinders nucleotides containing a   oh group to bind
