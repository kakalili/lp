thermostabilization of the neurotensin receptor nts
structural studies on g protein coupled receptors have been hampered for many years by their instability in detergent solution and by the number of potential conformations that receptors can adopt recently the structures of the   and   adrenergic receptors and the adenosine a a receptor were determined in the antagonist bound state a receptor conformation that is thought to be more stable than the agonist bound state in contrast to these receptors the neurotensin nt receptor nts is much less stable in detergent solution we have therefore used a systematic mutational approach coupled with activity assays to identify receptor mutants suitable for crystallization both alone and in complex with the peptide agonist nt the best receptor mutant nts  m contained four point mutations it showed increased stability compared to the wild type receptor in the absence of ligand after solubilization with a variety of detergents in addition nts  m bound to nt was more stable than unliganded nts  m of the four thermostabilizing mutations only one residue a l is predicted to be in the lipid environment in contrast i  a appears to be buried within the transmembrane helix bundle f  a may form a distant part of the putative ligand binding site whereas f  a is likely to be in a region that is important for receptor activation nts  m binds nt with a similar affinity for the wild type receptor however agonist dissociation was slower and nts  m activated g proteins poorly the affinity of nts  m for the antagonist sr   was also lower than that of the wild type receptor thus we have successfully stabilized nts in an agonist binding conformation that does not efficiently couple to g proteins
