the crystal structures of ornithine carbamoyltransferase from mycobacterium tuberculosis and its ternary complex with carbamoyl phosphate and l norvaline reveal the enzyme s catalytic mechanism
mycobacterium tuberculosis ornithine carbamoyltransferase mtb otc catalyzes the sixth step in arginine biosynthesis it produces citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate cp and ornithine orn  here we report the crystal structures of mtb otc in orthorhombic form i and hexagonal form ii space groups the molecules in form ii are complexed with cp and l norvaline nva  the latter is a competitive inhibitor of otc the asymmetric unit in form i contains a pseudo hexamer with  point group symmetry the cp and nva in form ii induce a remarkable conformational change in the  s and the  s loops with the displacement of these loops towards the active site the displacement of these loops is strikingly different from that seen in other otc structures in addition the ligands induce a domain closure of    in form ii sequence comparison of active site residues of mtb otc with several other otcs of known structure reveals that they are virtually identical the interactions involving the active site residues of mtb otc with cp and nva and a modeling study of orn in the form ii structure strongly rule out an earlier proposed mechanistic role of cys  in catalysis and suggest a possible mechanism for otc our results strongly support the view that orn with an already deprotonated n  atom is the species that binds to the enzyme and that one of the phosphate oxygen atoms of cp is likely to be involved in accepting a proton from the doubly protonated n  atom of orn we have interpreted this deprotonation as part of the collapse of the transition state of the reaction
