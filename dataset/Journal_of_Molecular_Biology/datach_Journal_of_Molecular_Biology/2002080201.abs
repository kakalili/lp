phage versus phagemid libraries for generation of human monoclonal antibodies
non immune na  ve phage antibody libraries have become an important source of antibodies for reagent diagnostic and therapeutic use to date reported na  ve libraries have been constructed in phagemid vectors as fusions to piii yielding primarily single copy monovalent display of antibody fragments for this work we subcloned the single chain fv scfv gene repertoire from a na  ve phagemid antibody library into a true phage vector to create a multivalently displayed scfv phage library compared to monovalently displayed scfv multivalent phage display resulted in improved efficiency of display as well as antibody selection a greater number of antibodies were obtained and at earlier rounds of selection such increased efficiency allows the screening for binding antibodies after a single round of selection greatly facilitating automation expression levels of antigen binding scfv were also higher than from the phagemid library in contrast the affinities of scfv from the phage library were lower than from the phagemid library this could be overcome by utilizing the scfv in a multivalent format by affinity maturation or by converting the library to monovalent display after the first round of selection
