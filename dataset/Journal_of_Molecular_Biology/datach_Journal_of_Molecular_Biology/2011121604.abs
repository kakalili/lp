influence of histone tails and h tail acetylations on nucleosome  nucleosome interactions
nucleosome  nucleosome interaction plays a fundamental role in chromatin folding and self association the cation induced condensation of nucleosome core particles ncps displays properties similar to those of chromatin fibers with important contributions from the n terminal histone tails we study the self association induced by addition of cations mg  ca  cobalt iii hexammine  spermidine  and spermine  for ncps reconstituted with wild type unmodified histones and with globular tailless histones and for ncps with the h histone tail having lysine k acetylations or lysine to glutamine mutations at positions k  k  k  and k  in addition the histone construct with the single h k  acetylation was investigated acetylated histones were prepared by a semisynthetic native chemical ligation method the aggregation behavior of ncps shows a general cation dependent behavior similar to that of the self association of nucleosome arrays unlike nucleosome array self association ncp aggregation is sensitive to position and nature of the h tail modification the tetra acetylation in the h tail significantly weakens the nucleosome  nucleosome interaction while the h k  q tetra mutation displays a more modest effect the single h k  acetylation also weakens the self association of ncps which reflects the specific role of h k  in the nucleosome  nucleosome stacking tailless ncps can aggregate in the presence of oligocations which indicates that attraction also occurs by tail independent nucleosome  nucleosome stacking and dna  dna attraction in the presence of cations the experimental data were compared with the results of coarse grained computer modeling for ncp solutions with explicit presence of mobile ions
