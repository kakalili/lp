thioredoxin a active site mutants form mixed disulfide dimers that resemble enzyme  substrate reaction intermediates
thioredoxin functions in nearly all organisms as the major thiol  disulfide oxidoreductase within the cytosol its prime purpose is to maintain cysteine containing proteins in the reduced state by converting intramolecular disulfide bonds into dithiols in a disulfide exchange reaction thioredoxin has been reported to contribute to a wide variety of physiological functions by interacting with specific sets of substrates in different cell types to investigate the function of the essential thioredoxin a trxa in the low gc gram positive bacterium bacillus subtilis we purified wild type trxa and three mutant trxa proteins that lack either one or both of the two cysteine residues in the cxxc active site the pure proteins were used for substrate binding studies known as  mixed disulfide fishing  in which covalent disulfide bonded reaction intermediates can be visualized an unprecedented finding is that both active site cysteine residues can form mixed disulfides with substrate proteins when the other active site cysteine is absent but only the n terminal active site cysteine forms stable interactions a second novelty is that both single cysteine mutant trxa proteins form stable homodimers due to thiol oxidation of the remaining active site cysteine residue to investigate whether these dimers resemble mixed enzyme  substrate disulfides the structure of the most abundant dimer c s was characterized by x ray crystallography this yielded a high resolution     x ray crystallographic structure of a thioredoxin homodimer from a low gc gram positive bacterium the c s trxa dimer can be regarded as a mixed disulfide reaction intermediate of thioredoxin which reveals the diversity of thioredoxin substrate binding modes
