a janus splicing regulatory element modulates hiv  tat and rev mrna production by coordination of hnrnp a cooperative binding
retroviral protein production depends upon alternative splicing of the viral transcript the hiv  acceptor site a is required for tat and rev mrna production production of the tat transcriptional activator is highly controlled because of its apoptotic properties two silencer elements ess and iss and two enhancer elements ese and ese  gaa  were previously identified at site a  hnrnp a binds iss and ess and is involved in the inhibitory process asf sf activates site a utilisation here by using chemical and enzymatic probes we established the d structure of the hiv bru rna region containing site a and identified the rna segments protected in nuclear extract and by purified hnrnp a  iss ese  gaa  and ess are located in three distinct stem loop structures sls   and   as expected hnrnp a binds sites   and  of iss and ess b and oligomerises on the polypurine sequence upstream of ess b in addition we discovered an unidentified hnrnp a binding site auagaa  that overlaps ese  gaa  on the basis of competition experiments hnrnp a has a stronger affinity for this site than for ess b by insertion of gaa  alone or preceded by the aua trinucleotide in a foreign context the auagaa sequence was found to modulate strongly the gaa  splicing enhancer activity cross linking experiments on these heterologous rnas and the sls sls hiv  rna region in nuclear extract and with recombinant proteins showed that binding of hnrnp a to aua gaa  strongly competes the association of asf sf with gaa  in addition disruption of aua gaa  demonstrated a key role of this sequence in hnrnp a cooperative binding to the iss and ess b inhibitors and hnrnp a oligomerisation on the polypurine sequence thus depending on the cellular context  asf sf  hnrnp a  ratio  aua gaa  will activate or repress site a utilisation and can thus be considered as a janus splicing regulator
