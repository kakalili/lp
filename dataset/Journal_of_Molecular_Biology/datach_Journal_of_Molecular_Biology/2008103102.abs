structural characteristics of  synuclein oligomers stabilized by the flavonoid baicalein
the flavonoid baicalein inhibits fibrillation of  synuclein which is a major component of lewy bodies in parkinson s disease it has been known that baicalein induces the formation of  synuclein oligomers and consequently prevents their fibrillation in order to evaluate the structural properties of baicalein stabilized oligomers we purified oligomer species by hplc and examined their stability and structure by cd fourier transform infrared spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography hplc small angle x ray scattering and atomic force microscopy baicalein stabilized oligomers are  sheet enriched according to cd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses they did not form fibrils even after very prolonged incubation from small angle x ray scattering data and atomic force microscopy images the oligomers were characterized as quite compact globular species oligomers were extremely stable with a gdmcl cm   m this high stability explains the previously observed inhibition properties of baicalein against  synuclein fibrillation these baicalein stabilized oligomers added to the solution of aggregating  synuclein were able to noticeably inhibit its fibrillation after prolonged coincubation short fibrils were formed suggesting an effective interaction of oligomers with monomeric  synuclein membrane permeability tests suggested that the baicalein stabilized oligomers had a mild effect on the integrity of the membrane surface this effect was rather similar to that of the monomeric protein suggesting that targeted stabilization of certain  synuclein oligomers might offer a potential strategy for the development of novel parkinson s disease therapies
