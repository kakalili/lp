ligand induced conformational changes and conformational dynamics in the solution structure of the lactose repressor protein
we present here the results of a series of small angle x ray scattering studies aimed at understanding the role of conformational changes and structural flexibility in dna binding and allosteric signaling in a bacterial transcription regulator lactose repressor protein laci  experiments were designed to detect possible conformational changes that occur when laci binds either dna or the inducer iptg or both our studies included the native laci dimer of homodimers and a dimeric variant r  enabling us to probe conformational changes within the homodimers and distinguish them from those involving changes in the homodimer  homodimer relationships the scattering data indicate that removal of operator dna odna from r results in an unfolding and extension of the hinge helix that connects the laci regulatory and dna binding domains in contrast only very subtle conformational changes occur in the r dimer  odna complex upon iptg binding indicative of small adjustments in the orientations of domains and or subdomains within the structure the binding of iptg to native tetrameric laci  odna complexes also appears to facilitate a modest change in the average homodimer  homodimer disposition notably the crystal structure of the native laci  odna complex differs significantly from the average solution conformation the solution scattering data are best fit by an ensemble of structures that includes      of the v shaped dimer of homodimers observed in the crystal structure and      of molecules with more  open  forms such as those generated when the homodimers move with respect to each other about the tetramerization domain in gene regulation such a flexible laci would be beneficial for the interaction of its two dna binding domains positioned at the tips of the v with the required two of three laci operators needed for full repression
