Divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and among eukaryotic ribosomal RNAs is focused in expansion segments (ESs). Eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger than prokaryotic ribosomes partly because of their ESs. We hypothesize that larger rRNAs of complex organisms could confer increased functionality to the ribosome. Here, we characterize the binding partners of Saccharomyces cerevisiae expansion segment 7 (ES7), which is the largest and most variable ES of the eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit and is located at the surface of the ribosome. In vitro RNA‐protein pull-down experiments using ES7 as a bait indicate that ES7 is a binding hub for a variety of non-ribosomal proteins essential to ribosomal function in eukaryotes. ES7-associated proteins observed here cluster into four groups based on biological process, (i) response to abiotic stimulus (e.g., response to external changes in temperature, pH, oxygen level, etc.), (ii) ribosomal large subunit biogenesis, (iii) protein transport and localization, and (iv) transcription elongation. Seven synthetases, Ala-, Arg-, Asp-, Asn-, Leu-, Lys- and TyrRS, appear to associate with ES7. Affinities of AspRS, TyrRS and LysRS for ES7 were confirmed by in vitro binding assays. The results suggest that ES7 in S. cerevisiae could play a role analogous to the multi-synthetase complex present in higher order organisms and could be important for the appropriate function of the ribosome. Thermal denaturation studies and footprinting experiments confirm that isolated ES7 is stable and maintains a near-native secondary and tertiary structure.
