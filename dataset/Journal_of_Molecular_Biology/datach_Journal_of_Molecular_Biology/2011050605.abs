the prohead i structure of bacteriophage hk  implications for scaffold mediated control of particle assembly and maturation
virus capsid assembly requires recruiting and organizing multiple copies of protein subunits to form a closed shell for genome packaging that leads to infectivity many viruses encode scaffolding proteins to shift the equilibrium toward particle formation by promoting intersubunit interactions and stabilizing assembly intermediates bacteriophage hk  lacks an explicit scaffolding protein but the capsid protein gp  contains a scaffold like n terminal segment termed the delta domain when gp is expressed in escherichia coli the delta domain guides   copies of the subunit into a procapsid with t  laevo icosahedral symmetry named prohead i prohead i can be disassembled and reassembled under mild conditions and it cannot mature further when the virally encoded protease gp  is coexpressed with gp  it is incorporated into the capsid and digests the delta domain followed by autoproteolysis to produce the metastable prohead ii prohead i p was isolated by coexpressing gp and an inactive mutant of gp  prohead i and prohead i p were compared by biochemical methods revealing that the inactive protease stabilized the capsid against disassembly by chemical or physical stress the crystal structure of prohead i p was determined at     resolution and distortions were observed in the subunit tertiary structures similar to those observed previously in prohead ii prohead i p differed from prohead ii due to the presence of the delta domain and the resulting repositioning of the n arms explaining why prohead i can be reversibly dissociated and cannot mature low resolution x ray data enhanced the density of the relatively dynamic delta domains revealing their quaternary arrangement and suggesting how they drive proper assembly
