de novo dna synthesis by human dna polymerase   dna polymerase  and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase
dna polymerases pols catalyse the synthesis of dna this reaction requires a primer template dna in order to grow from the   oh end of the primer along the template on the other hand terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase tdt catalyses the addition of nucleotides at the   oh end of a dna strand without the need of a template pol  and pol  are ubiquitous enzymes possess both dna polymerase and terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase activities and belong to pol x family together with pol  and tdt here we show that pol   pol  and tdt all possess the ability to synthesise in vitro short fragments of dna in the absence of a primer template or even a primer or a template in the reaction the dna synthesised de novo by pol   pol  and tdt appears to have an unusual structure furthermore we found that the amino acid phe  of pol  is essential for the de novo synthesis this novel catalytic activity might be related to the proposed functions of these three pol x family members in dna repair and dna recombination
