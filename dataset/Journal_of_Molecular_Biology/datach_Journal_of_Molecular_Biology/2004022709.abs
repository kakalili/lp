crystal structure of chorismate synthase a novel fmn binding protein fold and functional insights
chorismate synthase catalyzes the conversion of  enolpyruvylshikimate  phosphate to chorismate in the shikimate pathway which represents an attractive target for discovering antimicrobial agents and herbicides chorismate serves as a common precursor for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids and many aromatic compounds in microorganisms and plants chorismate synthase requires reduced fmn as a cofactor but the catalyzed reaction involves no net redox change here we have determined the crystal structure of chorismate synthase from helicobacter pylori in both fmn bound and fmn free forms it is a tetrameric enzyme with each monomer possessing a novel       sandwich fold   highly conserved regions including several flexible loops cluster together around the bound fmn to form the active site the unique fmn binding site is formed largely by a single subunit with a small contribution from a neighboring subunit the isoalloxazine ring of the bound fmn is significantly non planar our structure illuminates the essential functional roles played by the cofactor
