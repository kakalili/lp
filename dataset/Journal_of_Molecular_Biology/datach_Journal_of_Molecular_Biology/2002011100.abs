a novel main chain anion binding site in proteins the nest a particular combination of    values in successive residues gives rise to anion binding sites that occur commonly and are found often at functionally important regions edited by j thornton
main chain conformations where one amino acid residue can be described as  r or  r and an adjacent one as  l or  l mostly result in the three main chain nh groups of the two residues and the one following forming a depression that can accommodate an atom with a whole or partial negative charge we propose the name nest for this feature the negatively charged atom when present is also stabilized by hydrogen bonding with the nh groups in an average protein   of residues are involved in a nest the anion or partially negatively charged atom that often occupies the nest may be a main chain carbonyl oxygen atom as in the paperclip also called the schellman loop and the oxyanion hole of serine proteases it can be a phosphate group as in the p loop superfamily that binds atp and gtp overlapping compound nests are observed often as in the p loop which has five successive nh groups that bind the  phosphate group of nucleotide triphosphate the longest compound nests are found surrounding cysteine bound  fe s and  fe s iron sulfur centers which are also anionic nests may encourage binding of the more reduced forms the nest is a novel feature in the sense of not having been described as a unique motif with anion binding potential before although some of the situations where it occurs are familiar
