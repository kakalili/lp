pfkfb regulates oxidative stress homeostasis via its s glutathionylation in cancer
whereas moderately increased cellular oxidative stress is supportive for cancerous growth of cells excessive levels of reactive oxygen species ros are detrimental to their growth and survival we demonstrated that high ros levels via increased oxidized glutathione gssg  induce isoform specific s glutathionylation of  phosphofructo  kinase fructose   bisphosphatase  pfkfb  at residue cys   which is located near the entrance to the  phosphofructo  kinase catalytic pocket upon this ros dependent reversible covalent modification a marked decrease in its catalytic ability to synthesize fructose   bisphosphate fru   p  the key glycolysis allosteric activator was observed this event was coupled to a decrease in glycolytic flux and an increase in glucose metabolic flux into the pentose phosphate pathway this shift in turn caused an increase in reduced glutathione gsh and ultimately resulted in ros detoxification inside hela cells the ability of pfkfb to control the fru   p levels in an ros dependent manner allows the pfkfb expressing cancer cells to continue energy metabolism with a reduced risk of excessive oxidative stress and thereby to support their cell survival and proliferation this study provides a new insight into the roles of pfkfb as switch that senses and controls redox homeostasis in cancer in addition to its role in cancer glycolysis
