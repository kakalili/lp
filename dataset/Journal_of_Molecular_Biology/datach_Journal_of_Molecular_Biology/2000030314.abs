backbone dynamics of a cbegf domain pair in the presence of calcium edited by m summers
calcium binding cb epidermal growth factor like egf domains are found in a wide variety of extracellular proteins with diverse functions in several proteins including the fibrillins  and   the low density lipoprotein receptor the notch receptor and related molecules these domains are organised as multiple tandem repeats the functional importance of calcium binding by egf domains has been underscored by the identification of missense mutations associated with defective calcium binding which have been linked to human diseases here we present  n backbone relaxation data for a pair of cbegf domains from fibrillin  the defective protein in the marfan syndrome the data were best fit using a symmetric top model confirming the extended conformation of the cbegf domain pair our data demonstrate that calcium plays a key role in stabilising the rigidity of the domain pair on the pico to millisecond time scale strikingly the most dynamically stable region of the construct is centred about the domain interface these results provide important insight into the properties of intact fibrillin  the consequences of marfan syndrome causing mutations and the ultrastructure of fibrillins and other extracellular matrix proteins
