structural basis of phospholipase activity of staphylococcus hyicus lipase
staphylococcus hyicus lipase differs from other bacterial lipases in its high phospholipase a activity here we present the crystal structure of the s hyicus lipase at     resolution the lipase is in an open conformation with the active site partly covered by a neighbouring molecule ser   asp  and his  form the catalytic triad the substrate binding cavity contains two large hydrophobic acyl chain binding pockets and a shallow and more polar third pocket that is capable of binding either a short fatty acid or a phospholipid head group a model of a phospholipid bound in the active site shows that lys  is at hydrogen bonding distance from the substrate s phosphate group residues ser   glu  and thr  hold the lysine in position by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions these observations explain the biochemical data showing the importance of lys  and ser  for phospholipid binding and phospholipase a activity
