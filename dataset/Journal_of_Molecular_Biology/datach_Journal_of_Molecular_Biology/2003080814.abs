structural and biochemical characterization of a new mg  binding site near tyr  in the restriction endonuclease pvuii
we have determined the crystal structure of the pvuii endonuclease in the presence of mg  according to the structural data divalent metal ion binding in the pvuii subunits is highly asymmetric the pvuii  mg  complex has two distinct metal ion binding sites one in each monomer one site is formed by the catalytic residues asp  and glu  and has extensive similarities to a catalytically important site found in all structurally examined restriction endonucleases the other binding site is located in the other monomer in the immediate vicinity of the hydroxyl group of tyr  it has no analogy to metal ion binding sites found so far in restriction endonucleases to assign the number of metal ions involved and to better understand the role of mg  binding to tyr  for the function of pvuii we have exchanged tyr  by phe and characterized the metal ion dependence of dna cleavage of wild type pvuii and the y f variant wild type pvuii cleaves both strands of the dna in a concerted reaction mg  binding as measured by the mg  dependence of dna cleavage occurs with a hill coefficient of  meaning that at least two metal ions are bound to each subunit in a cooperative fashion upon formation of the active complex quenched flow experiments show that dna cleavage occurs about tenfold faster if mg  is pre incubated with enzyme or dna than if preformed enzyme  dna complexes are mixed with mg  these results show that mg  cannot easily enter the active center of the preformed enzyme  dna complex but that for fast cleavage the metal ions must already be bound to the apoenzyme and carried with the enzyme into the enzyme  dna complex the y f variant in contrast to wild type pvuii does not cleave dna in a concerted manner and metal ion binding occurs with a hill coefficient of  these results indicate that removal of the mg  binding site at tyr  completely disrupts the cooperativity in dna cleavage moreover in quenched flow experiments y f cleaves dna about ten times more slowly than wild type pvuii regardless of the order of mixing from these results we conclude that wild type pvuii cleaves dna in a fast and concerted reaction because the mg  required for catalysis are already bound at the enzyme one of them at tyr  we suggest that this mg  is shifted to the active center during binding of a specific dna substrate these results for the first time shed light on the pathway by which metal ions as essential cofactors enter the catalytic center of restriction endonucleases
