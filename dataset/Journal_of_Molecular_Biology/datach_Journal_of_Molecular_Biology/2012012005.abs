differential reaction kinetics cleavage complex formation and nonamer binding domain dependence dictate the structure specific and sequence specific nuclease activity of rags
during v d j recombination rag recombination activating gene complex cleaves dna based on sequence specificity besides its physiological function rag has been shown to act as a structure specific nuclease recently we showed that the presence of cytosine within the single stranded region of heteroduplex dna is important when rags cleave on dna structures in the present study we report that heteroduplex dna containing a bubble region can be cleaved efficiently when present along with a recombination signal sequence rss in cis or trans configuration the sequence of the bubble region influences rag cleavage at rss when present in cis we also find that the kinetics of rag cleavage differs between rss and bubble wherein rss cleavage reaches maximum efficiency faster than bubble cleavage in addition unlike rss rag cleavage at bubbles does not lead to cleavage complex formation finally we show that the  nonamer binding region   which regulates rag cleavage on rss is not important during rag activity in non b dna structures therefore in the current study we identify the possible mechanism by which rag cleavage is regulated when it acts as a structure specific nuclease
