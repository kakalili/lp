In spite of recent efforts to elucidate the nuclear import pathway of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase protein (IN), its exact route as well as the domains that mediate its import are still unknown. Here, we show that a synthetic peptide bearing the amino acid residues 161–173 of the HIV-1 IN is able to mediate active import of covalently attached bovine serum albumin molecules into nuclei of permeabilized cells and therefore was designated as nuclear localization signal-IN (NLS(IN)). A peptide bearing residues 161–173 in the reversed order showed low karyophilic properties. Active nuclear import was demonstrated by using fluorescence microscopy and a quantitative ELISA-based assay system. Nuclear import was blocked by addition of the NLS(IN) peptide, as well as by a peptide bearing the NLS of the simian virus 40 T-antigen (NLS-SV40). The NLS(IN) peptide partially inhibited nuclear import mediated by the full-length recombinant HIV-1 IN protein, indicating that the sequence of the NLS(IN) is involved in mediating nuclear import of the IN protein. The NLS(IN) as well as the full-length IN protein interacted specifically with importin α, binding of which was blocked by the NLS(IN) peptide itself as well as by the NLS-SV40.
