fhx l and fhx s two isoforms of the human fork head factor fhx foxj  with differential activity edited by m yaniv
many biological phenomena are dependent on mechanisms that fine tune the expression levels of particular genes this can be achieved by altering the relative activity of a single transcription factor by post translational modifications or by interaction with regulatory molecules an alternative mechanism is based on competition between two or more differently active isoforms of the same transcription factor we found that fhx a recently characterized human fork head transcriptional activator may show such a mechanism for balancing its activity by expressing two differently sized isoforms fhx s and fhx l encoded by a single gene located on human chromosome   fhx l and fhx s showed different transcriptional capacities the larger form fhx l behaving as the more potent transactivator a transactivation domain of the acidic type present only in fhx l would account for this functional difference the relative concentrations of these two fhx isoforms appear to vary in a number of cell types a circumstance that may regulate the final activity of this transcription factor
