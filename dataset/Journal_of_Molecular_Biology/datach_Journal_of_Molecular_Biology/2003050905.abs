evolutionary stabilization of the gene  protein of phage fd reveals the principles that govern the thermodynamic stability of two domain proteins
the gene  protein g p of filamentous phage is essential for their propagation it consists of three domains the ct domain anchors g p in the phage coat the n domain binds to the f pilus of escherichia coli and thus initiates infection and the n domain continues by interacting with the tola receptor phage are thus only infective when the three domains of g p are tightly linked and this requirement is exploited by proside an in vitro selection method for proteins with increased stability in proside a repertoire of variants of the protein to be stabilized is inserted between the n and the ct domains of g p stabilized variants can be selected because they resist cleavage by a protease and thus maintain the essential linkage between the domains the method is limited by the proteolytic stability of g p itself we improved the stability of g p by subjecting the phage without a guest protein to rounds of random in vivo mutagenesis and proteolytic proside selections variants of g p with one to four mutations were selected and the temperature at which the corresponding phage became accessible for a protease increased in a stepwise manner from   c to almost   c the n  n fragments of wild type gene  protein and of the four selected variants were purified and their stabilities towards thermal and denaturant induced unfolding were determined in the biphasic transitions of these proteins domain dissociation and unfolding of n occur in a concerted reaction in the first step followed by the independent unfolding of domain n in the second step n is thus less stable than n  and it unfolds when the interactions with n are broken the strongest stabilizations were caused by mutations in domain n  in particular in its hinge subdomain which provides many stabilizing interactions between the n and n domains these results reveal how the individual domains and their assembly contribute to the overall stability of two domain proteins and how mutations are optimally placed to improve the stability of such proteins
