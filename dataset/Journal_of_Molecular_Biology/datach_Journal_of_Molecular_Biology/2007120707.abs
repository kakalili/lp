conformational instability of the cholera toxin a polypeptide
cholera toxin ct moves from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum er by vesicular transport in the er the catalytic cta subunit dissociates from the holotoxin and enters the cytosol by exploiting the quality control system of er associated degradation erad  it is hypothesized that cta triggers its erad mediated translocation into the cytosol by masquerading as a misfolded protein but the process by which cta activates the erad system remains unknown here we directly assess the thermal stability of the isolated cta polypeptide by biophysical and biochemical methods and correlate its temperature dependent conformational state with susceptibility to degradation by the  s proteasome measurements with circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrated that cta is a thermally unstable protein with a disordered tertiary structure and a disturbed secondary structure at    c a protease sensitivity assay likewise detected the temperature induced loss of native cta structure this protease sensitive conformation was not apparent when cta remained covalently associated with the cta subunit thermal instability in the dissociated cta polypeptide could thus allow it to appear as a misfolded protein for erad mediated export to the cytosol in vitro the disturbed conformation of cta at    c rendered it susceptible to ubiquitin independent degradation by the core  s proteasome in vivo cta was also susceptible to degradation by a ubiquitin independent proteasomal mechanism adp ribosylation factor  a cytosolic eukaryotic protein that enhances the enzymatic activity of cta  stabilized the heat labile conformation of cta and protected it from in vitro degradation by the  s proteasome thermal instability in the reduced cta polypeptide has not been reported before yet both the translocation and degradation of cta may depend upon this physical property
