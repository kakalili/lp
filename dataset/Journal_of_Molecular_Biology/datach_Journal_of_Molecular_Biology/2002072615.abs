the structures of crystalline complexes of human serum amyloid p component with its carbohydrate ligand the cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose
two monoclinic p  crystal forms of human serum amyloid p component sap in complex with the   pyruvate acetal of  d galactose mo dg were prepared structure analysis by molecular replacement and refinement at    resolution revealed that crystal form  a   a  b   a  c    a        contained a pentamer in the asymmetric unit with a structure very similar to that of the published search model the mode of ligand co ordination was also similar except that four of the five subunits showed bound ligand with an additional h bond between o of the galactose and the side chain of lys  one sub unit showed no bound ligand and a vacant calcium site close to a crystal contact the    resolution structure of crystal form  a    a  b    a  c    a  and       showed ten sub units in the asymmetric unit all with two bound calcium ions and ligand the most extensive protein  protein interactions between pentamers describe an ab face to face interaction involving  ion pairs that sandwiches five molecules of bound mo dg at the interface
