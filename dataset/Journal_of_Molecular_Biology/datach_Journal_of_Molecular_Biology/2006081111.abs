cebrc  stimulates d loop formation by rad  and promotes dna single strand annealing
the brca tumour suppressor regulates the rad  recombinase during double strand break dsb repair by homologous recombination hr but how brca executes its functions is not well understood we previously described a functional homologue of brca in caenorhabditis elegans cebrc  that binds preferentially to single stranded dna via an ob fold domain and associates directly with rad  via a single brc domain consistent with a direct role in hr cebrc  mutants are defective for repair of meiotic and radiation induced dsbs due to an inability to regulate rad   here we explore the function of cebrc  in hr processes using purified proteins we show that cebrc  stimulates rad  mediated d loop formation and reduces the rate of atp hydrolysis catalysed by rad   these functions of cebrc  are dependent upon direct association with rad  via its brc motif and on its dna binding activity as point mutations in the brc domain that abolish rad  binding or the brc domain of cebrc  alone lacking the dna binding domain fail to stimulate rad  mediated d loop formation and do not reduce the rate of atp hydrolysis by rad   phenotypic comparison of cebrc  and rad  mutants also revealed a role for cebrc  in an error prone dsb repair pathway independent of rad  and non homologous end joining raising the possibility that cebrc  may have replaced the role of vertebrate rad  in dna single strand annealing ssa  which is missing from c elegans indeed we show here that cebrc  mediates ssa of rpa oligonucleotide complexes similar to rad  these results reveal rad  dependent and independent functions of cebrc  that provide an explanation for the difference in dna repair defects observed in cebrc  and rad  mutants and define mechanistic roles for cebrc  in hr and in the ssa pathway for dsb repair
