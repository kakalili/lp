domain interdependence in the biosynthetic assembly of cftr
the dimerization of their two nucleotide binding domains nbds in a so called  nucleotide sandwich  is the hallmark of atp cassette binding abc proteins and the basis of their catalytic activities the major disease causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr or abcc  deletion of phe  in nbd  does not grossly alter the structure of that domain but prevents conformational maturation of the whole cftr protein possibly by disrupting the native interaction between nbd and nbd  however the role of inter domain interactions in cftr folding has been brought into question by a recent report that all cftr domains fold independently here we show that in addition to domain folding correct inter domain assembly is essential to form a stable unit that satisfies endoplasmic reticulum er quality control n terminal domains depend on their more c terminal neighbors most essentially the second membrane spanning domain msd  but significantly not nbd  wild type c terminal truncation constructs completely devoid of nbd are transported out of the er and to the cell surface where they form characteristic cftr chloride channels with low open probability the  nbd wild type protein matures and has similar stability as its full length counterpart therefore the catalytically crucial inter nbd associations are not required to satisfy er quality control mechanisms the  f  mutation arrests the maturation of  nbd just as it does full length cftr indicating that  f  perturbs other portions of the molecule in addition to nbd  we find that the mutation prevents formation of a compact msd  reflected in its susceptibility to protease digestion this perturbation of msd may in turn prevent its normal integration with msd  the dispensability of nbd in the folding of more n terminal domains stands in contrast to the known hypersensitivity to proteolysis of nbd in the  f  protein
