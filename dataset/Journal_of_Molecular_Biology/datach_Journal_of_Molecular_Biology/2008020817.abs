cell type specific cleavage of nucleocapsid protein by effector caspases during sars coronavirus infection
the epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in   was caused by a novel coronavirus cov  designated sars cov the rna genome of sars cov is complexed by the nucleocapsid protein n to form a helical nucleocapsid besides this primary function n seems to be involved in apoptotic scenarios we show that upon infection of vero e cells with sars cov which elicits a pronounced cytopathic effect and a high viral titer n is cleaved by caspases in contrast in sars cov infected caco  cells which show a moderate cytopathic effect and a low viral titer this processing of n was not observed to further verify these observations we transiently expressed n in different cell lines caco  and n a cells served as models for persistent sars cov infection whereas vero e and a  cells did as prototype cell lines lytically infected by sars cov the experiments revealed that n induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway resulting in processing of n at residues   and   by caspase  and or caspase  of note caspase activation is highly cell type specific in sars cov infected as well as transiently transfected cells in caco  and n a cells almost no n processing was detectable in vero e and a  cells a high proportion of n was cleaved by caspases moreover we examined the subcellular localization of sars cov n in these cell lines in transfected vero e and a  cells sars cov n was localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus whereas in caco  and n a cells nearly no nuclear localization was observed in addition our studies indicate that the nuclear localization of n is essential for its caspase  mediated cleavage these data suggest a correlation among the replication cycle of sars cov subcellular localization of n induction of apoptosis and the subsequent activation of caspases leading to cleavage of n
