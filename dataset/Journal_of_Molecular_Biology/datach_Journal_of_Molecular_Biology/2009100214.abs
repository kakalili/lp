structural  thermodynamic relationships of interactions in the n terminal atp binding domain of hsp
despite its importance as a target in anti cancer therapeutics and the numerous rational based inhibitor design efforts aimed at it there are only limited data available on structural thermodynamic relationships of interactions of the n terminal atp binding domain of hsp  n hsp   here we redress this by presenting an investigation of binding of nucleotides and ansamycin compounds to this domain interactions of nucleotides with n hsp  are relatively weak  gt    m and are strongly enthalpy driven over the temperature range      c geldanamycin ga and its analogues  aag   allylamino   demethoxy ga and  dmag   n n dimethylaminoethylamino  demethoxy ga bind more strongly and have a dominant favourable enthalpic contribution over the temperature range investigated we investigated the temperature dependence of the enthalpic contribution to binding we found that while the ansamycin compounds have the commonly observed negative value the nucleotides show a negligible or even a positive  cp of binding these data represent the first observation of a single binding site for which interactions with different ligands result in both negative and positive  cp values by addressing the likely impact of the potential contributions from protein  ligand interactions we are able to attribute the anomalous  cp for the nucleotides largely to a change in the conformation of the domain structure and local motion in the lid region of n hsp  with the concomitant exposure of hydrophobic amino acid side chains
