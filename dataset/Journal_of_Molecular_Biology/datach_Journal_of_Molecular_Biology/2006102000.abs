evolutionally conserved intermediates between ubiquitin and nedd
the investigation of common structural motifs provides additional information on why proteins conserve similar topologies yet may have non conserved amino acid sequences proteins containing the ubiquitin superfold have similar topologies although the sequence conservation is rather poor here we present novel similarities and differences between the proteins ubiquitin and nedd  they have   identical sequence almost identical backbone topology and similar functional strategy although their physiological functions are mutually different using variable pressure nmr spectroscopy we found that the two proteins have similar conformational fluctuation in the evolutionary conserved enzyme binding region and contain a structurally similar locally disordered conformer i in equilibrium with the basic folded conformer n  a notable difference between the two proteins is that the equilibrium population of i is far greater for nedd   g ni lt  kj mol than for ubiquitin  g ni       kj mol  and that the tendency for overall unfolding u is also far higher for nedd   g nu       kj mol than for ubiquitin  g nu       kj mol  these results suggest that the marked differences in thermodynamic stabilities of the locally disordered conformer i and the overall unfolding species u are a key to determine the functional differences of the two structurally similar proteins in physiology
