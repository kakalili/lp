yeast rvb and rvb are atp dependent dna helicases that form a heterohexameric complex
rvb and rvb are highly conserved proteins present in archaea and eukaryotes these proteins are members of a large superfamily of atpases associated with diverse cellular activities  the aaa superfamily the rvbs have been found in multiprotein complexes that have wide ranges of functions including dna repair transcription chromatin remodeling ribosomal rna processing and small nucleolar rna accumulation here we show that yeast rvb and rvb form a heterohexameric ring structure rather than the double hexameric ring structure proposed to be formed by the human proteins the yeast rvb  complex has enhanced atpase activity compared with the individual rvb proteins furthermore the atpase activity of the rvb  complex is further increased in the presence of double stranded dna with   or   overhangs the yeast rvb  ring undergoes nucleotide dependent conformational changes as observed by electron microscopy in addition consistent with a role for these proteins in chromatin remodeling and dna repair the yeast rvb  complex exhibits dna helicase activity with a preference for unwinding in the   to   direction the individual rvb proteins also exhibit helicase activity albeit weaker than that of the rvb  complex these results clearly establish the yeast rvb  complex as a heterohexameric atp dependent dna helicase and highlight the possible roles played by the rvb proteins within multiprotein complexes
