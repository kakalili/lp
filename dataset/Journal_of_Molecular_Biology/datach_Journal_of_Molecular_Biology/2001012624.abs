the crystal structure of a liganded trehalose maltose binding protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus litoralis at     edited by t richmond
we report the crystallization and structure determination at     of the extracellular membrane anchored trehalose maltose binding protein tmbp in complex with its substrate trehalose tmbp is the substrate recognition site of the high affinity trehalose maltose abc transporter of the hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus litoralis in vivo this protein is anchored to the membrane presumably via an n terminal cysteine lipid modification the crystallized protein was n terminally truncated resulting in a soluble protein exhibiting the same binding characteristics as the wild type protein the protein shows the characteristic features of a transport related substrate binding protein and is structurally related to the maltose binding protein mbp of escherichia coli it consists of two similar lobes each formed by a parallel  sheet flanked by  helices on both sides both are connected by a hinge region consisting of two antiparallel  strands and an  helix as in mbp the substrate is bound in the cleft between the lobes by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions however compared to maltose binding in mbp direct hydrogen bonding between the substrate and the protein prevails while apolar contacts are reduced to elucidate factors contributing to thermostability we compared tmbp with its mesophilic counterpart mbp and found differences known from similar investigations specifically we find helices that are longer than their structurally equivalent counterparts and fewer internal cavities
