selection of small peptides inhibitors of translation
identification of small molecular weight compounds targeting specific sites in the ribosome can accelerate development of new antibiotics and provide new tools for ribosomal research we demonstrate here that antibiotic size short peptides capable of inhibiting protein synthesis can be selected by using specific elements of ribosomal rna as a target the  h   pseudoknot encompassing residues      of the small ribosomal subunit rna was used as a target in screening a heptapeptide phage display library two of the selected peptides could efficiently interfere with both bacterial and eukaryotic translation one of these inhibitory peptides exhibited a high affinity binding to the isolated small ribosomal subunit kd of    m  identification of inhibitory peptides that likely target a specific rrna structure may pave new ways for validating new antibiotic sites in the ribosome the selected peptides can be used as a tool in search of novel site specific inhibitors of translation
