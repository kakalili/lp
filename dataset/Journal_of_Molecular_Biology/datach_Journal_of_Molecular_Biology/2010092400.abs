the mir    group of microrna genes evolutionary biology cellular functions and roles in human diseases
the mir    group of microrna mirna gene is increasingly appreciated to serve key functions in humans these mirnas regulate gene expression involved in cell division metabolism stress response and angiogenesis in vertebrate species the mir    group has also been implicated in human cancers cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disease including alzheimer s disease here we provide an overview of the following   the evolution of mir    group member genes   the expression levels of mirnas in mammalian tissues   evidence for overlapping gene regulatory functions by different mirnas   the normal biochemical pathways regulated by mir    group mirnas and   the roles played by these mirnas in human diseases membership in this group is defined based on sequence similarity near the mature mirnas    end all include the sequence agcagc phylogeny of this group of mirnas is incomplete thus a definitive taxonomic classification e g  designation as a  superfamily   is currently not possible while all vertebrates studied to date express mir  a mir  b mir   mir   and mir   mammals alone are known to express mir   mir   mir   mir   and mir   multiple different mirnas in the mir    group are expressed at moderate to high levels in human tissues we present data on the expression of all known mir    group members in human cerebral cortical gray matter and white matter using new mirna profiling microarrays there is extensive overlap in the mrnas targeted by mir    group members we show new data from cultured h cancer cells that demonstrate similarities in mrnas targeted by mir  and mir   and also support the importance of the mature mirnas    seed region in mrna target recognition in conclusion the mir    group of mirna genes is a fascinating topic of study for evolutionary biologists mirna biochemists and clinically oriented translational researchers alike
