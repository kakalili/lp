the structure of the exopolyphosphatase ppx from escherichia coli o  h suggests a binding mode for long polyphosphate chains
polyphosphate polyp is a linear polymer consisting of tens to hundreds of phosphate molecules joined together by high energy anhydride bonds these polymers are found in virtually all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and perform many functions prominent among them are the responses to many stresses polyphosphate is synthesized by polyp kinase ppk  using the terminal phosphate of atp as the substrate and degraded to inorganic phosphate by both endo and exopolyphosphatases here we report the crystal structure and analysis of the polyphosphate phosphatase ppx from escherichia coli o  h refined at     resolution ppx is made of four domains domains i and ii display structural similarity with one another and share the ribonuclease h like fold domain iii bears structural similarity to the n terminal hd domain of spot domain iv the smallest domain has structural counterparts in cold shock associated rna binding proteins but is of unknown function in ppx the putative ppx active site is located at the interface between domains i and ii in the crystal structure of ppx these two domains are close together and represent the  closed  state comparison with the crystal structure of ppx gppa from aquifex aeolicus reveals close structural similarity between domains i and ii of the two enzymes with the ppx gppa representing an  open  state a striking feature of the dimer is a deep s shaped canyon extending along the dimer interface and lined with positively charged residues the active site region opens to this canyon we postulate that this is a likely site of polyp binding
