the drosophila df  protein interacts with histone h tails and promotes chromatin bridging in vitro
df  is a small hydrophilic protein from drosophila melanogaster that can act as a histone chaperone in vitro the protein is also detected as an integral component of chromatin present at approximately the same level as histone h  we have developed a simple assay to measure protein binding to oligonucleosomes and used it to characterise the df   oligonucleosome interaction df  bound to chromatin in vitro at a level comparable to that observed in vivo the df   chromatin interaction required the presence of core histone tails but binding was independent of the presence of h in the chromatin multiple regions of df  contributed to the interaction df   chromatin binding still occurred on chromatin containing only h   and cross linking experiments showed that df  made intimate contact with h  suggesting that this might be the primary contact site finally using immobilised chromatin templates we showed that df  promoted interstrand bridging between two independent oligonucleosome chains these results provide strong evidence for a structural role of df  in chromatin folding and give an indication of the mechanism involved
