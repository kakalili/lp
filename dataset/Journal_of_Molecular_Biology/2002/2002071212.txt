We show here that the ribozyme domain of the Neurospora VS ribozyme consists of separable upper and lower subdomains. Deletion analysis demonstrates that the entire upper subdomain (helices III/IV/V) is dispensable for site-specific cleavage activity, providing experimental evidence that the active site is contained within the lower subdomain and within the substrate itself. We demonstrate an important role in cleavage activity for a region of helix VI called the 730 loop. Surprisingly, several loop sequences, sizes, and structures at this position can support site-specific cleavage, suggesting that a variety of non-Watsonâ€“Crick structures, rather than a specific loop structure, in this region of the ribozyme can contribute to formation of the active site.
