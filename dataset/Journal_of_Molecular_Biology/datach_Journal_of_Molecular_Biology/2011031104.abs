augmenting  augmentation structural basis of how bamb binds bama and may support folding of outer membrane proteins
barrel proteins are frequently found in the outer membrane of mitochondria chloroplasts and gram negative bacteria in escherichia coli these proteins are inserted in the outer membrane by the bam   barrel assembly machinery complex a multiprotein machinery formed by the  barrel protein bama and the four peripheral membrane proteins bamb bamc bamd and bame the periplasmic part of bama binds prefolded  barrel proteins by a  augmentation mechanism thereby stabilizing the precursors prior to their membrane insertion however the role of the associated proteins within the bam complex remains unknown here we describe the crystal structure of bamb a nonessential component of the bam complex the structure shows a typical eight bladed  propeller fold two sequence stretches of bamb were previously identified to be important for interaction with bama in our structure both motifs are located in close proximity to each other and contribute to a conserved region forming a narrow groove on the top of the propeller moreover crystal contacts reveal two interaction modes of how bamb might bind unfolded  barrel proteins in the crystal lattice bamb binds to exposed  strands by  augmentation whereas peptide stretches rich in aromatic residues can be accommodated in hydrophobic pockets located at the bottom of the propeller thus bamb could simultaneously bind to bama and prefolded  barrel proteins thereby enhancing the folding and membrane insertion capability of the bam complex
