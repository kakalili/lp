energy based analysis and prediction of the orientation between light and heavy chain antibody variable domains
diversity in antibody structure is crucial to the ability of the adaptive immune system to recognize the tremendously diverse set of potential antigens the diversity in structure is most apparent in the six hypervariable loops of the complementarity determining regions however given that these loops occur at the interface of the heavy and light chain variable domains and form the antigen binding site the relative orientation of the heavy and light chain variable domains can create another source of structural diversity leading to changes in antigen binding here we first reexamine the diversity of vl vh orientations in existing antibody crystal structures using   nonredundant sequences demonstrating that the variation in vl vh orientation is greater than that expected from effects of crystal packing antigen binding or the presence of antibody constant regions and increases on average as sequence similarity decreases for residues in the interface between the domains we developed a tool for predicting the relative orientations of the heavy and light chain variable domains using side chain rotamer sampling in the interface and molecular mechanics based energy calculations when using variable domain backbones from the crystal structures the predicted orientation is very close  lt    rmsd to the crystallographically observed orientation in most cases confirming that the vl vh orientation is determined by the antibody sequence and suggesting an approach to predicting the relative orientation of the variable domains when building homology models of antibodies when applied to antibody homology models generated from templates with     sequence identity we predict the vl vh orientation of  antibodies with an average median rmsd of       to the crystal structures
