protein roles in group i intron rna folding the tyrosyl trna synthetase cyt  stabilizes the native state relative to a long lived misfolded structure without compromising folding kinetics
the neurospora crassa cyt  protein is a mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase that also promotes self splicing of group i intron rnas by stabilizing the functional structure in the conserved core cyt  binds the core along the same surface as a common peripheral element p abc suggesting that cyt  can replace p abc functionally in addition to stabilizing structure generally p abc stabilizes the native conformation of the tetrahymena group i intron relative to a globally similar misfolded conformation that has only local differences within the core and is populated significantly at equilibrium by a ribozyme variant lacking p abc e p abc  here we show that cyt  specifically promotes formation of the native group i intron core from this misfolded conformation catalytic activity assays demonstrate that cyt  shifts the equilibrium of e p abc toward the native state by at least  fold and binding assays suggest an even larger effect thus similar to p abc cyt  preferentially recognizes the native core despite the global similarity of the misfolded core and despite forming crudely similar complexes as revealed by dimethyl sulfate footprinting interestingly the effects of cyt  and p abc on folding kinetics differ whereas p abc inhibits refolding of the misfolded conformation by forming peripheral contacts that must break during refolding cyt  does not display analogous inhibition most likely because it relies to a greater extent on direct interactions with the core although cyt  does not encounter this rna in vivo our results suggest that it stabilizes its cognate group i introns relative to analogous misfolded intermediates by specifically recognizing native structural features cyt  may also interact with earlier folding intermediates to avoid rna misfolding or to trap native contacts as they form more generally our results highlight the ability of a protein cofactor to stabilize a functional rna structure specifically without incurring associated costs in rna folding kinetics
