yeast cytoplasmic and mitochondrial methionyl trna synthetases two structural frameworks for identical functions edited by m yaniv
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two methionyl trna synthetases metrs  one in the cytoplasm and the other in mitochondria the cytoplasmic metrs has a zinc finger motif of the type cys x cys x cys x cys in an insertion domain that divides the nucleotide binding fold into two halves whereas no such motif is present in the mitochondrial metrs here we show that tightly bound zinc atom is present in the cytoplasmic metrs but not in the mitochondrial metrs to test whether the presence of a zinc binding site is required for cytoplasmic functions of metrs we constructed a yeast strain in which cytoplasmic metrs gene was inactivated and the mitochondrial metrs gene was expressed in the cytoplasm provided that methionine accepting trna is overexpressed this strain was viable indicating that mitochondrial metrs was able to aminoacylate trnamet in the cytoplasm site directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the zinc domain was required for the stability and consequently for the activity of cytoplasmic metrs mitochondrial metrs like cytoplasmic metrs supported homocysteine editing in vivo in the yeast cytoplasm both metrss catalyzed homocysteine editing and aminoacylation of coenzyme a in vitro thus identical synthetic and editing functions can be carried out in different structural frameworks of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial metrss
