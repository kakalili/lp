activities of various flp recombinases expressed by adenovirus vectors in mammalian cells
flp like cre is a frequently employed site specific recombinase because wild type flp wtflp is thermolabile a thermostable flp mutant flpe has been developed for efficient recombination of flp in studies using mammalian cells and animals flpe and wtflp have been compared in multiple assays in vitro and in vivo and in mouse genetics flpe has been shown to be very effective like cre here we show an adenovirus vector adv system to be valuable for quantitative measurements of the enzyme activity in mammalian cells and using this system precisely compare activities of wtflp and flpe unexpectedly we found that the recombination efficiency of flpe enzyme was lower on a molar basis than that of wtflp even at    c and consequently that the higher recombination yield per transduced adv genome expressing flpe compared to wtflp was due not to inherently higher enzyme activity but rather to higher steady state levels of flpe by its thermostability therefore trying to increase flpe levels further we generated a  humanized  flpe hflpe gene with codon usage optimized for mammals hflpe produced about  fold more flpe enzyme in transfection experiments than flpe as expected however hflpe expressing adv was unstable and could not be prepared without deletion suggesting that a subtle deleterious effect of flp on   cells may exist with hflpe expressing adv thus unavailable of the adv constructs tested adv expressing flpe yielded the most recombined targets despite the lower recombination efficiency of flpe per enzyme molecule compared with that of wtflp we found hflpe to be valuable for plasmid transfection and its properties are probably suitable for experiments involving cell lines and transgenic mice
