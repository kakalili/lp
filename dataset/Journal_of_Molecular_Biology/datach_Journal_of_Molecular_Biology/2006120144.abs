x ray structures of the microglia macrophage specific protein iba from human and mouse demonstrate novel molecular conformation change induced by calcium binding
the ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule  iba  with   amino acid residues has been identified as a calcium binding protein expressed specifically in microglia macrophages and is expected to be a key factor in membrane ruffling which is a typical feature of activated microglia we have determined the crystal structure of human iba in a ca  free form and mouse iba in a ca  bound form to a resolution of     and     respectively x ray structures of iba revealed a compact single domain protein with two ef hand motifs showing similarity in overall topology to partial structures of the classical ef hand proteins troponin c and calmodulin in mouse iba  the second ef hand contains a bound ca  but the first ef hand does not which is often the case in s  proteins suggesting that iba has s  protein like ef hands the molecular conformational change induced by ca  binding of iba is different from that found in the classical ef hand proteins and or s  proteins which demonstrates that iba has an unique molecular switching mechanism dependent on ca  binding to interact with target molecules
