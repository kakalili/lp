dna recognition by the brinker repressor   an extreme case of coupling between binding and folding
the brinker brk nuclear repressor is a major element of the drosophila decapentaplegic morphogen signaling pathway its n terminal part has weak homology to the antennapedia homeodomain and binds to gc rich dna sequences we have investigated the conformation and dynamics of the n terminal   amino acid residues of brk in the absence and in the presence of cognate dna by solution nmr spectroscopy in the absence of dna brk is unfolded and highly flexible throughout the entire backbone addition of cognate dna induces the formation of a well folded structure for residues r  to r  this structure consists of four helices forming a helix turn helix motif that differs from homeodomains but has similarities to the tc transposase the pax  paired domain and the human centromere binding protein the gc rich dna recognition can be explained by specific major groove hydrogen bonds from the n terminal end of helix   the transition from a highly flexible completely unfolded conformation in the absence of dna to a well formed structure in the complex presents a very extreme case of the  coupling of binding and folding  phenomenon
