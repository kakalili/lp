holliday junction binding and resolution by the rap structure specific endonuclease of phage
rap endonuclease targets recombinant joint molecules arising from phage  red mediated genetic exchange previous studies revealed that rap nicks dna at the branch point of synthetic holliday junctions and other dna structures with a branched component however on x junctions incorporating a three base pair core of homology or with a fixed crossover rap failed to make the bilateral strand cleavages characteristic of a holliday junction resolvase here we demonstrate that rap can mediate symmetrical resolution of  bp and  holliday structures containing larger homologous cores on two different mobile  bp junctions rap displays a weak preference for cleaving the phosphodiester backbone between   gc dinucleotides the products of resolution on both large and small dna substrates can be sealed by t dna ligase confirming the formation of nicked duplexes rap protein was also assessed for its capacity to influence the global conformation of junctions in the presence or absence of magnesium ions unlike the known holliday junction binding proteins rap does not affect the angle of duplex arms implying an unorthodox mode of junction binding the results demonstrate that rap can function as a holliday junction resolvase in addition to eliminating other branched structures that may arise during phage recombination
