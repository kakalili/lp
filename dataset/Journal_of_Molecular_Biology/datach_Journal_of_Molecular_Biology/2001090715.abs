transfer of the salmonella type iii effector sope between unrelated phage families edited by m gottesman
salmonella spp are pathogenic enterobacteria that employ type iii secretion systems to translocate effector proteins and modulate responses of host cells the repertoire of translocated effector proteins is thought to define host specificity and epidemic virulence and varies even between closely related salmonella strains therefore horizontal transfer of effector protein genes between salmonella strains plays a key role in shaping the salmonella host interaction several effector protein genes are located in temperate phages the p like phage sope  encodes sope and the  like gifsy phages encode several effector proteins of the yopm ipah family lysogenic conversion with these phages is responsible for much of the diversity of the effector protein repertoires observed among salmonella spp however free exchange of effector proteins by lysogenic conversion can be restricted by superinfection immunity to identify genetic mechanisms that may further enhance horizontal transfer of effector genes we have analyzed sope loci from salmonella spp that do not harbor p like sequences of sope  in two novel sope loci that were identified the   nt sope gene is located in a conserved   kb cassette present also in sope  most strikingly in salmonella enterica subspecies i serovars gallinarum enteritidis hadar and dublin the sope cassette is located in a cryptic  like prophage with similarity to the gifsy phages this provides the first evidence for transfer of virulence genes between different phage families we show that such a mechanism can circumvent restrictions to phage mediated gene transfer and thereby enhances reassortment of the effector protein repertoires in salmonella spp
