rna chaperones stimulate formation and yield of the u snorna  pre rrna duplexes needed for eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis
short duplexes between the u small nucleolar rna and the precursor ribosomal rna must form quickly and with high yield to satisfy the high demand for ribosome synthesis in rapidly growing eukaryotic cells these interactions designated the u  ets external transcribed spacer and u   s duplexes are essential to initiate the processing of small subunit ribosomal rna previously we showed that duplexes corresponding to those in saccharomyces cerevisiae are only observed in vitro after addition of one of two proteins imp p or imp p here we used fluorescence based and other in vitro assays to determine whether these proteins possess rna chaperone activities and to assess whether these activities are sufficient to satisfy the duplex yield and rate requirements expected in vivo assembly of both proteins with the u small nucleolar rna into a chaperone complex destabilizes a u stem structure apparently to expose its  s base pairing site as a result the chaperone complex accelerates formation of the u   s duplex from an undetectable rate to one comparable with the intrinsic rate observed for hybridizing short duplexes the chaperone complex also stabilizes the u  ets duplex by   kcal mol these chaperone activities provide high u  ets duplex yield and rapid u   s duplex formation over a broad concentration range to help ensure that the u  precursor ribosomal rna interactions limit neither ribosome biogenesis nor rapid cell growth the thermodynamic and kinetic framework used is general and thus suitable for investigating the mechanism of action of other rna chaperones
