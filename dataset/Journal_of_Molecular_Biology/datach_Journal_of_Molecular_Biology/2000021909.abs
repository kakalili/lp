solution structure and dynamics of the rous sarcoma virus capsid protein and comparison with capsid proteins of other retroviruses edited by p e wright
the solution structure and dynamics of the recombinant   amino acid residue capsid protein from the rous sarcoma virus has been determined by nmr methods the structure was determined using   distance restraints and   torsion angle restraints and the dynamics analysis was based on  n relaxation parameters r  r  and h  n noe measured for   backbone amide groups the monomeric protein consists of independently folded n and c terminal domains that comprise residues leu  leu  and ala  gln   respectively the domains exhibit different rotational correlation times       ns and       ns respectively  are connected by a flexible linker ala  pro   and do not give rise to inter domain noe values indicating that they are dynamically independent despite limited sequence similarity the structure of the rous sarcoma virus capsid protein is similar to the structures determined recently for the capsid proteins of retroviruses belonging to the lentivirus and human t cell leukemia virus bovine leukemia virus genera structural differences that exist in the c terminal domain of rous sarcoma virus capsid relative to the other capsid proteins appear to be related to the occurrence of conserved cysteine residues whereas most genera of retroviruses contain a pair of conserved and essential cysteine residues in the c terminal domain that appear to function by forming an intramolecular disulfide bond during assembly the rous sarcoma virus capsid protein does not instead the rous sarcoma virus capsid protein contains a single cysteine residue that appears to be conserved among the avian c type retroviruses and is positioned in a manner that might allow the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond during capsid assembly
