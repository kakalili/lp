two structures of alliinase from alliium sativum l  apo form and ternary complex with aminoacrylate reaction intermediate covalently bound to the plp cofactor
alliinase alliin lyase ec      a plp dependent    eliminating lyase constitutes one of the major protein components of garlic alliium sativum l  bulbs the enzyme is a homodimeric glycoprotein and catalyzes the conversion of a specific non protein sulfur containing amino acid alliin  s allyl l cysteine sulfoxide to allicin diallyl thiosulfinate the well known biologically active component of freshly crushed garlic  pyruvate and ammonia the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of  s allyl l cysteine forming dendrite like monoclinic crystals in addition intentionally produced apo enzyme was crystallized in tetragonal form these structures of alliinase with associated glycans were resolved to     and     by molecular replacement branched hexasaccharide chains n linked to asn  and trisaccharide chains n linked to asn  are seen the structure of hexasaccharide was found similar to  short chain complex vacuole type  oligosaccharide most commonly seen in plant glycoproteins an unexpected state of the enzyme active site has been observed in the present structure the electron density in the region of the cofactor made it possible to identify the cofactor moiety as aminoacrylate intermediate covalently bound to the plp cofactor it was found in the present structure to be stabilized by large number of interactions with surrounding protein residues moreover the existence of the expected internal aldimine bond between the  amino group of lys  and the aldehyde of the plp is ruled out on the basis of a distinct separation of electron density of lys   the structure of the active site cavity in the apo form is nearly identical to that seen in the holo form with two sulfate ions an acetate and several water molecules from crystallization conditions that replace and mimic the plp cofactor
