sequence signals for generation of antigenic peptides by the proteasome implications for proteasomal cleavage mechanism edited by w baumeister
proteasomal cleavage of proteins is the first step in the processing of most antigenic peptides that are presented to cytotoxic t cells still its specificity and mechanism are not fully understood to identify preferred sequence signals that are used for generation of antigenic peptides by the proteasome we performed a rigorous analysis of the residues at the termini and flanking regions of naturally processed peptides eluted from mhc class i molecules our results show that both the c terminus position p of the cleavage site and its immediate flanking position p   possess significant signals the n termini of the peptides show these signals only weakly consistent with previous findings that antigenic peptides may be cleaved by the proteasome with n terminal extensions nevertheless we succeed to demonstrate indirectly that the n terminal cleavage sites contain the same preferred signals at position p   this reinforces previous findings regarding the role of the p   position of a cleavage site in determining the cleavage specificity in addition to the well known contribution of position p  our results apply to the generation of antigenic peptides and bare direct implications for the mechanism of proteasomal cleavage we propose a model for proteasomal cleavage mechanism by which both ends of cleaved fragments are determined by the same cleavage signals involving preferred residues at both p and p   positions of a cleavage site the compatibility of this model with experimental data on protein degradation products and generation of antigenic peptides is demonstrated
