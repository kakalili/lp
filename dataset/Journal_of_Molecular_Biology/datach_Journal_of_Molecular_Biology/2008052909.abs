structural insight into substrate binding and catalysis of a novel  keto  deoxy d arabinonate dehydratase illustrates common mechanistic features of the fah superfamily
the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus converts d arabinose to  oxoglutarate by an enzyme set consisting of two dehydrogenases and two dehydratases the third step of the pathway is catalyzed by a novel  keto  deoxy d arabinonate dehydratase kdad  in this study the crystal structure of the enzyme has been solved to     resolution the enzyme forms an oval shaped ring of four subunits each consisting of an n terminal domain with a four stranded  sheet flanked by two  helices and a c terminal catalytic domain with a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase fah fold crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme with magnesium or calcium ions and either a substrate analog  oxobutyrate or the aldehyde enzyme product   dioxopentanoate revealed that the divalent metal ion in the active site is coordinated octahedrally by three conserved carboxylate residues a water molecule and both the carboxylate and the oxo groups of the substrate molecule an enzymatic mechanism for base catalyzed dehydration is proposed on the basis of the binding mode of the substrate to the metal ion which suggests that the enzyme enhances the acidity of the protons  to the carbonyl group facilitating their abstraction by glutamate   a comprehensive structural comparison of members of the fah superfamily is presented and their evolution is discussed providing a basis for functional investigations of this largely unexplored protein superfamily
