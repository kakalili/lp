the role of the zinc finger motif and of the residues at the amino terminus in the function of yeast ribosomal protein yl a edited by j doudna
yl a is an essential yeast ribosomal protein that has a c c zinc finger motif replacement of the cysteine residues had yielded variants that lacked the capacity to bind zinc but still supported cell growth in a continuation of an examination of the relation of the structure of yl a to its function the contribution of amino acid residues in the intervening sequence between the internal cysteine residues of the motif was evaluated substitutions of alanine for the lysine residues at positions     or   or for arginine  slowed cell growth the most severe effect was caused by a double mutation k a r a a mutation of tryptophan  to alanine was lethal mutations to alanine of six conserved residues k  k  k  y  r  and y  in the amino terminal region decreased cell growth the y  mutation was lethal an in vitro assay for binding of yl a to individual  s rrna domains was developed binding of the recombinant fusion protein mbp yl a was to domains ii and iii the kd for binding to domain ii was  nm for domain iii it was   nm there was a close correspondence between the effect of mutations in yl a on cell growth and on binding to  s rrna in the atomic structure of the  s subunit of haloarcula marismortui the archaebacteria homolog of yeast yl a l ae coordinates a zinc atom and the finger motif is folded and interacts mainly with domain iii of  s rrna whereas the amino terminal region of l ae interacts primarily with domain ii the biochemical and genetic experiments complement the three dimensional structure and define for the first time the functional importance of a subset of the residues in close proximity to nucleotides
