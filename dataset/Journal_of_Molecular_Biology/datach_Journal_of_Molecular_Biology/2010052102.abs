inhibition of ctbp activity by akt mediated phosphorylation
pc  cbx  is a member of the chromobox family of polycomb proteins and is a sumo e ligase for the transcriptional corepressor ctbp  here we show that both ctbp and pc are phosphorylated by the kinase akt  which is activated by growth factor signaling via the pi kinase pathway in the presence of pc  phosphorylation of ctbp is increased and this requires interaction of both ctbp and akt with pc  pc promotes ctbp phosphorylation by recruiting akt and in part by preventing de phosphorylation of activated akt  alteration of the akt phosphorylated residue in ctbp to a phosphomimetic results in decreased ctbp dimerization but does not prevent interaction with other transcriptional regulators the phosphomimetic mutant of ctbp is expressed at a lower level than the wild type protein resulting in decreased transcriptional repression we show that this ctbp mutant is targeted for poly ubiquitylation and is less stable than the wild type protein co expression of pc and akt results in both phosphorylation and ubiquitylation of ctbp  thereby targeting ctbp for degradation this work suggests that pc might coordinate multiple enzymatic activities to regulate ctbp function
