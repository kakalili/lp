biochemical analysis of a dna replication origin in the archaeon aeropyrum pernix
we have characterised the interaction of the aeropyrum pernix origin recognition complex proteins orc and orc  with dna using dnase i footprinting each protein binds upstream of its respective gene however orc protein alone interacts more tightly with an additional region containing multiple origin recognition box orb sites that we show to be a replication origin at this origin there are four orb elements disposed either side of an a t rich region an orc protein dimer binds at each of these orb sites once all four orb sites have bound orc protein there is a transition to a higher order assembly with a defined alteration in topology and superhelicity furthermore after this transition the a t rich region becomes sensitive to digestion by dnase i and p nuclease revealing that the transition promotes distortion of the dna in this region presumably as a prelude to loading of mcm helicase
