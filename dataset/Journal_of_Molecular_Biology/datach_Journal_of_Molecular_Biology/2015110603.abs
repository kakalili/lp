a highly coupled network of tertiary interactions in the sam i riboswitch and their role in regulatory tuning
rna folding in vivo is significantly influenced by transcription which is not necessarily recapitulated by mg  induced folding of the corresponding full length rna in vitro riboswitches that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level are an ideal system for investigating this aspect of rna folding as ligand dependent termination is obligatorily co transcriptional providing a clear readout of the folding outcome the folding of representative members of the sam i family of riboswitches has been extensively analyzed using approaches focusing almost exclusively upon mg  and or s adenosylmethionine sam induced folding of full length transcripts of the ligand binding domain to relate these findings to co transcriptional regulatory activity we have investigated a set of structure guided mutations of conserved tertiary architectural elements of the ligand binding domain using an in vitro single turnover transcriptional termination assay complemented with phylogenetic analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry data this analysis revealed a conserved internal loop adjacent to the sam binding site that significantly affects ligand binding and regulatory activity conversely most single point mutations throughout key conserved features in peripheral tertiary architecture supporting the sam binding pocket have relatively little impact on riboswitch activity instead a secondary structural element in the peripheral subdomain appears to be the key determinant in observed differences in regulatory properties across the sam i family these data reveal a highly coupled network of tertiary interactions that promote high fidelity co transcriptional folding of the riboswitch but are only indirectly linked to regulatory tuning
