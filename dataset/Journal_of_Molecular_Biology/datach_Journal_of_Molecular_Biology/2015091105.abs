mutations in the yeast hsp  ssa  at p  alter atp cycling interdomain coupling and specific chaperone functions
the major cytoplasmic hsp  chaperones in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae are the ssa proteins and much of our understanding of hsp  biology has emerged from studying ssa mutant strains for example ssa catalyzes multiple cellular functions including protein transport and degradation and to this end the ssa   mutant has proved invaluable however the biochemical defects associated with the corresponding ssa   protein p  l are unknown consequently we characterized ssa p  l as well as a p  s variant which corresponds to a mutation in the gene encoding the yeast mitochondrial hsp  we discovered that the p  l and p  s proteins exhibit accelerated atpase activity that was similar to the hsp  stimulated rate of atp hydrolysis of wild type ssa  we also found that the mutant proteins were compromised for peptide binding these data are consistent with defects in peptide stimulated atpase activity and with results from limited proteolysis experiments which indicated that the mutants substrate binding domains were highly vulnerable to digestion defects in the reactivation of heat denatured luciferase were also evident correspondingly yeast expressing p  l or p  s as the only copy of ssa were temperature sensitive and exhibited defects in ssa dependent protein translocation and misfolded protein degradation together our studies suggest that the structure of the substrate binding domain is altered and that coupling between this domain and the nucleotide binding domain is disabled when the conserved p  residue is mutated our data also provide new insights into the nature of the many cellular defects associated with the ssa   allele
