catalysis by glomerella cingulata cutinase requires conformational cycling between the active and inactive states of its catalytic triad
cutinase belongs to a group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of esters and triglycerides structural studies on the enzyme from fusarium solani have revealed the presence of a classic catalytic triad that has been implicated in the enzyme s mechanism we have solved the crystal structure of glomerella cingulata cutinase in the absence and in the presence of the inhibitors e   diethyl p nitrophenyl phosphate and petfp  phenethylthio    trifluoropropan  one to resolutions between   and     analysis of these structures reveals that the catalytic triad ser   asp   and his   adopts an unusual configuration with the putative essential histidine his  swung out of the active site into a position where it is unable to participate in catalysis with the imidazole ring    away from its expected position solution state nmr experiments are consistent with the disrupted configuration of the triad observed crystallographically h  n a site directed mutant was shown to be catalytically inactive confirming the importance of this residue in the enzyme mechanism these findings suggest that during its catalytic cycle cutinase undergoes a significant conformational rearrangement converting the loop bearing the histidine from an inactive conformation in which the histidine of the triad is solvent exposed to an active conformation in which the triad assumes a classic configuration
