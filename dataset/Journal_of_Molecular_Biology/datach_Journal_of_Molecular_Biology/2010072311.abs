a structural insight into the molecular recognition of a      tetrahydrocannabinol and the development of a sensitive one step homogeneous immunocomplex based assay for its detection
tetrahydrocannabinol thc is the main psychoactive compound found in cannabis in this study an anti thc fab fragment designed t  was isolated from a display library cloned from the spleen cells of a mouse immunized with a thc  bovine serum albumin conjugate and the crystal structures of the t fab in its free form and in complex with thc were determined at     and     resolution respectively the thc binding site of the t fab is a narrow cavity the n pentyl group of thc protrudes deep into the interface area between the variable domains and the c  monoterpene moiety of the hapten is partially exposed to solvent the metabolites of thc with modifications in the c  monoterpene moiety   nor  carboxy   tetrahydrocannabinol and  hydroxy   tetrahydrocannabinol are bound by the t fab with a higher affinity than thc the crystal structures suggest that ser h and arg h of the t fab are able to make hydrogen bonds with the metabolites which leads to an increased binding against these metabolites by developing a t fab    thc immunocomplex binding antibody from a na ve antibody phage display library the specificity of the   thc binding is highly increased which allows a one step homogeneous fluorescence resonance energy transfer based sensitive immunoassay with a detection limit of   ng ml from saliva samples
