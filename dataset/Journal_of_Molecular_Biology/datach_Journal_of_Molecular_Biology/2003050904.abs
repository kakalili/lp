structure and location of gene product  in the bacteriophage t baseplate
many bacteriophages such as t  t  rb  and    have complex sometimes multilayered tails that facilitate an almost   success rate for the viral particles to infect host cells in bacteriophage t  there is a baseplate which is a multiprotein assembly at the distal end of the contractile tail the baseplate communicates to the tail that the phage fibers have attached to the host cell thereby initiating the infection process gene product  gp  whose amino acid sequence consists of   residues is one of at least  different structural proteins that constitute the t baseplate and is the sixth baseplate protein whose structure has been determined a    resolution x ray structure of gp shows that the two domain protein forms a dimer in which each monomer consists of a three layered  sandwich with two loops each containing an  helix at the opposite sides of the sandwich the crystals of gp were produced in the presence of concentrated chloride and bromide ions resulting in at least  halide binding sites per monomer five halide sites situated at the n termini of  helices have a protein environment observed in other halide containing protein crystal structures the computer programs emfit and situs were used to determine the positions of six gp dimers within the   resolution cryo electron microscopy image reconstruction of the baseplate tail tube complex the gp dimers were found to be located in the upper part of the baseplate outer rim about   of the gp surface is involved in contacts with other baseplate proteins presumed to be gp  gp  and gp  with the structure determination of gp  a total of   of the volume of the baseplate has now been interpreted in terms of its atomic structure
