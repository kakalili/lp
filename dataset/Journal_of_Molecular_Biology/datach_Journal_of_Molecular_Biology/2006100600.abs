dystrophin dp f associates with the   integrin adhesion complex to modulate pc  cell adhesion
dystrophin dp  is the main product of the duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in the brain however its function is unknown to study the role of dp  in neuronal cells we previously generated by antisense treatment pc  neuronal cell clones with decreased dp  expression antisense dp  cells  pc  cells express two different splicing isoforms of dp  a cytoplasmic variant called dp f and a nuclear isoform called dp d we previously reported that antisense dp  cells display deficient adhesion to substrate and reduced immunostaining of   integrin in the cell area contacting the substrate in this study we isolated additional antisense dp  clones to analyze in detail the potential involvement of dp f isoform with the   integrin adhesion system of pc  cells immunofluorescence analyses as well as immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the pc  cell   integrin adhesion complex is composed of   integrin talin paxillin   actinin fak and actin in addition our results showed that dp f associates with most of the   integrin complex components   integrin fak   actinin talin and actin  in the antisense dp  cells the deficiency of dp  provokes a significant reduction of the   integrin adhesion complex and consequently the deficient adhesion of these cells to laminin in vitro binding experiments confirmed the interaction of dp f with fak and   integrin our data indicate that dp f is a structural component of the   integrin adhesion complex of pc  cells that modulates pc  cell adhesion by conferring proper complex assembly and or maintenance
