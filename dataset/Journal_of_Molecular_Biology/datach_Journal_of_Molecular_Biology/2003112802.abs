glucocorticoid receptor like zn cys  motifs in bsli restriction endonuclease
bsli restriction endonuclease cleaves the symmetric sequence ccn gg where n a c g or t  the enzyme is composed of two subunits   and   that form a heterotetramer     in solution the  subunit is believed to be responsible for dna recognition while the  subunit is thought to mediate cleavage here for the first time we provide experimental evidence that bsli binds zn ii  specifically using x ray absorption spectroscopic analysis we show that the  subunit of bsli contains two zn cys  type zinc motifs similar to those in the dna binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor this conclusion is supported by genetic analysis of the zinc binding motifs whereby amino acid substitutions in the zinc finger motifs are demonstrated to abolish or impair cleavage activity an additional putative zinc binding motif was identified in the  subunit consistent with the x ray absorption data these data were corroborated by proton induced x ray emission measurements showing that full bsli contains at least three fully occupied zn sites per    heterodimer on the basis of these data we propose a role for the bsli zn motifs in protein  dna as well as protein  protein interactions
