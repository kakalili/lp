structural and functional characterization of an agonistic anti human epha monoclonal antibody
we report here the three dimensional structure of human ephrin type a receptor  epha  bound to the fab fragment antigen binding of an agonistic human antibody  c  igg    the structure of the corresponding complex was solved at a resolution of     using molecular replacement and constitutes the first reported structure of a human ephrin receptor bound to an antibody we have also defined the corresponding functional epitope using a mutagenesis based approach this study revealed discrete structural features that determine the fine specificity of c to epha  our data also provided a molecular basis for c mechanism of action more precisely we propose that its agonistic internalizing properties are the result of ligand mimicry by the third heavy chain complementarity determining region of c  because epha is an important contributor to cancer formation and progression these findings may have implications for designing the next generation of anti tumor therapies
