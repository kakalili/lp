characterization of the cofactor induced folding mechanism of a zinc binding peptide using computationally designed mutants
metals are the most commonly encountered protein cofactors and they play important structural and functional roles in biology in many cases metal binding provides a major driving force for a polypeptide chain to fold while there are many studies on the structure stability and function of metal binding proteins there are few studies focusing on understanding the kinetic mechanism of metal induced folding herein the zn  induced folding kinetics of a small zinc binding protein are studied the ch  peptide is derived from the first cysteine histidine rich region ch domain of the protein interaction domains of the transcriptional coregulator creb binding protein computational design is used to introduce tryptophan and histidine mutations that are structurally consistent with ch  these mutants are studied using stopped flow tryptophan fluorescence experiments the zn  induced ch  folding kinetics are consistent with two parallel pathways where the initial binding of zn  occurs at two sites however the initially formed zn  bound complexes can proceed either directly to the folded state where zinc adopts a tetrahedral coordination or to an off pathway misligated intermediate while elimination of those ligands responsible for misligation simplifies the folding kinetics it also leads to a decrease in the zinc binding constant therefore these results suggest why these nonnative zinc ligands in the ch  motif are conserved in several distantly related organisms and why the requirement for function can lead to kinetic frustration in folding in addition the loop closure rate of the ch  peptide is determined based on the proposed model and temperature dependent kinetic measurements
