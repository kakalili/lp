crystallographic characterization of an exocyclic dna adduct  n etheno   deoxycytidine in the dodecamer   cgcgaatt cgcg
exocyclic dna adducts are formed from metabolites of chemical carcinogens and have also been detected as endogenous lesions in human dna the exocyclic adduct  n etheno   deoxycytidine  dc  positioned opposite deoxyguanosine in the b form duplex of the dodecanucleotide d cgcgaatt cgcg  has been crystallographically characterized at    resolution this self complementary oligomer crystallizes in space group p   containing a single strand in the asymmetric unit the crystal structure was solved by isomorphous replacement with the corresponding unmodified dodecamer structure exposure of both structures to identical crystal packing forces allows a detailed investigation of the influence of the exocyclic base adduct on the overall helical structure and local geometry structural changes are limited to the  c g and adjacent t a and g c base pairs the standard watson  crick base pairing scheme retained in the t a and g c base pairs is blocked by the etheno bridge in the  c g pair in its place a hydrogen bond involving o of  c and n of g is present comparison with an  dc containing nmr structure confirms the general conformation reported for  c g including the hydrogen bonding features superposition with the crystal structure of a dna duplex containing a t g wobble pair shows similar structural changes imposed by both mismatches evaluation of the hydration shell of the duplex with bond valence calculations reveals two sodium ions in the crystal
