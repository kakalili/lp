analysis of dna looping interactions by type ii restriction enzymes that require two copies of their recognition sites edited by j karn
before cleaving dna substrates with two recognition sites the cfr i ngo miv naei and sfii restriction endonucleases bridge the two sites through d space looping out the intervening dna to characterise their looping interactions the enzymes were added to plasmids with two recognition sites interspersed with two res sites for site specific recombination by tn  resolvase in buffers that contained either edta or cacl so as to preclude dna cleavage by the endonuclease the extent to which the res sites were sequestered into separate loops was evaluated from the degree of inhibition of resolvase with cfr i a looped complex was detected in the presence but not in the absence of ca  it had a lifetime of about  seconds neither ngo miv nor naei gave looped complexes of sufficient stability to be detected by this method in contrast sfii with ca  produced a looped complex that survived for more than seven hours whereas its looping interaction in edta lasts for about four minutes when resolvase was added to a sfii binding reaction in edta followed immediately by cacl  the looped dna was blocked from recombination while the unlooped dna underwent recombination by measuring the distribution between looped and unlooped dna at various sfii concentrations and by fitting the data to a model for dna binding by a tetrameric protein to two sites in cis an equilibrium constant for the looping interaction was determined the equilibrium constant was essentially independent of the length of dna between the sfii sites
