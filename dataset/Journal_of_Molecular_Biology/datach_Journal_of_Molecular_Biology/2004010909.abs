molecular mechanisms for viral mimicry of a human cytokine activation of gp  by hhv  interleukin
kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus kshv or hhv  encodes a pathogenic viral homologue of human interleukin  il   in contrast to human il  hil   viral il  vil  binds directly to and activates the shared human cytokine signaling receptor gp  without the requirement for pre complexation to a specific  receptor here we dissect the biochemical and functional basis of vil  mimicry of hil  we find that in addition to the    receptor independent  tetrameric vil  gp  complex the viral cytokine can engage the human  receptor il r  to form a hexameric vil  il r  gp  complex with enhanced signaling potency in contrast to the assembly sequence of the hil  hexamer the preformed vil  gp  tetramer can be decorated with il r  post facto in a  vil  dependent  fashion a detailed comparison of the viral and human cytokine gp  interfaces indicates that vil  has evolved a unique molecular strategy to interact with gp   as revealed by an almost entirely divergent structural makeup of its receptor binding sites viral il  appears to utilize an elegant combination of both convergent and unexpectedly divergent molecular strategies to oligomerize gp  and activate similar downstream signaling cascades as its human counterpart
