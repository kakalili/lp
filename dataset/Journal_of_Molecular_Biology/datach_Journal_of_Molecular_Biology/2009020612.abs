bacterial genome partitioning n terminal domain of incc protein encoded by broad host range plasmid rk modulates oligomerisation and dna binding
para walker atpases form part of the machinery that promotes better than random segregation of bacterial genomes para proteins normally occur in one of two forms differing by their n terminal domain ntd of approximately   aa which is generally associated with site specific dna binding unusually and for as yet unknown reasons para incc of incp  plasmids is translated from alternative start codons producing two forms incc    aa and incc    aa  whose ratio varies between hosts incc could be detected as an oligomeric form containing dimers tetramers and octamers but the n terminal extension present in incc favours nucleotide stimulated dimerisation as well as high affinity and atp dependent non specific dna binding the incc ntd does not dimerise or bind dna alone but it does bind incc in the presence of nucleotides mixing incc and incc improved polymerisation and dna binding thus the ntd may modulate the polymerisation interface facilitating polymerisation depolymerisation and dna binding to promote the cycle that drives partitioning
