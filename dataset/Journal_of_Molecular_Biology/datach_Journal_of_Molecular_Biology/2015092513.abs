selection of high affinity peptidic serine protease inhibitors with increased binding entropy from a back flip library of peptide  protease fusions
we have developed a new concept for designing peptidic protein modulators by recombinantly fusing the peptidic modulator with randomized residues directly to the target protein via a linker and screening for internal modulation of the activity of the protein we tested the feasibility of the concept by fusing a  residue long disulfide bond constrained inhibitory peptide randomized in selected positions to the catalytic domain of the serine protease murine urokinase type plasminogen activator high affinity inhibitory peptide variants were identified as those that conferred to the fusion protease the lowest activity for substrate hydrolysis the usefulness of the strategy was demonstrated by the selection of peptidic inhibitors of murine urokinase type plasminogen activator with a low nanomolar affinity the high affinity could not have been predicted by rational considerations as the high affinity was associated with a loss of polar interactions and an increased binding entropy
