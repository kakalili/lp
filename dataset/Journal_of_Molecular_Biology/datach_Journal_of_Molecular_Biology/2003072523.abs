proline replacements and the simplification of the complex parallel channel folding mechanism for the alpha subunit of trp synthase a tim barrel protein
the kinetic folding mechanism for the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts from escherichia coli involves four parallel channels whose inter conversions are controlled by three cis trans prolyl isomerization reactions      and    a previous mutational analysis of all  proline positions including the unique cis asp   pro  peptide bond revealed that the g p g p a or p a mutations selectively eliminated the fast    ten seconds  folding phase while the p  m and p  a mutations eliminated the medium     seconds and the slow       seconds folding phases respectively to further elucidate the role of these proline residues and to simplify the folding mechanism a series of double and triple mutants were constructed at these critical positions and comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic experiments were performed although it was not possible to construct a stable system that was free of proline isomerization constraints a double mutant variant g p g p  m in which the refolding of more than   of the unfolded protein is not limited by proline isomerization reactions was identified further long range interactions between several of these residues appear to be a crucial part of the cooperative network of structure that stabilizes the tim barrel motif for  ts
