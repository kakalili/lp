crystal structure analysis of dna uridine endonuclease mth  bound to dna
the reliable repair of pre mutagenic u g mismatches that originated from hydrolytic cytosine deamination is crucial for the maintenance of the correct genomic information in most organisms any uracil base in dna is attacked by uracil dna glycosylases udgs  but at least in methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus  h an alternative strategy has evolved the exonuclease iii homologue mth  from the thermophilic archaeon m thermautotrophicus  h exhibits a dna uridine endonuclease activity in addition to the apyrimidinic apurinic site endonuclease and      exonuclease functions mth  alone compensates for the lack of a udg in a single step reaction thus substituting the two step pathway that requires the consecutive action of udg and apyrimidinic apurinic site endonuclease in order to gain deeper insight into the structural basis required for the specific uridine recognition by mth   we have characterized the enzyme by means of x ray crystallography structures of mth  wild type or mutant proteins either alone or in complex with dna substrates and products have been determined to a resolution of up to     suggesting key residues for the uridine endonuclease activity the insertion of the side chain of arg  into the dna helical base stack resembles interactions observed in human udg and seems to be crucial for the uridine recognition in addition ser   asn   and lys  in the substrate binding pocket appear to have important functions in the discrimination of aberrant uridine against naturally occurring thymidine and cytosine residues in double stranded dna
