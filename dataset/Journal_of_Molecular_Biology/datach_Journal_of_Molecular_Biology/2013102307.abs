structural and mechanistic basis for enhanced translational efficiency by  thiouridine at the trna anticodon wobble position
the  thiouridine s u at the wobble position of certain bacterial and eukaryotic trnas enhances aminoacylation kinetics assists proper codon  anticodon base pairing at the ribosome a site and prevents frameshifting during translation by mass spectrometry of affinity purified native escherichia coli trna glnuug we show that the complete modification at the wobble position  is  carboxyaminomethyl  thiouridine cmnm s u  the crystal structure of e coli glutaminyl trna synthetase glnrs bound to native trna gln and atp demonstrates that cmnm s u  improves the order of a previously unobserved  amino acid surface loop in the distal  barrel domain of the enzyme and imparts other local rearrangements of nearby amino acids that create a binding pocket for the  thio moiety together with previously solved structures these observations explain the degenerate recognition of c  and modified u  by glnrs comparative pre steady state aminoacylation kinetics of native trna gln synthetic trna gln containing s u  as sole modification and unmodified wild type and mutant trna gln and trna gln transcripts demonstrates that the exocyclic sulfur moiety improves trna binding affinity to glnrs  fold compared with the unmodified transcript and that an additional fourfold improvement arises from the presence of the cmnm moiety measurements of gln  trnagln interactions at the ribosome a site show that the s u modification enhances binding affinity to the glutamine codons caa and cag and increases the rate of gtp hydrolysis by e coli ef tu by fivefold
