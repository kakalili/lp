atpase center of bacteriophage  terminase involved in post cleavage stages of dna packaging identification of atp interactive amino acids edited by m gottesman
terminase is the enzyme that mediates  dna packaging into the viral prohead the large subunit of terminase gpa   amino acid residues  has a high affinity atpase activity km   m  to directly identify gpa  s atp interacting amino acids holoterminase bearing a his tag at the c terminus of gpa was uv crosslinked with  n    p atp tryptic peptides from the photolabeled terminase were purified by affinity chromatography and reverse phase hplc two labeled peptides of gpa were identified amino acid sequencing failed to show the tyrosine residue of the first peptide e say qegr  or the lysine of the second peptide v gysk mll  indicating that y  and k  were the  n atp modified amino acids to investigate their roles in  dna packaging y  was changed to e a and f and k  was changed to e and a purified his tagged terminases with changes at residues  and  lacked the gpa high affinity atpase activity though the cos cleavage and cohesive end separation activities were near to those of the wild type enzyme in virion assembly reactions using virion dna as a packaging substrate the mutant terminases showed severe defects in summary the results indicate that y  and k  are part of the high affinity atpase center of gpa and show that this atpase activity is involved in the post cos cleavage stages of  dna packaging
