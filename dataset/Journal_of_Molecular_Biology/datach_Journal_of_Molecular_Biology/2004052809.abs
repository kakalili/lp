the chromosome of shigella flexneri bacteriophage sf  complete nucleotide sequence genetic mosaicism and dna packaging
shigella flexneri temperate bacteriophage sf is of interest in part because its prophage expresses the oac gene that alters the antigenic properties of the surface o antigen polysaccharide of its host bacterium we have determined the complete sequence of its    bp genome the sequence shows that sf is a member of the canonical lambdoid phage group and like other phages of this type has a highly mosaic genome it has chromosomal regions that encode proteins gt   identical with at least  different previously characterized lambdoid phages and prophages but   of the genome including the virion assembly genes is homologous to the genome of one phage hk   an analysis of the nucleotide differences between sf and hk  indicates that even these similar regions are highly mosaic this mosaicism suggests ways in which the virion structural proteins might interact with each other the sf early operons are arranged like a typical lambdoid phage with  boundary sequences  often found between functional modules in the  metabolic  genome domain by virtue of high degree of similarity in the encoding genes and their dna target sites we predict that the integrase early transcription anti terminator ci and cro repressors and cii protein of sf have dna binding specificities very similar to the homologous proteins encoded by phages hk       and p  respectively the late operon contains two trna genes the sf terminase genes are unusual analysis of in vivo initiation of the dna packaging series showed that the sf apparatus that recognizes dna for packaging appears to cleave dna for initiation of packaging series at many sites within a large region of about   bp that includes a possible pac site this is unlike previously characterized phage packaging mechanisms
