structural basis for cell cycle dependent nuclear import mediated by the karyopherin kap  p
kap  p also known as pse p is an essential karyopherin that mediates nuclear import of a plethora of cargoes including cell cycle regulators transcription factors and ribosomal proteins in saccharomyces cerevisiae it has been proposed that the spindle assembly checkpoint signaling triggers molecular rearrangements of nuclear pore complexes and thereby arrests kap  p mediated nuclear import at metaphase while leaving import mediated by other karyopherins unaffected the kap  p specific import inhibition is required for normal progression through mitosis to understand the structural basis for kap  p mediated nuclear import and its unique regulatory mechanism during mitosis we determined crystal structures of kap  p in isolation and also in complex with either its import cargoes or nucleoporin nup p or rangtp kap  p has a superhelical structure composed of  heat repeats the structures of kap  p  cargo complexes define a non conventional nuclear localization signal nls that has a consensus sequence of kv ixkx  k h r the structure of kap  p  nup p complex shows that cargo and nup p compete for the same high affinity binding site explaining how nup p binding forces cargo release when the kap  p binding site of nup p is exposed during mitosis comparison of the nls and rangtp complexes reveals that rangtp binding not only occludes the cargo binding site but also forces kap  p into a conformation that is incompatible with nls recognition
