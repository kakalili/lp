dfoxo regulates transcription of a drosophila acid lipase
insulin resistance is a major feature of pathological states such as obesity and diabetes a consequence of insulin resistance is enhanced lipolysis which causes excessive release of free fatty acids and deregulates fatty acid homeostasis the transcription factor foxo has a central role in the regulation of glucose levels by insulin reduced insulin signaling causes foxo activation which increases hepatic glucose production by activating transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose  phosphatase mrnas our results suggest an additional role for foxo transcription factors the regulation of lipid homeostasis by insulin here we show that in flies dfoxo regulates lipase  dlip  a drosophila homologue of human acid lipases dfoxo binds and activates the dlip promoter in vitro and in vivo and regulates dlip expression in addition dlip mrna expression in flies is dependent on dfoxo our results support a model where dfoxo acts as a key modulator of lipid metabolism by insulin signaling and integrates insulin responses to glucose and lipid homeostasis
