generation of a highly active folding enzyme by combining a parvulin type prolyl isomerase from sura with an unrelated chaperone domain
parvulins are small prolyl isomerases and serve as catalytic domains of folding enzymes sura survival protein a from the periplasm of escherichia coli consists of an inactive par  and an active par  parvulin domain as well as a chaperone domain in the absence of the chaperone domain the folding activity of par is virtually abolished we created a chimeric protein by inserting the chaperone domain of slyd an unrelated folding enzyme from the fkbp family into a loop of the isolated par domain of sura this increased its folding activity   fold to a value higher than the activity of sura in which par is linked with its natural chaperone domain in the presence of both the natural and the foreign chaperone domain the folding activity of par was   fold increased related and unrelated chaperone domains thus are similarly efficient in enhancing the folding activity of the prolyl isomerase par  a sequence analysis of various chaperone domains suggests that clusters of exposed methionine residues in mobile chain regions might be important for a generic interaction with unfolded protein chains this binding is highly dynamic to allow frequent transfer of folding protein chains between chaperone and catalytic domains
