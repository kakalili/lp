acid denaturation of   antitrypsin characterization of a novel mechanism of serpin polymerization
the native serpin architecture is extremely sensitive to mutation and environmental factors these factors induce the formation of a partially folded species that results in the production of inactive loop sheet polymers the deposition of these aggregates in tissue results in diseases such as liver cirrhosis thrombosis angioedema and dementia in this study we characterize the kinetics and conformational changes of   antitrypsin polymerization at ph  using tryptophan fluorescence circular dichroism turbidity changes and thioflavin t binding these biophysical techniques have demonstrated that polymerization begins with a reversible conformational change that results in partial loss of secondary structure and distortion at the top of  sheet a this is followed by two bimolecular processes first protodimers are formed which can be dissociated by changing the ph back to  then an irreversible conformational change occurs resulting in the stabilization of the dimers with a concomitant increase in  sheet structure allowing for subsequent polymer extension electron microscopy analysis of the polymers coupled with the far uv cd and thioflavin t properties of the ph  polymers suggest they do not form via the classical loop  sheet a linkage however they more closely resemble those formed by the pathological variant mmalton taken together these data describe a novel kinetic mechanism of serine proteinase inhibitor polymerization
