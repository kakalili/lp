The nuclear receptor retinoid X receptor (RXR) functions potently in the regulation of homeostasis and cell development, while rexinoids as RXR agonists have proved their therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer. Here, the natural product bigelovin was identified as a selective RXRα agonist. Interestingly, this compound could not transactivate RXRα:RXRα homodimer but could enhance the transactivation of RXRα:peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ heterodimer and repress that of RXRα:liver X receptor (LXR) α heterodimer, while it had no effects on RXRα:farnesoid X receptor heterodimer. Considering that the effective role of LXR response element involved transactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c mediated by RXRα:LXRα in triglyceride elevation, such LXR response element repressing by bigelovin has obviously addressed its potency for further research. Moreover, our determined crystal structure of the bigelovin-activated RXRα ligand-binding domain with the coactivator human steroid receptor coactivator-1 peptide revealed that bigelovin adopted a distinct binding mode. Compared with the known RXR ligands, bigelovin lacks the acidic moiety in structure, which indicated that the acidic moiety rendered little effects on RXR activation. Our results have thereby provided new insights into the structure-based selective rexinoids design with bigelovin as a potential lead compound.
