stability of dimer and domain  domain interaction of arabidopsis phototropin  lov
transient grating signals after photoexcitation of arabidopsis phototropin  light  oxygen  voltage  phot lov  domain without the linker were found to be very sensitive to temperature in particular the diffusion signal drastically increased with rising temperature the signal was consistently explained by the superposition of the photo induced dissociation and association reactions this observation indicated the presence of an equilibrium between the monomer and dimer forms of the phot lov domain in the dark the equilibrium was confirmed by a gel chromatographic technique the equilibrium constants at various temperatures were calculated from the fraction of the dimer and the stabilization enthalpy and entropy were determined interestingly the transient grating signal of phot lov with the linker phot lov linker  which exists as the monomer form was also temperature dependent the diffusion signal intensity decreased with increasing temperature because the diffusion signal reflects a conformation change of the linker upon photoexcitation this temperature dependence indicated that there were two forms of the phot lov linker one form exhibited a conformational change upon photoexcitation whereas the other form showed no change these two forms are not distinguishable spectroscopically the fraction of these species depended on the temperature considering the monomer  dimer equilibrium of the phot lov domain we suggest that the nonreactive form possesses the linker region that is dissociated from the lov domain because the dissociation of the linker region from the lov domain is a key step for the conformation change of the phot lov linker to induce biological activity we proposed that the phototropins could have a role as a temperature sensor
