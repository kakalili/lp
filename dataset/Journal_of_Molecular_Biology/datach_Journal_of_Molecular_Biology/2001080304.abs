the crystal and molecular structure of a collagen like peptide with a biologically relevant sequence edited by i a wilson
a detailed description of the    structure of the triple helical peptide  pro hyp gly  ile thr gly ala arg gly leu ala gly pro hyp gly pro hyp gly  denoted as t    is presented this peptide contains a biologically relevant sequence and was designed to model the imino acid poor      region of human type iii collagen just c terminal to the matrix metalloproteinase cleavage site the crystal structure of the t   peptide demonstrates that sequence can influence local conformational changes in triple helical structure in terms of superhelical pitch hydrogen bonding pattern and hydration patterns the novel packing arrangement displayed by the t   structure compared with those of collagen like peptides with more imino acid rich sequences indicates the sequence dependence of intermolecular assemblies in collagen as well the observed synergy between the packing arrangements and the extended hydration network indicates that hydration of the triple helix is directly related to its association with other molecules
