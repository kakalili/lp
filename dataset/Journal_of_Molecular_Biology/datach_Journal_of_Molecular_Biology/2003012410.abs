lysyl trna synthetase from bacillus stearothermophilus the trp  residue is shielded in a non polar environment and is responsible for the fluorescence changes observed in the amino acid activation reaction
three trp variants of lysyl trna synthetase from bacillus stearothermophilus in which either one or both of the two trp residues within the enzyme trp  and trp   were substituted by a phe residue were produced by site directed mutagenesis without appreciable loss of catalytic activity the following two phenomena were observed with w  f and with the wild type enzyme but not with w  f   the addition of l lysine alone decreased the protein fluorescence of the enzyme but the addition of atp alone did not   the subsequent addition of atp after the addition of excess l lysine restored the fluorescence to its original level fluorometry under various conditions and uv absorption spectroscopy revealed that trp   which was about   away from the lysine binding site and was shielded in a non polar environment was solely responsible for the fluorescence changes of the enzyme in the l lysine activation reaction furthermore the microenvironmental conditions around the residue were made more polar upon the binding of l lysine though its contact with the solvent was still restricted it was suggested that trp  was located in a less polar environment than was trp   after comparison of the wavelengths at the peaks of fluorescence emission and of the relative fluorescence quantum yields trp  was thought based on the fluorescence quenching by some perturbants and the chemical modification with n bromosuccinimide to be on the surface of the enzyme whereas trp  was buried inside the uv absorption difference spectra induced by the l lysine binding indicated that the state of trp   including its electrostatic environment changed during the process but trp  did not change the increased fluorescence from trp  at acidic ph compared with that at neutral ph suggests that carboxylate s are in close proximity to the trp  residue
