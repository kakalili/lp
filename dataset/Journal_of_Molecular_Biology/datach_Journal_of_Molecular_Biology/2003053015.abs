teaching tetr to recognize a new inducer
tet repressor tetr recognizes the inducer tetracycline tc with high affinity the tc analog  de dimethylamino  deoxy  demethyl tetracycline cmt  is not an inducer for tetr induction specificity for cmt was generated by employing a directed evolution approach to screen appropriate tetr mutants in four successive steps the specificity of the best tetr mutant is more than    fold increased for cmt over tc as judged by the ratio of their respective binding constants two rounds of directed evolution via dna shuffling revealed his  as a key residue for inducer specificity the best tetr mutant with cmt specificity contains the h k exchange leading to a   fold decreased tc and a  fold increased cmt affinity another round of directed evolution made use of randomized oligonucleotides to mutate selected residues close to the tc binding pocket of tetr and yielded tetr s  l with a   fold increased cmt affinity the double mutant tetr h k s  l was constructed and again subjected to directed evolution using randomized oligonucleotides to alter residues in the  secondary shell  of the tc binding pocket the resulting best mutants tetr h k e  q s  l tetr a v h k q  e q  e s  l and tetr h k t  k s  l are fully inducible by cmt and not by tc thus their inducer specificity has been redesigned the molecular mechanism of changed inducer recognition is discussed based on binding constants with several tc analogs and in light of the tetr crystal structure
