in vitro assembly of the  x  procapsid from external scaffolding protein oligomers and early pentameric assembly intermediates
bacteriophage  x  morphogenesis requires two scaffolding proteins an internal species similar to those employed in other viral systems and an external species which is more typically associated with satellite viruses the current model of  x  assembly is based on structural and in vivo data during morphogenesis   copies of the external scaffolding protein mediate the association of  pentameric particles into procapsids the hypothesized pentameric intermediate the  s  particle contains  proteins  copies each of the coat spike and internal scaffolding proteins and  copy of the dna pilot protein assembly na ve  s  particles and external scaffolding oligomers most likely tetramers formed procapsid like particles in vitro suggesting that the  s  particle is a bona fide assembly intermediate and validating the current model of procapsid morphogenesis the in vitro system required a crowding agent was influenced by the ratio of the reactants and was most likely driven by hydrophobic forces while the system reported here shared some characteristics with other in vitro internal scaffolding protein mediated systems it displayed unique features these features most likely reflect external scaffolding protein mediated morphogenesis and the  x  procapsid structure in which external scaffolding  scaffolding protein interactions as opposed to coat  coat protein interactions between pentamers constitute the primary lattice forming contacts
