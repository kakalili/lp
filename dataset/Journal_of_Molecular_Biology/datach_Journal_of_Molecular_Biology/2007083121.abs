structural model of the r state of escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase with substrates bound
the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase atcase exists in two conformational states the enzyme in the absence of substrates is primarily in the low activity t state is converted to the high activity r state upon substrate binding and remains in the r state until substrates are exhausted these conformational changes have made it difficult to obtain structural data on r state active site complexes here we report the r state structure of atcase with the substrate asp and the substrate analog phosphonoactamide pam bound this r state structure represents the stage in the catalytic mechanism immediately before the formation of the covalent bond between the nitrogen of the amino group of asp and the carbonyl carbon of carbamoyl phosphate the binding mode of the pam is similar to the binding mode of the phosphonate moiety of n phosphonoacetyl l aspartate pala  the carboxylates of asp interact with the same residues that interact with the carboxylates of pala although the position and orientations are shifted the amino group of asp is     away from the carbonyl oxygen of pam positioned correctly for the nucleophilic attack arg  and leu  in the catalytic chain interact with pam and asp and help to position the substrates correctly for catalysis this structure fills a key gap in the structural determination of each of the steps in the catalytic cycle by combining these data with previously determined structures we can now visualize the allosteric transition through detailed atomic motions that underlie the molecular mechanism
