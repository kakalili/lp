communication between eukaryotic translation initiation factors  and a on the yeast small ribosomal subunit
we have used expressed protein ligation to site specifically label eukaryotic translation initiation factors eifs  and a at their c termini with tetramethyl rhodamine these fluorescent proteins were used in steady state anisotropy based binding experiments to measure the dissociation constants of the factors and the yeast small  s ribosomal subunit for the first time these studies demonstrate that both eif and eif a are capable of binding to the  s subunit in the absence of any other initiation factors or mrna arguing against previous suggestions that eif is required for recruitment of eif to the small ribosomal subunit strikingly the data also demonstrate that there is approximately ninefold thermodynamic coupling in the binding of the two factors to the  s subunit this indicates that eif and eif a communicate with one another when bound to the  s subunit communication between these two factors is likely to be important for coordinating their functions during the initiation process the data presented here provide a foundation on which to build a quantitative understanding of the network of interactions between these essential factors and the rest of the initiation machinery
