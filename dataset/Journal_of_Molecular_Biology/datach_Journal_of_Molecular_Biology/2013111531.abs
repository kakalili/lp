structure of novel enzyme in mannan biodegradation process  o  d mannosyl d glucose phosphorylase mgp
the crystal structure of a novel component of the mannan biodegradation system  o  d mannosyl d glucose phosphorylase mgp  was determined to a     resolution the structure of the enzyme revealed a unique homohexameric structure which was formed by using two helices attached to the n terminus and c terminus as a tab for sticking between subunits the structures of mgp complexes with genuine substrates  o  d mannosyl d glucose and phosphate and the product d mannose  phosphate were also determined the complex structures revealed that the invariant residue asp   which is supposed to be the general acid base did not exist close to the glycosidic glc o atom which should be protonated in the catalytic reaction also no solvent molecule that might mediate a proton transfer from asp  was observed in the substrate complex structure suggesting that the catalytic mechanism of mgp is different from those of known disaccharide phosphorylases
