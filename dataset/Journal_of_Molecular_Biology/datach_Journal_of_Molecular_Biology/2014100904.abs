structural insights into estrogen receptor  methylation by histone methyltransferase smyd  a cellular event implicated in estrogen signaling regulation
estrogen receptor er signaling plays a pivotal role in many developmental processes and has been implicated in numerous diseases including cancers we recently showed that direct er  methylation by the multi specificity histone lysine methyltransferase smyd regulates estrogen signaling through repressing er  dependent transactivation however the mechanism controlling the specificity of the smyd  er  interaction and the structural basis of smyd substrate binding diversity are unknown here we present the crystal structure of smyd in complex with a target lysine lys   containing er  peptide the structure reveals that er  binds smyd in a u shaped conformation with the binding specificity determined mainly by residues c terminal to the target lysine the structure also reveals numerous intrapeptide contacts that ensure shape complementarity between the substrate and the active site of the enzyme thereby likely serving as an additional structural determinant of substrate specificity in addition comparison of the smyd  er  and smyd  p  structures provides the first structural insight into the diverse nature of smyd substrate recognition and suggests that the broad specificity of smyd is achieved by multiple molecular mechanisms such as distinct peptide binding modes and the intrinsic dynamics of peptide ligands strikingly a novel potentially smyd specific polyethylene glycol binding site is identified in the ctd domain implicating possible functions in extended substrate binding or protein  protein interactions our study thus provides the structural basis for the smyd mediated er  methylation and the resulting knowledge of smyd substrate specificity and target binding diversity could have important implications in selective drug design against a wide range of er  related diseases
