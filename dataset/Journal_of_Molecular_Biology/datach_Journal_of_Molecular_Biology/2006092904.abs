identification of a stable flavin thiolate adduct in heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase
heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase tsox is a complex bifunctional flavoenzyme that contains two flavins most of the fmn in recombinant tsox is present as a covalent adduct with an endogenous ligand enzyme denaturation disrupts the adduct accompanied by release of a stoichiometric amount of sulfide enzyme containing    unmodified fmn is prepared by displacement of the endogenous ligand with sulfite a less tightly bound competing ligand reaction of adduct depleted tsox with sodium sulfide produces a stable complex that resembles the endogenous tsox adduct and known a s cysteinyl flavin adducts the results provide definitive evidence for sulfide as the endogenous tsox ligand and strongly suggest that the modified fmn is a a sulfide adduct a comparable reaction with sodium sulfide is not detected with other flavoprotein oxidases a model of the postulated tsox adduct suggests that it is stabilized by nearby residues that may be important in the electron transferase oxidase function of the coenzyme
