differential expression of two plant like enolases with distinct enzymatic and antigenic properties during stage conversion of the protozoan parasite toxoplasma gondii edited by r huber
the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the switch between the two developmental stages of toxoplasma gondii and the metabolic adaptations occurring during this stage conversion are poorly understood because inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration are known to trigger differentiation from tachyzoite into bradyzoite stages we believe that some of the switch components may be sought in the regulation of central carbohydrate metabolism we have previously described a cdna encoding a bradyzoite specific enolase eno  we now report the isolation and characterization of another enolase encoding cdna eno  that is expressed preferentially in the tachyzoite stage the deduced amino acid sequences of eno and eno share     identity they both display significant homologies to plant enolases with the presence of two plant like peptide insertions a pentapeptide ewgw y c s and a dipeptide ek or dk  we demonstrate that deletions of the eno pentapeptide motif on its own or together with the dipeptide reduce drastically the affinity for the pga substrate suggesting that the evolutionary acquisition of these peptides in enolases of land plants and apicomplexan parasites contribute a specific function to their enzymatic activities t gondii eno and eno were also expressed as active recombinant enzymes in escherichia coli while eno and eno display similar km values the pure tachyzoite specific enzyme eno  has a threefold specific activity at vmax compared with that of the bradyzoite specific enolase eno  moreover immunoblot analyses performed using polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant enzymes revealed that the native enolase in tachyzoite and bradyzoite are also antigenically distinct taken together our results indicate that the differences witnessed between the two activities may be instrumental in maintaining glycolysis in pace with the distinct stage specific requirements of carbohydrate metabolism
