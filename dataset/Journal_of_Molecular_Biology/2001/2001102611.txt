Amyloid fibrils formed by incubation of recombinant wild-type human β2-microglobulin (β2M) ab initio in vitro at low pH and high ionic strength are short and highly curved. By contrast, fibrils extracted from patients suffering from haemodialysis-related amyloidosis and those formed by seeding growth of the wild-type protein in vitro with fibrils ex vivo are longer and straighter than those previously produced ab initio in vitro. Here we explore the effect of growth conditions on morphology of β2M fibrils formed ab initio in vitro from the wild-type protein, as well as a variant form of β2M in which Asn17 is deamidated to Asp (N17D). We show that deamidation results in significant destabilisation of β2M at neutral pH. Despite this, acidification is still necessary to form amyloid from the mutant protein in vitro. Interestingly, at low pH and low ionic strength long, straight fibrils of recombinant β2M are formed in vitro. The fibrils comprise three distinct morphological types when examined using electron microscopy (EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) that vary in periodicity and the number of constituent protofibrils. Using kinetic experiments we suggest that the immature fibrils observed previously do not represent intermediates in the assembly of fully mature amyloid, at least under the conditions studied here.
