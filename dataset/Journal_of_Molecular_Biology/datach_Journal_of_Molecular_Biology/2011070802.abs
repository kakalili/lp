monte carlo study of the formation and conformational properties of dimers of a   variants
small soluble oligomers and dimers in particular of the amyloid  peptide a  are believed to play an important pathological role in alzheimer s disease here we investigate the spontaneous dimerization of a   with  residues by implicit solvent all atom monte carlo simulations for the wild type peptide and the mutants f e e g and e g i e the observed dimers of these variants share many overall conformational characteristics but differ in several aspects at a detailed level in all four cases the most common type of secondary structure is intramolecular antiparallel  sheets parallel in register  sheet structure as in models for a  fibrils is rare the primary force driving the formation of dimers is hydrophobic attraction the conformational differences that we do see involve turns centered in the     region the probability of finding turns centered in the     region where there is a loop in a  fibrils is found to increase upon dimerization and to correlate with experimentally measured rates of fibril formation for the different a   variants our findings hint at reorganization of this part of the molecule as a potentially critical step in a  aggregation
