structural analysis of the quaking homodimerization interface
quaking qki is a prototypical member of the star signal transducer and activator of rna protein family which plays key roles in posttranscriptional gene regulation by controlling mrna translation stability and splicing qki  has been shown to regulate mrna expression in the central nervous system but little is known about its roles in other tissues star proteins function as dimers and bind to bipartite rna sequences however the structural and functional roles of homodimerization and heterodimerization are still unclear here we present the crystal structure of the qki dimerization domain which adopts a similar stacked helix  turn  helix arrangement as its homologs gld  germ line development defective   and sam  src  associated protein during mitosis  kda but differs by an additional helix inserted in the dimer interface variability of the dimer interface residues likely ensures selective homodimerization by preventing association with non cognate star family proteins in the cell mutations that inhibit dimerization also significantly impair rna binding in vitro alter qki  protein levels and impair qki function in a splicing assay in vivo together our results indicate that a functional qua homodimerization domain is required for qki  function in mammalian cells
