Recognition of the human immunodeficiency virus Rev-responsive element (RRE) RNA by the Rev protein is an essential step in the viral life cycle. Formation of the Rev–RRE complex signals nucleocytoplasmic export of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA. Essential components of the complex have been localized to a minimal arginine-rich Rev peptide and stem IIB of RRE. In vitro selection studies have identified a synthetic peptide known as RSG 1.2 that binds with better specificity and affinity to RRE than the Rev peptide. NMR structures of both peptide–RNA complexes of Rev and RSG 1.2 bound to RRE stem IIB have been solved and reveal gross structural differences between the two bound complexes. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Rev and RSG 1.2 peptides in complex with RRE stem IIB have been simulated to better understand on an atomic level how two arginine-rich peptides of similar length recognize the same sequence of RNA with such different structural motifs. While the Rev peptide employs some base-specific hydrogen bonding for recognition of RRE, shape recognition, through contact with the sugar-phosphate backbone, and cation–pi interactions are also important. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that RSG 1.2 binds more tightly to the RRE sequence than Rev by forming more base-specific contacts, using water to mediate peptide–RNA contacts, and is held in place by a strong salt bridge network spanning the major groove of the RNA.
