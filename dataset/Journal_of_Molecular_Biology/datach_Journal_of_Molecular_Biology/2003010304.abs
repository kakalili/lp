structural studies of bacteriophage   assembly
bacteriophage   is a member of the microviridae a family of small single stranded icosahedral phages that include  x   these viruses have an ssdna genome associated with approximately  copies of an h pilot protein and  copies of a small j dna binding protein the surrounding capsid consists of  f coat proteins decorated with  pentameric spikes of g protein assembly proceeds via a  s empty procapsid that requires the external d and internal b scaffolding proteins for its formation the    open  procapsid structural intermediate was determined to   resolution by cryo electron microscopy cryo em  unlike the  x    closed  procapsid and the infectious virion the   open procapsid has   wide pores at the  fold vertices and   wide gaps between f pentamers as a result of the disordering of two helices in the f capsid protein the large pores are probably used for dna entry and internal scaffolding protein exit during dna packaging portions of the b scaffolding protein are located at the  fold axes under the spike and in the hydrophobic pocket on the inner surface of the capsid protein b appears to have autoproteolytic activity that cleaves at an arg phe motif and probably facilitates the removal of the protein through the   wide pores the structure of the   mature virion was solved to    resolution by x ray crystallography and was used to interpret the open procapsid cryo em structure the main differences between the   and  x  virion structures are in the spike and the dna binding proteins the   pentameric spikes have a rotation of    compared to those of  x   the   dna binding protein which is shorter by  amino acid residues at its amino end when compared to the  x  j protein retains its carboxy terminal binding site on the internal surface of the capsid protein the icosahedrally ordered structural component of the ssdna appears to be substantially increased in   compared to  x   allowing the building of about   of the ribose phosphate backbone
