structure and mechanism of action of a cofactor dependent phosphoglycerate mutase homolog from bacillus stearothermophilus with broad specificity phosphatase activity edited by r huber
the crystal structure of bacillus stearothermophilus phoe originally termed yhfr  a broad specificity monomeric phosphatase with a molecular mass of    kda has been solved at    resolution in order to investigate its structure and function phoe already identified as a homolog of a cofactor dependent phosphoglycerate mutase shares with the latter an     sandwich structure spanning as a structural excursion a smaller subdomain composed of two  helices and one short  strand the active site contains residues from both the     sandwich and the sub domain with the exception of the hydrophilic catalytic machinery conserved throughout the cofactor dependent phosphoglycerate mutase family the active site cleft is strikingly hydrophobic docking studies with two diverse favored substrates show that  phosphoglycerate may bind to the catalytic core while  napthylphosphate binding also involves the hydrophobic portion of the active site cleft combining a highly favorable phospho group binding site common to these substrate binding modes and data from related enzymes a catalytic mechanism can be proposed that involves formation of a phosphohistidine intermediate on his  and likely acid base behavior of glu  other structural factors contributing to the broad substrate specificity of phoe can be identified the dynamic independence of the subdomain may enable the active site cleft to accommodate substrates of different sizes although similar motions are present in simulations of cofactor dependent phosphoglycerate mutases perhaps favoring a more general functional role a significant number of entries in protein sequence databases particularly from unfinished microbial genomes are more similar to phoe than to cofactor dependent phosphoglycerate mutases or to fructose   bisphosphatases this phoe structure will therefore serve as a valuable basis for inference of structural and functional characteristics of these proteins
