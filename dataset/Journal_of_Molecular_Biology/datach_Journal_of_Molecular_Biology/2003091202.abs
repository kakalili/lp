designing repeat proteins well expressed soluble and stable proteins from combinatorial libraries of consensus ankyrin repeat proteins
we describe an efficient way to generate combinatorial libraries of stable soluble and well expressed ankyrin repeat ar proteins using a combination of sequence and structure consensus analyses we designed a  amino acid residue ar module with seven randomized positions having a theoretical diversity of      different numbers of this module were cloned between n and c terminal capping repeats i e ars designed to shield the hydrophobic core of stacked ar modules in this manner combinatorial libraries of designed ar proteins consisting of four to six repeats were generated thereby potentiating the theoretical diversity all randomly chosen library members were expressed in soluble form in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli in amounts up to   mg per  l of shake flask culture virtually pure proteins were obtained in a single purification step the designed ar proteins are monomeric and display cd spectra identical with those of natural ar proteins at the same time our ar proteins are highly thermostable with tm values ranging from   c to well above   c thus our combinatorial library members possess the properties required for biotechnological applications moreover the favorable biophysical properties and the modularity of the ar fold may account partly for the abundance of natural ar proteins
