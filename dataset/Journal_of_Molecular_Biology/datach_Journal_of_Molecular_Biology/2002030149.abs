implications for the ubiquitination reaction of the anaphase promoting complex from the crystal structure of the doc apc  subunit
the anaphase promoting complex apc is a multi subunit e protein ubiquitin ligase that is responsible for the metaphase to anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis one of the subunits of the apc that is required for its ubiquitination activity is doc apc  a protein composed of a doc homology domain that has been identified in a number of diverse putative e ubiquitin ligases here we present the crystal structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae doc apc  at    resolution the doc homology domain forms a  sandwich structure that is related in architecture to the galactose binding domain of galactose oxidase the coagulation factor c domain and a domain of xrcc  residues that are invariant amongst doc apc  sequences including a temperature sensitive mitotic arrest mutant map to a  sheet region of the molecule whose counterpart in galactose oxidase the coagulation factor c domains and xrcc  mediate bio molecular interactions this finding suggests the identification of the functionally important and conserved region of doc apc  and since invariant residues of doc apc  colocalise with conserved residues of other doc homology domains we propose that the doc homology domains perform common ubiquitination functions in the apc and other e ubiquitin ligases
