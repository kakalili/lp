docking of antizyme to ornithine decarboxylase and antizyme inhibitor using experimental mutant and double mutant cycle data
antizyme az is a highly conserved key regulatory protein bearing a major role in regulating polyamine levels in the cell it has the ability to bind and inhibit ornithine decarboxylase odc  targeting it for degradation az inhibitor azi impairs the activity of az in this study we mapped the binding sites of odc and azi on az using ala scan mutagenesis and generated models of the two complexes by constrained computational docking in order to scan a large number of mutants in a short time we developed a workflow combining high throughput mutagenesis small scale parallel partial purification of his tagged proteins and their immobilization on a tris nitrilotriacetic acid coated surface plasmon resonance chip this combination of techniques resulted in a significant reduction in time for production and measurement of large numbers of mutant proteins the data driven docking results suggest that both proteins occupy the same binding site on az with az binding within a large groove in azi and odc however single mutant data provide information concerning the location of the binding sites only not on their relative orientations therefore we generated a large number of double mutant cycles between residues on az and odc and used the resulting interaction energies to restrict docking the model of the complex is well defined and accounts for the mutant data generated here and previously determined biochemical data for this system insights on the structure and function of the complexes as well as general aspects of the method are discussed
