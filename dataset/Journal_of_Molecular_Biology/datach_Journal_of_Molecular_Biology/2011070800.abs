microsecond subdomain folding in dihydrofolate reductase
the characterization of microsecond dynamics in the folding of multisubdomain proteins has been a major challenge in understanding their often complex folding mechanisms using a continuous flow mixing device coupled with fluorescence lifetime detection we report the microsecond folding dynamics of dihydrofolate reductase dhfr  a two subdomain     sandwich protein known to begin folding in this time range the global dimensions of early intermediates were monitored by f rster resonance energy transfer and the dynamic properties of the local trp environments were monitored by fluorescence lifetime detection we found that substantial collapse occurs in both the locally connected adenosine binding subdomain and the discontinuous loop subdomain within    s of initiation of folding from the urea unfolded state during the fastest observable     s phase the discontinuous loop subdomain further contracts concomitant with the burial of trp residue s  as both subdomains achieve a similar degree of compactness taken together with previous studies in the millisecond time range a hierarchical assembly of dhfr  in which each subdomain independently folds subsequently docks and then anneals into the native conformation after an initial heterogeneous global collapse  emerges the progressive acquisition of structure beginning with a continuously connected subdomain and spreading to distal regions shows that chain entropy is a significant organizing principle in the folding of multisubdomain proteins and single domain proteins subdomain folding also provides a rationale for the complex kinetics often observed
