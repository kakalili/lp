transcription activation by the escherichia coli cyclic amp receptor protein determinants within activating region  edited by r ebright
at class ii crp dependent promoters the escherichia coli cyclic amp receptor protein crp activates transcription by making multiple interactions with rna polymerase rnap  two discrete surfaces of crp known as activating region  ar  and activating region  ar  interact with the c terminal and n terminal domains respectively of the  subunit of rnap activating region  ar  is a third separate surface of crp which is thought to interact with a target in the c terminal region of the rnap   subunit we have used a crp mutant that functions primarily via ar  crp hl  ke  kn  as a tool to identify residues within ar that are important for activation this was achieved by screening a random mutant library of the gene encoding crp hl  ke  kn  for positive control mutants at class ii crp dependent promoters and also by performing alanine scanning mutagenesis using both in vivo reporter assays and in vitro transcription assays we measured the effects of key substitutions within ar on transcription activation in both crp hl  ke  kn  and wild type crp we show that a cluster of negatively charged surface exposed residues at positions      and  is required for optimal activation at a class ii but not at a class i crp dependent promoter we conclude that these residues in ar of crp form an activatory determinant for class ii transcription activation abortive initiation assays were used to show that this activatory determinant accelerates the rate of isomerisation from the closed to open complex at a class ii crp dependent promoter ar of crp also contains an inhibitory determinant the lysine residue at position  of crp is inhibitory to maximal levels of transcription activation from class ii promoters we show that the negative effects of k  are not simply due to  masking  of the negatively charged residues at positions      and   our results suggest that during activation by wild type crp the activatory and inhibitory determinants of ar balance each other thus activation is predominantly determined by ar and ar
