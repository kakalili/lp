generation of mutated variants of the human form of the mhc class i related receptor fcrn with increased affinity for mouse immunoglobulin g
much data support the concept that the mhc class i related receptor fcrn serves to regulate immunoglobulin g igg concentrations in serum and other diverse body sites in both rodents and humans previous studies have indicated that the human ortholog of fcrn is endowed with unexpectedly high stringency in binding specificity for iggs in contrast to mouse fcrn which binds promiscuously to iggs across species human fcrn does not bind to mouse igg or igg a and interacts weakly with mouse igg b here we investigate the molecular basis for this high level specificity we have systematically mutated human fcrn residues to the corresponding mouse fcrn residues in the regions that encompass the fcrn  igg interaction site notably mutation of the poorly conserved residue leu  of human fcrn to glutamic acid l  e generates a human fcrn mutant that binds to mouse igg and mouse igg a with equilibrium dissociation constants of    m and    m respectively from earlier high resolution structural analyses of the rat fcrn  rat fc complex residue   of human fcrn is predicted to contact residue   of igg which can be either his   mouse igg  mouse igg a or tyr   human igg  mouse igg b  the simplest interpretation of our data for the l  e mutant is therefore that replacement of the leu   tyr   human by the glu   his   mouse pair generates a receptor that can bind to mouse igg and mouse igg a the l  e mutation reduces the affinity of human fcrn for human igg by about twofold consistent with the introduction of a less favorable glu   tyr  interaction however the analysis of the effects of other mutations on the binding to different iggs indicates that the contribution to binding of the interaction of fcrn residue   with igg residue   can vary this suggests the existence of distinct docking topologies that are accompanied by variations in contacts between these two residues for different fcrn igg pairs our observations are of direct relevance to understanding the molecular nature of the human fcrn  igg interaction in turn understanding human fcrn function has significance for the optimization of the serum half lives of therapeutic and prophylactic antibodies
