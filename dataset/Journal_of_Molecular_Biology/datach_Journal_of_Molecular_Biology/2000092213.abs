crystal structure of a dimeric archaeal splicing endonuclease edited by j a doudna
the splicing endonuclease fromarchaeoglobus fulgidus af belongs to the homodimeric family of splicing endonucleases thought to have evolved from the homotetrameric endonucleases we report here the crystal structure of the af endonuclease determined at     the crystal structure of the full length af endonuclease contains a homodimer with each monomer consisting of two homologous repeats joined together by an extended polypeptide chain of ten amino acid residues the c terminal repeat has a strong homology to that of a single subunit of the previously determined homotetrameric trna splicing endonuclease from methanococcus jannaschii mj  indicating its role in catalysis the n terminal repeat is a more degenerate form of the mj enzyme thus the n terminal repeat is a  non active  endonuclease fold evolved from the  active  one by detailed comparison of the structures of the n terminal and the c terminal repeats the binding region for rna substrates containing a bulge helix bulge motif can be identified based on the identified rna binding region a cation  interaction is suggested to be responsible for coordinating activities between the two active sites in addition the full length af endonuclease can adopt a higher ordered fibrous structure in solution as revealed by the unusual crystallographic packing interactions and other biochemical analysis this  fold fibrous structure adopted by the full length enzyme is inaccessible to the rna substrate and is largely stabilized by the first  amino acid residues a mutated form of af endonuclease with its first  residues removed catalyzes the cleavage reaction at a significantly higher rate whether there is any role in vivo for this structure mediated modulation of activity remains to be determined
