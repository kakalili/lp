structural basis of substrate specificity of plant  oxophytodienoate reductases
oxophytodienoate reductase  opr  is a fmn dependent oxidoreductase that catalyzes the reduction of the cyclopentenone  s  s   oxophytodienoate  s  s opda to the corresponding cyclopentanone in the biosynthesis of the plant hormone jasmonic acid in vitro however opr reduces the jasmonic acid precursor  s  s opda as well as the enantiomeric  r  r opda while its isozyme opr is highly selective accepting only  r  r opda as a substrate to uncover the molecular determinants of this remarkable enantioselectivity we determined the crystal structures of opr and opr in complex with the ligand p hydroxybenzaldehyde structural comparison with the opr  r  r opda complex and further biochemical and mutational analyses revealed that two active site residues tyr  and tyr  in opr and phe  and his  in opr  are critical for substrate filtering the relatively smaller opr residues allow formation of a wider substrate binding pocket that is less enantio restrictive substitution of phe  and his  by the corresponding opr tyrosines resulted in an opr mutant showing enhanced opr like substrate selectivity moreover sequence analysis of the opr family supports the filtering function of tyr  and tyr  and allows predictions with respect to substrate specificity and biological function of thus far uncharacterized opr isozymes the discovered structural features may also be relevant for other stereoselective proteins and guide the rational design of stereospecific enzymes for biotechnological applications
