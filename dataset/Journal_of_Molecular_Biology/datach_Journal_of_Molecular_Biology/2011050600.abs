crystal structure of human enterovirus   c protease
human enterovirus   ev  is the major pathogen that causes hand foot and mouth disease that particularly affects young children growing hand foot and mouth disease outbreaks were observed worldwide in recent years and caused devastating losses both economically and politically however vaccines or effective drugs are unavailable to date the genome of ev  consists of a positive sense single stranded rna of     bp encoding a large precursor polyprotein that requires proteolytic processing to generate mature viral proteins the proteolytic processing mainly depends on ev  c protease  cpro that possesses both proteolysis and rna binding activities which enable the protease to perform multiple tasks in viral replication and pathogen  host interactions the central roles played by ev  cpro make it an appealing target for antiviral drug development we determined the first crystal structure of ev  cpro and analyzed its enzymatic activity the crystal structure shows that ev  cpro has a typical chymotrypsin like fold that is common in picornaviral cpro strikingly we found an important surface loop also denoted as  ribbon which adopts a novel open conformation in ev  cpro we identified two important residues located at the base of the  ribbon gly  and his   which form hinges that govern the intrinsic flexibility of the ribbon structure guided mutagenesis studies revealed that the hinge residues are important to ev  cpro proteolytic activities in summary our work provides the first structural insight into ev  cpro including a mobile  ribbon which is relevant to the proteolytic mechanism our data also provides a framework for structure guided inhibitor design against ev  cpro
