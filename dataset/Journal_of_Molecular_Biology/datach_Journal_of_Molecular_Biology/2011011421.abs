distal to proximal no conversion in hemoproteins the role of the proximal pocket
hemoproteins play central roles in the formation and utilization of nitric oxide no in cellular signaling as well as in protection against nitrosative stress key to heme  nitrosyl function and reactivity is the fe coordination number  or   for five coordinate  c no complexes the potential for no to bind on either heme face exists as in the microbial cytochrome c  from alcaligenes xylosoxidans axcytcp  which forms a stable proximal c no complex via a distal six coordinate no intermediate and a putative dinitrosyl species strong parallels between the no binding kinetics of axcytcp the eukaryotic no sensor soluble guanylate cyclase and the ferrocytochrome c cardiolipin complex have led to the suggestion that a distal to proximal no switch could contribute to the selective ligand responses in gas sensing hemoproteins the proximal no binding site in axcytcp is close to a conserved basic arg   residue that is postulated to modulate no reactivity we have replaced arg  by five different amino acids and have determined high resolution          crystallographic structures with and without no these together with kinetic and resonance raman data provide new insights into the mechanism of distal to proximal heme  no conversion including the determinants of fe  his bond scission the arg  ala variant allowed us to determine the structure of an analog of the previously unobserved key c no distal intermediate species the very high resolution structures combined with the extensive spectroscopic and kinetic data have allowed us to provide a fresh insight into heme reactivity towards no a reaction that is of wide importance in biology
