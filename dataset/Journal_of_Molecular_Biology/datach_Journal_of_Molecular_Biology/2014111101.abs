structural determinants in prion protein folding and stability
prions are responsible for a heterogeneous group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases involving post translational modifications of the cellular prion protein epidemiological studies on creutzfeldt jakob disease a prototype prion disorder show a majority of cases being sporadic while the remaining occurrences are either genetic or iatrogenic the molecular mechanisms by which prpc is converted into its pathological isoform have not yet been established while point mutations and seeds trigger the protein to cross the energy barriers thus causing genetic and infectious transmissible spongiform encephalopathies respectively the mechanism responsible for sporadic forms remains unclear since prion diseases are protein misfolding disorders we investigated prion protein folding and stability as functions of different milieus using spectroscopic techniques and atomistic simulations we dissected the contribution of major structural determinants also defining the energy landscape of prion protein in particular we elucidated i the essential role of the octapeptide region in prion protein folding and stability  ii the presence of a very enthalpically stable intermediate in prion susceptible species and iii the role of the disulfide bridge in prion protein folding
