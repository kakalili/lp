structural consequences of accommodation of four non cognate amino acid residues in the s pocket of bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin
crystal structures of p gly val leu and phe bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti variants in complex with two serine proteinases bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin have been determined the association constants for the four mutants with the two enzymes show that the enlargement of the volume of the p residue is accompanied by an increase of the binding energy which is more pronounced for bovine chymotrypsin since the conformation of the p side chains in the two s pockets is very similar we suggest that the difference in  g values between the enzymes must arise from the more polar environment of the s site of trypsin this results mainly from the substitutions of met  and ser  observed in chymotrypsin with gln  and asp  present in trypsin the more polar interior of the s site of trypsin is reflected by a much higher order of the solvent network in the empty pocket of the enzyme as is observed in the complexes of the two enzymes with the p gly bpti variant the more optimal binding of the large hydrophobic p residues by chymotrypsin is also reflected by shrinkage of the s pocket upon the accommodation of the cognate residues of this enzyme conversely the s pocket of trypsin expands upon binding of such side chains possibly to avoid interaction with the polar residues of the walls further differentiation between the two enzymes is achieved by small differences in the shape of the s sites resulting in an unequal steric hindrance of some of the side chains as observed for the  branched p leu variant of bpti which is much more favored by bovine chymotrypsin than trypsin analysis of the discrimination of  branched residues by trypsin and chymotrypsin is based on the complexes with the p val bpti variant steric repulsion of the p val residue by the walls of the s pocket of both enzymes prevents the p val side chain from adopting the most optimal   value
