interactions between late acting proteins required for peptidoglycan synthesis during sporulation
the requirement of peptidoglycan synthesis for growth complicates the analysis of interactions between proteins involved in this pathway in particular the latter steps that involve membrane linked substrates have proven largely recalcitrant to in vivo analysis here we have taken advantage of the peptidoglycan synthesis that occurs during sporulation in bacillus subtilis to examine the interactions between spove a nonessential sporulation specific homolog of the well conserved and essential seds shape elongation division and sporulation proteins and spovd a nonessential class b penicillin binding protein we found that localization of spovd is dependent on spove and that spovd protects spove from in vivo proteolysis co immunoprecipitations and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicated that spove and spovd interact and co affinity purification in escherichia coli demonstrated that this interaction is direct finally we generated a functional protein consisting of an spove  spovd fusion and found that a loss of function point mutation in either part of the fusion resulted in loss of function of the entire fusion that was not complemented by a wild type protein thus spove has a direct and functional interaction with spovd and this conclusion will facilitate understanding the essential function that spove and related seds proteins such as ftsw and roda play in bacterial growth and division
