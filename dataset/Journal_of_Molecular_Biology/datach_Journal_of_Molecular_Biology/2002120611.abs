differential affinity and cooperativity functions of the amino terminal  residues of  integrase
the site specific recombinase int of bacteriophage  is a heterobivalent dna binding protein that binds two different classes of dna binding sites within its recombination target sites the several functions of int are apportioned between a large carboxy terminal domain that cleaves and ligates dna at each of its four  core type  dna binding sites and a small amino terminal domain whose primary function is binding to each of its five  arm type  dna sites which are distant from the core region int bridges between the two classes of binding sites are facilitated by accessory dna bending proteins that along with int comprise higher order recombinogenic complexes we show here that although the  amino terminal residues of int bind efficiently to a single arm site this protein cannot form doubly bound complexes on adjacent arm sites however    int does show the same cooperative binding to adjacent arm sites as the full length protein we also found that   int specifies cooperative interactions with the accessory protein xis when the two are bound to their adjacent cognate sites p and x  respectively to complement the finding that these two amino terminal domain functions along with arm dna binding are all specified by residues     we determined that thr  is the first residue of the minimal carboxy terminal domain thereby identifying a specific interdomain linker region we have measured the affinity constants for int binding to each of the five arm sites and the cooperativity factors for int binding to the two pairs of adjacent arm sites and we have identified several dna structural features that contribute to the observed patterns of int binding to arm sites taken together the results highlight several interesting features of arm dna binding that invite speculation about additional levels of complexity in the regulation of  site specific recombination
