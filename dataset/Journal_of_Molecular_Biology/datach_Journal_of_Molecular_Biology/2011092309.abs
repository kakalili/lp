crystal structure of the archaeal asparagine synthetase interrelation with aspartyl trna and asparaginyl trna synthetases
asparagine synthetase a asna catalyzes asparagine synthesis using aspartate atp and ammonia as substrates asparagine is formed in two steps the  carboxylate group of aspartate is first activated by atp to form an aminoacyl amp before its amidation by a nucleophilic attack with an ammonium ion interestingly this mechanism of amino acid activation resembles that used by aminoacyl trna synthetases which first activate the  carboxylate group of the amino acid to form also an aminoacyl amp before they transfer the activated amino acid onto the cognate trna in a previous investigation we have shown that the open reading frame of pyrococcus abyssi annotated as asparaginyl trna synthetase asnrs  is in fact an archaeal asparagine synthetase a as ar that evolved from an ancestral aspartyl trna synthetase asprs  we present here the crystal structure of this as ar the fold of this protein is similar to that of bacterial asna and resembles the catalytic cores of asprs and asnrs the high resolution structures of as ar associated with its substrates and end products help to understand the reaction mechanism of asparagine formation and release a comparison of the catalytic core of as ar with those of archaeal asprs and asnrs and with that of bacterial asna reveals a strong conservation this study uncovers how the active site of the ancestral asprs rearranged throughout evolution to transform an enzyme activating the  carboxylate group into an enzyme that is able to activate the  carboxylate group of aspartate which can react with ammonia instead of trna
