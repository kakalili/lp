impact of mutations on the allosteric conformational equilibrium
allostery in a protein involves effector binding at an allosteric site that changes the structure and or dynamics at a distant functional site in addition to the chemical equilibrium of ligand binding allostery involves a conformational equilibrium between one protein substate that binds the effector and a second substate that less strongly binds the effector we run molecular dynamics simulations using simple smooth energy landscapes to sample specific ligand induced conformational transitions as defined by the effector bound and effector unbound protein structures these simulations can be performed using our web server http  salilab org allosmod  we then develop a set of features to analyze the simulations and capture the relevant thermodynamic properties of the allosteric conformational equilibrium these features are based on molecular mechanics energy functions stereochemical effects and structural dynamic coupling between sites using a machine learning algorithm on a data set of  proteins and   mutations we predict both the magnitude and the sign of the allosteric conformational equilibrium shift by the mutation the impact of a large identifiable fraction of the mutations can be predicted with an average unsigned error of kbt with similar accuracy we predict the mutation effects for an  th protein that was omitted from the initial training and testing of the machine learning algorithm we also assess which calculated thermodynamic properties contribute most to the accuracy of the prediction
