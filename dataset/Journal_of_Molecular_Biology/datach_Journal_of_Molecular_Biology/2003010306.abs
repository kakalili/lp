heat capacities and a snapshot of the energy landscape in protein gb from the pre denaturation temperature dependence of backbone nh nanosecond fluctuations
protein stability is usually characterized calorimetrically by a melting temperature and related thermodynamic parameters despite its importance the microscopic origin of the melting transition and the relationship between thermodynamic stability and dynamics remains a mystery here nmr relaxation parameters were acquired for backbone  nh groups of the  residue immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein g over a pre denaturation temperature range of     c relaxation data were analyzed using three methods the standard three lorentzian model free approach the f    j   spectral density approach that yields motional correlation time distributions and a new approach that determines frequency dependent order parameters regardless of the method of analysis the temperature dependence of internal motional correlation times and order parameters is essentially the same nanosecond time scale internal motions are found for all nhs in the protein and their temperature dependence yields activation energies ranging up to about  kj molresidue nh motional barrier heights are structurally correlated with the largest energy barriers being found for residues in the most  rigid  segments of the fold   strands  and  and the  helix trends in this landscape also parallel the free energy of folding  unfolding derived from hydrogen  deuterium h  d exchange measurements indicating that the energetics for internal motions occurring on the nanosecond time scale mirror those occurring on the much slower time scale of h  d exchange residual heat capacities derived from the temperature dependence of order parameters range from near zero to near  j molkresidue and correlate with this energy landscape these results provide a unique picture of this protein s energy landscape and a relationship between thermodynamic stability and dynamics that suggests thermosensitive regions in the fold that could initiate the melting process
