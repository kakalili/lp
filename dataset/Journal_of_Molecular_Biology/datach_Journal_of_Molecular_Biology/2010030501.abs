trpm activates m calpain by stress dependent stimulation of p  mapk and c jun n terminal kinase
trpm is a ca  permeant and mg  permeant ion channel in possession of its own kinase domain in a previous study we showed that overexpression of the channel kinase in hek   cells produced cell rounding and loss of adhesion which was dependent on the ca  dependent protease m calpain the trpm elicited change in cell morphology was channel dependent and occurred without any significant increase in cytosolic ca  here we demonstrate that overexpression of trpm increased levels of cellular reactive oxygen species ros and nitric oxide causing the activation of p  mitogen activated protein kinase mapk and c jun n terminal kinase jnk  application of inhibitors of p  mapk and jnk blocked trpm induced cell rounding and activation of m calpain without affecting the phosphorylation state of the protease overexpression of trpm increased intracellular mg  however when the concentration of either external ca  or mg  was increased to favor the permeation of one divalent cation over the other a similar increase in cell rounding and calpain activity was detected indicating that trpm mediated activation of m calpain is not dependent on the nature of the divalent conducted by the channel application of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and mitochondrial derived ros reduced trpm induced increases in nitric oxide and ros production blocked the change in cell morphology and reduced cellular calpain activity collectively our data reveal that excessive trpm channel activity causes oxidative and nitrosative stresses producing cell rounding mediated by p  mapk jnk dependent activation of m calpain
