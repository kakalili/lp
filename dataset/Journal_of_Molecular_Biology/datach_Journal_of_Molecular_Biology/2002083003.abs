crystal structure and anion binding in the prokaryotic hydrogenase maturation factor hypf acylphosphatase like domain
nife hydrogenases require a set of complementary and regulatory proteins for correct folding and maturation processes one of the essential regulatory proteins hypf  kda contains a n terminal acylphosphatase act like domain a sequence motif shared with enzymes catalyzing o carbamoylation and two zinc finger motifs similar to those found in the dnaj chaperone the hypf acylphosphatase domain is thought to support the conversion of carbamoylphosphate into co and cn   promoting coordination of these ligands to the hydrogenase metal cluster it has been shown recently that the hypf n terminal domain can aggregate in vitro to yield fibrils matching those formed by proteins linked to amyloid diseases the    resolution hypf acylphosphatase domain crystal structure residues     r factor    shows a domain fold of       topology as observed in mammalian acylphosphatases specifically catalyzing the hydrolysis of the carboxyl  phosphate bonds in acylphosphates the hypf n terminal domain can be assigned to the ferredoxin structural superfamily to which rna binding domains of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and some metallochaperone proteins belong additionally the hypf n terminal domain displays an intriguing structural relationship to the recently discovered act domains the structures of different hypf acylphosphatase domain complexes show a phosphate binding cradle comparable to the p loop observed in unrelated phosphatase families on the basis of the catalytic mechanism proposed for acylphosphatases whereby residues arg  and asn  would support substrate orientation and the nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the phosphate group fine structural features of the hypf n terminal domain putative active site region may account for the lack of acylphosphatase activity observed for the expressed domain the crystallographic analyses here reported were undertaken to shed light on the molecular bases of inactivity folding misfolding and aggregation of the hypf n terminal acylphosphatase domain
