mechanical design of the first proximal ig domain of human cardiac titin revealed by single molecule force spectroscopy
the elastic i band part of muscle protein titin contains two tandem immunoglobulin ig domain regions of distinct mechanical properties until recently the only known structure was that of the i  module of the distal region whose mechanical properties have been reported in detail recently the structure of the first proximal domain i  has been resolved at    in addition to the characteristic  sandwich structure of all titin ig domains the crystal structure of i showed an internal disulfide bridge that was proposed to modulate its mechanical extensibility in vivo here we use single molecule force spectroscopy and protein engineering to examine the mechanical architecture of this domain in contrast to the predictions made from the x ray crystal structure we find that the formation of a disulfide bridge in i is a relatively rare event in solution even under oxidative conditions furthermore our studies of the mechanical stability of i modules engineered with point mutations reveal significant differences between the mechanical unfolding of the i and i  modules our study illustrates the varying mechanical architectures of the titin ig modules
