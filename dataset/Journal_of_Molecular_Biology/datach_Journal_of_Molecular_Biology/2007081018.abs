jab mediates protein degradation of the rad rad hus checkpoint complex
the rad rad hus     complex serves a dual role as a dna damage sensor in checkpoint signaling and as a mediator in the dna repair pathway however the intercellular mechanisms that regulate the    complex are poorly understood jab  the fifth component of the cop signalosome complex has a central role in the degradation of multiple proteins and is emerging as an important regulator in cancer development here we tested the hypothesis that jab controls the protein stability of the    complex via the proteosome pathway we provide evidence that jab physically associates with the    complex and show that this association is mediated through direct interaction between jab and rad  one of the subunits of the    complex importantly jab causes translocation of the    complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm mediating rapid degradation of the    complex via the  s proteasome furthermore jab significantly suppresses checkpoint signaling activation dna synthesis recovery from blockage and cell viability after replication stresses such as uv exposure   radiation and treatment with hydroxyurea these results suggest that jab is an important regulator for the stability of protein    control in cells which may provide novel information on the involvement of jab in the checkpoint and dna repair signaling in response to dna damage
