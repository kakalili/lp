protein  protein docking with backbone flexibility
computational protein  protein docking methods currently can create models with atomic accuracy for protein complexes provided that the conformational changes upon association are restricted to the side chains however it remains very challenging to account for backbone conformational changes during docking and most current methods inherently keep monomer backbones rigid for algorithmic simplicity and computational efficiency here we present a reformulation of the rosetta docking method that incorporates explicit backbone flexibility in protein  protein docking the new method is based on a  fold tree  representation of the molecular system which seamlessly integrates internal torsional degrees of freedom and rigid body degrees of freedom problems with internal flexible regions ranging from one or more loops or hinge regions to all of one or both partners can be readily treated using appropriately constructed fold trees the explicit treatment of backbone flexibility improves both sampling in the vicinity of the native docked conformation and the energetic discrimination between near native and incorrect models
