Amyloid fibrils are ordered polymers in which constituent polypeptides adopt a non-native fold. Despite their importance in degenerative human diseases, the overall structure of amyloid fibrils remains unknown. High-resolution studies of model peptide assemblies have identified residues forming cross-β-strands and have revealed some details of local β-strand packing. However, little is known about the assembly contacts that define the fibril architecture. Here we present a set of three-dimensional structures of amyloid fibrils formed from full-length β2-microglobulin, a 99-residue protein involved in clinical amyloidosis. Our cryo-electron microscopy maps reveal a hierarchical fibril structure built from tetrameric units of globular density, with at least three different subunit interfaces in this homopolymeric assembly. These findings suggest a more complex superstructure for amyloid than hitherto suspected and prompt a re-evaluation of the defining features of the amyloid fold.
