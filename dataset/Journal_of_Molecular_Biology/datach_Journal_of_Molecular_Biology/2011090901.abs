the molecular basis of the caskin and mint interaction with cask
calcium calmodulin dependent serine protein kinase cask is a conserved multi domain scaffolding protein involved in brain development synapse formation and establishment of cell polarity to accomplish these diverse functions cask participates in numerous protein  protein interactions in particular cask forms competing cask mint velis and cask caskin velis tripartite complexes that physically associate with the cytoplasmic tail of neurexin a transmembrane protein enriched at presynaptic sites this study shows that a short linear eeiwvlrk peptide motif from caskin is necessary and sufficient for binding cask we also identified the conserved binding site for the peptide on the cask calmodulin kinase domain a related epiwvmrq peptide from mint was also discovered to be sufficient for binding searching all human proteins for the mint caskin consensus peptide exiwvxr revealed that t cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis  tiam  contains a conserved eeviwvrre peptide that was also found to be sufficient for cask binding in vitro tiam is well known for its role in tumor metastasis but it also possesses overlapping cellular and neurological functions with cask suggesting a previously unknown cooperation between the two proteins this new peptide interaction motif also explains how caskin and mint form competing complexes and suggests a new role for the cellular hub protein cask
