The Ewing sarcoma (EWS) protein is a member of a large family of RNA-binding proteins. Chimeric EWS oncoproteins generated by chromosomal translocations between the EWS protein and several transcription factors cause various malignant tumors. Due to its multifunctional properties, the EWS protein is involved in such processes as meiotic DNA pairing/recombination, cellular senescence, gene expression, RNA processing and transport, and cell signaling. The EWS protein is predominantly located in the nucleus. It was found in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane. In this study, analysis of the localization of endogenous and fluorescently labeled recombinant EWS protein in different phases of the cell cycle in different cell lines revealed a very dynamic subcellular distribution of the EWS protein. In Cos7 and HeLa cells, an association of the EWS protein with the centrosomal compartments was shown. Furthermore, in HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 (T) cells, an interaction of the overexpressed recombinant EWS-yellow fluorescent protein fusion protein with microtubules, leading to their stabilization and cell cycle arrest, was demonstrated. As an outlook, the present findings provide an important insight into temporally and spatially regulated functions of the EWS protein and, particularly, into its role in the regulation of the cell cycle and possibly cell differentiation.
