SQUAMOSA promoter binding proteins (SBPs) form a major family of plant-specific transcription factors related to flower development. Although SBPs are heterogeneous in primary structure, they share a highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that has been suggested to be zinc binding. Here we report the NMR solution structures of DBDs of two SBPs of Arabidopsis thaliana, SPL4 and SPL7. The two share essentially the same structural features. Each structure contains two zinc-binding sites consisting of eight Cys or His residues in a Cys3HisCys2HisCys or Cys6HisCys sequence motif in which the first four residues coordinate to one zinc and the last four coordinate to the other. These structures are dissimilar to other known zinc-binding structures, and thus represent a novel type of zinc-binding motif. The electrostatic profile on the surface suggested that a continuous region, including all the conserved basic residues, is involved in the DNA binding, the mode of which is likely to be novel as well.
