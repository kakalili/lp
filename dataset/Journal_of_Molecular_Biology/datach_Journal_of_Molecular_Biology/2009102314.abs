a mechanism for histone chaperoning activity of nucleoplasmin thermodynamic and structural models
nucleoplasmin np  a histone chaperone acts as a reservoir for histones h a  h b in xenopus laevis eggs and can displace sperm nuclear basic proteins and linker histones from the chromatin fiber of sperm and quiescent somatic nuclei np has been proposed to mediate the dynamic exchange of histones during the expression of certain genes and assists the assembly of nucleosomes by modulating the interaction between histones and dna here solution structural models of full length np and np complexes with the functionally distinct nucleosomal core and linker histones are presented for the first time providing a picture of the physical interactions between the nucleosomal and linker histones with np core and tail domains small angle x ray scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry reveal that np pentamer can accommodate five histones either h a  h b dimers or h  and that np core and tail domains are intimately involved in the association with histones the analysis of the binding events employing a site specific cooperative model reveals a negative cooperativity based regulatory mechanism for the linker histone nucleosomal histone exchange the two histone types bind with drastically different intrinsic affinity and the strongest affinity is observed for the np variant that mimicks the hyperphosphorylated active protein the different  affinity windows  for h and h a  h b might allow np to fulfill its histone chaperone role simultaneously acting as a reservoir for the core histones and a chromatin decondensing factor our data are compatible with the previously proposed model where np facilitates nucleosome assembly by removing the linker histones and depositing h a  h b dimers onto dna
