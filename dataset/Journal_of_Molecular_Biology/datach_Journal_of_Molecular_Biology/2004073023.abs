seca folding kinetics a large dimeric protein rapidly forms multiple native states
seca a   kda dimeric protein is the atpase for the sec dependent translocase of precursor proteins in vivo seca must undergo conformational changes which may involve dissociation into a monomer as it translocates the precursor protein across the inner membrane to better understand the dynamics of seca in vivo protein folding studies to probe the native intermediate and unfolded species of seca in vitro have been done seca folds through a stable dimeric intermediate and dimerizes in the dead time of a manual mixing kinetic experiment      seconds  here stopped flow fluorescence and cd as well as ultra rapid continuous flow fluorescence techniques were used to further probe the rapid folding kinetics of seca in the absence of urea rapid near diffusion limited    m  s   seca dimerization occurs following a rate limiting unimolecular rearrangement of a rapidly formed intermediate multiple kinetic folding and unfolding phases were observed and seca was shown to have multiple native and unfolded states using sequential mixing stopped flow experiments seca was determined to fold via parallel channels with sequential intermediates these results confirm that seca is a highly dynamic protein consistent with the rapid major conformational changes it must undergo in vivo
