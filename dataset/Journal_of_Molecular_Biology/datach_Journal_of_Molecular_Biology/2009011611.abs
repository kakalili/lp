evidence for a tyrosine  adenine stacking interaction and for a short lived open intermediate subsequent to initial binding of escherichia coli rna polymerase to promoter dna
bacterial rna polymerase and a  sigma  transcription factor form an initiation competent  open  complex at a promoter by disruption of about  base pairs strand separation is likely initiated at the highly conserved    a  t base pair amino acids in conserved region   of the main escherichia coli sigma factor    are involved in this process but their roles are unclear to monitor the fates of particular bases upon addition of rna polymerase promoters bearing single substitutions of the fluorescent a analog  aminopurine  ap at    and two other positions in promoter dna were examined evidence was obtained for an open intermediate on the pathway to open complex formation in which these  aps are no longer stacked onto their neighboring bases the tyrosine at residue   in region   of   was shown to be involved in quenching the fluorescence of a  ap substituted at    presumably through a stacking interaction these data refine the structural model for open complex formation and reveal a novel interaction involved in dna melting by rna polymerase
