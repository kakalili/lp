crystallographically mapped ligand binding differs in high and low ige binding isoforms of birch pollen allergen bet v
the ability of pathogenesis related proteins of family  to bind a broad spectrum of ligands is considered to play a key role for their physiological and pathological functions in particular bet v  an archetypical allergen from birch pollen is described as a highly promiscuous ligand acceptor however the detailed recognition mechanisms including specificity factors discriminating binding properties of naturally occurring bet v  variants are poorly understood here we report crystal structures of bet v  variants in complex with an array of ligands at a resolution of up to     residue  within the hydrophobic pocket not only discriminates in high and low ige binding bet v  isoforms but also induces a drastic change in the binding mode of the model ligand deoxycholate ternary crystal structure complexes of bet v  with several ligands together with the fluorogenic reporter  anilino  naphthalene sulfonate explain anomalous fluorescence binding curves obtained from  anilino  naphthalene sulfonate displacement assays the structures reveal key interaction residues such as tyr  and rationalize both the binding specificity and promiscuity of the so called hydrophobic pocket in bet v  the intermolecular interactions of bet v  reveal an unexpected complexity that will be indispensable to fully understand its roles within the physiological and allergenic context
