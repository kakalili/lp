ensemble modulation as an origin of denaturant independent hydrogen exchange in proteins edited by i wilson
native state hydrogen exchange hx has become a powerful tool for the analysis of conformational states that exist under native conditions however the interpretation of hx data in terms of conformational fluctuations is still controversial in particular it has been shown that many residues display exchange behavior that is independent of denaturant concentration it has been postulated that this lack of denaturant dependence results from local fluctuations that do not expose appreciable amounts of buried surface area here we use a general thermodynamic description of hx to explore the different possibilities for this behavior we find that the denaturant dependence seen in hx experiments under native conditions is not a de facto indication of the amount of surface area exposure required for exchange instead this behavior results from the relatively homogenous character of the conformational ensemble that exists under native conditions and the non specific nature of denaturant effects furthermore a comparison of the hx behavior from a stabilized mutant of staphylococcal nuclease snase with that predicted for the wild type snase from the corex algorithm suggests that denaturant independent exchange of many residues is consistent with significant      surface area exposure for this protein
