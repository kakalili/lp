use of a new label  c   o in the determination of a structural model of phospholamban in a lipid bilayer spatial restraints resolve the ambiguity arising from interpretations of mutagenesis data
a structural model of pentameric phospholamban plb in a lipid bilayer has been derived using a combination of experimental data obtained from atr ftir site directed dichroism and the implementation of the resulting restraints during a molecular dynamics simulation plb residues    has been synthesised incorporating a new label   c   o at residues  and   we have not only determined the tilt of the helices       but also the relative orientation of the transmembrane segments with an  angle of        for l  this angle is taken as zero in the direction of the helix tilt plb is a simple test case where site directed dichroism has been applied to resolve the indeterminacy arising from the mutagenesis data available the results presented point specifically to a single structural model for plb
