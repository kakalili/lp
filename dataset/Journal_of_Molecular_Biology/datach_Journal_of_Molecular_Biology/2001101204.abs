structure of a variant of lac repressor with increased thermostability and decreased affinity for operator edited by d rees
a single amino acid substitution k l in the escherichia coli lac repressor produces a protein that has substantially increased stability compared to wild type however despite the increased stability this altered tetrameric repressor has a tenfold reduced affinity for operator and greatly decreased rate constants of inducer binding as well as a reduced phenotypic response to inducer in vivo to understand the dramatic increase in stability and altered functional properties we have determined the x ray crystal structures of a dimeric repressor with and without the k l substitution at resolutions of   and     respectively in the wild type dimer k    lys  forms electrostatic interactions at the monomer monomer interface and is partially exposed to solvent in the k l  substituted protein there is reorientation of the n subdomains which allows the leucine to become deeply buried at the monomer monomer interface this reorientation of the n subdomains in turn results in an alteration of hydrogen bonding ion pairing and van der waals interactions at the monomer monomer interface the lysine residue at position  appears to exert its key effects by destabilizing the  optimal  conformation of the repressor effectively loosening the dimer interface and allowing the repressor to adopt the conformations necessary to function as a molecular switch
