the zn position in metallo  lactamases is critical for activity a study on chimeric metal sites on a conserved protein scaffold
metallo  lactamases m ls are bacterial zn ii dependent hydrolases that confer broad spectrum resistance to  lactam antibiotics these enzymes can be subdivided into three subclasses b  b and b  that differ in their metal binding sites and their characteristic tertiary structure to date there are no clinically useful pan m l inhibitors available mainly due to the unawareness of key catalytic features common to all m l brands here we have designed expressed and characterized two double mutants of bcii a di zn ii b m l from bacillus cereus namely bcii r  h c  d bcii hd and bcii r  h c  s bcii hs  these mutants display modified environments at the so called zn site or dch site reproducing the metal coordination environments of structurally related metallohydrolases through a combination of structural and functional studies we found that bcii hd is an impaired  lactamase even as a di zn ii enzyme whereas bcii hs exhibits the ability to exist as mono or di zn ii species in solution with different catalytic performances we show that these effects result from an altered position of zn  which is incapable of providing a productive interaction with the substrate  lactam ring these results indicate that the position of zn is essential for a productive substrate binding and hydrolysis
