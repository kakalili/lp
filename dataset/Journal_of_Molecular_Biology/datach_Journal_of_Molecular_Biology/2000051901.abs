local and long range interactions in the molten globule state a study of chimeric proteins of bovine and human  lactalbumin edited by c r matthews
the molten globule state of  lactalbumin has ordered secondary structure in the  domain which comprises residues  to  and  to   in order to investigate which part of a polypeptide is important for stabilizing the molten globule state of  lactalbumin we have produced and studied three chimeric proteins of bovine and human  lactalbumin the stability of the molten globule state formed by domain exchanged  lactalbumin in which the amino acid sequence in the  domain comes from human  lactalbumin and that in the  domain comes from bovine  lactalbumin is the same as that of human  lactalbumin and is substantially greater than that of bovine  lactalbumin therefore our results show that the stability of the molten globule state of  lactalbumin is determined by the  domain and the  domain is not important for stabilizing the molten globule state the substitution of residues  to  of bovine  lactalbumin with those of human  lactalbumin substantially increases the stability of the molten globule state while the substitution of residues  to   of bovine  lactalbumin with those of human  lactalbumin decreases the stability of the molten globule state therefore residues  to  in human  lactalbumin is more important for the stability of the human  lactalbumin molten globule state than residues  to   the stabilization of the molten globule state due to substitution of both residues  to  and  to   is not identical with the sum of the two individual substitutions demonstrating the non additivity of the stabilization of the molten globule state this result indicates that there is a long range interaction between residues  to  and  to   in the molten globule state of human  lactalbumin the differences in the stabilities of the molten globule states are well correlated with the averaged helical propensity values in the  domain when the long range interactions are negligible suggesting that the local interaction is the dominant term for determining the stability of the molten globule state our results also indicate that the apparent cooperativity is closely linked to the stability of the molten globule state even if the molten globule state is weakly cooperative
