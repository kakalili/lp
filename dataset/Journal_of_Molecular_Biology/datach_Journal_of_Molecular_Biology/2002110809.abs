simulation of folding of a small alpha helical protein in atomistic detail using worldwide distributed computing
by employing thousands of pcs and new worldwide distributed computing techniques we have simulated in atomistic detail the folding of a fast folding  residue  helical protein from the villin headpiece the total simulated time exceeds   s orders of magnitude more than previous simulations of a molecule of this size starting from an extended state we obtained an ensemble of folded structures which is on average    and    away from the native state in c  distance based root mean square deviation drms and c  drms sense respectively the folding mechanism of villin is most consistent with the hydrophobic collapse view of folding the molecule collapses non specifically very quickly    ns  which greatly reduces the size of the conformational space that needs to be explored in search of the native state the conformational search in the collapsed state appears to be rate limited by the formation of the aromatic core in a significant fraction of our simulations the c terminal phenylalanine residue packs improperly with the rest of the hydrophobic core we suggest that the breaking of this interaction may be the rate determining step in the course of folding on the basis of our simulations we estimate the folding rate of villin to be approximately  s by analyzing the average features of the folded ensemble obtained by simulation we see that the mean folded structure is more similar to the native fold than any individual folded structure this finding highlights the need for simulating ensembles of molecules and averaging the results in an experiment like fashion if meaningful comparison between simulation and experiment is to be attempted moreover our results demonstrate that   the computational methodology exists to simulate the multi microsecond regime using distributed computing and   that potential sets used to describe interatomic interactions may be sufficiently accurate to reach the folded state at least for small proteins we conclude with a comparison between our results and current protein folding theory
