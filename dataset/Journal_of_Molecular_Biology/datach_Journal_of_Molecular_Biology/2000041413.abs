divergence in macromolecular assembly x ray crystallographic structure analysis of lumazine synthase from brucella abortus edited by r huber
we have determined the three dimensional structure of   dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase lumazine synthase from brucella abortus the infectious organism of the disease brucellosis in animals this enzyme catalyses the formation of   dimethyl  ribityllumazine the penultimate product in the synthesis of riboflavin the three dimensional x ray crystal structure of the enzyme from b abortus has been solved and refined at    resolution to a final r value of    rfree    the macromolecular assembly of the enzyme differs from that of the enzyme from bacillus subtilis the only other lumazine synthase structure known while the protein from b subtilis assembles into a  subunit icosahedral capsid built from  pentameric units the enzyme from b abortus is pentameric in its crystalline form nonetheless the active sites of the two enzymes are virtually identical indicating inhibitors to theses enzymes could be effective pharmaceuticals across a broad species range furthermore we compare the structures of the enzyme from b subtilis and b abortus and describe the c teminus structure which accounts for the differences in quaternary structure
