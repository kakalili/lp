drug recognition and stabilisation of the parallel stranded dna quadruplex d ttagggt  containing the human telomeric repeat
the nmr structure of the parallel stranded dna quadruplex d ttagggt  containing the human telomeric repeat has been determined in solution in complex with a fluorinated pentacyclic quino    kl acridinium cation rhps  rhps has been identified as a potent inhibitor of telomerase at submicromolar levels ic  value of        m  exhibiting a wide differential between telomerase inhibition and acute cellular toxicity all of the data point to rhps exerting its chemotherapeutic potency through interaction with and stabilisation of four stranded g quadruplex structures rhps forms a dynamic interaction with d ttagggt  as evident from h and  f linewidths with fast exchange between binding sites induced at   k perturbations to dna chemical shifts and  intermolecular nuclear overhauser effects noes identify the   apg and   gpt steps as the principle intercalation sites a structural model has been refined using noe restrained molecular dynamics the central g tetrad core remains intact with drug molecules stacking at the ends of the g quadruplex the partial positive charge on position  n of the acridine ring appears to act as a  pseudo  potassium ion and is positioned above the centre of the g tetrad in the region of high negative charge density in both apg and gpt intercalation sites the drug is seen to converge to the same orientation in which the  system of the drug overlaps primarily with two bases of each g tetrad the drug is held in place by stacking interactions with the g tetrads however there is some evidence for a more dynamic weakly stabilised a tetrad that stacks partially on top of the drug at the   end of the sequence together the interactions of rhps increase the tm of the quadruplex by     c there is no evidence for drug intercalation within the g quadruplex however the structural model strongly supports end stacking interactions with the terminal g tetrads
