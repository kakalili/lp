hiv  protease dimer interface mutations that compensate for viral reverse transcriptase instability in infectious virions
mature enzymes encoded within the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genome protease pr  reverse transcriptase rt and integrase in  derive from proteolytic processing of a large polyprotein gag pol  gag pol processing is catalyzed by the viral pr which is active as a homodimer the hiv  rt functions as a heterodimer p  p  composed of subunits of   and   amino acid residues respectively both subunits have identical amino acid sequence but p  lacks   residues that are removed by the hiv  pr during viral maturation while p  is the catalytic subunit p  has a primarily structural role amino acid substitutions affecting the stability of p  p  i e f  w have a deleterious effect on viral fitness previously we showed that the effects of f  w are mediated by p  and can be compensated by mutation t s while studying the dynamics of emergence of the compensatory mutation we observed that mutations in the viral pr coding region were selected in hiv clones containing the rt substitution f  w before the imposition of t s f  w mutations the pr mutations identified g s and t s improved the replication capacity of the f  w mutant virus by using a trans complementation assay we demonstrate that the loss of p  p  heterodimer stability caused by trp  can be attributed to an increased susceptibility of rt to viral pr degradation recombinant hiv  prs bearing mutations g s or t s showed decreased dimer stability and reduced catalytic efficiency these results were consistent with crystallographic data showing the location of both residues in the pr dimerization interface
