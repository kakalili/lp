gold nanoparticles coated with oligomannosides of hiv  glycoprotein gp  mimic the carbohydrate epitope of antibody g
after three decades of research an effective vaccine against the pandemic aids caused by human immunodeficiency virus hiv is not still available and a deeper understanding of hiv immunology as well as new chemical tools that may contribute to improve the currently available arsenal against the virus is highly wanted among the few broadly neutralizing human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  monoclonal antibodies  g  is the only carbohydrate directed one  g  recognizes a cluster of high mannose glycans on the viral envelope glycoprotein gp   this type of glycan has thus been envisaged as a target to develop an hiv vaccine that is capable of eliciting g  like antibodies herein we show that gold nanoparticles coated with self assembled monolayers of synthetic oligomannosides manno gold glyconanoparticles gnps  which are present in gp   are able to bind g  with high affinity and to interfere with g  gp  binding as determined by surface plasmon resonance and saturation transfer difference nmr spectroscopy cellular neutralization assays demonstrated that gnps coated with a linear tetramannoside could block the g  mediated neutralization of a replication competent virus under conditions that resemble the ones in which normal serum prevents infection of the target cell dispersibility in water and physiological media absence of cytotoxicity and the possibility of inserting more than one component into the same nanoparticle make manno gnps versatile polyvalent and multifunctional systems that may aid efforts to develop new multifaceted strategies against hiv
