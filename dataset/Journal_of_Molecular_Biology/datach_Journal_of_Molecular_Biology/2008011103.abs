structures of mutants of cellulase cel f of clostridium cellulolyticum in complex with long hemithiocellooligosaccharides give rise to a new view of the substrate pathway during processive action
an efficient breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass is a prerequisite for the production of second generation biofuels cellulases are key enzymes in this process we crystallized complexes between hemithio cello deca and dodecaoses and the inactive mutants e q and e q of the endo processive cellulase cel f one of the most abundant cellulases in cellulosomes from clostridium cellulolyticum to elucidate its processive mechanism in both complexes the cellooligosaccharides occupy similar positions in the tunnel part of the active site but are more or less buried into the cleft which hosts the active site in the e q complex it proceeds along the upper part of the cavity while it occupies in the e q complex the same productive binding subsites in the lower part of the cavity that have previously been reported in cel f cellooligosaccharide complexes in both cases the sugar moieties are stabilized by stacking interactions with aromatic side chains and h bonds the upper pathway is gated by tyr   which blocks its access in the e q complex and offers a new stacking interaction in the e q complex the new structural data give rise to the hypothesis of a two step mechanism in which processive action and chain disruption occupy different subsites at the end of their trajectory in the first part of the mechanism the chain may smoothly slide up to the leaving group site along the upper pathway while in the second part the chain is cleaved in the already described productive binding position located in the lower pathway the solved native structure of cel f without any bound sugar in the active site confirms the two side chain orientations of the proton donor glu  as observed in the complex structures
