genome wide nuclear morphology screen identifies novel genes involved in nuclear architecture and gene silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae
organisation of the cell nucleus is crucial for the regulation of gene expression but little is known about how nuclei are structured to address this issue we designed a genomic screen to identify factors involved in nuclear architecture in saccharomyces cerevisiae this screen is based on microscopic monitoring of nuclear pore complexes and nucleolar proteins fused with the green fluorescent protein in a collection of approximately   individual deletion mutants among the  genes identified by this screen most affect both the nuclear envelope and the nucleolar morphology corresponding gene products are localised preferentially to the nucleus or close to the nuclear periphery interestingly these nuclear morphology alterations were associated with chromatin silencing defects these genes provide a molecular context to explore the functional link between nuclear architecture and gene silencing
