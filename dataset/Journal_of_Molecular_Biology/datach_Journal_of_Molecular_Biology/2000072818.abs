electron microscopy and subunit subunit interaction studies reveal a first architecture of cop signalosome edited by m f moody
the cop signalosome is involved in signal transduction whereas the  s proteasome lid is a regulatory subcomplex of the  s proteasome responsible for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins cop signalosome and lid possess significant sequence homologies among their eight core subunits and are likely derived from a common ancestor surprisingly from our two dimensional electron microscopy data a common architectural plan for the two complexes could not be deduced none the less the two particles have structural features in common both cop signalosome and lid lack any symmetry in subunit arrangement and exhibit a central groove possibly qualified for scaffolding functions filter binding assays with recombinant cop signalosome components revealed a multitude of subunit subunit interactions supporting the asymmetrical appearance of the complex in electron microscopy on the basis of two dimensional images and subunit interaction studies a first architectural model of cop signalosome was created the fact that four distinct classes of particle views were identified and that only   of the selected particles could be classified indicates a high degree of heterogeneity in electron microscopic images different orientations with respect to the viewing axis and conformational variety presumably due to different grades of phosphorylation are possible reasons for the heterogeneous appearance of the complex our biochemical data show that recombinant cop signalosome subunits  and  are phosphorylated by the associated kinase activity the modification of cop signalosome subunit  might be essential for c jun phosphorylation dephosphorylation does not inactivate the associated kinase activity although substrate phosphorylation by cop signalosome is significantly decreased by lambda protein phosphatase treatment   autophosphorylation  is increased
