thermodynamic penalty arising from burial of a ligand polar group within a hydrophobic pocket of a protein receptor
here we examine the thermodynamic penalty arising from burial of a polar group in a hydrophobic pocket that forms part of the binding site of the major urinary protein mup i  x ray crystal structures of the complexes of octanol nonanol and   octan diol indicate that these ligands bind with similar orientations in the binding pocket each complex is characterised by a bridging water molecule between the hydroxyl group of tyr  and the hydroxyl group of each ligand the additional hydroxyl group of   octan diol is thereby forced to reside in a hydrophobic pocket and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicate that this is accompanied by a standard free energy penalty of   kj mol with respect to octanol and   kj mol with respect to nonanol consideration of the solvation thermodynamics of each ligand enables the  intrinsic   solute  solute interaction energy to be determined which indicates a favourable enthalpic component and an entropic component that is small or zero these data indicate that the thermodynamic penalty to binding derived from the unfavourable desolvation of   octan diol is partially offset by a favourable intrinsic contribution quantum chemical calculations suggest that this latter contribution derives from favourable solute  solute dispersion interactions
