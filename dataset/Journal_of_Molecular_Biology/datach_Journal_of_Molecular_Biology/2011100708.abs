nanornas a class of small rnas that can prime transcription initiation in bacteria
it has been widely assumed that all transcription in cells occur using ntps only i e  de novo  however it has been known for several decades that both prokaryotic and eukaryotic rna polymerases can utilize small  to    nt rnas to prime transcription initiation in vitro raising the possibility that small rnas might also prime transcription initiation in vivo a new study by goldman et al has now provided the first evidence that priming with so called  nanornas   i e   to   nt rnas can in fact occur in vivo furthermore this study provides evidence that altering the extent of nanorna mediated priming of transcription initiation can profoundly influence global gene expression in this perspective we summarize the findings of goldman et al and discuss the prospect that nanorna mediated priming of transcription initiation represents an underappreciated aspect of gene expression in vivo
