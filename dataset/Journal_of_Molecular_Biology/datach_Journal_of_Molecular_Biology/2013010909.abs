unfolding of the c terminal domain of the j protein zuo releases autoinhibition and activates pdr dependent transcription
the c terminal  residues of the j protein zuo are sufficient to activate pdr  a transcription factor involved in both pleiotropic drug resistance and growth control little is understood about the pathway of activation by this primarily ribosome associated hsp  co chaperone here we report that only the c terminal  residues of zuo are required for activation of pdr  with hydrophobic residues being critical for activity two hybrid interaction experiments suggest that the interaction between this  residue zuo peptide and pdr is direct analogous to the activation of pdr by xenobiotics however simply dissociation of zuo from the ribosome is not sufficient for induction of pdr transcriptional activity as the c terminal  residues of zuo fold into an autoinhibitory left handed four helix bundle hydrophobic residues critical for interaction with pdr are sequestered within the structure of this c terminal domain ctd  necessitating unfolding for activation thus although expression of the ctd does not result in activation alterations that destabilize the structure cause induction of pleiotropic drug resistance these destabilizing alterations also result in dissociation of the full length protein from the ribosome thus our results are consistent with an activation pathway in which unfolding of zuo s c terminal helical bundle domain results in ribosome dissociation followed by activation of pdr via a direct interaction
