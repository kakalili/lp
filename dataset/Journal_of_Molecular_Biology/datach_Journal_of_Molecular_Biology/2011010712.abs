high resolution crystal structures of trimeric and rod phycocyanin
the phycobilisome light harvesting antenna in cyanobacteria and red algae is assembled from two substructures a central core composed of allophycocyanin surrounded by rods that always contain phycocyanin pc  unpigmented proteins called linkers are also found within the rods and core we present here two new structures of pc from the thermophilic cyanobacterium thermosynechococcus vulcanus we have determined the structure of trimeric pc to      the highest resolution reported to date for this protein we also present a structure of pc isolated in its intact and functional rod form at     analysis of rod crystals showed that in addition to the  and  pc subunit there were three linker proteins the capping rod linker lr   the rod linker lr  and only one of three rod  core linkers lrc cpcg  with a stoichiometry of       this ratio indicates that the crystals contained rods composed of two hexamers the crystallographic parameters of the rod crystals are nearly identical with that of the trimeric form indicating that the linkers do not affect crystal packing and are completely embedded within the rod cavities absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were red shifted as expected for assembled rods and this could be shown for the rod in solution as well as in crystal using confocal fluorescence microscopy the crystal packing imparts superimposition of the three rod linkers canceling out their electron density however analysis of b factors and the conformations of residues facing the rod channel indicate the presence of linkers based on the experimental evidence presented here and a homology based model of the lr protein we suggest that the linkers do not in fact link between rod hexamers but stabilize the hexameric assembly and modify rod energy absorption and transfer capabilities
