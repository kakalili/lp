bovine pancreatic polypeptide bpp undergoes significant changes in conformation and dynamics upon binding to dpc micelles
the pancreatic polypeptide pp  a  residue c terminally amidated polypeptide hormone is a member of the neuropeptide y npy family here we have studied the structure and dynamics of bovine pancreatic polypeptide bpp when bound to dpc micelles as a membrane mimicking model as well as the dynamics of bpp in solution the comparison of structure and dynamics of bpp in both states reveals remarkable differences the overall correlation time of   ns derived from the  n relaxation data proves unambiguously that bpp in solution exists as a dimer therein intermolecular as well as intramolecular hydrophobic interactions from residues of both the amphiphilic helix and of the back folded n terminus contribute to the stability of the pp fold the overall rigidity is well reflected in positive values for the heteronuclear noe for residues    the membrane bound species displays a partitioning into a more flexible n terminal region and a well defined  helical region comprising residues     the average rmsd value for residues     is         the flexibility of the n terminus is compatible with negative values of the heteronuclear noe observed for the n terminal residues    and low values of the generalized order parameter s  the membrane  peptide interface was investigated by micelle integrating spin labels and h h exchange measurements it is formed by those residues which make contacts between the c terminal  helix and the polyproline helix in contrast to pnpy also residues from the n terminus display spatial proximity to the membrane interface furthermore the orientation of the c terminus that presumably contains residues involved in receptor binding is different in the two environments we speculate that this pre positioning of residues could be an important requirement for receptor activation moreover we doubt that the pp fold is of functional relevance for binding at the y receptor
