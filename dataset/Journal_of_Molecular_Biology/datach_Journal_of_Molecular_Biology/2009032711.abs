allostery wiring diagrams in the transitions that drive the groel reaction cycle
determining the network of residues that transmit allosteric signals is crucial to understanding the function of biological nanomachines during the course of a reaction cycle biological machines in general and escherichia coli chaperonin groel in particular undergo large scale conformational changes in response to ligand binding normal mode analyses based on structure based coarse grained models where each residue is represented by an  carbon atom have been widely used to describe the motions encoded in the structures of proteins here we propose a new c   side chain elastic network model of proteins that includes information about the physical identity of each residue and accurately accounts for the side chain topology and packing within the structure using the c   side chain elastic network model and the structural perturbation method which probes the response of a local perturbation at a given site at all other sites in the structure we determine the network of key residues allostery wiring diagram responsible for the t  r and r   t transitions in groel a number of residues both within a subunit and at the interface of two adjacent subunits are found to be at the origin of the positive cooperativity in the atp driven t  r transition of particular note are residues g   r  d  e   and k   of these r  d  and k  are highly conserved g  is located in the apical domain at the interface between two subunits e  and k  are located in the apical domain toward the center of a subunit r  and d  are equatorial domain residues the allostery wiring diagram shows that the network of residues are interspersed throughout the structure residues d  v   e   and d  play a critical role in the r   t transition which implies that mutations of these residues would compromise the atpase activity d  and e  are also highly conserved d  is moderately conserved the negative cooperativity between the rings in the r   t transition is orchestrated through several interface residues within a single ring including n  e   d   and e   signal from the trans ring that is transmitted across the interface between the equatorial domains is responsible for the r   t transition the cochaperonin groes plays a passive role in the r   t transition remarkably the binding affinity of groes for groel is allosterically linked to groel residues      that span helices k and l the movements of helices k and l alter the polarity of the cavity throughout the groel functional cycle and undergo large scale motions that are anticorrelated with the other apical domain residues the allostery wiring diagrams for the t  r and r   t transitions of groel provide a microscopic foundation for the cooperativity anticooperativity within between the ring rings  using statistical coupling analysis we extract evolutionarily linked clusters of residues in groel and groes we find that several substrate protein binding residues as well as sites related to atpase activity belong to a single functional network in groel for groes the mobile loop residues and groes groes interface residues are linked
