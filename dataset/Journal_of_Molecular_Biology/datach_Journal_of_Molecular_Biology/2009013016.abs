crystal structure of the ha subcomponent of clostridium botulinum type c progenitor toxin
the clostridium botulinum type c  s progenitor toxin contains a neurotoxin and several nontoxic components designated nontoxic nonhemagglutinin ha  ha  ha   ha  ha   ha a ha      and ha b ha   the ha b subcomponent seems to play an important role cooperatively with ha in the internalization of the toxin by gastrointestinal epithelial cells via binding of these subcomponents to specific oligosaccharides in this study we investigated the sugar binding specificity of the ha b subcomponent using recombinant protein fused to glutathione s transferase and determined the three dimensional structure of the ha a  ha b complex based on x ray crystallography the crystal structure was determined at a resolution of     ha b contains three domains domains i to iii and the structure of domain i resembles ha a in crystal packing three ha a  ha b molecules are assembled to form a three leaved propeller like structure the three ha b domain i and three ha a alternate forming a trimer of dimers in a database search no proteins with high structural homology to any of the domains z score gt   were found especially ha a and ha b domain i mainly composed of  sheets reveal a unique fold in binding assays ha b bound sialic acid with high affinity but did not bind galactose n acetylgalactosamine or n acetylglucosamine the electron density of liganded n acetylneuraminic acid was determined by crystal soaking in the sugar complex structure the n acetylneuraminic acid binding site was located in the cleft formed between domains ii and iii of ha b this report provides the first determination of the three dimensional structure of the ha a  ha b complex and its sialic acid binding site our results will provide useful information for elucidating the mechanism of assembly of the c s toxin and for understanding the interactions with oligosaccharides on epithelial cells and internalization of the botulinum toxin complex
