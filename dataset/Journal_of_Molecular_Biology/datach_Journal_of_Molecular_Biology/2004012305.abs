inhibition of e induced degradation of its cellular substrates by novel blocking peptides
the e oncoprotein derived from the tumour associated human papillomavirus hpv types induces the ubiquitin mediated degradation of several cellular proteins by conjugating them with the cellular ubiquitin ligase e ap this is a hect domain containing ligase that was originally identified through its involvement in the e mediated degradation of the cellular tumour suppressor protein p  here we have investigated in more detail the nature of the e e ap interaction using binding peptides isolated from an e specific library the selected peptides were either predicted or shown to have an  helical core resembling the e binding motif on e ap as well as amino acid alterations that increased their affinity for e  these peptides were potent inhibitors of the e e ap interaction further analysis of the effects of these peptides on the ability of e to direct the proteolytic degradation of its various substrates including p  dlg and the magi family of proteins as well as using e ap immunodepletion revealed striking differences in the mechanism by which e targets its cellular substrates for degradation these results suggest that the site on e bound by e ap is also most likely occupied by other as yet unidentified ubiquitin ligases
