conformational changes during the catalytic cycle of gluconate kinase as revealed by x ray crystallography
the crystal structure of gluconate kinase from escherichia coli has been determined to    resolution by x ray crystallography the three dimensional structure was solved by multi wavelength anomalous dispersion using a crystal of selenomethionine substituted enzyme gluconate kinase is an    structure consisting of a twisted parallel  sheet surrounded by  helices with overall topology similar to nucleoside monophosphate nmp kinases such as adenylate kinase in order to identify residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis structures of binary complexes with atp the atp analogue adenosine       methylene triphosphate and the product gluconate  phosphate have been determined significant conformational changes are induced upon binding of atp to the enzyme the largest changes involve a hinge bending motion of the nmpbind part and a motion of the lid with adjacent helices which opens the cavity to the second substrate gluconate opening of the active site cleft upon atp binding is the opposite of what has been observed in the nmp kinase family so far which usually close their active site to prevent fortuitous hydrolysis of atp the conformational change positions the side chain of arg  to stack with the purine ring of atp and the side chain of arg  is shifted to interact with the  phosphate in atp at the same time protecting atp from solvent water the  and  phosphate groups of atp bind in the predicted p loop a conserved lysine side chain interacts with the  phosphate group and might promote phosphoryl transfer gluconate  phosphate binds with its phosphate group in a similar position as the  phosphate of atp consistent with inline phosphoryl transfer the gluconate binding pocket in gntk is located in a different position than the nucleoside binding site usually found in nmp kinases
