a large collapsed state rna can exhibit simple exponential single molecule dynamics
the process of large rna folding is believed to proceed from many collapsed structures to a unique functional structure requiring precise organization of nucleotides the diversity of possible structures and stabilities of large rnas could result in non exponential folding kinetics e g stretched exponential under conditions where the molecules have not achieved their native state we describe a single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret study of the collapsed state region of the free energy landscape of the catalytic domain of rnase p rna from bacillus stearothermophilus cthermo  ensemble measurements have shown that this   residue rna folds cooperatively to its native state at    mm mg  but little is known about the conformational dynamics at lower ionic strength our measurements of equilibrium conformational fluctuations reveal simple exponential kinetics that reflect a small number of discrete states instead of the expected inhomogeneous dynamics the distribution of discrete dwell times collected from an  ensemble  of   single molecules at each of a series of mg  concentrations fit well to a double exponential which indicates that the rna conformational changes can be described as a four state system this finding is somewhat unexpected under mg  conditions in which this rna does not achieve its native state observation of discrete well defined conformations in this large rna that are stable on the seconds timescale at low mg   lt   mm suggests that even at low ionic strength with a tremendous number of possible weak interactions a few critical interactions may produce deep energy wells that allow for rapid averaging of motions within each well and yield kinetics that are relatively simple
