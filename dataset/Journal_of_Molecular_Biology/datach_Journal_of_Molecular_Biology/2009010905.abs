regulation of root elongation by histone acetylation in arabidopsis
transcriptional repression by histone modification represents a universal mechanism that underlies critical biological processes such as neurogenesis and hematopoietic differentiation in animals in plants however the extent to which these regulatory pathways are involved in development and morphogenesis is not well defined swp ldl is a component of a plant corepressor complex that is involved in regulation of flower timing here we report that swp also plays a role in the regulation of root elongation by repressing a root specific gene lateral root primordium  lrp  via histone deacetylation a null mutation in swp results in hyperacetylation of histones h and h in lrp chromatin elevation of lrp expression and increased root elongation this effect of swp knockout on the root phenotype is mimicked by transgenic expression of lrp  which bypasses the swp mediated suppression of the native gene thus swp likely functions as a regulator of developmental events both in the shoot and in the root meristem
