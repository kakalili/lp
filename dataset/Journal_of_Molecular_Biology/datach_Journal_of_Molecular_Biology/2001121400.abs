localization of membrane permeabilization and receptor binding sites on the vp hemagglutinin of rotavirus implications for cell entry edited by w baumeister
the surface of rotavirus is decorated with  spike like projections each composed of a dimer of vp  the viral hemagglutinin trypsin cleavage of vp generates two fragments vp   which binds sialic acid sa  and vp   containing an integrin binding motif and a hydrophobic region that permeabilizes membranes and is homologous to fusion domains although the mechanism for cell entry by this non enveloped virus is unclear it is known that trypsin cleavage enhances viral infectivity and facilitates viral entry we used electron cryo microscopy and difference map analysis to localize the binding sites for two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies  a  and g  which are directed against the sa binding site within vp   and the membrane permeabilization domain within vp   respectively fab a  binds at the tips of the dimeric heads of vp  and g binds in the cleft between the two heads of the spike when these binding results are combined with secondary structure analysis we predict that the vp heads are composed primarily of  sheets in vp   and that vp   forms the body and base primarily in  structure and  helical conformations respectively based on these results and those of others a model is proposed for cell entry in which vp   and vp   mediate receptor binding and membrane permeabilization and uncoating occurs during transfer across the lipid bilayer thereby generating the transcriptionally active particle
