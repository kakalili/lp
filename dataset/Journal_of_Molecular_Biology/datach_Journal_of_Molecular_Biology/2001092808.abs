molecular dissection of the cd c  counter receptor interface identifies cd tyr  and cd  lys  residues as the functional  hot spot   edited by i wilson
the heterophilic cd cd  adhesion interface contains interdigitating residues that impart high specificity and rapid binding kinetics to define the hot spot of this counter receptor interaction we characterized cd adhesion domain variants harboring a single mutation of the central tyr  or of each amino acid residue forming a salt link hydrogen bond alanine mutations at d  d  and k  on the c strand and k  and r  on the c  strand reduce affinity for cd  by    fold as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry the y a mutant reduces affinity by     fold whereas y f is virtually without effect underscoring the importance of the phenyl ring rather than the hydroxyl moiety the cd cd  crystal structure offers a detailed view of this key functional epitope cd d  and d  orient the side chain of cd  k  such that cd y  makes hydrophobic contact with the extended aliphatic component of cd  k  between cd y  and cd  f  the elucidation of this hot spot provides a new target for rational design of immunosuppressive compounds and suggests a general approach for other receptors
