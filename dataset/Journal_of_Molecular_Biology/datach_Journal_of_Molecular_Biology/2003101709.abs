the mechanism of proton exclusion in the aquaporin  water channel
aquaporins are efficient yet strictly selective water channels remarkably proton permeation is fully blocked in contrast to most other water filled pores which are known to conduct protons well blocking of protons by aquaporins is essential to maintain the electrochemical gradient across cellular and subcellular membranes we studied the mechanism of proton exclusion in aquaporin  by multiple non equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that also allow proton transfer reactions from the simulations an effective free energy profile for the proton motion along the channel was determined with a maximum likelihood approach the results indicate that the main barrier is not as had previously been speculated caused by the interruption of the hydrogen bonded water chain but rather by an electrostatic field centered around the fingerprint asn pro ala npa motif hydrogen bond interruption only forms a secondary barrier located at the ar r constriction region the calculated main barrier height of     kj mol   matches the barrier height for the passage of protons across pure lipid bilayers and therefore suffices to prevent major leakage of protons through aquaporins conventional molecular dynamics simulations additionally showed that negatively charged hydroxide ions are prevented from being trapped within the npa region by two adjacent electrostatic barriers of opposite polarity
