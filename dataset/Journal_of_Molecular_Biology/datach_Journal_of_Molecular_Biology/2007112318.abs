dynamics of a benzo a pyrene derived guanine dna lesion in tgt and cgc sequence contexts enhanced mobility in tgt explains conformational heterogeneity flexible bending and greater susceptibility to nucleotide excision repair
the nucleotide excision repair ner machinery excises a variety of bulky dna lesions but with varying efficiencies the structural features of the dna lesions that govern these differences are not well understood an intriguing model system for studying structure  function relationships in ner is the major adduct derived from the reaction of the highly tumorigenic metabolite of benzo a pyrene   anti benzo a pyrene diol epoxide with the exocyclic amino group of guanine   trans anti bp n dg or g  the rates of incision of the stereochemically identical lesions catalyzed by the prokaryotic uvrabc system was shown to be greater by a factor of     in the tg t than in the cg c sequence context biochemistry             here we employ molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the origin of the greater excision efficiency in the tg t case and more broadly to delineate structural parameters that enhance ner our results show that the bp aromatic ring system is   directed along the modified strand in the b dna minor groove in both sequence contexts however the tg t modified duplex is much more dynamically flexible featuring more perturbed and mobile watson  crick hydrogen bonding adjacent to the lesion a greater impairment in stacking interactions more dynamic local roll bending and more minor groove flexibility these characteristics explain a number of experimental observations concerning the   trans anti bp n dg adduct in double stranded dna with the tg t sequence context its conformational heterogeneity in nmr solution studies its highly flexible bend and its lower thermal stability by contrast the cg c modified duplex is characterized by a single bp conformation and a rigid bend while current recognition models of bulky lesions by ner factors have stressed the importance of impaired watson  crick pairing stacking and bending our results highlight the likelihood of an important role for the local dynamics in the vicinity of the lesion
