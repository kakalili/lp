rab c is a retrogene that encodes a centrosomal protein involved in cell cycle progression
rab gtpases are key regulators of membrane transport and growing evidence indicates that their expression levels are altered in certain human malignancies including cancer rab c a newly identified rab subfamily member has attracted recent attention because its reduced expression might confer a selective advantage to drug resistant breast cancer cells here we report that rab c is a primate specific retrogene derived from a rab a  transcript rab c is transcribed in a limited number of human tissues including brain testis prostate and breast endogenous rab c is considerably less abundant and has a much shorter half life than rab a   comparison of the gtp binding motifs of rab c and rab a   homology modeling and gtp blot overlay assays indicate that amino acid changes in rab c have greatly reduced its gtp binding affinity instead the noncanonical gtp binding domain of rab c mediates localization of the protein to the centrosome overexpression of rab c results in g arrest and its specific depletion generates tetraploid cells with supernumerary centrosomes revealing a role of rab c in events related to the centrosome and cell cycle progression thus rab c is a rare example of a recently emerged retrogene that has acquired the status of a new gene encoding a functional protein with altered characteristics compared to rab a
