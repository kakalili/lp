conformational and hydration effects of site selective sodium calcium and strontium ion binding to the dna holliday junction structure d tcggtaccga
the role of metal ions in determining the solution conformation of the holliday junction is well established but to date the picture of metal ion binding from structural studies of the four way dna junction is very incomplete here we present two refined structures of the holliday junction formed by the sequence d tcggtaccga in the presence of na and ca  and separately with sr  to resolutions of    and     respectively this sequence includes the acc core found to promote spontaneous junction formation but its structure has not previously been reported almost complete hydration spheres can be defined for each metal cation the na sites the most convincing observation of such sites in junctions to date are one on either face of the junction crossover region and stabilise the ordered hydration inside the junction arms the four ca  sites in the same structure are at the cg cg steps in the minor groove the sr  ions occupy the tc ag gg cc and ta ta sites in the minor groove giving ten positions forming two spines of ions spiralling through the minor grooves within each arm of the stacked x structure the two structures were solved in the two different c lattices previously observed with the sr  derivative crystallising in the more highly symmetrical form with two fold symmetry at its centre both structures show an opening of the minor groove face of the junction of    in the ca  and na containing structure and    in the sr  containing structure the crossover angles at the junction are    and     respectively in addition to this a relative shift in the base pair stack alignment of the arms of    is observed for the sr  containing structure only overall these results provide an insight into the so far elusive stabilising ion structure for the dna holliday junction
