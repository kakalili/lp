high resolution analysis of zn  coordination in the alkaline phosphatase superfamily by exafs and x ray crystallography
comparisons among evolutionarily related enzymes offer opportunities to reveal how structural differences produce different catalytic activities two structurally related enzymes escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase ap and xanthomonas axonopodis nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase npp  have nearly identical binuclear zn  catalytic centers but show tremendous differential specificity for hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters or phosphate diesters to determine if there are differences in zn  coordination in the two enzymes that might contribute to catalytic specificity we analyzed both x ray absorption spectroscopic and x ray crystallographic data we report a     crystal structure of ap with bound phosphate allowing evaluation of interactions at the ap metal site with high resolution to make systematic comparisons between ap and npp we measured zinc extended x ray absorption fine structure for ap and npp in the free enzyme forms with amp and inorganic phosphate ground state analogs and with vanadate transition state analogs these studies yielded average zinc  ligand distances in ap and npp free enzyme forms and ground state analog forms that were identical within error suggesting little difference in metal ion coordination among these forms upon binding of vanadate to both enzymes small increases in average metal  ligand distances were observed consistent with an increased coordination number slightly longer increases were observed in npp relative to ap which could arise from subtle rearrangements of the active site or differences in the geometry of the bound vanadyl species overall the results suggest that the binuclear zn  catalytic site remains very similar between ap and npp during the course of a reaction cycle
