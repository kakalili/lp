structural analysis of human igg fc glycoforms reveals a correlation between glycosylation and structural integrity
antibodies may be viewed as adaptor molecules that provide a link between humoral and cellular defence mechanisms thus when antigen specific igg antibodies form antigen antibody immune complexes the effectively aggregated igg can activate a wide range of effector systems multiple effector mechanisms result from cellular activation mediated through a family of igg fc receptors differentially expressed on leucocytes it is established that glycosylation of igg fc is essential for recognition and activation of these ligands igg antibodies predominate in human serum and most therapeutic antibodies are of the igg class the igg fc is a homodimer of n linked glycopeptide chains comprised of two immunoglobulin domains c   c   that dimerise via inter heavy chain disulphide bridges at the n terminal region and non covalent interactions between the c terminal c  domains the overall shape of the igg fc is similar to that of a  horseshoe  with a majority of the internal space filled by the oligosaccharide chains only attached through asparagine residues   to investigate the influence of individual sugar monosaccharide residues of the oligosaccharide on the structure and function of igg fc we have compared the structure of  wild type  glycosylated igg fc with that of four glycoforms bearing consecutively truncated oligosaccharides removal of terminal n acetylglucosamine as well as mannose sugar residues resulted in the largest conformational changes in both the oligosaccharide and in the polypeptide loop containing the n glycosylation site the observed conformational changes in the c  domain affect the interface between igg fc fragments and fc rs furthermore we observed that the removal of sugar residues permits the mutual approach of c  domains resulting in the generation of a  closed  conformation in contrast to the  open  conformation which was observed for the fully galactosylated igg fc which may be optimal for fc r binding these data provide a structural rationale for the previously observed modulation of effector activities reported for this series of proteins
