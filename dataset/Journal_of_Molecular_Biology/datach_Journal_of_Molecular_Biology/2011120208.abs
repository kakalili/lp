mutations in the gene encoding c orf  block complex i assembly by inhibiting production of the mitochondria encoded subunit nd
the assembly of complex i nadh  ubiquinone oxidoreductase is a complicated process requiring the integration of  subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial dnas into a structure of approximately  mda a number of  assembly factors  that aid complex i biogenesis have recently been described including c orf  this protein was identified as an assembly factor by its evolutionary conservation in organisms containing complex i and by a c orf  mutation in a patient presenting with leigh syndrome and isolated complex i deficiency in this report we have undertaken the characterization of c orf  and its role in complex i assembly analysis of mitochondria from fibroblasts of a patient harboring a c orf  mutation showed almost undetectable levels of steady state complex i and defective biogenesis of the mtdna encoded subunit nd  complementation with wild type c orf  restored the levels of both nd and complex i confirming the c orf  mutation as the cause of the complex i defect in the patient in the absence of nd in patient cells early and mid stage intermediate complexes were still formed however assembly of late stage intermediates was impaired indicating a convergence point in the assembly process while c orf  appears to behave at a step in complex i biogenesis similar to that of the assembly factor c orf  complementation studies showed that both proteins are required for nd synthesis stabilization we conclude that c orf  is a crucial factor required for the translation and or integration of nd into an early stage assembly intermediate and that mutation of c orf  disrupts the initial stages of complex i biogenesis
