chimeric fc receptors identify ligand binding regions in human glycoprotein vi
glycoprotein gp vi a key receptor for collagen induced platelet activation recently emerged as a major target for developing new antithrombotics however little is known about its functional domains which is a disadvantage for the rational development of antagonists our aim was to identify the structures determining gpvi specificity gpvi presents homologies with members of the ig superfamily in particular with fc ri whose extracellular parts present two domains d and d linked by a hinge interdomain to identify the respective role of these domains in gpvi we have substituted d and d by their fc ri homologue in a soluble gpvi fusion protein gpvi fc and have modified the linker motif by mutagenesis proteins were tested for their binding to ligands and antibodies specific for gpvi and fc ri we demonstrate for the first time that d plays a specific and significant role in gpvi binding to collagen and that the hinge interdomain is critical for the binding to convulxin furthermore binding to crp requires elements of d and of the linker motif our results indicate that gpvi is unique amongst the receptors of its family as it uses different structural domains to interact with several agonists and provide evidence that different sites on gpvi constitute targets to develop antagonists of gpvi
