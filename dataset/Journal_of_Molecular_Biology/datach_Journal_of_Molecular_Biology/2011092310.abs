drosophila btb poz domains of  ttk group  can form multimers and selectively interact with each other
the btb bric a brac tramtrack and broad complex poz poxvirus and zinc finger domain is a conserved protein  protein interaction motif contained in a variety of transcription factors involved in development chromatin remodeling insulator activity and carcinogenesis all well studied mammalian btb domains form obligate homodimers and rarely tetramers only the btb domain of the drosophila gaga factor gaf has been shown to exist as higher order multimers the btb domain of gaf belongs to the  ttk group  that contains several highly conserved sequences not found in other btb domains here we have shown by size exclusion chromatography chemical cross linking and nondenaturing page that four additional btb domains of the ttk group  batman mod mdg  pipsqueak and tramtrack  can form multimers like gaf interestingly the btb domains of gaf and batman have formed a wide range of complexes and interacted in the yeast two hybrid assay with other btb domains tested in contrast the btb domains of mod mdg  pipsqueak and tramtrack have formed stable high order multimer complexes and failed to interact with each other the btb domain of drosophila cp  protein does not belong to the ttk group this btb domain has formed stable dimers and has not interacted with domains of the ttk group previously it was suggested that gaf oligomerization into higher order complexes facilitates long range activation by providing a protein bridge between an enhancer and a promoter unexpectedly experiments in the drosophila model system have not supported the role of gaf in organization of long distance interaction between the yeast gal activator and the white promoter
