full sequence computational design and solution structure of a thermostable protein variant
computational protein design procedures were applied to the redesign of the entire sequence of a  amino acid residue protein drosophila melanogaster engrailed homeodomain various sequence optimization algorithms were compared and two resulting designed sequences were experimentally evaluated the two sequences differ by  mutations and share   and   sequence identity with the wild type protein both computationally designed proteins were considerably more stable than the naturally occurring protein with midpoints of thermal denaturation greater than    c the solution structure was determined for one of the two sequences using multidimensional heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and the structure was found to closely match the original design template scaffold
