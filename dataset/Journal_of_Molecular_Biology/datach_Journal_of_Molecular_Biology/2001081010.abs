solution structure and interaction surface of the c terminal domain from p  a major p  cofactor involved in snare disassembly edited by m f summers
p  is the major protein identified in complex with the cytosolic aaa atpase p  it functions as an essential cofactor of p  regulated membrane fusion which has been suggested to disassemble t t snare complexes and prepare them for further rounds of membrane fusion here we report the high resolution nmr structure of the c terminal domain from p  it comprises a ubx domain and a  residue long structured n terminal extension the ubx domain adopts a characteristic ubiquitin fold with a        secondary structure arrangement three hydrophobic residues from the n terminal extension pack closely against a cleft in the ubx domain we also identify for the first time the p  interaction surface using nmr chemical shift perturbation studies
