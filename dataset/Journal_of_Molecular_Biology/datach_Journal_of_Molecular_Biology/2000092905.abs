the trna dependent activation of arginine by arginyl trna synthetase requires inter domain communication edited by a fersht
the trna dependent amino acid activation catalyzed by mammalian arginyl trna synthetase has been characterized a conditional lethal mutant of chinese hamster ovary cells that exhibits reduced arginyl trna synthetase activity arg   and two of its derived revertants arg r and arg r  were analyzed at the structural and functional levels a single nucleotide change resulting in a cys to tyr substitution at position   of arginyl trna synthetase is responsible for the defective phenotype of the thermosensitive and arginine hyper auxotroph arg  cell line the two revertants have a single additional mutation resulting in a met  to ile change for arg r or a tyr  to ser change for arg r  the corresponding mutant enzymes were expressed in yeast and purified the cys  to tyr mutation affects both the thermal stability of arginyl trna synthetase and the kinetic parameters for arginine in the atp ppi exchange and trna aminoacylation reactions this mutation is located underneath the floor of the rossmann fold catalytic domain characteristic of class  aminoacyl trna synthetases near the end of a long helix belonging to the  helix bundle c terminal domain distinctive of class a synthetases for the met  to ile revertant there is very little effect of the mutation on the interaction of arginyl trna synthetase with either of its substrates however this mutation increases the thermal stability of arginyl trna synthetase thereby leading to reversion of the thermosensitive phenotype by increasing the steady state level of the enzyme in vivo in contrast for the arg r cell line reversion of the phenotype is due to an increased catalytic efficiency of the c  y y  s double mutant as compared to the initial c  y enzyme in light of the location of the mutations in the d structure of the enzyme modeled using the crystal structure of the closely related yeast arginyl trna synthetase the kinetic analysis of these mutants suggests that the obligatory trna induced activation of the catalytic site of arginyl trna synthetase involves interdomain signal transduction via the long helices that build the trna binding domain of the enzyme and link the site of interaction of the anticodon domain of trna to the floor of the active site
