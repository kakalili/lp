protein protein interactions in control of a transcriptional switch
protein partner exchange plays a key role in regulating many biological switches although widespread the mechanisms dictating protein partner identity and therefore the outcome of a switch have been determined for a limited number of systems the escherichia coli protein bira undergoes a switch between posttranslational biotin attachment and transcription repression in response to cellular biotin demand moreover the functional switch reflects formation of alternative mutually exclusive protein protein interactions by bira previous studies provided a set of alanine substituted bira variants with altered kinetic and equilibrium parameters of forming these interactions in this work dnase i footprinting measurements were employed to investigate the consequences of these altered properties for the outcome of the bira functional switch the results support a mechanism in which bira availability for dna binding and therefore transcription repression is controlled by the rate of the competing protein protein interaction however occupancy of the transcriptional regulatory site on dna by bira is exquisitely tuned by the equilibrium constant governing its homodimerization
