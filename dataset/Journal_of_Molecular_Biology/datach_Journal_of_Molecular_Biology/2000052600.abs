crystal structure of an adenine bulge in the rna chain of a dna rna hybrid d ctcctcttc  r gaagagagag  edited by i tinoco
crystal structure of a dna rna hybrid d ctcctcttc  r gaagagagag  with an adenine bulge in the polypurine rna strand was determined at    resolution the structure was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to a final r factor of     rfree     the hybrid duplex crystallized in the space group i  with unit cell dimens ions a       b      and c       and adopts the a form conformation all rna and dna sugars are in the c   endo conformation the glycosyl angles in anti conformation and the majority of the c   c   torsion angles in g except two trans angles in conformity with the c   endo rigid nucleotide hypothesis the adenine bulge is looped out and it is also in the anti c   endo conformation the bulge is involved in a base triple c g  a interaction with the end base pair c  g  in the minor groove of a symmetry related molecule the   hydroxyl group of g  is hydrogen bonded to o p and o   of g  skipping the bulged adenine a  and stabilizing the sugar phosphate backbone of the hybrid the hydrogen bonding and the backbone conformation at the bulged adenine site is very similar to that found in the crystal structure of a protein rna complex
