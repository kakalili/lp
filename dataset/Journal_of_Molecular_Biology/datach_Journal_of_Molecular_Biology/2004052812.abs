snorkeling preferences foster an amino acid composition bias in transmembrane helices
by analyzing transmembrane tm helices in known structures we find that some polar amino acids are more frequent at the n terminus than at the c terminus we propose the asymmetry occurs because most polar amino acids are better able to snorkel their polar atoms away from the membrane core at the n terminus than at the c terminus two findings lead us to this proposition   side chain conformations are influenced strongly by the n or c terminal position of the amino acid in the bilayer and   the favored snorkeling direction of an amino acid correlates well with its n to c terminal composition bias our results suggest that tm helix predictions should incorporate an n to c terminal composition bias that rotamer preferences of tm side chains are position dependent and that the ability to snorkel influences the evolutionary selection of amino acids for the helix n and c termini
