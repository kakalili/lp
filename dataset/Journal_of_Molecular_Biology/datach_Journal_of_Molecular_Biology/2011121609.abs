structural model for p ntr  trka intracellular domain interaction a combined fret and bioinformatics study
nerve growth factor ngf is a member of the neurotrophins which are important regulators of embryonic development and adult function in the vertebrate nervous systems the signaling elicited by ngf regulates diverse activities including survival axon growth and synaptic plasticity ngf action is mediated by engagement with two structurally unrelated transmembrane receptors p ntr and trka which are co expressed in a variety of cells the functional interactions of these receptors have been widely demonstrated and include complex formation convergence of signaling pathways and indirect interaction through adaptor proteins each domain of the receptors was shown to be important for the formation of trka and p ntr complexes but only the intramembrane and transmembrane domains seemed to be crucial for the creation of high affinity binding sites however whether these occur through a physical association of the receptors is unclear in the present work we demonstrate by f rster resonance energy transfer that p ntr and trka are physically associated through their intracellular ic domains and that this interaction occurs predominantly at the cell membrane and prior to ngf stimulation our data suggest that there is a pool of receptors dimerized before ngf stimulus which could contribute to the high affinity binding sites we modeled the three dimensional structure of the trka ic domain by homology modeling and with this and the nmr resolved structure of p ntr we modeled the heterodimerization of trka and p ntr by docking methods and molecular dynamics these models together with the results obtained by f rster resonance energy transfer provide structural insights into the receptors physical association
