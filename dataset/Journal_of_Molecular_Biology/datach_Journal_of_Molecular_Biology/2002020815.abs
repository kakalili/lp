a structural model for the catalytic cycle of ca  atpase edited by w baumeister
ca  atpase is responsible for active transport of calcium ions across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane this coupling involves an ordered sequence of reversible reactions occurring alternately at the atp site within the cytoplasmic domains or at the calcium transport sites within the transmembrane domain these two sites are separated by a large distance and conformational changes have long been postulated to play an important role in their coordination to characterize the nature of these conformational changes we have built atomic models for two reaction intermediates and postulated the mechanisms governing the large structural changes one model is based on fitting the x ray crystallographic structure of ca  atpase in the e state to a new   structure by cryoelectron microscopy in the e state this fit indicates that calcium binding induces enormous movements of all three cytoplasmic domains as well as significant changes in several transmembrane helices we found that fluorescein isothiocyanate displaced a decavanadate molecule normally located at the intersection of the three cytoplasmic domains but did not affect their juxtaposition this result indicates that our model likely reflects a native e conformation and not an artifact of decavanadate binding to explain the dramatic structural effect of calcium binding we propose that m and m transmembrane helices are responsive to calcium binding and directly induce rotation of the phosphorylation domain furthermore we hypothesize that both the nucleotide binding and  sheet domains are highly mobile and driven by brownian motion to elicit phosphoenzyme formation and calcium transport respectively if so the reaction cycle of ca  atpase would have elements of a brownian ratchet where the chemical reactions of atp hydrolysis are used to direct the random thermal oscillations of an innately flexible molecule
