structural aspects of the distinct biochemical properties of glutaredoxin  and glutaredoxin  from saccharomyces cerevisiae
glutaredoxins grxs are small     kda heat stable proteins that are ubiquitously distributed in saccharomyces cerevisiae seven grx enzymes have been identified two of them ygrx and ygrx  are dithiolic possessing a conserved cys pro tyr cys motif here we show that ygrx has a specific activity  times higher than that of ygrx  although these two oxidoreductases share   identity and   similarity with respect to their amino acid sequences further characterization of the enzymatic activities through two substrate kinetics analysis revealed that ygrx possesses a lower km for glutathione and a higher turnover than ygrx  to better comprehend these biochemical differences the pka of the n terminal active site cysteines cys  of these two proteins and of the ygrx c s mutant were determined since the pka values of the ygrx and ygrx cys  residues are very similar these parameters cannot account for the difference observed between their specific activities therefore crystal structures of ygrx in the oxidized form and with a glutathionyl mixed disulfide were determined at resolutions of   and      respectively comparisons of ygrx structures with the recently determined structures of ygrx provided insights into their remarkable functional divergence we hypothesize that the substitutions of ser  and gln  in ygrx by ala  and glu  in ygrx modify the capability of the active site c terminal cysteine to attack the mixed disulfide between the n terminal active site cysteine and the glutathione molecule mutagenesis studies supported this hypothesis the observed structural and functional differences between ygrx and ygrx may reflect variations in substrate specificity
