the structure of an insect chymotrypsin edited by i a wilson
the south american imported fire ant solenopsis invicta  without natural enemies in the united states widely infests the southern united states causing more than a half billion dollars in health and agriculture related damage annually in texas alone fire ants are resistant to most insecticides so control will require a more fundamental understanding of their biochemistry and metabolism leading to the design of selective ecologically safe insecticides the th instar larvae play a crucial role in the nutrition of the colony by secreting proteinases especially chymotrypsin which digest food products for the entire colony the first structure of an ant proteolytic enzyme fire ant chymotrypsin was determined to atomic resolution      a structural comparison of the ant and mammalian structures confirms the  universality  of the serine proteinase motif and reveals a difference at residues     which are proteolytically removed in the bovine enzyme but are firmly intact in the ant chymotrypsin suggesting a different activation mechanism for the latter likewise the absence of the covalently attached propeptide domain    further suggests an uncharacteristic activation mechanism the presence of gly  in the s site is an atypical feature of this chymotrypsin and is comparable only to human leukocyte elastase hornet chymo trypsin and fiddler crab collagenase binding studies confirm the chymotrypsin nature of this novel enzyme
