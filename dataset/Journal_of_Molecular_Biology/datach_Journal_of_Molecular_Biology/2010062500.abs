mechanism of u insertion rna editing in trypanosome mitochondria the bimodal tutase activity of the core complex
expression of the trypanosomal mitochondrial genome requires the insertion and deletion of uridylyl residues at specific sites in pre mrnas ret terminal uridylyl transferase is an integral component of the rna editing core complex recc and is responsible for the guide rna dependent u insertion reaction by analyzing rna interference based knock in trypanosoma brucei cell lines purified editing complex and individual protein we have investigated ret s association with the recc in addition the u insertion activity exhibited by ret as an recc subunit was compared with characteristics of the monomeric protein we show that interaction of ret with recc is accomplished via a protein  protein contact between its middle domain and a structural subunit mp  the recombinant ret catalyzes a faithful editing on gapped precleaved double stranded rna substrates and this reaction requires an internal monophosphate group at the   end of the mrna   cleavage fragment however ret processivity is limited to insertion of three us incorporation into the recc voids the internal phosphate requirement and allows filling of longer gaps similar to those observed in vivo remarkably monomeric and recc embedded enzymes display a similar bimodal activity the distributive insertion of a single uracil is followed by a processive extension limited by the number of guiding nucleotides based on the rna substrate specificity of ret and the purine rich nature of u insertion sites we propose that the distributive  insertion creates a substrate for the processive gap filling reaction upon base pairing of the  extended   cleavage fragment with a guiding nucleotide this substrate is recognized by ret in a different mode compared to the product of the initial nucleolytic cleavage therefore ret distinguishes base pairs in gapped rna substrates which may constitute an additional checkpoint contributing to overall fidelity of the editing process
