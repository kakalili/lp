the biological functions of a kinase anchor proteins edited by p e wright
camp dependent protein kinase is targeted to discrete subcellular locations by a family of specific anchor proteins a kinase anchor proteins akaps  localization recruits protein kinase a pka holoenzyme close to its substrate effector proteins directing and amplifying the biological effects of camp signaling akaps include two conserved structural modules  i a targeting domain that serves as a scaffold and membrane anchor and ii a tethering domain that interacts with pka regulatory subunits alternative splicing can shuffle targeting and tethering domains to generate a variety of akaps with different targeting specificity although akaps have been identified on the basis of their interaction with pka they also bind other signaling molecules mainly phosphatases and kinases that regulate akap targeting and activate other signal transduction pathways we suggest that akap forms a  transduceosome  by acting as an autonomous multivalent scaffold that assembles and integrates signals derived from multiple pathways the transduceosome amplifies camp and other signals locally and by stabilizing and reducing the basal activity of pka it also exerts long distance effects the akap transduceosome thus optimizes the amplitude and the signal noise ratio of camp pka stimuli travelling from the membrane to the nucleus and other subcellular compartments
