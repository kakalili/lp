galanthamine and non competitive inhibitor binding to ach binding protein evidence for a binding site on non  subunit interfaces of heteromeric neuronal nicotinic receptors
rapid neurotransmission is mediated through a superfamily of cys loop receptors that includes the nicotinic acetylcholine nachr   aminobutyric acid gabaa  serotonin  ht  and glycine receptors a class of ligands including galanthamine local anesthetics and certain toxins interact with nachrs non competitively suggested modes of action include blockade of the ion channel modulation from undefined extracellular sites stabilization of desensitized states and association with annular or boundary lipid alignment of mammalian cys loop receptors shows aromatic residues found in the acetylcholine or ligand binding pocket of nachrs are conserved in all subunit interfaces of neuronal nachrs including those that are not formed by  subunits on the principal side of the transmitter binding site the amino terminal domain containing the ligand recognition site is homologous to the soluble acetylcholine binding protein achbp from mollusks an established structural and functional surrogate we assess ligand specificity and employ x ray crystallography with achbp to demonstrate ligand interactions at subunit interfaces lacking vicinal cysteines i e the non  subunit interfaces in nachrs  non competitive nicotinic ligands bind achbp with high affinity kd       m  we mutated the vicinal cysteine residues in loop c of achbp to mimic the non  subunit interfaces of neuronal nachrs and other cys loop receptors classical nicotinic agonists show a     fold reduction in binding affinity whereas binding of ligands known to be non competitive are not affected x ray structures of cocaine and galanthamine bound to achbp     and     resolution respectively reveal interactions deep within the subunit interface and the absence of a contact surface with the tip of loop c hence in addition to channel blocking non competitive interactions with heteromeric neuronal nachr appear to occur at the non  subunit interface a site presumed to be similar to that of modulating benzodiazepines on gabaa receptors
