structural insights into unique substrate selectivity of thermoplasma acidophilumd aldohexose dehydrogenase
the d aldohexose dehydrogenase from the thermoacidophilic archaea thermoplasma acidophilum aldt belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase sdr superfamily and catalyzes the oxidation of several monosaccharides with a preference for nad rather than nadp as a cofactor it has been found that aldt is a unique enzyme that exhibits the highest dehydrogenase activity against d mannose here we describe the crystal structures of aldt in ligand free form in complex with nadh and in complex with the substrate d mannose at          and     resolution respectively the aldt subunit forms a typical sdr fold with an unexpectedly long c terminal tail and assembles into an intertwined tetramer the d mannose complex structure reveals that glu  interacts with the axial c hydroxyl group of the bound d mannose structural comparison with bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase bmglcdh suggests that the conformation of the glutamate side chain is crucial for discrimination between d mannose and its c epimer d glucose and the conformation of the glutamate side chain depends on the spatial arrangement of nearby hydrophobic residues that do not directly interact with the substrate elucidation of the d mannose recognition mechanism of aldt further provides structural insights into the unique substrate selectivity of aldt finally we show that the extended c terminal tail completely shuts the substrate binding pocket of the neighboring subunit both in the presence and absence of substrate the elaborate inter subunit interactions between the c terminal tail and the entrance of the substrate binding pocket imply that the tail may play a pivotal role in the enzyme activity
