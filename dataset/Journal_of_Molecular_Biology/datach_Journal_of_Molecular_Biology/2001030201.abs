native topology or specific interactions what is more important for protein folding  edited by f cohen
fifty five molecular dynamics runs of two three stranded antiparallel  sheet peptides were performed to investigate the relative importance of amino acid sequence and native topology the two peptides consist of  residues each and have a sequence identity of    one peptide has gly ser gs at both turns while the other has d pro gly dpg  the simulations successfully reproduce the nmr solution conformations irrespective of the starting structure the large number of folding events sampled along the trajectories at   k total simulation time of about   s yield a projection of the free energy landscape onto two significant progress variables the two peptides have compact denatured states similar free energy surfaces and folding pathways that involve the formation of a  hairpin followed by consolidation of the unstructured strand for the gs peptide there are  folding events that start by the formation of the    hairpin and  with first the    hairpin for the dpg peptide the statistical predominance is opposite   and  folding events start from the    hairpin and the    hairpin respectively these simulation results indicate that the overall shape of the free energy surface is defined primarily by the native state topology in agreement with an ever increasing amount of experimental and theoretical evidence while the amino acid sequence determines the statistically predominant order of the events
