characterization of a functional dnag type primase in archaea implications for a dual primase system
we have biochemically characterized the bacterial like dnag primase contained within the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus sso and compared in vitro priming kinetics with those of the eukaryotic type primase prisl also found in sso ssodnag exhibited metal and temperature dependent profiles consistent with priming at high temperatures the distribution of primer products was discrete but highly similar to the distribution of primer products produced by the homologous escherichia coli dnag the predominate primer length was  bases although less abundant products are present ssodnag was found to bind dna cooperatively as a dimer with a moderate dissociation constant mutation of the conserved glutamate in the active site severely inhibited priming activity suggesting a functional homology with e coli dnag ssodnag was also found to have a greater than fourfold faster rate of dna priming over that of ssoprisl under optimal in vitro conditions the presence of both enzymatically functional primase families in archaea suggests that the dna priming role may be shared on leading or lagging strands during dna replication
