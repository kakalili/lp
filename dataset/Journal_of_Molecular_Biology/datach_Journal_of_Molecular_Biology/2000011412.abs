an archaeal holliday junction resolving enzyme from sulfolobus solfataricus exhibits unique properties edited by j karn
the rearrangement and repair of dna by homologous recombination often involves the creation of holliday junctions which must be cleaved by junction specific endonucleases to yield recombinant duplex dna products holliday junction resolving enzymes are a ubiquitous class of proteins with diverse structural and mechanistic characteristics we have characterised an endonuclease hje from the thermophilic crenarchaeote sulfolobus solfataricus that exhibits a high degree of specificity for holliday junctions via an apparently novel mechanism hje resolves four way dna junctions by the introduction of paired nicks in a reaction that is independent of the local nucleotide sequence but is restricted solely to strands that are continuous in the stacked x form of the junction three way dna junctions are cleaved only when the presence of a bulge in one strand allows the junction to stack in an analogous manner to four way junctions these properties differentiate hje from all other known junction resolving enzymes
