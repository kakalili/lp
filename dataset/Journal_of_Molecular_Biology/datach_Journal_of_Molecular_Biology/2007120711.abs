crystal structures of the luciferase and green fluorescent protein from renilla reniformis
due to its ability to emit light the luciferase from renilla reniformis rluc is widely employed in molecular biology as a reporter gene in cell culture experiments and small animal imaging to accomplish this bioluminescence the  kda enzyme catalyzes the degradation of its substrate coelenterazine in the presence of molecular oxygen resulting in the product coelenteramide carbon dioxide and the desired photon of light we successfully crystallized a stabilized variant of this important protein rluc  and herein present the first structures for any coelenterazine using luciferase these structures are based on high resolution data measured to     and demonstrate a classic    hydrolase fold we also present data of a coelenteramide bound luciferase and reason that this structure represents a secondary conformational form following shift of the product out of the primary active site during the course of this work the structure of the luciferase s accessory green fluorescent protein rrgfp was also determined and shown to be highly similar to that of aequorea victoria gfp
