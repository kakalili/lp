tandem phd fingers of morf moz acetyltransferases display selectivity for acetylated histone h and are required for the association with chromatin
morf moz monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein related factor and moz are catalytic subunits of histone acetyltransferase hat complexes essential in hematopoiesis neurogenesis skeletogenesis and other developmental programs and implicated in human leukemias the canonical hat domain of morf moz is preceded by a tandem of plant homeodomain phd fingers whose biological roles and requirements for morf moz activity are unknown here we demonstrate that the tandem phd  fingers of morf recognize the n terminal tail of histone h  acetylation of lys  h k ac or lys  h k ac enhances binding of morf phd  to unmodified h peptides twofold to threefold the selectivity for acetylated h tail is conserved in the double phd  fingers of moz this interaction requires the intact n terminus of histone h and is inhibited by trimethylation of lys  biochemical analysis using nmr fluorescence spectroscopy and mutagenesis identified key amino acids of morf phd  necessary for the interaction with histones fluorescence microscopy and immunoprecipitation experiments reveal that both phd fingers are required for binding to h k ac in vivo and localization to chromatin the hat assays indicate that the interaction with h k ac may promote enzymatic activity in trans together our data suggest that the phd  fingers play a role in moz morf hats association with the chromatic regions enriched in acetylated marks
