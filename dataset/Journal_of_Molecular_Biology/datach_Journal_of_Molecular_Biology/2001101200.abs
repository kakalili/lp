the two mitochondrial heat shock proteins   ssc and ssq  compete for the cochaperone mge  edited by m yaniv
two members of the heat shock protein  kda hsp  family ssc and ssq  perform important functions in the mitochondrial matrix the essential ssc is an abundant atp binding protein required for both import and folding of mitochondrial proteins the function of ssc is supported by an interaction with the preprotein translocase subunit tim  the cochaperone mdj  and the nucleotide exchange factor mge  in contrast only limited information is available on ssq  so far a basic characterization of ssq has demonstrated its involvement in the maintenance of mitochondrial dna the maturation of the yeast frataxin yfh  after import and assembly of the mitochondrial fe s cluster here we analyzed the biochemical properties and the interaction partners of ssq in detail ssq showed typical chaperone properties by binding to unfolded substrate proteins in an atp regulated manner ssq was able to form a specific complex with the nucleotide exchange factor mge  in particular complex formation in organello was enhanced significantly when ssc was inactivated selectively however even under these conditions no interaction of ssq with the two other mitochondrial hsp  cochaperones tim  and mdj  was observed the ssq mge interaction showed a lower overall stability but the same characteristic nucleotide dependence as the ssc mge interaction a quantitative analysis of the interaction properties indicated a competition of ssq with ssc for binding to mge  perturbation of mge function or amounts resulted in direct effects on ssq activity in intact mitochondria we conclude that mitochondria represent the unique case where two hsp s compete for the interaction with one nucleotide exchange factor
