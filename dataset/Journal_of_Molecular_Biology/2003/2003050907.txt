The ETS domain of murine PU.1 tolerates a large number of DNA cognates bearing a central consensus 5′-GGAA-3′ that is flanked by a diverse combination of bases on both sides. Previous attempts to define the sequence selectivity of this DNA binding domain by combinatorial methods have not successfully predicted observed patterns among in vivo promoter sequences in the genome, and have led to the hypothesis that energetic coupling occurs among the bases in the flanking sequences. To test this hypothesis, we determined, using thermodynamic cycles, the complex stabilities and base coupling energies of the PU.1 ETS domain for a set of 26 cognate variants (based on the λB site of the Igλ2-4 enhancer, 5′-AATAAAAGGAAGTGAAACCAA-3′) in which flanking sequences up to three bases upstream and/or two bases downstream of the core consensus are substituted. We observed that both cooperative and anticooperative coupling occurs commonly among the flanking sequences at all the positions investigated. This phenomenon extends at least three bases in the 5′ side and is, at least on our experimental data, due exclusively to pairwise interactions between the flanking bases, and not changes in the local environment of the DNA groove floor. Energetic coupling also occurs between the flanking sides across the core consensus, suggesting long-range conformational effects along the DNA target and/or in the protein. Our data provide an energetic explanation for the pattern of flanking bases observed among in vivo promoter sequences and reconcile the apparent discrepancies raised by the combinatorial experiments. We also discuss the significance of base coupling in light of an indirect readout mechanism in ETS/DNA site recognition.
