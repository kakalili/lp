chs insulator mediated alleviation of promoter interference during cell based expression of tandemly associated transgenes
expression of multiple transgenes in cells or whole organisms is a powerful tool for basic research of various biological functions and potentially for clinical applications such as gene therapy as a model system for this purpose multi cdna expression clones were constructed harboring two tandemly situated fluorescent protein cdnas as reporter genes on a single plasmid when   cells were transfected transiently the downstream gene displayed significantly lower expression when compared with the upstream cdna such transcriptional interference was markedly alleviated by inserting an insulator cassette of chs elements derived from the chicken  globin locus at a site between two neighboring cdnas the introduction of chs resulted in a drastic increase of the expression level of the downstream cdna ensuring comparable expression levels of the tandem transgenes using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we demonstrated that ctcf and usf that recruit histone modifying complexes are bound to the chs region depletion of ctcf or usf by sirna resulted in relief of the diminished effect our data thus indicate that ctcf and histone modifiers recruited by usf cooperatively mediate the suppression of transcriptional interference between apposed genes presumably by facilitating active chromatin conformation over the transgenes
