structural basis of signaling blockade by anti il  antibody lebrikizumab
the cytokine interleukin   il   is a major effector molecule for t helper type  inflammation and is pathogenic in allergic diseases such as asthma the effects of il  are mediated via a pathway that is initiated by binding to a heterodimeric receptor consisting of il  r  and il r  antibodies raised against il  can block its inflammatory effects by interfering with binding to either of the two receptor polypeptides lebrikizumab is a monoclonal anti il  antibody that has shown clinical benefit in a phase ii study for the treatment of moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma here we report the molecular structure of il  in complex with the fab from lebrikizumab by x ray crystallography at    resolution we show that lebrikizumab inhibits il  signaling by binding to il  with very high affinity and blocking il  binding to il r  in addition we use site directed mutations to identify the most important antibody contributors to binding our studies define key features of lebrikizumab binding and its mechanism of action that may contribute to its clinical effects
