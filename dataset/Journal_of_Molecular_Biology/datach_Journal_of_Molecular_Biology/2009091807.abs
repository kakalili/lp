highly cooperative recruitment of ets  and release of autoinhibition by pax
pax  paired box binding factor  is a critical regulator of transcription and lineage commitment in b lymphocytes in b cells mb  ig  immunoglobulin associated   promoter transcription is activated by pax through its recruitment of e  like transforming sequence ets family proteins to a composite site the p ebs pax ets binding site  previously x ray crystallographic analysis revealed a network of contacts between the dna binding domains of pax and ets  while bound to the p ebs here we report that pax assembles these ternary complexes via highly cooperative interactions that overcome the autoinhibition of ets  using recombinant proteins we calculated kd app values for the binding of pax  ets  and ga binding proteins separately or together to the p ebs by itself pax binds the p ebs with high affinity kd   nm  ets       bound the p ebs by itself with low affinity kd   nm  however autoinhibited ets       alone does not bind detectably to the suboptimal sequences of the p ebs recruitment of ets       or ets       resulted in highly efficient ternary complex assembly with pax  pax counteracts autoinhibition and increases binding of ets  of the mb  promoter by gt   fold mutation of pax gln  to alanine q a enhances promoter binding by pax  however q a greatly reduces recruitment of ets       and ets       by pax    or gt   fold respectively  thus gln  of pax is essential for overcoming ets  autoinhibition pax wild type and q a each recruited ga binding protein    to the mb  promoter with similar affinities but recruitment was less efficient than that of ets  reduced by   fold  our results suggest a mechanism that allows pax to overcome autoinhibition of ets  dna binding in summary these data illustrate requirements for partnerships between ets proteins and pax
