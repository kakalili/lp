molecular insight into the conformational dynamics of the elongin bc complex and its interaction with hiv  vif
the human immunodeficiency virus type  virion infectivity factor vif inhibits the innate viral immunity afforded by the apobec family of cytidine deaminases vif targets the apobec family for poly ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation by linking the elongin bc dependent ubiquitin ligase complex with the apobec proteins the interaction between vif and the heterodimeric elongin bc complex which is mediated by vif s viral suppressor of cytokine signaling box is essential for vif function the biophysical consequences of the full length vif elongin bc interaction have not been extensively reported in this study hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry was used to dissect the vif elongin bc interaction elongin c was found to be highly dynamic in the elongin bc complex while elongin b was much more stable recombinant full length vif interacted with the elongin bc complex in vitro with a kd of    m and resulted in observable changes in deuterium uptake in both elongin c and b upon binding to elongin bc no significant global conformational changes were detected in vif by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry but a short fragment of vif that consisted of the viral suppressor of cytokine signaling box showed decreased deuterium incorporation upon elongin bc incubation suggesting that this region folds upon binding
