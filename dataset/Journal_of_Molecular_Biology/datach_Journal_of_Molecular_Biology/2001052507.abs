the regb rega two component regulatory system controls synthesis of photosynthesis and respiratory electron transfer components in rhodobacter capsulatus edited by n m chua
recently we demonstrated that the regb rega two component regulatory system from rhodobacter capsulatus functions as a global regulator of metabolic processes that either generate or consume reducing equivalents for example the regb rega system controls expression of such energy generating processes as photosynthesis and hydrogen utilization in addition regb rega also control nitrogen and carbon fixation pathways that utilize reducing equivalents here we use a combination of dnase i protection and plasmid based reporter expression studies to demonstrate that rega directly controls synthesis of cytochrome cbb and ubiquinol oxidases that function as terminal electron acceptors in a branched respiratory chain we also demonstrate that rega controls expression of cytochromes c  cy and the cytochrome bc complex that are involved in both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transfer events these data provide evidence that the regb rega two component system has a major role in controlling the synthesis of numerous processes that affect reducing equivalents in rhodobacter capsulatus
