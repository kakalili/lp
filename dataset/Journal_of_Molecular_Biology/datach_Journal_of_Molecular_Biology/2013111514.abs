the c b domain is the primary ca  sensor in doc b a structural and functional analysis
doc b double c domain protein is thought to be a high affinity ca  sensor for spontaneous and asynchronous neurotransmitter release to elucidate the molecular features underlying its physiological role we determined the crystal structures of its isolated c a and c b domains and examined their ca  binding properties we further characterized the solution structure of the tandem domains c ab using small angle x ray scattering in parallel we tested structure  function correlates with live cell imaging tools we found that despite striking structural similarity c b binds ca  with considerably higher affinity than c a the c ab solution structure is best modeled as two domains with a highly flexible orientation and no difference in the presence or absence of ca  in addition kinetic studies of c ab demonstrate that in the presence of unilamellar vesicles ca  binding is stabilized as reflected by the   fold slower rate of ca  dissociation than in the absence of vesicles in cells isolated c b translocates to the plasma membrane pm with an ec  of  nm while the c a does not translocate at submicromolar ca  concentrations supporting the biochemical observations nevertheless c ab translocates to the pm with an  fold lower ec  and to a greater extent than c b our results together with previous studies reveal that the c b is the primary ca  sensing unit in doc b whereas c a enhances the interaction of c ab with the pm
