binding mode prediction for a flexible ligand in a flexible pocket using multi conformation simulated annealing pseudo crystallographic refinement  edited by j thornton
we describe multi conformation simulated annealing pseudo crystallographic refinement mcsa pcr  a technique developed for predicting the binding mode of a flexible ligand in a flexible binding pocket to circumvent the local minimum problem efficiently this method performs multiple independent cycles of simulated annealing with explicit solvent   growing  the ligand in the binding pocket each time from the ensemble of structures a pseudo crystallographic electron density map is calculated and then conventional crystallographic refinement methods are used to best fit a single optimal structure into the density map the advantage of the mcsa pcr method is that it provides a direct means to evaluate the accuracy and uniqueness of the calculated solution provides a measure of ligand and protein dynamics from the refined b factors and facilitates comparison with x ray crystallographic data here we show that our mcsa pcr method succeeds in predicting the correct binding mode of the vsv peptide to the major histocompatibility complex mhc receptor importantly there is a significant correlation between the experimentally determined crystallographic water molecules and water density observed in the pseudo map by mcsa pcr furthermore comparison of different approaches for extracting a single most probable structure from the calculated ensemble reveals the power of the pcr method and provides insights into the nature of the energetic landscape
