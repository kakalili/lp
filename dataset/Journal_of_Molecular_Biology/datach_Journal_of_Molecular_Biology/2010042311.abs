the effect of ribosome assembly cofactors on in vitro  s subunit reconstitution
ribosome biogenesis is facilitated by a growing list of assembly cofactors including helicases gtpases chaperones and other proteins but the specific functions of many of these assembly cofactors are still unclear the effect of three assembly cofactors on  s ribosome assembly was determined in vitro using a previously developed mass spectrometry based method that monitors the rrna binding kinetics of ribosomal proteins the essential gtpase era caused several late binding proteins to bind rrna faster when included in a  s reconstitution rimp enabled faster binding of s and s  and inhibited the binding of s  and s  perhaps by blocking those proteins binding sites rimm caused proteins s and s  to bind dramatically faster these quantitative kinetic data provide important clues about the roles of these assembly cofactors in the mechanism of  s biogenesis
