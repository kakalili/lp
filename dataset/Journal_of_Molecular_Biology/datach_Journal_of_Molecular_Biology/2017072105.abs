structural basis for receptor selectivity by the whitewater arroyo mammarenavirus
whitewater arroyo virus belongs to the  new world  group of mammarenaviruses that reside in rodent reservoirs and are prevalent in north and south americas clades b and a b of new world mammarenaviruses use transferrin receptor  tfr  for entry while all of these viruses use rodent derived tfr orthologs some can also use the human tfr and thereby infect humans although we have structural information for tfr recognition by pathogenic virus we do not know what the structural differences are between the receptor binding domains of pathogenic and non pathogenic viruses that allow some but not all viruses to utilize the human receptor for entry the poor understanding of the molecular determinants of mammarenavirus host range and thus pathogenicity is partly due to the low sequence similarity between the receptor binding domains from these viruses and the limited available structural information that preclude the use of modeling approaches here we present the first crystal structure of a receptor binding domain of a non pathogenic clade a b mammarenavirus this structure reveals the magnitude of structural differences within the receptor binding domains of tfr tropic viruses our structural and sequence analyses indicate that the same structural incompatibilities with the human receptor equally affect both pathogenic and non pathogenic mammarenaviruses non pathogenic viruses do not have specific structural elements that prevent them from using the human receptor instead the ability to utilize the human receptor directly depends on the extent of weak interactions throughout the receptor binding site that in some viruses are sufficiently strong to overcome the structural incompatibilities
