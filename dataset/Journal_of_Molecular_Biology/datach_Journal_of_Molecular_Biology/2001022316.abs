solution structure of grb reveals extensive flexibility necessary for target recognition edited by p e wright
grb is an adaptor protein composed of a single sh domain flanked by two sh domains grb functions as an important evolutionary conserved link between a variety of cell membrane receptors and the ras map kinase signaling cascade here we describe the solution structure of grb as revealed by nmr and small angle x ray scattering measurements we demonstrate that grb is a flexible protein in which the c terminal sh domain is connected to the sh domain via a flexible linker this is in contrast to the previously described grb crystal structure which showed a compact structure with intramolecular contact between two sh domains binding experiments on grb and peptides containing two different proline rich sequences indicate that grb adapts the relative position and orientation of the two sh domains to bind bivalently to the target peptide sequences
