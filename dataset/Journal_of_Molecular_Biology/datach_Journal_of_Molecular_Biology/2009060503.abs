probing the roles of the two different dimers mediated by the receiver domain of the response regulator phob
structural analysis of the escherichia coli response regulator transcription factor phob indicates that the protein dimerizes in two different orientations that are both mediated by the receiver domain the two dimers exhibit  fold rotational symmetry one involves the       surface and the other involves the     surface the       dimer is observed when the protein is crystallized in the presence of the phosphoryl analog bef  while the     dimer is observed in its absence from these studies a model of the inactive and active states of phob has been proposed that involves the formation of two distinct dimers in order to gain further insight into the roles of these dimers we have engineered a series of mutations in phob intended to perturb each of them selectively our results indicate that perturbation of the       surface disrupts phosphorylation dependent dimerization and dna binding as well as phob mediated transcriptional activation of phoa while perturbations to the     surface do not furthermore experiments with a gcn leucine zipper phob chimera protein indicate that phob is activated through an intermolecular mechanism together these results support a model of activation of phob in which phosphorylation promotes dimerization via the       face which enhances dna binding and thus the ability of phob to regulate transcription
