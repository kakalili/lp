ubsrd the ubiquitin structural relational database
the structurally defined ubiquitin like homology fold ubl can engage in several unique protein  protein interactions and many of these complexes have been characterized with high resolution techniques using rosetta s structural classification tools we have created the ubiquitin structural relational database ubsrd  an sql database of features for all   ubl containing structures in the pdb allowing users to browse these structures by protein  protein interaction and providing a platform for quantitative analysis of structural features we used ubsrd to define the recognition features of ubiquitin ubq and sumo observed in the pdb and the orientation of the ubq tail while interacting with certain types of proteins while some of the interaction surfaces on ubq and sumo overlap each molecule has distinct features that aid in molecular discrimination additionally we find that the ubq tail is malleable and can adopt a variety of conformations upon binding ubsrd is accessible as an online resource at rosettadesign med unc edu ubsrd
