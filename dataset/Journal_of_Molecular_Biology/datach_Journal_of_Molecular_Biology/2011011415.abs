structural and thermodynamic characterization of metal ion binding in streptococcus suis dpr
the use of protein cages for the creation of novel inorganic nanomaterials has attracted considerable attention in recent years ferritins are among the most commonly used protein cages in nanoscience accordingly the binding of various metals to ferritins has been studied extensively dps dna binding protein from starved cells like proteins belong to the ferritin superfamily in contrast to ferritins dps like proteins form  mers instead of  mers have a different ferroxidase center and are able to store a smaller amount of iron atoms in a hollow cavity up to     instead of the     iron atoms found in ferritins  with the exception of iron the binding of other metal cations to dps proteins has not been studied in detail here the binding of six divalent metal ions zn  mn  ni  co  cu  and mg  to streptococcus suis dps like peroxide resistance protein ssdpr was characterized by x ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry itc  all metal cations except for mg  were found to bind to the ferroxidase center similarly to fe  with moderate affinity binding constants between      m   and     m    the stoichiometry of binding as deduced by itc data suggested the presence of a dication ferroxidase site no other metal binding sites were identified in the protein the results presented here demonstrate the ability of ssdpr to bind various metals as substitutes for iron and will help in better understanding protein  metal interactions in the dps family of proteins as potential metal nanocontainers
