the translation initiation functions of if  targets for thiostrepton inhibition
bacterial translation initiation factor if was localized on the ribosome by rrna cleavage using free cu ii    orthophenanthroline the results indicated proximity of if to helix   to the sarcin  ricin loop and to helices  and   which constitute the  l  thiostrepton  stem loops of  s rrna these findings prompted an investigation of the l  contribution to if activity and a re examination of the controversial issue of the effect on if functions of thiostrepton a peptide antibiotic known primarily as a powerful inhibitor of translocation ribosomes lacking l  were found to have wild type capacity to bind if but a strongly reduced ability to elicit its gtpase activity we found that thiostrepton caused a faster recycling of this factor on and off the  s ribosomes and  s subunits which in turn resulted in an increased rate of the multiple turnover if dependent gtpase although thiostrepton did not inhibit the p site binding of fmet trna the a site binding of the ef tu gtp phe trna or the activity of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase center as measured by the formation of fmet puromycin  it severely inhibited if dependent initiation dipeptide formation this inhibition can probably be traced back to a thiostrepton induced distortion of the ribosomal binding site of if  which leads to a non productive interaction between the ribosome and the aminoacyl trna substrates of the peptidyl transferase reaction overall our data indicate that the translation initiation function of if is as sensitive as the translocation function of ef g to thiostrepton inhibition
