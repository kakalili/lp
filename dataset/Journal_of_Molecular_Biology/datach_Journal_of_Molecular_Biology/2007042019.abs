ca versus mg  coordination at the nucleotide binding site of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase
the recently determined crystal structure of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase serca a with a bound atp analogue amppcp reveals a compact state similar to that found in the presence of adp and aluminium fluoride however although the two ca  binding sites in the membrane are known to be occluded in the latter state in the amppcp bound state the ca  binding sites are not occluded under conditions with physiological levels of mg  and ca  it has been shown that the high concentration   mm of ca  used for crystallization in the presence of mg  may be responsible for the discrepancy to determine whether ca  competes with mg  and affects the nucleotide binding site we have subjected the amppcp and adp alf   bound forms to crystallographic analysis by anomalous difference fourier maps and we have compared amppcp bound forms crystallized in the absence or in the presence of mg  we found that ca  rather than mg  binds together with amppcp at the phosphorylation site whereas the adp alf   complex is associated with two magnesium ions these results address the structure of the phosphorylation site before and during phosphoryl transfer the bound caamppcp nucleotide may correspond to the activated pre complex formed immediately before phosphorylation whereas the mg adp alf   transition state complex reflects the preference for mg  in catalysis in addition we have identified a phosphatidylcholine lipid molecule bound at the cytosol  membrane interface
