discoidin domain receptor  inhibits fibrillogenesis of collagen type
discoidin domain receptors ddr and ddr  are widely expressed cell surface receptors which bind to and are activated by collagens including collagen type  activation of ddrs and the resulting downstream signaling is known to regulate the extracellular matrix however little is known about how ddrs interact with collagen and its direct impact on collagen regulation here we have established that by binding to collagen the extracellular domain ecd of ddr inhibits collagen fibrillogenesis and alters the morphology of collagen type  fibers our in vitro assays utilized ddr fc fusion proteins which contain only the ecd of ddr  using surface plasmon resonance we confirmed that further oligomerization of ddr fc by means of anti fc antibody greatly enhances its binding to immobilized collagen type  collagen turbidity measurements and biochemical assays indicated that ddr delays the formation of collagen fibrils atomic force microscopy of soluble collagen revealed that a predominately monomeric state of collagen was present with ddr  while control solutions had an abundance of polymeric collagen transmission electron microscopy of collagen fibers showed that the native periodic banded structure of collagen fibers was weakened and nearly absent in the presence of ddr  further using a cell based assay we demonstrate that overexpression of full length ddr inhibits fibrillogenesis of collagen type  our results demonstrate a novel and important functional role of the ddr ecd that may contribute to collagen regulation via modulation of fibrillogenesis
