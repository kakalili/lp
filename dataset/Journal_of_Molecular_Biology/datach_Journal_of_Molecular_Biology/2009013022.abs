early closure of a long loop in the refolding of adenylate kinase a possible key role of non local interactions in the initial folding steps
most globular protein chains when transferred from high to low denaturant concentrations collapse instantly before they refold to their native state the initial compaction of the protein molecule is assumed to have a key effect on the folding pathway but it is not known whether the earliest structures formed during or instantly after collapse are defined by local or by non local interactions  that is by secondary structural elements or by loop closure of long segments of the protein chain stable closure of one or several long loops can reduce the chain entropy at a very early stage and can prevent the protein from following non productive pathways whose number grows exponentially with the length of the protein chain in escherichia coli adenylate kinase ak  about seven long loops define the topology of the native structure we selected four loop forming sections of the chain and probed the time course of loop formation during refolding of ak we labeled the termini of the loop segments with tryptophan and cysteine  amidosalicylic acid this donor acceptor pair of probes used with fluorescence resonance excitation energy transfer spectroscopy fret is suitable for detecting very short distances and thus is able to distinguish between random and specific compactions refolding of ak was initiated by stopped flow mixing followed simultaneously by donor and acceptor fluorescence and analyzed in terms of energy transfer efficiency and distance in the collapsed state of ak observed after the  ms dead time of the instrument one of the selected segments shows a native like separation of its termini it forms a loop already in the collapsed state a second segment that includes the first but is longer by  residues shows an almost native like separation of its termini in contrast a segment that is shorter but part of the second segment shows a distance separation of its termini as high as a segment that spans almost the whole protein chain we conclude that a specific network of non local interactions the closure of one or several loops can play an important role in determining the protein folding pathway at its early phases
