hydrophobic interaction between the sh domain and the kinase domain is required for the activation of csk
the protein tyrosine kinase c terminal src kinase csk is activated by the engagement of its src homology sh  domain however the molecular mechanism required for this is not completely understood the crystal structure of the active csk indicates that csk could be activated by contact between the sh domain and the     c loop in the n terminal lobe of the kinase domain to study the importance of this interaction for the sh domain mediated activation of csk we mutated the amino acid residues forming the contacts between the sh domain and the     c loop the mutation of the     c loop ala  to glycine and of the sh domain tyr   tyr   leu   and leu  to alanine resulted in the inability of the sh domain ligand to activate csk furthermore the overexpressed csk mutants a  g y  a y  a l  a and l  a were unable to efficiently inactivate endogenous src in human embryonic kidney   cells the results suggest that the sh domain mediated activation of csk is dependent on the binding of the     c loop ala  to the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side chains of tyr   tyr   leu   and leu  on the surface of the sh domain
