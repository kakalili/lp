conserved intermediates on the assembly pathway of double stranded rna bacteriophages
double stranded rna dsrna viruses are complex rna processing machines that sequentially perform packaging replication and transcription of their genomes in order to characterize the assembly intermediates of such a machine we have developed an efficient in vitro assembly system for the procapsid of bacteriophage   the major structural protein p is a stable and soluble tetramer three tetramers associate with a p monomer rna dependent rna polymerase to form the nucleation complex this complex is further stabilized by a p hexamer packaging motor  further assembly proceeds via rapid addition of individual building blocks the incorporation of the packaging and replication machinery is under kinetic control the in vitro assembled procapsids perform packaging replication and transcription of viral rna comparison with another dsrna phage    indicates conservation of key assembly intermediates in the absence of sequence homology and suggests that a general assembly mechanism for the dsrna virus lineage may exist
