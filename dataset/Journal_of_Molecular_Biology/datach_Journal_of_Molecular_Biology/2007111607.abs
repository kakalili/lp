allosteric loss of function mutations in hiv  nef from a long term non progressor
activation of src family kinases by human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  nef may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hiv aids here we investigated whether diverse nef sequences universally activate hck a src family member expressed in macrophages and other hiv  target cells in general we observed that hck activation is a highly conserved nef function however we identified an unusual nef variant from an hiv positive individual that did not develop aids which failed to activate hck despite the presence of conserved residues linked to hck sh domain binding and kinase activation amino acid sequence alignment with active nef proteins revealed differences in regions not previously implicated in hck activation including a large internal flexible loop absent from available nef structures substitution of these residues in active nef compromised hck activation without affecting sh domain binding these findings show that residues at a distance from the sh domain binding site influence nef interactions allosterically with a key effector protein linked to aids progression
