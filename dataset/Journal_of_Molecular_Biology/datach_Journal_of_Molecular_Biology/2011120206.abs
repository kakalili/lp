a disulfide free single domain vl intrabody with blocking activity towards huntingtin reveals a novel mode of epitope recognition
we present the crystal structure and biophysical characterization of a human vl variable domain immunoglobulin ig light chain single domain intrabody that binds to the huntingtin htt protein and has been engineered for antigen recognition in the absence of its intradomain disulfide bond otherwise conserved in the ig fold analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that the  htt vl   domain is a stable monomer under physiological conditions even at concentrations gt    m using peptide spot arrays we identified the minimal binding epitope to be eklmkafeslksfq comprising the n terminal residues    of htt and including the first residue of the poly gln stretch x ray structural analysis of  htt vl both as apo protein and in the presence of the epitope peptide revealed several interesting insights first the role of mutations acquired during the combinatorial selection process of the  htt vl   domain  initially starting from a single chain fv fragment  that are responsible for its stability as an individually soluble ig domain also lacking the disulfide bridge and second a previously unknown mode of antigen recognition revealing a novel paratope the htt epitope peptide adopts a purely  helical structure in the complex with  htt vl and is bound at the base of the complementarity determining regions cdrs at the concave  sheet that normally gives rise to the interface between the vl domain and its paired vh variable domain ig heavy chain domain while only few interactions with cdr l and cdr l are formed notably this noncanonical mode of antigen binding may occur more widely in the area of in vitro selected antibody fragments including other ig like scaffolds possibly even if a vh domain is present
