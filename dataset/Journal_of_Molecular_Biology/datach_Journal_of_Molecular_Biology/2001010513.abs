electron microscopic analysis supports a dual role for the mitochondrial telomere binding protein of candida parapsilosis edited by w baumeister
linear mitochondrial genomes exist in several yeast species which are closely related to yeast that harbor circular mitochondrial genomes several lines of evidence suggest that the conversion from one form to another occurred accidentally through a relatively simple mechanism previously we l t  amp j n  reported the identification of the first mitochondrial telomere binding protein mttbp that specifically binds a sequence derived from the extreme end of candida parapsilosis linear mtdna and sequence analysis of the corresponding nuclear gene mtp revealed that mttbp shares homology with several bacterial and mitochondrial single stranded ss dna binding ssb proteins in this study the dna binding properties of mttbp in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by electron microscopy em  when m  ssdna was used as a substrate mttbp exhibited similar dna binding characteristics as human mitochondrial ssb mttbp formed protein globules along the dna substrate and the bound proteins were randomly distributed indicating that the binding of mttbp to m  ssdna is not highly cooperative em analysis demonstrated that mttbp is able to recognize the   single stranded telomeric overhangs in their natural context using isopycnic centrifugation of mitochondrial lysates of c papsilosis we show that mttbp is a structural part of mitochondrial nucleoids of c parapsilosis and is predominantly bound to the mitochondrial telomeres these data support a dual role of mttbp in mitochondria of c parapsilosis serving both as a typical mitochondrial ssb and as a specific component of the mitochondrial telomeric chromatin
