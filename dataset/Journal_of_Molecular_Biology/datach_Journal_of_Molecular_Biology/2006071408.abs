a novel glycoside hydrolase family   the structure of family   unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase complexed with a disaccharide in comparison with family  enzyme complexed with the disaccharide
yter a hypothetical protein with unknown functions is derived from bacillus subtilis strain   and has an overall structure similar to that of bacterial unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase ugl  although it exhibits little amino acid sequence identity with ugl ugl releases unsaturated glucuronic acid from glycosaminoglycan treated with glycosaminoglycan lyases the amino acid sequence of yter shows a significant homology   identity with the hypothetical protein yesr also from b subtilis strain   to clarify the intrinsic functions of yter and yesr both proteins were overexpressed in escherichia coli purified and characterized based on their gene arrangements in genome and enzyme properties yter and yesr were found to constitute a novel enzyme activity   unsaturated rhamnogalacturonyl hydrolase   classified as new glycoside hydrolase family   this enzyme acts specifically on unsaturated rhamnogalacturonan rg obtained from rg type i treated with rg lyases and releases an unsaturated galacturonic acid the crystal structure of yter complexed with unsaturated chondroitin disaccharide ugl substrate was obtained and compared to the structure of ugl complexed with the same disaccharide the ugl substrate is sterically hindered with the active pocket of yter the protruding loop of yter prevents the ugl substrate from being bound effectively the most likely candidate catalytic residues for general acid base are asp  in yter and asp  in yesr this is supported by three dimensional structural and site directed mutagenesis studies these findings provide molecular insights into novel enzyme catalysis and sequential reaction mechanisms involved in rg i depolymerization by bacteria
