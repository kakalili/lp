first structural evidence of a specific inhibition of phospholipase a by  tocopherol vitamin e and its implications in inflammation crystal structure of the complex formed between phospholipase a and  tocopherol at    resolution
this is the first structural evidence of  tocopherol   tp as a possible candidate against inflammation as it inhibits phospholipase a specifically and effectively the crystal structure of the complex formed between vipera russelli phospholipase a and  tocopherol has been determined and refined to a resolution of    the structure contains two molecules a and b of phospholipase a in the asymmetric unit together with one  tocopherol molecule which is bound specifically to one of them the phospholipase a molecules interact extensively with each other in the crystalline state the two molecules were found in a stable association in the solution state as well thus indicating their inherent tendency to remain together as a structural unit leading to significant functional implications in the crystal structure the most important difference between the conformations of two molecules as a result of their association pertains to the orientation of trp  it may be noted that trp  is located at the mouth of the hydrophobic channel that forms the binding domain of the enzyme the values of torsion angles       and   for both the backbone as well as for the side chain of trp  in molecules a and b are                 and                  respectively the conformation of trp  in molecule a is suitable for binding while that in b hinders the passage of the ligand to the binding site consequently   tocopherol is able to bind to molecule a only while the binding site of molecule b contains three water molecules in the complex the aromatic moiety of  tocopherol is placed in the large space at the active site of the enzyme while the long hydrophobic channel in the enzyme is filled by hydrocarbon chain of  tocopherol the critical interactions between the enzyme and  tocopherol are generated between the hydroxyl group of the six membered ring of  tocopherol and his  n  and asp  o  as characteristic hydrogen bonds the remaining part of  tocopherol interacts extensively with the residues of the hydrophobic channel of the enzyme giving rise to a number of hydrophobic interactions resulting in the formation of a stable complex
