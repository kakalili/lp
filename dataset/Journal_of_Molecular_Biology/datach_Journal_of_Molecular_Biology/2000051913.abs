the phenotype of mutations of the base pair c   g   that closes the tetraloop in the sarcin ricin domain of escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna edited by d e draper
the sarcin ricin domain srd in escherichia coli  s rrna is a part of the site for the association of elongation factors with ribosomes and for that reason is critical for the binding of aminoacyl trna and for translocation during the reiterative elongation reactions of protein synthesis the srd has a gaga tetraloop that is shut off by a watson crick c   g   pair the contribution of this pair to the function of the ribosome has been evaluated by constructing mutations in the nucleotides and determining their phenotype constitutive expression of a plasmid encoded rrnb operon with a g  c transversion mutation that disrupts the watson crick pair was lethal double transversion mutations c  g g  c and c  a g  u that reverse the polarity of the pyrimidine and the purine but restore the potential to form a canonical pair were also lethal induction of transcription of  s rrna with the same mutations but encoded in a plasmid with a  pl promoter and expressed at a lower level retarded growth the sedimentation profiles of ribosomes with transversion mutations in c   and or g   are altered the ratio of  s subunits to  s particles is changed and polysomes are reduced ribosomes with a g  c a c  g g  c or a c  a g  u mutation in  s rrna were not active in protein synthesis indeed they appeared to inhibit the activity of ribosomes with wild type  s rrna transversion mutations in the analogs of c   and g   decreased binding of ef g to srd oligoribonucleotides the same mutations in  s rrna decreased binding of the factor to intact ribosomes the most severe phenotype in growth in protein synthesis and in the binding of ef g was associated with a c  g g  c mutation it is surprising that this was more severe than an analogous c  a g  u mutation a double transition mutation c  u g  a which is not known to have occurred in nature had no effect on the growth of cells or on the function of ribosomes the lethal phenotype of transversion mutations in c   and g   appears to derive from a loss of the capacity of ribosomes to bind ef g and by indirection the ef tu ternary complex
