reciprocal regulation of human immunodeficiency virus  gene expression and replication by heat shock proteins  and
cellular heat shock proteins hsps are induced upon heat shock uv irradiation and microbial or viral infection they are also known to be involved in apoptosis and immune response in addition to their chaperone function although some literature exists regarding the role of hsps in human immunodeficiency virus hiv  infection a clear understanding of their role remains elusive previously we have shown that hsp  a co chaperone of hsp  interacts with hiv  negative regulatory factor nef and is required for nef mediated increase in viral gene expression and replication we now show that hsp  is also present in the nef  hsp  complex reported earlier furthermore hsp  inhibits viral gene expression and replication however hsp  can rescue this down regulation of viral gene expression induced by hsp  we also show that hiv  viral protein r is required for this inhibitory effect of hsp  on viral replication our data further show that hsp  is consistently up regulated in hiv  infection whereas hsp  is down regulated after initial up regulation favoring viral replication finally hsp  expression inhibits the phosphorylation of cyclin dependent kinase  required for high affinity binding of hiv  transactivator of transcription  positive transcription elongation factor b complex to transactivation response rna whereas hsp  seems to induce it thus hsp  and hsp  both closely associated in their chaperone function seem to act contrary to each other in regulating viral gene expression it seems that hsp  favors the host by inhibiting viral replication whereas hsp  works in favor of the virus by inducing its replication thus differential expression of hsp  and hsp  reciprocally regulates viral gene expression and replication in hiv  infection
