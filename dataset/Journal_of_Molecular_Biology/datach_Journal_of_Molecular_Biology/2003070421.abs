crystal structure of the nucleotide binding domain of the abc transporter haemolysin b identification of a variable region within abc helical domains
the abc transporter haemolysin b is a central component of the secretion machinery that translocates the toxin haemolysin a in a sec independent fashion across both membranes of e coli here we report the x ray crystal structure of the nucleotide binding domain nbd of hlyb the molecule shares the common overall architecture of abc transporter nbds however the last three residues of the walker a motif adopt a   helical conformation stabilized by a bound anion in consequence this results in an unusual interaction between the walker a lysine residue and the walker b glutamate residue as these residues are normally required to be available for atp binding for catalysis and for dimer formation of abc domains we suggest that this conformation may represent a latent monomeric form of the nbd surprisingly comparison of available nbd structures revealed a structurally diverse region sdr of about  residues within the helical arm ii domain unique to each of the eight nbds analyzed as this region interacts with the transmembrane part of abc transporters the sdr helps to explain the selectivity and or targeting of different nbds to their cognate transmembrane domains
