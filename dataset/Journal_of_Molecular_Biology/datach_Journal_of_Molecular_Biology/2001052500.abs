the antiterminator nusb enhances termination at a sub optimal rho site edited by m gottesman
interactions between the antiterminator nusb and boxa elements in the nut sites are necessary to ensure  n mediated processive antitermination similarly in the bacterial cell interactions between nusb and boxa elements help rna polymerase to counteract polarity during transcription of rrn operons we analyzed the effects of nusb on intragenic termination at the level of two tandem terminators located in the hisg cistron gtte and gtte  unexpectedly we found that nusb enhances transcription termination at the sub optimal rho site gtte  moreover site directed mutagenesis of a boxa homolog located within gtte and the masking of this element by translating ribosomes demonstrated that the recruitment of nusb in the termination complex is mediated by a boxa element the mutated boxa also abolishes the formation of a nusb dependent complex on gtte rna on the whole results provide evidence that interactions between nusb and boxa can enhance rho dependent termination
