stem loop sl of the hiv   rna packaging signal exhibits weak affinity for the nucleocapsid protein structural studies and implications for genome recognition edited by p e wright
encapsidation of the genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  during retrovirus assembly is mediated by interactions between the nucleocapsid nc domains of assembling gag polyproteins and a    nucleotide segment of the genome known as the  site the hiv   site contains four stem loops sl through sl  all of which are important for genome packaging recent isothermal titration calorimetry itc studies have demonstrated that sl and sl are capable of binding nc with high affinity kd     nm  consistent with proposals for protein interactive functions during packaging to determine if sl may have a similar function nc interactive studies were conducted by nmr and gel shift methods in contrast to previous reports we find that sl binds weakly to nc kd      m  suggesting an alternative function nmr studies indicate that the gaga tetraloop of sl adopts a classical gnra type fold r  purine n  g c a or u  a motif that stabilizes rna tertiary structures in other systems in combination with previously reported gel mobility studies of  site deletion mutants these findings suggest that sl functions in genome recognition not by binding to gag but by stabilizing the structure of the  site differences in the affinities of nc for sl  sl and sl stem loops can now be rationalized in terms of the different structural properties of stem loops that contain ggng sl and sl  and gnra sl  sequences
