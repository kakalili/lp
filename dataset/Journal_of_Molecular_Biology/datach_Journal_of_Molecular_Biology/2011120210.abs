molecular links between the e envelope glycoprotein and nucleocapsid core in sindbis virus
a three dimensional reconstruction of sindbis virus at     resolution presented here provides a detailed view of the virion structure and includes structural evidence for key interactions that occur between the capsid protein cp and transmembrane tm glycoproteins e and e  based on crystal structures of component proteins and homology modeling we constructed a nearly complete pseudo atomic model of the virus notably this includes identification of the  residue cytoplasmic domain of e  cde  which follows a path from the e tm helix to the cp where it enters and exits the cp hydrophobic pocket and then folds back to contact the viral membrane modeling analysis identified three major contact regions between cde and cp and the roles of specific residues were probed by molecular genetics this identified r  and e  of cde and y  and k  of cp as critical for virus assembly the n termini of the cps form a contiguous network that interconnects  pentameric and  hexameric cp capsomers a single glycoprotein spike cross links three neighboring cp capsomers as might occur during initiation of virus budding
