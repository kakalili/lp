crystal structure of human collagen xviii trimerization domain a novel collagen trimerization fold
collagens contain a unique triple helical structure with a repeating sequence g x y  where proline and hydroxyproline are major constituents in x and y positions respectively folding of the collagen triple helix requires trimerization domains once trimerized collagen chains are correctly aligned and the folding of the triple helix proceeds in a zipper like fashion here we report the isolation characterization and crystal structure of the trimerization domain of human type xviii collagen a member of the multiplexin family this domain differs from all other known trimerization domains in other collagens and exhibits a high trimerization potential at picomolar concentrations strong chain association and high specificity of binding are needed for multiplexins which are present at very low levels
