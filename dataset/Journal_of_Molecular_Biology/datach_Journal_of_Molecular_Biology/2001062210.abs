sfl functions via the co repressor ssn tup and the camp dependent protein kinase tpk  edited by j karn
ssn  cyc  is a component of the yeast general corepressor ssn tup that inhibits the transcription of many diversely regulated genes the corepressor does not interact directly with dna but is recruited to different promoters through interactions with distinct pathway specific dna binding repressor proteins using yeast two hybrid and gst chromatography interaction experiments we have determined that sfl  a novel repressor protein interacts directly with ssn  and in vivo repression data suggest that sfl inhibits transcription by recruiting ssn tup via a specific domain in the sfl protein sin and srb  components of specific rna polymerase ii sub complexes that are required for ssn tup repression activity are found to be required for sfl repression function these results indicate a possible mechanism for sfl mediated repression via ssn tup and specific subunits of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immuno precipitation assays demonstrate that sfl is present at the promoters of three ssn tup repressible genes namely flo  hsp  and suc  sfl is known to interact with tpk  a camp dependent protein kinase that negatively regulates sfl function consistently we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase a inhibits sfl dna binding in vitro and that a tpk  mutation increases the levels of sfl protein associated with specific promoter elements in vivo these data indicate a possible mechanism for regulating sfl mediated repression through modulation of dna binding by camp dependent protein kinase dependent phosphorylation taken together with previous data these new observations suggest a link between camp signaling and ssn tup mediated transcriptional repression
