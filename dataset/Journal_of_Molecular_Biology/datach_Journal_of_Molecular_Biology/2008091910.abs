extensive conformational transitions are required to turn on atp hydrolysis in myosin
conventional myosin is representative of biomolecular motors in which the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate atp is coupled to large scale structural transitions both in and remote from the active site the mechanism that underlies such  mechanochemical coupling   especially the causal relationship between hydrolysis and allosteric structural changes has remained elusive despite extensive experimental and computational analyses in this study using combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical simulations and different conformations of the myosin motor domain we provide evidence to support that regulation of atp hydrolysis activity is not limited to residues in the immediate environment of the phosphate specifically we illustrate that efficient hydrolysis of atp depends not only on the proper orientation of the lytic water but also on the structural stability of several nearby residues especially the arg  glu  salt bridge the numbering of residues follows myosin ii in dictyostelium discoideum and the water molecule that spans this salt bridge and the lytic water more importantly by comparing the hydrolysis activities in two motor conformations with very similar active site i e  switches i and ii configurations which distinguished this work from our previous study the results clearly indicate that the ability of these residues to perform crucial electrostatic stabilization relies on the configuration of residues in the nearby n terminus of the relay helix and the  wedge loop   without the structural support from those motifs residues in a closed active site in the post rigor motor domain undergo subtle structural variations that lead to consistently higher calculated atp hydrolysis barriers than in the pre powerstroke state in other words starting from the post rigor state turning on the atpase activity requires not only displacement of switch ii to close the active site but also structural transitions in the n terminus of the relay helix and the  wedge loop   which have been proposed previously to be ultimately coupled to the rotation of the converter subdomain    away
