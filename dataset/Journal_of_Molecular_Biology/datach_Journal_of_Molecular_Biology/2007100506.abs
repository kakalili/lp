evidence for induced fit in bacterial rnase p rna mediated cleavage
rnase p with its catalytic rna subunit is involved in the processing of a number of rna precursors with different structures however precursor trnas are the most abundant substrates for rnase p available data suggest that a trna is folded into its characteristic structure already at the precursor state and that rnase p recognizes this structure the trna d t loop domain tsl region is suggested to interact with the specificity domain of rnase p rna while residues in the catalytic domain interact with the cleavage site here we have studied the consequences of a productive interaction between the tsl region and its binding site tbs in the specificity domain using trna precursors and various hairpin loop model substrates the different substrates were analyzed with respect to cleavage site recognition ground state binding cleavage as a function of the concentration of mg  and the rate of cleavage under conditions where chemistry is suggested to be rate limiting using wild type escherichia coli rnase p rna m rna and m rna variants with structural changes in the tbs region on the basis of our data we conclude that a productive tsl tbs interaction results in a conformational change in the m rna substrate complex that has an effect on catalysis moreover it is likely that this conformational change comprises positioning of chemical groups and mg  at and in the vicinity of the cleavage site hence our findings are consistent with an induced fit mechanism in rnase p rna mediated cleavage
