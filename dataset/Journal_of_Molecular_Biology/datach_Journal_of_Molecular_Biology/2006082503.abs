nucleosome core particles containing a poly da dt sequence element exhibit a locally distorted dna structure
poly da dt dna sequence elements are thought to promote transcription by either excluding nucleosomes or by altering their structural or dynamic properties here the stability and structure of a defined nucleosome core particle containing a  base pair poly da dt element a  ncp was investigated the a  ncp requires a significantly higher temperature for histone octamer sliding in vitro compared to comparable nucleosomes that do not contain a poly da dt element fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that the interactions between the nucleosomal dna ends and the histone octamer were destabilized in a  ncp the crystal structure of a  ncp was determined to a resolution of     the overall structure was maintained except for local deviations in dna conformation these results are consistent with previous in vivo and in vitro observations that poly da dt elements cause only modest changes in dna accessibility and modest increases in steady state transcription levels
