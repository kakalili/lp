covariance analysis of rna recognition motifs identifies functionally linked amino acids edited by f cohen
the rna recognition motif rrm is one of the most common eukaryotic protein motifs rrm sequences form a conserved globular structure known as the rna binding domain rbd or the ribonucleoprotein domain many proteins that contain rrm sequences bind rna in a sequence specific manner to investigate the basis for the rna binding specificity of rrms we subjected   aligned rrm sequences to covariance analysis the analysis revealed a single network of covariant amino acid pairs comprising the buried core of the rbd and a surface patch structural studies have implicated a subset of these residues in rna binding the covariance linkages identify a larger set of amino acid residues including some not directly in contact with bound rna that may influence rna binding specificity
