the crystal structure of zapa and its modulation of ftsz polymerisation
ftsz is part of a mid cell cytokinetic structure termed the z ring that recruits a hierarchy of fission related proteins early in the bacterial cell cycle the widely conserved zapa has been shown to interact with ftsz to drive its polymerisation and to promote ftsz filament bundling thereby contributing to the spatio temporal tuning of the z ring here we show the crystal structure of zapa    kda from pseudomonas aeruginosa at    resolution the electron density reveals two dimers associating via an extensive c terminal coiled coil protrusion to form an elongated anti parallel tetramer in solution zapa exists in a dimer  tetramer equilibrium that is strongly correlated with concentration an increase in concentration promotes formation of the higher oligomeric state the dimer is postulated to be the predominant physiological species although the tetramer could become significant if as ftsz is integrated into the z ring and is cross linked the local concentration of the dimer becomes sufficiently high we also show that zapa binds ftsz with an approximate   molar stoichiometry and that this interaction provokes dramatic ftsz polymerisation and inter filament association as well as yielding filaments single or bundled more stable and resistant to collapse whilst in vitro dynamics of ftsz are well characterised its in vivo arrangement within the ultra structural architecture of the z ring is yet to be determined despite being fundamental to cell division the zapa dimer has single  fold symmetry whilst the bipolar tetramer displays triple  fold symmetry given the symmetry of these zapa oligomers and the polar nature of ftsz filaments the structure of zapa carries novel implications for the inherent architecture of the z ring in vivo
