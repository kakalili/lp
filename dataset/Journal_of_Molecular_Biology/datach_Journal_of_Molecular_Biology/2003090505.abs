visualization of the domain structure of an l type ca  channel using electron cryo microscopy
the three dimensional structure of the skeletal muscle voltage gated l type calcium channel cav   dihydropyridine receptor dhpr was determined using electron cryo microscopy and single particle averaging the structure shows a single channel complex with an approximate total molecular mass of   kda corresponding to the five known subunits of the dhpr and bound detergent and lipid features visible in our structure together with antibody labeling of the  and   subunits allowed us to assign locations for four of the five subunits within the structure the most striking feature of the structure is the extra cellular   subunit that protrudes from the membrane domain in close proximity to the   subunit the cytosolic  subunit is located close to the membrane and adjacent to subunits     and   our structure correlates well with the functional and biochemical data available for this channel and suggests a three dimensional model for the excitation  contraction coupling complex consisting of dhpr tetrads and the calcium release channel
