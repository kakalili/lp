structure and action of the binary c toxin from clostridium botulinum
c toxin from clostridium botulinum is composed of the enzyme component c i which adp ribosylates actin and the binding and translocation component c ii responsible for the interaction with eukaryotic cell receptors and the following endocytosis three c i crystal structures at resolutions of up to     are presented together with a crystal structure of c ii at an appreciably lower resolution and a model of the prepore formed by fragment c iia the c i structure was determined at ph   and at ph   the structural differences are small indicating that c i does not unfold even at a ph value as low as   the adp ribosyl transferase activity of c i was determined for  and    actin and related to that of iota toxin and of mutant s  r of c i that introduced the arginine observed in iota toxin the substantial activity differences between  and    actin cannot be explained by the protein structures currently available the structure of the transport component c ii at ph   was established by molecular replacement using a model of the protective antigen of anthrax toxin at ph   the c terminal receptor binding domain of c ii could not be located but was present in the crystals it may be mobile the relative orientation and positions of the four other domains of c ii do not differ much from those of the protective antigen indicating that no large conformational changes occur between ph   and ph   a model of the c iia prepore structure was constructed based on the corresponding assembly of the protective antigen it revealed a surprisingly large number of asparagine residues lining the pore the interaction between c i and c iia and the translocation of c i into the target cell are discussed
