following the dynamics of changes in solvent accessibility of  s and  s rrna during ribosomal subunit association using synchrotron generated hydroxyl radicals
we have probed the structure and dynamics of ribosomal rna in the escherichia coli ribosome using equilibrium and time resolved hydroxyl radical oh rna footprinting to explore changes in the solvent accessible surface of the rrna with single nucleotide resolution the goal of these studies is to better understand the structural transitions that accompany association of the  s and  s subunits and to build a foundation for the quantitative analysis of ribosome structural dynamics during translation clear portraits of the subunit interface surfaces for  s and  s rrna were obtained by constructing difference maps between the oh protection maps of the free subunits and that of the associated ribosome in addition to inter subunit contacts consistent with the crystal structure additional oh protections are evident in regions at or near the subunit interface that reflect association induced conformational changes comparison of these data with the comparable difference maps of the solvent accessible surface of the rrna calculated for the thermus thermophilus x ray crystal structures shows extensive agreement but also distinct differences as a prelude to time resolved oh footprinting studies the reactivity profiles obtained using fe ii edta and x ray generated oh were comprehensively compared the reactivity patterns are similar except for a small number of nucleotides that have decreased reactivity to oh generated from fe ii edta compared to x rays these nucleotides are generally close to ribosomal proteins which can quench diffusing radicals by virtue of side chain oxidation synchrotron x ray oh footprinting was used to monitor the kinetics of association of the  s and  s subunits the rates individually measured for the inter subunit contacts are comparable within experimental error the application of this approach to the study of ribosome dynamics during the translation cycle is discussed
