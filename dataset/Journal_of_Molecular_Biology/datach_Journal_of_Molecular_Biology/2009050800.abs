allostery in hsp  chaperones is transduced by subdomain rotations
hsp s heat shock protein   kda are central to protein folding refolding and trafficking in organisms ranging from archaea to homo sapiens under both normal and stressed cellular conditions hsp s are comprised of a nucleotide binding domain nbd and a substrate binding domain sbd  the nucleotide binding site in the nbd and the substrate binding site in the sbd are allosterically linked adp binding promotes substrate binding while atp binding promotes substrate release hsp s have been linked to inhibition of apoptosis i e  cancer and diseases associated with protein misfolding such as alzheimer s parkinson s and huntington s it has long been a goal to characterize the nature of allosteric coupling in these proteins however earlier studies of the isolated nbd could not show any difference in overall conformation between the atp state and the adp state hence the question how is the state of the nucleotide communicated between nbd and sbd here we report a solution nmr study of the  kda nbd of hsp  from thermus thermophilus in the adp and amppnp states using the solution nmr methods of residual dipolar coupling analysis we determine that significant rotations occur for different subdomains of the nbd upon exchange of nucleotide these rotations modulate access to the nucleotide binding cleft in the absence of a nucleotide exchange factor moreover the rotations cause a change in the accessibility of a hydrophobic surface cleft remote from the nucleotide binding site which previously has been identified as essential to allosteric communication between nbd and sbd we propose that it is this change in the nbd surface cleft that constitutes the allosteric signal that can be recognized by the sbd
