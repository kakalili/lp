characterization of tightly associated smooth muscle myosin  myosin light chain kinase  calmodulin complexes
a current popular model to explain phosphorylation of smooth muscle myosin smm by myosin light chain kinase mlck proposes that mlck is bound tightly to actin but weakly to smm we found that mlck and calmodulin cam co purify with unphosphorylated smm from chicken gizzard suggesting that they are tightly bound although the mlck smm molar ratio in smm preparations was well below stoichiometric      the ratio was       of that in gizzard tissue fifteen to   of mlck was associated with cam at    nm free ca   there were two mlck pools that bound unphosphorylated smm with kd   and    m and phosphorylated smm with kd   and    m using an in vitro motility assay to measure actin sliding velocities we showed that the co purifying mlck  cam was activated by ca  and phosphorylation of smm occurred at a pca  of   and at a hill coefficient of   similar properties were observed from reconstituted mlck  cam  smm using motility assays co sedimentation assays and on coverslip enzyme linked immunosorbent assays to quantify proteins on the motility assay coverslip we provide strong evidence that most of the mlck is bound directly to smm through the telokin domain and some may also be bound to both smm and to co purifying actin through the n terminal actin binding domain these results suggest that this mlck may play a role in the initiation of contraction
