structure dynamics and binding characteristics of the second pdz domain of ptp bl edited by m f summers
the pdz domains of the protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp bl mediate interactions by binding to specific amino acid sequences in target proteins the solution structure of the second pdz domain of ptp bl pdz  displays a compact fold with six  strands and two  helices a unique feature of this domain compared to the canonical pdz fold is an extended flexible loop at the base of the binding pocket termed l  that folds back onto the protein backbone a feature that is shared by both the murine and human orthologues the structure of pdz differs significantly from the orthologous human structure a comparison of structural quality indicators clearly demonstrates that the pdz ensemble is statistically more reasonable than that of the human orthologue the analysis of  n relaxation data for pdz shows a normal pattern with more rigid secondary structures and more flexible loop structures close to the binding pocket leu  and thr  display greater mobility when compared to surrounding residues peptide binding studies demonstrated a lack of interaction between murine pdz and the c terminus of the murine fas cd  receptor suggesting that the fas cd  receptor is not an in vivo target for pdz  in addition pdz specifically binds the c termini of both human fas cd  receptor and the ril protein despite ril containing a non canonical pdz interacting sequence of e x v a model of pdz with the ril peptide reveals that the pdz binding pocket is able to accommodate the bulkier side chain of glutamic acid while maintaining crucial protein to peptide hydrogen bond interactions
