expression improvement and mechanistic study of the retro diels alderase catalytic antibody  f  by site directed mutagenesis
antibody  f  catalyzes the retro diels  alder reaction of the bicyclic prodrug  releasing hno and anthracene  kcat kuncat    earlier x ray crystal structures of fab  f  showed that tryptophan h  at the bottom of the binding pocket interacts by  stacking with the aromatic ring of the substrate antibody  f  was expressed as a chimeric fab and subjected to site directed mutagenesis expression was improved by substituting a serine for a phenylalanine residue on the fv domain surface nine active site mutants were then prepared including replacements at trph   pheh  and serh   catalysis depends mainly on trph  and pheh   catalysis is most likely caused by a combination of shape complementarity and specific electronic interactions between transition state and the aromatic residue h   medium and de solvation effects have no effect on the reaction rate catalysis was improved to kcat kuncat   by substituting phenylalanine for leul  to indirectly enhance  stacking between transition state and trph
