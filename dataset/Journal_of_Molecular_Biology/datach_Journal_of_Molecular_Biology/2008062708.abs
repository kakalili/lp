a betacellulin mutant promotes differentiation of pancreatic acinar ar j cells into insulin producing cells with low affinity of binding to erbb
betacellulin btc is one of the members of the epidermal growth factor egf ligand family of erbb receptor tyrosine kinases it is a differentiation factor as well as a potent mitogen btc promotes the differentiation of pancreatic acinar derived ar j cells into insulin producing cells it independently and preferentially binds to two type i tyrosine kinase receptors the egf receptor erbb  and erbb  however the physiochemical characteristics of btc that are responsible for its preferential binding to these two receptors have not been fully defined in this study to investigate the essential amino acid residues of btc for binding to the two receptors we introduced point mutations into the egf domain of btc employing error prone pcr the receptor binding abilities of   mutants expressed in escherichia coli were assessed by enzyme immunoassay replacement of the glutamic acid residue at position  with a lysine residue in btc was found to produce a significant loss of affinity for binding to erbb  while the affinity of binding to erbb was unchanged in addition the mutant of btc e  k showed less growth promoting activity on balb c t cells compared with that of the wild type btc protein interestingly the btc mutant protein promoted differentiation of pancreatic acinar ar j cells at a high frequency into insulin producing cells compared with ar j cells that were treated with wild type btc protein these results indicate the possibility of designing btc mutants which have an activity of inducing differentiation only without facilitating growth promotion
