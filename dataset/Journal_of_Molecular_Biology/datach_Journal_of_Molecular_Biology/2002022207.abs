xkcm acts on a single protofilament and requires the c terminus of tubulin edited by j karn
the stability of microtubules during the cell cycle is regulated by a number of cellular factors some of which stabilize microtubules and others that promote breakdown xkcm is a kinesin like protein that induces microtubule depolymerization and is required for mitotic spindle assembly we have examined the binding and depolymerization effects of xkcm on different tubulin polymers in order to learn about its mechanism of action zinc induced tubulin polymers characterized by an anti parallel protofilament arrangement are depolymerized by xkcm  indicating that this enzyme acts on a single protofilament gdp tubulin rings which correspond to the low energy state of tubulin are stable only under conditions that inhibit xkcm depolymerizing activity but can be stabilized by xkcm bound to amppnp tubulin polymers made of subtilisin treated tubulin lacking the tubulin c terminal tail are resistant to xkcm induced depolymerization suggesting that the interaction of the acidic tail of tubulin with basic residues in xkcm unique to kin i proteins is required for depolymerization
