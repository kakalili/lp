the role of tropomyosin domains in cooperative activation of the actin  myosin interaction
to establish  tropomyosin tm s structure  function relationships in cooperative regulation of muscle contraction thin filaments were reconstituted with a variety of tm mutants   tm   tm   tm p stm p stm p p stm p p tm and wttm  and force and sliding velocity of the thin filament were studied using an in vitro motility assay in the case of deletion mutants   indicates which of the quasi equivalent repeats in tm was deleted in the case of period p mutants an ala cluster was introduced into the indicated period to strengthen the tm  actin interaction in p p tm the n terminal half of period  was substituted with that of period  to test the quasi equivalence of these two tm periods the reconstitution included bovine cardiac troponin deletion studies revealed that period  is important for the positive cooperative effect of tm on actin filament regulation and that period  also contributes to this effect at low ionic strength but to a lesser degree furthermore tm with one extra ala cluster at period  p s or period  p s did not increase force or velocity whereas tm with two extra ala clusters p p s increased both force and velocity demonstrating interaction between these periods most mutants did not move in the absence of ca  notable exceptions were  tm and p p tm which moved near at the full velocity but with reduced force which indicate impaired relaxation these results are consistent with the mechanism that the tm  actin interaction cooperatively affects actin to result in generation of greater force and velocity
