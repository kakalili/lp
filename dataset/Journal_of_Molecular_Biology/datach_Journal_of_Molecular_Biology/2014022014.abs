c orf  resa is a novel mitochondrial intermembrane space protein connected to respiratory chain assembly
oxidative phosphorylation oxphos in mitochondria takes place at the inner membrane which folds into numerous cristae the stability of cristae depends among other things on the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging complex its components include inner mitochondrial membrane protein mitofilin and outer membrane protein sam  we identified a conserved uncharacterized protein c orf   sel repeat containing  protein selrc   as one of the proteins significantly reduced after the knockdown of sam  and mitofilin we show that c orf  is a mitochondrial soluble intermembrane space protein sam  depletion affects moderately the import and assembly of c orf  into two protein complexes of approximately  kda and  kda we observe that the knockdown of c orf  leads to reduction of levels of proteins belonging to the oxphos complexes the activity of complexes i and iv is reduced in c orf  depleted cells and we observe the strongest defects in the assembly of complex iv therefore we propose c orf  to be a novel factor important for the assembly of respiratory chain complexes in human mitochondria and suggest to name it resa  for respiratory chain assembly
