effects of chloride ion binding on the photochemical properties of salinibacter sensory rhodopsin i
microbial organisms utilize light not only as energy sources but also as signals by which rhodopsins containing retinal as a chromophore work as photoreceptors sensory rhodopsin i sri is a dual photoreceptor that regulates both negative and positive phototaxis in microbial organisms such as the archaeon halobacterium salinarum and the eubacterium salinibacter ruber these organisms live in highly halophilic environments suggesting the possibility of the effects of salts on the function of sri however such effects remain unclear because sri proteins from h salinarum hssri are unstable in dilute salt solutions recently we characterized a new sri protein srsri that is stable even in the absence of salts thus allowing us to investigate the effects of salts on the photochemical properties of sri in this study we report that the absorption maximum of srsri is shifted from   to   nm in a cl  dependent manner with a km of     mm showing that cl  binding sites exist in sri the bathochromic shift was caused not only by nacl but also by other salts nai nabr and nano  implying that i   br   and no   can also bind to srsri in addition the photochemical properties during the photocycle are also affected by chloride ion binding mutagenesis studies strongly suggested that a conserved residue his   is involved in the cl  binding site in light of these results we discuss the effects of the cl  binding to sri and the roles of cl  binding in its function
