interaction of the tylosin resistance methyltransferase rlmaii at its rrna target differs from the orthologue rlmai
rlmaii methylates the n position of nucleotide g  in hairpin  of  s rrna the resultant methyl group extends into the peptide channel of the  s ribosomal subunit and confers resistance to tylosin and other mycinosylated macrolide antibiotics methylation at g  occurs in several groups of gram positive bacteria including the tylosin producer streptomyces fradiae and the pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae recombinant s pneumoniae rlmaii was purified and shown to retain its activity and specificity in vitro when tested on unmethylated  s rrna substrates rlmaii makes multiple footprint contacts with nucleotides in stem  loops    and   and does not interact elsewhere in the rrna binding of rlmaii to the rrna is dependent on the cofactor s adenosylmethionine or s adenosylhomocysteine  rlmaii interacts with the same rrna region as the orthologous enzyme rlmai that methylates at nucleotide g   differences in nucleotide contacts within hairpin  indicate how the two methyltransferases recognize their distinct targets
