implications of the progressive self association of wild type human factor h for complement regulation and disease
factor h fh is a major regulator of complement alternative pathway activation it is composed of  short complement regulator scr domains and is genetically associated as a risk factor for age related macular degeneration previous studies on fh suggested that it existed in monomeric and dimeric forms improved x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation methodology for wild type fh permitted a clarification of these oligomeric properties data at lower concentrations revealed a dependence of the x ray radius of gyration values on concentration that corresponded to the weak self association of fh global sedimentation equilibrium fits indicated that a monomer  dimer equilibrium best described the data up to   mg ml with a fitted dissociation constant kd of    m and that higher oligomers formed at increased concentrations the kd showed that about     of serum fh will be monomeric in the absence of other factors size distribution analyses in sedimentation velocity experiments showed that monomeric fh was the major species but that as many as six oligomeric forms co existed with it the data were explained in terms of two weak dimerisation sites recently identified in the scr   and scr    fragments of fh with similar kd values these observations indicate a mechanism for the progressive self association of fh and may be relevant for complement regulation and the formation of drusen deposits that are associated with age related macular degeneration
