a g  c rich palindromic structural motif and a stretch of single stranded purines are required for optimal packaging of mason  pfizer monkey virus mpmv genomic rna
during retroviral rna packaging two copies of genomic rna are preferentially packaged into the budding virus particles whereas the spliced viral rnas and the cellular rnas are excluded during this process specificity towards retroviral rna packaging is dependent upon sequences at the   end of the viral genome which at times extend into gag sequences it has earlier been suggested that the mason  pfizer monkey virus mpmv contains packaging sequences within the   untranslated region utr and gag these studies have also suggested that the packaging determinants of mpmv that lie in the utr are bipartite and are divided into two regions both upstream and downstream of the major splice donor however the precise boundaries of these discontinuous regions within the utr and the role of the intervening sequences between these dipartite sequences towards mpmv packaging have not been investigated employing a combination of genetic and structural prediction analyses we have shown that region  a   immediately downstream of the primer binding site is composed of   nt whereas region  b  is composed of the last   nt of utr and the intervening   nt between these two discontinuous regions do not contribute towards mpmv rna packaging in addition we have identified a  nt g  c rich palindromic sequence with   autocomplementarity within region a that has been predicted to fold into a structural motif and is essential for optimal mpmv rna packaging furthermore we have also identified a stretch of single stranded purines sspurines within the utr and  nt of these sspurines are duplicated in region b the native sspurines or its repeat in region b when predicted to refold as sspurines has been shown to be essential for rna packaging possibly functioning as a potential nucleocapsid binding site findings from this study should enhance our understanding of the steps involved in mpmv replication including rna encapsidation process
