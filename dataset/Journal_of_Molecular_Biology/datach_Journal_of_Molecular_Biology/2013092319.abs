the role of aromatic  aromatic interactions in strand  strand stabilization of  sheets
aromatic  aromatic interactions have long been believed to play key roles in protein structure folding and binding functions however we still lack full understanding of the contributions of aromatic  aromatic interactions to protein stability and the timing of their formation during folding here using an aromatic ladder in the  barrel protein cellular retinoic acid binding protein  crabp  as a case study we find that aromatic  stacking plays a greater role in the phe   phe  cross strand pair while in another pair phe   phe  hydrophobic interactions are dominant the phe   phe  pair spans  strands  and  in the  barrel which lack interstrand hydrogen bonding and we speculate that it compensates energetically for the absence of strand  strand backbone interactions using perturbation analysis we find that both aromatic  aromatic pairs form after the transition state for folding of crabp  thus playing a role in the final stabilization of the  sheet rather than in its nucleation as had been earlier proposed the aromatic interaction between strands  and  in crabp is highly conserved in the intracellular lipid binding protein ilbp family and several lines of evidence combine to support a model wherein it acts to maintain barrel structure while allowing the dynamic opening that is necessary for ligand entry lastly we carried out a bioinformatics analysis and found  examples of aromatic  aromatic interactions across non hydrogen bonded  strands outside the ilbps arguing for the generality of the role played by this structural motif
