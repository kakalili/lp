structural studies on the empty capsids of physalis mottle virus edited by r huber
the three dimensional crystal structure of the empty capsid of physalis mottle tymovirus has been determined to    resolution the empty capsids crystallized in the space group p  leading to  fold non crystallographic redundancy the known structure of physalis mottle virus was used as a phasing model to initiate the structure determination by real space electron density averaging the main differences between the structures of the native and the empty capsids were in residues  to  of the a subunit residues  to  of the b subunit and residues  to  of the c subunit which are ordered only in the native virus particles an analysis of the subunit disposition reveals that the virus has expanded radially outward by      in the empty particles the a subunits move in a direction that makes   to the icosahedral  fold axes of symmetry the b and c subunits move along vectors making   and   to the quasi  fold axes the quaternary organization of the pentameric and hexameric capsomeres are not altered significantly however the pentamer hexamer contacts are reduced therefore encapsidation of rna appears to cause a reduction in the particle radius concomittant with the ordering of the n terminal arm in the three subunits these structural changes in physalis mottle virus appear to be larger than the corresponding changes observed in viruses for which both the empty and full particle structures have been determined
