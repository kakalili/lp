free energy landscapes of peptides by enhanced conformational sampling edited by b honig
the free energy landscapes of peptide conformations in water have been observed by the enhanced conformational sampling method applying the selectively enhanced multicanonical molecular dynamics simulations the conformations of the peptide dimers  gly gly  gly ala  gly ser  ala gly  asn gly  pro gly  pro ala  and ala ala  which were all blocked with n terminal acetyl and c terminal n methyl groups were individually sampled with the explicit tip p water molecules from each simulation trajectory we obtained the canonical ensemble at   k from which the individual three dimensional landscape was drawn by the potential of mean force using the three reaction coordinates the backbone dihedral angle   of the first amino acid the backbone dihedral angle   of the second amino acid and the distance between the carbonyl oxygen of the n terminal acetyl group and the c terminal amide proton the most stable state and several meta stable states correspond to extended conformations and typical  turn conformations and their free energy values were accounted for from the potentials of mean force at the states in addition the contributions from the intra molecular energies of peptides and those from the hydration effects were analyzed consequently the stable  turn conformations in the free energy landscape were consistent with the empirically preferred  turn types for each amino acid sequence the thermodynamic values for the hydration effect were decomposed and they correlated well with the empirical values estimated from the solvent accessible surface area of each molecular conformation during the trajectories the origin of the architecture of protein local fragments was analyzed from the viewpoint of the free energy and its decomposed factors
