crystal structure of nadh dependent ferredoxin reductase component in biphenyl dioxygenase edited by d rees
oxidative biodegradation of aromatic compounds by bacteria usually begins with hydroxylation of the aromatic ring by multi component dioxygenases like benzene dioxygenase biphenyl dioxygenase and others these enzymes are composed of ferredoxin reductase ferredoxin and terminal oxygenase reducing equivalents that originate from nadh are transferred from ferredoxin reductase to ferredoxin and in turn to the terminal oxygenase thus resulting in the activation of a dioxygen bpha is the ferredoxin reductase component of biphenyl dioxygenase from pseudomonas sp strain kks   the amino acid sequence of bpha exhibits significant homology with the putidaredoxin reductase of the cytochrome p  cam system in pseudomonas putida as well as with various other oxygenase coupled nadh dependent ferredoxin reductases onfrs of bacteria to date no structural information has been provided for the ferredoxin reductase component of the dioxygenase systems in order to provide a structural basis for discussing the mechanism of electron transport between ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin crystal structures of bpha and its nadh complex were solved the three dimensional structure of bpha is different from those of ferredoxin reductases whose structures have already been determined but adopts essentially the same fold as the enzymes of the glutathione reductase gr family also the three dimensional structure of the first two domains of bpha adopts a fold similar to that of adrenodoxin reductase adr in the mitochondrial cytochrome p  system comparing the amino acid sequence with what is known of the three dimensional structure of bpha strongly suggests that the other onfrs have secondary structural features that are similar to that of bpha  this analysis of the crystal structures of bpha suggests that lys  and glu  seem to be involved in the hydride transfer from nadh to fad since the amino acid residues around the active site some of which seem to be important to electron transport are highly conserved among onfrs it is likely that the mechanism of electron transport of bpha is quite applicable to other onfrs
