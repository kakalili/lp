In order to understand how inter-subunit association stabilizes oligomeric proteins, a single polypeptide chain variant of heptameric co-chaperonin GroES (tandem GroES) was constructed from Escherichia coli heptameric GroES by linking consecutively the C-terminal of one subunit to the N-terminal of the adjacent subunit with a small linker peptide. The tandem GroES (ESC7) showed properties similar to wild-type GroES in structural aspects and co-chaperonin activity. In unfolding and refolding equilibrium experiments using guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) as a denaturant at a low protein concentration (50 μg ml−1), ESC7 showed a two-state transition with a greater resistance toward Gdn-HCl denaturation (Cm=1.95 M) compared to wild-type GroES (Cm=1.1 M). ESC7 was found to be about 10 kcal mol−1 more stable than the wild-type GroES heptamer at 50 μg ml−1. Kinetic unfolding and refolding experiments of ESC7 revealed that the increased stability was mainly attributed to a slower unfolding rate. Also a transient intermediate was detected in the refolding reaction. Interestingly, at the physiological GroES concentration (&gt;1 mg ml−1), the free energy of unfolding for GroES heptamer exceeded that for ESC7. These results showed that at low protein concentrations (&lt;1 mg ml−1), the covalent linking of subunits contributes to the stability but also complicates the refolding kinetics. At physiological concentrations of GroES, however, the oligomeric state is energetically preferred and the advantages of covalent linkage are lost. This finding highlights a possible advantage in transitioning from multi-domain proteins to oligomeric proteins with small subunits in order to improve structural and kinetic stabilities.
