crystal structure of the atppase subunit and its substrate dependent association with the gatase subunit a novel regulatory mechanism for a two subunit type gmp synthetase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot
guanosine   monophosphate synthetase s  gmps catalyzes the final step of the de novo synthetic pathway of purine nucleotides gmps consists of two functional units that are present as domains or subunits glutamine amidotransferase gatase and atp pyrophosphatase atppase  gatase hydrolyzes glutamine to yield glutamate and ammonia while atppase utilizes ammonia to convert adenyl xanthosine   monophosphate adenyl xmp into guanosine   monophosphate here we report the crystal structure of ph atppase the atppase subunit of the two subunit type gmps from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii ot  ph atppase consists of two domains n domain and c domain and exists as a homodimer in the crystal and in solution the n domain contains an atp binding platform called p loop whereas the c domain contains the xanthosine  monophosphate xmp binding site and also contributes to homodimerization we have also demonstrated that ph gatase the glutamine amidotransferase subunit of the two subunit type gmps from the hyperthermophilic archaeon p horikoshii ot  alone is inactive and that all substrates of ph atppase except for ammonia mg  atp and xmp are required to stabilize the active complex of ph atppase and ph gatase subunits
