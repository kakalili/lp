the energetics of specific binding of at hooks from hmga to target dna
the interaction of the second and third at hooks of hmga  formerly hmgi y  which bind selectively in the minor groove of an at rich dna sequence was studied at different temperatures and ionic strengths by spectropolarimetry spectrofluorimetry isothermal titration calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry the data show that binding of the ten amino acid core element of the two at hooks which penetrates deep into the minor groove is entropically driven both the entropy and enthalpy of association of the peptides to the target dna are positive up to   c the seven amino acid extension of the core in the second at hook which extends out from the minor groove and loops over the phosphodiester backbone adds a substantial negative enthalpic component into the binding of the  residue dbd peptide to dna that corresponds in magnitude to the enthalpy of formation of two hydrogen bonds the ionic strength dependence of the association constant allowed an estimation of the electrostatic component of binding and by subtraction the contribution of the non electrostatic component which results from dehydration of the contacting surfaces and makes up almost   of the total energy of complex formation the exceptionally large positive entropy and enthalpy of association of the core at hook peptides with target dna suggest that the water which is removed from the minor groove of dna upon binding is in a highly ordered state acetylation of the lysine residue in the second at hook which corresponds to lys  of hmga  has little effect on the dna binding so it appears that repression of the hifn  gene which follows this modification is not a direct result of the abrogation of dna binding
