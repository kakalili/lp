determining the turnover of glycosphingolipid species by stable isotope tracer lipidomics
in this study we used water soluble stable mass isotope precursors to measure the turnover of endogenous ceramide cer and glycosphingolipids gsls in hep  cells cells incubated in the presence of  c u glucose showed rapid incorporation of hexose residues with an increased mass of da into gsls different turnover rates of gsl classes and their molecular species were observed approximately   of the glucosylceramide   of the lactosylceramide and   of the globotriaosylceramide species showed a much slower turnover than the rest this demonstrates the existence of different lipid pools where a certain fraction of species survived for a long time in the cells the species with the shortest n amidated fatty acyl groups c   and c   showed a more rapid turnover than those with the longest n amidated fatty acids c   and c    experiments with addition of  c u serine were performed to study de novo synthesis of cer from serine and palmitoyl coa these experiments revealed that de novo synthesis contributes to a minor extent to the total synthesis of new sphingolipids and showed that there is a more rapid formation of the longest cer species c   and c   than of the shortest species c    that is the opposite as observed for the gsls in the experiments with  c u glucose in conclusion this flux lipidomics experimental approach with the addition of  c u glucose to cells allows us to not only study the total turnover but also permit observations of lipid intermediates and metabolic flow of endogenous gsl species at the molecular lipid level
