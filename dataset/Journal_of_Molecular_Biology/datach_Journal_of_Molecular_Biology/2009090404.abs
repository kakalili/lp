structural and functional divergence within the dim ksga family of rrna methyltransferases
the enzymes of the ksga dim family are universally distributed throughout all phylogeny however structural and functional differences are known to exist the well characterized function of these enzymes is to dimethylate two adjacent adenosines of the small ribosomal subunit in the normal course of ribosome maturation and the structures of ksga from escherichia coli and dim from homo sapiens and plasmodium falciparum have been determined to this point no examples of archaeal structures have been reported here we report the structure of dim from the thermophilic archaeon methanocaldococcus jannaschii while it shares obvious similarities with the bacterial and eukaryotic orthologs notable structural differences exist among the three members particularly in the c terminal domain previous work showed that eukaryotic and archaeal dim were able to robustly complement for ksga in e coli here we repeated similar experiments to test for complementarity of archaeal dim and bacterial ksga in saccharomyces cerevisiae however neither the bacterial nor the archaeal ortholog could complement for the eukaryotic dim  this might be related to the secondary non methyltransferase function that dim is known to play in eukaryotic ribosomal maturation to further delineate regions of the eukaryotic dim critical to its function we created and tested ksga dim chimeras of the chimeras only one constructed with the n terminal domain from eukaryotic dim and the c terminal domain from archaeal dim was able to complement suggesting that eukaryotic specific dim function resides in the n terminal domain also where few structural differences are observed between members of the ksga dim family future work is required to identify those determinants directly responsible for dim function in ribosome biogenesis finally we have conclusively established that none of the methyl groups are critically important to growth in yeast under standard conditions at a variety of temperatures
