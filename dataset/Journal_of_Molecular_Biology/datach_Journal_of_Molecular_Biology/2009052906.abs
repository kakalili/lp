structure and in vivo requirement of the yeast spt sh domain
during transcription elongation through chromatin the ser phosphorylated c terminal repeat domain of rna polymerase ii binds the c terminal src homology  sh  domain of the nucleosome re assembly factor spt  this sh domain is unusual in its specificity to bind phosphoserine rather than phosphotyrosine and because it is the only sh domain in the yeast genome here we report the high resolution crystal structure of the sh domain from candida glabrata spt  the structure combines features from both structural subfamilies of sh domains suggesting it resembles a common ancestor of all sh domains two conserved surface pockets deviate from those of canonical sh domains and may explain the unusual phosphoserine specificity differential gene expression analysis reveals that the sh domain is required for normal expression of a subset of yeast genes and is consistent with multiple functions of spt in chromatin transcription
