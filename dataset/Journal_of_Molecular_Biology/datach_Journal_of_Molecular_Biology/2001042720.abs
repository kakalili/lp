functional mutagenesis of aml runx and pebp  cbf  define distinct non overlapping sites for dna recognition and heterodimerization by the runt domain edited by m yaniv
the runt domain family of transcription factors play key roles in transcriptional regulation of definitive hematopoiesis and osteogenesis this transcription factor family is characterized by a dna binding  subunit harboring the runt domain and a secondary subunit   which binds to the runt domain and enhances its interaction with dna missense mutations in the runt domain from either the blood or bone related gene product are associated with the onset of acute human leukemia as well as a disease of skeletal patterning known as cleidocranial dysplasia nmr  footprinting  analysis of runt domain  dna ternary complexes in solution previously identified the likely residues that form the heterodimerization and dna binding surfaces of the runt domain functional mutagenesis at  positions in the runt domain or  confirms the original identification of these interaction surfaces and reveals that the heterodimerization and dna binding surfaces of the runt domain occur at distinct non overlapping sites within the domain the analysis of an additional  disease related missense mutations identified from patients with either blood or bone disease demonstrates that the primary defect in these patients is a failure in dna recognition by the runt domain the molecular basis for the dna binding defect is analyzed in the context of the three dimensional structure of the runt domain in binary and ternary protein dna complexes
