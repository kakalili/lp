mapping of functional domains in f plasmid partition proteins reveals a bipartite sopb recognition domain in sopa
active partition of the f plasmid to dividing daughter cells is assured by interactions between proteins sopa and sopb and a centromere sopc a close homologue of the sop operon is present in the linear prophage n  and together with sopc like sequences it ensures stability of this replicon we have exploited this sequence similarity to construct hybrid sop operons with the aim of locating specific interaction determinants within the sopa and sopb proteins that are needed for partition function and for autoregulation of sopab expression centromere binding was found to be specified entirely by a central  residue region of sopb strongly predicted to form a helix turn helix structure sopb protein also carries a species specific sopa interaction determinant within its n terminal  amino acids and as shown by escherichia coli two hybrid analysis a dimerization domain within its c terminal   f or   n  residues promoter operator binding specificity was located within an n terminal  residue region of sopa which is predicted to contain a helix turn helix motif two other regions of sopa protein one next to the atpase walker a box the other c terminal specify interaction with sopb yeast two hybrid analysis indicated that these regions contact sopb directly evidence for the involvement of the sopa n terminus in autoinhibition of sopa function was obtained revealing a possible new aspect of the role of sopb in sopa activation
