similarity between protein  protein and protein  carbohydrate interactions revealed by two crystal structures of lectins from the roots of pokeweed
the roots of pokeweed phytolacca americana are known to contain the lectins designated pl a pl b pl c pl d  and pl d  of these lectins the crystal structures of two pls the ligand free pl c and the complex of pl d with tri n acetylchitotriose have been determined at    resolution the polypeptide chains of pl c and pl d form three and two repetitive chitin binding domains respectively in the crystal structure of the pl d complex one trisaccharide molecule is shared mainly between two neighboring molecules related to each other by a crystallographic  screw axis and infinite helical chains of complexed molecules are generated by the sharing of ligand molecules the crystal structure of pl c reveals that the molecule is a dimer of two identical subunits whose polypeptide chains are located in a head to tail fashion by a molecular  fold axis three putative carbohydrate binding sites in each subunit are located in the dimer interface the dimerization of pl c is performed through the hydrophobic interactions between the carbohydrate binding sites of the opposite domains in the dimer leading to a distinct dimerization mode from that of wheat germ agglutinin three aromatic residues in each carbohydrate binding site of pl c are involved in the dimerization these residues correspond to the residues that interact mainly with the trisaccharide in the pl d complex and appear to mimic the saccharide residues in the complex consequently the present structure of the pl c dimer has no room for accommodating carbohydrate the quaternary structure of pl c formed through these putative carbohydrate binding residues may lead to the lack of hemagglutinating activity
