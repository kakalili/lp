motifs of serine and threonine can drive association of transmembrane helices edited by g von heijne
known sequence motifs containing key glycine residues can drive the homo oligomerization of transmembrane helices to find other motifs a randomized library of transmembrane interfaces was generated in which glycine was omitted the toxcat system which measures transmembrane helix association in the escherichia coli inner membrane was used to select high affinity homo oligomerizing sequences in this library the two most frequently occurring motifs were sxxssxxt and sxxxssxxt isosteric mutations of any one of the serine and threonine residues to non polar residues abolished oligomerization indicating that the interaction between these positions is specific and requires an extended motif of serine and threonine hydroxyl groups computational modeling of these sequences produced several chemically plausible structures that contain multiple hydrogen bonds between the serine and threonine residues while single serine or threonine side chains do not appear to promote helix association motifs can drive strong and specific association through a cooperative network of interhelical hydrogen bonds
