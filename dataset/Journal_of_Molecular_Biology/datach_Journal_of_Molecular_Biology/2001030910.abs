structural characterization of the n terminal oligomerization domain of the bacterial chromatin structuring protein h ns edited by a r fersht
the h ns protein plays a key role in condensing dna and modulating gene expression in bacterial nucleoids the mechanism by which this is achieved is dependent at least in part on the oligomerization of the protein h ns consists of two distinct domains the n terminal domain responsible for protein oligomerization and the c terminal dna binding domain which are separated by a flexible linker region we present a multidimensional nmr study of the amino terminal  residues of h ns denoted h ns   from salmonella typhimurium which constitute the oligomerization domain this domain exists as a homotrimer which is predicted to be self associated through a coiled coil configuration nmr spectra show an equivalent magnetic environment for each monomer indicating that the polypeptide chains are arranged in parallel with complete  fold symmetry despite the limited resonance dispersion an almost complete backbone assignment for hn  h   n  co and  c  nmr resonances was obtained using a suite of triple resonance experiments applied to uniformly  n   c  n and h  c  n labelled h ns   samples the secondary structure of h ns   has been identified on the basis of the analysis of h   c   c  and  co chemical shifts nh solvent exchange rates intra chain hn hn and medium range nuclear overhauser enhancements noes  within the context of the homotrimer each h ns   protomer consists of three  helices spanning residues      and    respectively a topological model is presented for the symmetric h ns   trimer based upon the combined analysis of the helical elements and the pattern of backbone amide group  n nuclear relaxation rates within the context of axially asymmetric diffusion tensor in this model the longest of the three helices helix  residues    forms a coiled coil interface with the other chains in the homotrimer the two shorter n terminal helices fold back onto the outer surface of the coiled coil core and potentially act to stabilise this configuration
