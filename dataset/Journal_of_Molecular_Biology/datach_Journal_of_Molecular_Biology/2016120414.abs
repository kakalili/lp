analysis of the cleavage mechanism by protein only rnase p using precursor trna substrates with modifications at the cleavage site
ribonuclease p rnase p is the enzyme that endonucleolytically removes   precursor sequences from trna transcripts in all domains of life rnase p activities are either ribonucleoprotein rnp or protein only rnase p prorp enzymes raising the question about the mechanistic strategies utilized by these architecturally different enzyme classes to catalyze the same type of reaction here we analyzed the kinetics and cleavage site selection by prorp from arabidopsis thaliana atprorp  using precursor trnas pre trnas with individual modifications at the canonical cleavage site with either rp or sp phosphorothioate or   deoxy    fluoro    amino or   o methyl substitutions we observed a small but robust rescue effect of sp phosphorothioate modified pre trna in the presence of thiophilic cd  ions consistent with metal ion coordination to the pro sp oxygen during catalysis sp phosphorothioate    deoxy    amino and   o methyl modification redirected the cleavage mainly to the next unmodified phosphodiester in the   direction our findings are in line with the   oh substituent at nucleotide   being involved in an h bonding acceptor function in contrast to bacterial rnase p atprorp was found to be able to utilize the canonical and upstream cleavage site with similar efficiency corresponding to reduced cleavage fidelity  and the two cleavage pathways appear less interdependent than in the bacterial rna based system
