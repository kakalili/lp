role of residues in the tryptophan repeat motif for hiv  reverse transcriptase dimerization
the tryptophan repeat motif of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  reverse transcriptase rt is comprised of a cluster of six tryptophan residues at codons             and   that are highly conserved amongst primate lentiviral rts to determine the contributions of each of these residues for hiv  rt dimerization we introduced changes into cloned dna and tested the mutant subunits for their capacity to mediate heterodimerization in the yeast two hybrid system changes of residue   to either leucine or alanine but not phenylalanine and residue   to leucine resulted in major reductions in  galactosidase activity produced from the reporter gene as compared to yeast expressing wild type p  bait and p  prey fusions subunit selective mutagenesis revealed that the effect of these mutations was mediated mainly through the p  subunit introduction of tryptophan mutants into the bacterial expression vector prt h nb prot showed that rts containing w  a or w  l substitutions but not w  f and w  l were defective for dimerization in vitro consistent with their dimerization defect the w  a w  l and w  l mutants were devoid of rt activity using the yeast two hybrid system we identified several second site suppressors in p  that restored interaction of the p w  a bait to the p w  a prey the suppressors t  i d  g v  a and i  m also restored heterodimerization of bacterially expressed w  a subunits when introduced into the w  a mutant t  i was able to restore rt activity to   of the wild type level examination of the rt structures revealed that k  in p  makes multiple hydrogen bond contacts with residues in the p  loop spanned by w  and w   consistent with this observation the k  a rt mutant was dimerization defective we conclude that mutations at codons   and   in p  impair dimerization by altering the proper positioning of structural elements in between these residues that make important contacts with p
