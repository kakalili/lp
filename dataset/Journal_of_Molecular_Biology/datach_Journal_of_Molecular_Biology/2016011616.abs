structural insights into kctd protein assembly and cullin recognition
cullin  cul  based ubiquitin e ligase complexes catalyze the transfer of ubiquitin from an e enzyme to target substrate proteins in these assemblies the c terminal region of cul binds rbx e ubiquitin while the n terminal region interacts with various btb bric  brac tramtrack broad complex domain proteins that serve as substrate adaptors previous crystal structures of the homodimeric btb proteins klhl  klhl  and spop in complex with the n terminal domain of cul revealed the features required for cul recognition in these proteins a second class of btb domain containing proteins the kctd proteins is also cul substrate adaptors but these do not share many of the previously identified determinants for cul binding we report the pentameric crystal structures of the kctd and kctd btb domains and identify plasticity in the kctd rings we find that the kctd proteins     and  bind to cul with high affinity while the kctd proteins  and  do not have detectable binding finally we confirm the   assembly of kctd cul complexes by cryo electron microscopy and provide a molecular rationale for btb mediated cul binding specificity in the kctd family
