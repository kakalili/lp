The structural features of human eIF4E were investigated by X-ray crystal analyses of its cap analog (m7GTP and m7GpppA) complexes and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of cap-free and cap-bound eIF4Es, as well as the cap-bound Ser209-phosphorylated eIF4E. Crystal structure analyses at 2.0Å resolution revealed that the molecule forms a temple-bell-shaped surface of eight antiparallel β-structures, three α-helices and ten loop structures, where the N-terminal region corresponds to the handle of the bell. This concave backbone provides a scaffold for the mRNA cap-recognition pocket consisting of three receiving parts for the 5′-terminal m7G base, the triphosphate, and the second nucleotide. The m7G base is sandwiched between the two aromatic side-chains of Trp102 and Trp56. The two (m7G)NH–O (Glu103 carboxy group) hydrogen bonds stabilize the stacking interaction. The basic residues of Arg157 and Lys162 and water molecules construct a binding pocket for the triphosphate moiety, where a universal hydrogen-bonding network is formed. The flexible C-terminal loop region unobserved in the m7GTP complex was clearly observed in the m7GpppA complex, as a result of the fixation of this loop by the interaction with the adenosine moiety, indicating the function of this loop as a receiving pocket for the second nucleotide. On the other hand, MD simulation in an aqueous solution system revealed that the cap-binding pocket, especially its C-terminal loop structure, is flexible in the cap-free eIF4E, and the entrance of the cap-binding pocket becomes narrow, although the depth is relatively unchanged. SDS-PAGE analyses showed that this structural instability is highly related to the fast degradation of cap-free eIF4E, compared with cap-bound or 4E-BP/cap-bound eIF4E, indicating the conferment of structural stability of eIF4E by the binary or ternary complex formation. MD simulation of m7GpppA-bound Ser209-phosphorylated eIF4E showed that the size of the cap-binding entrance is dependent on the ionization state in the Ser209 phosphorylation, which is associated with the regulatory function through the switching on/off of eIF4E phosphorylation.
