propensities of aromatic amino acids versus leucine and proline to induce residual structure in the denatured state ensemble of iso  cytochrome c
histidine  heme loop formation in the denatured state of a protein is a sensitive means for probing residual structure under unfolding conditions in this study we use a host  guest approach to investigate the relative tendencies of different amino acids to promote residual structure under denaturing conditions the host for this work is a  amino acid insert of five alanines followed by a lysine engineered immediately following a unique histidine near the n terminus of yeast iso  cytochrome c we substitute the fourth alanine in this sequence haaaxak with x trp phe tyr and leu  the effects of proline are tested with substitutions at positions  and  in the insert hpaaaak and haaaapk respectively  thermodynamic studies on his  heme loop formation in  m guanidine hydrochloride reveal significant stabilization of residual structure by aromatic amino acids particularly trp and phe and minimal stabilization of residual structure by leu prolines slightly disfavor his  heme loop formation presumably due to enhanced chain stiffness kinetic studies reveal that much of the change in his  heme loop stability for the aromatic amino acids is caused by a slowdown in the rate of his  heme loop breakage indicating that residual structure is preferentially stabilized in the closed loop form of the denatured state
