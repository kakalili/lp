dna aptamers derived from hiv  rnase h inhibitors are strong anti integrase agents
hiv  integrase the retroviral encoded enzyme involved in the integration of the retrotranscribed viral genome into the host nuclear dna is an attractive and still unexploited target to date very few inhibitors of this enzyme with a potential therapeutic value have been described during the search for new hiv  targets we recently described dna oligodeoxynucleotide aptamers odn  and odn   that are strong inhibitors of the rnase h activity associated with hiv  reverse transcriptase the striking structural homology between rnase h and integrase led us to study the effect of the rnase h inhibitors on the integrase shorter dna aptamers derived from odns  and   odns  del and  del were able to inhibit hiv  integrase in the nanomolar range they had g rich sequences able to form g quartets stabilized by the presence of k  the presence of these ions increased the inhibitory efficiency of these agents dramatically inhibition of enzymatic activities by odn  del and odn  del was observed in a cell free assay system using a recombinant integrase and hiv  replication was abolished in infected human cells moreover cell fusion assays showed that these agents do not block viral cell entry at concentrations where viral replication is stopped
