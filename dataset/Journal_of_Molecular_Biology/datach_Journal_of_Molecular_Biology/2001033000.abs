troponin organization on relaxed and activated thin filaments revealed by electron microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction edited by w baumeister
the steric model of muscle regulation holds that at low ca  concentration tropomyosin strands running along thin filaments are constrained by troponin in an inhibitory position that blocks myosin binding sites on actin ca  activation releasing this constraint allows tropomyosin movement initiating actin myosin interaction and contraction although the different positions of tropomyosin on the thin filament are well documented corresponding information on troponin has been lacking and it has therefore not been possible to test the model structurally here we show that troponin can be detected on thin filaments and demonstrate how its changing association with actin can control tropomyosin position in response to ca  to accomplish this thin filaments were reconstituted with an engineered short tropomyosin creating a favorable troponin stoichiomtery and symmetry for three dimensional analysis we demonstrate that in the absence of ca  troponin bound to both tropomyosin and actin can act as a latch to constrain tropomyosin in a position on actin that inhibits actomyosin atpase in addition we find that on ca  activation the actin troponin connection is broken allowing tropomyosin to assume a second position initiating actomyosin atpase and thus permitting contraction to proceed
