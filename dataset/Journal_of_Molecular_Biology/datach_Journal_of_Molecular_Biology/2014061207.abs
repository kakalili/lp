the nucleolar pict  gltscr protein forms homo oligomers
the human  protein interacting with carboxyl terminus    pict   also designated as the  glioma tumor suppressor candidate region  gene product   gltscr  is a nucleolar protein whose activity is as yet unknown contradictory results regarding the role of pict  in cancer have been reported and pict  has been suggested to function either as a tumor suppressor protein or as an oncogene in this study we demonstrate self association of pict  through yeast two hybrid assay we identified pict  as its own interaction partner we confirmed the interaction of pict  with itself by direct yeast two hybrid assay and also showed self association of pict  in mammalian cells by co immunoprecipitation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays furthermore we confirmed direct self association of pict  by using in vitro microfluidic affinity binding assays the later assay also identified the carboxy terminal domain as mediating self interaction of pict  glutaraldehyde cross linking and gel filtration assays suggest that pict  forms dimers though it may form higher order complexes as well our findings add another layer of complexity in understanding the different functions of pict  and may help provide insights regarding the activities of this protein
