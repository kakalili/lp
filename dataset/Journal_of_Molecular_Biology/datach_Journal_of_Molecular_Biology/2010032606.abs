hk  maturation studied by crystallography and h h exchange reveals the structural basis for exothermic particle transitions
hk  is an exceptionally amenable system for characterizing major conformational changes associated with capsid maturation in double stranded dna bacteriophage hk  undergoes a capsid expansion of     accompanied by major subunit rearrangements during genome packaging a previous     resolution crystal structure of the mature capsid head ii and cryo electron microscopy studies of other intermediate expansion forms of hk  suggested that primarily rigid body movements facilitated the maturation process we recently reported a     resolution structure of the preexpanded particle form prohead ii p ii and found that the capsid subunits undergo significant refolding and twisting of the tertiary structure to accommodate expansion the p ii study focused on major twisting motions in the p domain and on refolding of the spine helix during the transition here we extend the crystallographic comparison between p ii and head ii characterizing the refolding events occurring in each of the four major domains of the capsid subunit and their effect on quaternary structure stabilization in addition hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry was used to characterize the structural dynamics of three distinct capsid intermediates p ii expansion intermediate and the nearly mature head i differences in the solvent accessibilities of the seven quasi equivalent capsid subunits attributed to differences in secondary and quaternary structures were observed in p ii nearly all differences in solvent accessibility among subunits disappear after the first transition to expansion intermediate we show that most of the refolding is coupled to this transformation an event associated with the transition from asymmetric to symmetric hexamers
