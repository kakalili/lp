stra  interacts with stat and modulates transcription of stat dependent targets
stra  is a pvhl dependent bhlh transcription factor up regulated on the mrna level in multiple cancer cell lines and implicated recently in the regulation of immune cell homeostasis and autoimmunity in searching for stra  interacting proteins with oncogenic potential by the yeast two hybrid screening we identified stat  as a stra  binding partner we showed that stra  binds predominantly to phosphorylated active stat   and  isoforms via its hlh and c terminal regions we also found that stra  was able to activate transcription from stat dependent cis elements expression of endogenous stra  was shown to be cytokine inducible consistent with stra  involvement in stat dependent transcription regulation we demonstrated that the stat regulated promoter of the pro apoptotic fas gene was activated upon stra  over expression and that co expression of stra  with stat  or stat  modulated the transcriptional outcome forced expression of stra  induced apoptosis in agreement with the stra  activation effect on the fas promoter simultaneous expression of stra  and stat  resulted in alleviation of the stra  pro apoptotic effect thus for the first time we identify stra  as a stat partner and provide a consistent line of evidence for stra  involvement into regulation of apoptosis via the stat pathways
