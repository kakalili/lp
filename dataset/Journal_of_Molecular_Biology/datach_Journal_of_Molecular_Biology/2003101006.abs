cell transformation by the v myc oncogene abrogates c myc max mediated suppression of a c ebp  dependent lipocalin gene
using differential hybridization techniques a cdna clone q  was isolated that corresponds to a highly abundant mrna in quail embryo fibroblasts transformed by the v myc oncogene the deduced   amino acid protein product of q  contains an n terminal signal sequence and a lipocalin sequence motif the hallmark of a family of secretory proteins binding and transporting small hydrophobic molecules of diverse biological function including retinoids and steroids the quail q  protein displays   sequence identity with a developmentally regulated chicken protein termed p k or ch  cell transformation specifically by v myc but not by other oncogenic agents induces high level expression of q  mrna and of the q  protein nucleotide sequence analysis and transcriptional mapping revealed that the q  gene encompasses seven exons with the coding region confined to exons  through  the promoter region contains consensus binding sites for the transcriptional regulators myc and c ebp  transcriptional activation of q  is principally dependent on c ebp  but is blocked in normal cells by the endogenous c myc max mad transcription factor network in v myc transformed cells high level expression of the v myc protein and formation of highly stable v myc max heterodimers leads to abrogation of q  gene suppression and activation by c ebp  a   amino acid residue recombinant protein representing the secreted form of q  was used for structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy q  folds into a single globular domain of the lipocalin type the central part consists of an eight stranded up and down  barrel core flanked by an n terminal   like helix and a c terminal  helix the orientation of the c terminal  helix is partially determined by a disulfide bridge between cys  and cys   the three dimensional structure determination of the q  protein will facilitate the identification of its authentic ligand and the assessment of its biological function including the putative role in myc induced cell transformation
