influence of the internal disulfide bridge on the folding pathway of the cl antibody domain
disulfide bridges are one of the most important factors stabilizing the native structure of a protein whereas the basis for their stabilizing effect is well understood their role in a protein folding reaction still seems to require further attention we used the constant domain of the antibody light chain cl  a representative of the ubiquitous immunoglobulin ig superfamily to delineate the kinetic role of its single buried disulfide bridge independent of its redox state the monomeric cl domain adopts a typical ig fold under native conditions and does not retain significant structural elements when unfolded interestingly its folding pathway is strongly influenced by the disulfide bridge the more stable oxidized protein folds via a highly structured on pathway intermediate whereas the destabilized reduced protein populates a misfolded off pathway species on its way to the native state in both cases the formation of the intermediate species is shown to be independent of the isomerization state of the tyr  pro  bond our results demonstrate that the internal disulfide bridge in an antibody domain restricts the folding pathway by bringing residues of the folding nucleus into proximity thus facilitating the way to the native state
