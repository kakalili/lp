phage display mapping for peptide  sensitive sequences binding to laminin  edited by m gottesman
we utilized a  mer random phage display library to identify sequences which bind to laminin  and elute with heparan sulfate or peptide   cdpgyigsr  laminin  derivatized plates were used for biopanning three consecutive rounds of low ph elutions were carried out followed by three rounds of specific elutions each consisting of a heparan sulfate elution followed by a peptide  elution the random sequence inserts were sequenced for phage populations eluted at low ph by heparan sulfate and by peptide   specifically eluted phage populations exhibited three classes of mimotopes for different regions in the cdna derived amino acid sequence of the  kda laminin binding protein lbp  these regions were   a palindromic sequence known as peptide g   a predicted helical domain corresponding to lbp residues      and   tedws containing c terminal repeats all elution conditions also yielded phage with putative heparin binding sequences we modeled the lbp     domain which is strongly predicted to have a helical secondary structure and determined that this region likely possesses heparin binding characteristics located to one side of the helix while the opposite side appears to contain a hydrophobic patch where peptide  could bind using elisa plate assays we demonstrated that peptide  and heparan sulfate individually bound to synthetic lbp     peptide we also demonstrated that the qpatedwsa peptide could inhibit tumor cell adhesion to laminin  these data support the proposal that the  kda lbp can bind the   laminin chain at the peptide  region and suggest that heparan sulfate is a likely alternate ligand for the binding interactions our results also confirm previous data suggesting that the most c terminal region of the lbp which contains the tedws repeats is involved in cell adhesion to laminin  and we specifically implicate the repeat sequence in that activity
