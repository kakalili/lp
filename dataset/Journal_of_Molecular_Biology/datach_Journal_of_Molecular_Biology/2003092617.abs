supernatant protein factor in complex with rrr  tocopherylquinone a link between oxidized vitamin e and cholesterol biosynthesis
the vast majority of monomeric lipid transport in nature is performed by lipid specific protein carriers this class of proteins can enclose cognate lipid molecules in a hydrophobic cavity and transport them across the aqueous environment supernatant protein factor spf is an enigmatic representative of monomeric lipid transporters belonging to the sec  family spf stimulates squalene epoxidation a downstream step of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway by an unknown mechanism here we present the three dimensional crystal structure of human spf in complex with rrr  tocopherylquinone the major physiological oxidation product of rrr  tocopherol at a resolution of     the structure of the complex reveals how spf sequesters rrr  tocopherylquinone rrr  tq in its protein body and permits a comparison with the recently solved structure of human  tocopherol transfer protein   ttp in complex with rrr  tocopherol recent findings have shown that rrr  tq is reduced in vivo to rrr  tqh  the latter has been suggested to protect low density lipoprotein ldl particles from oxidation hence the antioxidant function of the redox couple rrr  tq rrr  tqh in blocking ldl oxidation may reduce cellular cholesterol uptake and thus explain how spf upregulates cholesterol synthesis
