small angle x ray scattering and single molecule fret spectroscopy produce highly divergent views of the low denaturant unfolded state
the results of more than a dozen single molecule f rster resonance energy transfer smfret experiments suggest that chemically unfolded polypeptides invariably collapse from an expanded random coil to more compact dimensions as the denaturant concentration is reduced in sharp contrast small angle x ray scattering saxs studies suggest that at least for single domain proteins at non zero denaturant concentrations such compaction may be rare here we explore this discrepancy by studying protein l a protein previously studied by saxs at   c  which suggested fixed unfolded state dimensions from   to  m guanidine hydrochloride guhcl  and by smfret at    c  which suggested that in contrast the chain contracts by     over this same denaturant range repeating the earlier saxs study under the same conditions employed in the smfret studies we observe little if any evidence that the unfolded state of protein l contracts as the concentration of guhcl is reduced for example scattering profiles and thus the shape and dimensions collected within    ms after dilution to as low as    m guhcl are effectively indistinguishable from those observed at equilibrium at higher denaturant our results thus argue that the disagreement between saxs and smfret is statistically significant and that the experimental evidence in favor of obligate polypeptide collapse at low denaturant cannot be considered conclusive yet
