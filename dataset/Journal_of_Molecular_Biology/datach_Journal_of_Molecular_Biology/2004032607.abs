a pathogenesis associated mutation in human mitochondrial trnaleu uur leads to reduced   end processing and cca addition
point mutations in mitochondrial trnas can cause severe multisystemic disorders such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes melas and myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers merrf  some of these mutations impair one or more steps of trna maturation and protein biosynthesis including   end processing post transcriptional base modification structural stability aminoacylation and formation of trna ribosomal complexes trnaleu uur  an etiologic hot spot for such diseases harbors  of more than  disease associated mutations described to date here the pathogenesis associated base substitutions a  g t  c t  c a  g and c  t within this trna were tested for their effects on endonucleolytic   end processing and cca addition at the trna   terminus whereas mutations a  g a  g and c  t reduced the efficiency of   end cleavage only the c  t substitution was a less efficient substrate for cca addition these results support the view that pathogenesis may be elicited through cumulative effects of trna mutations a mutation can impede several pre trna processing steps with each such reduction contributing to the overall impairment of trna function
