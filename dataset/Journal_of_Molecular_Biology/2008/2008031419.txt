To characterize driving forces and driven processes in formation of a large-interface, wrapped protein–DNA complex analogous to the nucleosome, we have investigated the thermodynamics of binding the 34-base pair (bp) H′ DNA sequence to the Escherichia coli DNA-remodeling protein integration host factor (IHF). Isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer are applied to determine effects of salt concentration [KCl, KF, K glutamate (KGlu)] and of the excluded solute glycine betaine (GB) on the binding thermodynamics at 20 °C. Both the binding constant Kobs and enthalpy ΔH°obs depend strongly on [salt] and anion identity. Formation of the wrapped complex is enthalpy driven, especially at low [salt] (e.g., ΔHoobs=−20.2 kcal·mol−1 in 0.04 M KCl). ΔH°obs increases linearly with [salt] with a slope (dΔH°obs/d[salt]), which is much larger in KCl (38±3 kcal·mol−1 M−1) than in KF or KGlu (11±2 kcal·mol−1 M−1). At 0.33 M [salt], Kobs is approximately 30-fold larger in KGlu or KF than in KCl, and the [salt] derivative SKobs=dlnKobs/dln[salt] is almost twice as large in magnitude in KCl (−8.8±0.7) as in KF or KGlu (−4.7±0.6).A novel analysis of the large effects of anion identity on Kobs, SKobs and on ΔH°obs dissects coulombic, Hofmeister, and osmotic contributions to these quantities. This analysis attributes anion-specific differences in Kobs, SKobs, and ΔH°obs to (i) displacement of a large number of water molecules of hydration [estimated to be 1.0(±0.2)×103] from the 5340 Å2 of IHF and H′ DNA surface buried in complex formation, and (ii) significant local exclusion of F− and Glu− from this hydration water, relative to the situation with Cl−, which we propose is randomly distributed. To quantify net water release from anionic surface (22% of the surface buried in complexation, mostly from DNA phosphates), we determined the stabilizing effect of GB on Kobs: dlnKobs/d[GB]=2.7±0.4 at constant KCl activity, indicating the net release of ca. 150 H2O molecules from anionic surface.
