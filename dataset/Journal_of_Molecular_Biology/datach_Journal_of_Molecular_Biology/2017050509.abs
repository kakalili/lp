selective targeting of sh domain  phosphotyrosine interactions of src family tyrosine kinases with monobodies
the binding of src homology  sh  domains to phosphotyrosine py sites is critical for the autoinhibition and substrate recognition of the eight src family kinases sfks  the high sequence conservation of the   human sh domains poses a significant challenge to selectively perturb the interactions of even the sfk sh family against the rest of the sh domains we have developed synthetic binding proteins termed monobodies for six of the sfk sh domains with nanomolar affinity most of these monobodies competed with py ligand binding and showed strong selectivity for either the srca yes src fyn fgr or srcb subgroup lck lyn blk hck  interactome analysis of intracellularly expressed monobodies revealed that they bind sfks but no other sh containing proteins three crystal structures of monobody  sh complexes unveiled different and only partly overlapping binding modes which rationalized the observed selectivity and enabled structure based mutagenesis to modulate inhibition mode and selectivity in line with the critical roles of sfk sh domains in kinase autoinhibition and t cell receptor signaling monobodies binding the src and hck sh domains selectively activated respective recombinant kinases whereas an lck sh binding monobody inhibited proximal signaling events downstream of the t cell receptor complex our results show that sfk sh domains can be targeted with unprecedented potency and selectivity using monobodies they are excellent tools for dissecting sfk functions in normal development and signaling and to interfere with aberrant sfk signaling networks in cancer cells
