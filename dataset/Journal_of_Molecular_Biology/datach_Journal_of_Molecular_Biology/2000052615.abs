the solution structure and internal motions of a fragment of the cytidine rich strand of the human telomere edited by i tinoco
we present the solution structure of d cccta cccta cccta ccct  a fragment of the vertebrate telomere which folds intramolecularly the four cytidine stretches form an i motif which includes six intercalated c c pairs and terminates with the cytidines at the   extremity of each stretch above the second ta linker loops across one of the narrow grooves while at the bottom the first and third linkers loop across the wide grooves at   c the spectra of the first and third linkers are quasi degenerate severe broadening at lower temperature indicates that this results from motional averaging between at least two structures of each bottom loop and makes it impossible to solve the configuration of the bottom loops directly in contrast to the rest of the structure we therefore turned to the modified sequence d cccta mcccta cccua ccct in which the two base substitutions underlined break the quasi symmetry between linkers  and  the three loops follow approximately the hairpin  second pattern  of hilbers in the first loop t is in the syn orientation whereas its analog in the third loop u  oriented anti is in a central location where it interacts with bases of both loops thus contributing to their tight association the only motion is a syn anti flip of a  in the third loop returning to the telomere fragment we show that each of the bottom loops switches between the structures identified in the first and third loops of the modified structure the motions are concerted and the resulting configurations of the bottom loop cluster present a bulge to either right t syn or left t  syn
