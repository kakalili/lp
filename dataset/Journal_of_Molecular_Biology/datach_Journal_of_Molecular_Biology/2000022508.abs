three conformations of an archaeal chaperonin tf  from sulfolobus shibatae edited by a r fersht
chaperonins are cylindrical oligomeric complexes essential for viability and required for the folding of other proteins the groe group i subfamily found in eubacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts have  fold symmetry and provide an enclosed chamber for protein subunit folding the central cavity is transiently closed by interaction with the co protein groes the most prominent feature specific to the group ii subfamily found in archaea and in the eukaryotic cytosol is a long insertion in the substrate binding region in the archaeal complex this forms an extended structure acting as a built in lid obviating the need for a groes like co factor this extension occludes a site known to bind non native polypeptides in groel the site and nature of substrate interaction are not known for the group ii subfamily the atomic structure of the thermosome an archaeal group ii chaperonin has been determined in a fully closed form but the entry and exit of protein substrates requires transient opening although an open form has been investigated by electron microscopy conformational changes in group ii chaperonins are not well characterized using electron cryo microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction we describe three conformations of a group ii chaperonin including an asymmetric bullet shaped form revealing the range of domain movements in this subfamily
