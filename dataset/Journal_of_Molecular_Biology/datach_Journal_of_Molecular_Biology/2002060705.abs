alternate usage of two dimerization initiation sites in hiv  viral rna in vitro
an essential step in the replication cycle of all retroviruses is the dimerization of genomic rna prior to or during encapsidation and budding in hiv  a stem loop structure in the genomic rna called the dimerization initiation site or dis has been well characterized however the identification of the structure s necessary for dimerization of hiv  genomic rna has been less straightforward as reflected by recent conflicting reports here using a variety of mutant and wild type rna constructs and a systematic analysis of experimental conditions we demonstrate that two dimerization sites in hiv  rna are clearly discernible under different experimental conditions a short sequence overlapping the primer binding site acts as the default dimerization site for wild type viral rna transcripts of several lengths provided that dimerization incubation conditions do not include a high heat step  gt   c  and electrophoresis is carried out under mild conditions that do not deplete the rna of magnesium however some rna constructs are able to dimerize through stem loop  sl  which is the structure homologous to the hiv  dis under certain experimental conditions interestingly deletion or mutation of the default pbs dimerization site leads to efficient usage of the sl dimerization site this study defines conditions under which each site may be used for dimerization and demonstrates furthermore the facility with which the two sites can substitute for each other this is suggestive of a switching mechanism that may be used in the viral replication cycle
