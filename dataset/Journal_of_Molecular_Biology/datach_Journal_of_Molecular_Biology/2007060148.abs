molecular implications of evolutionary differences in chd double chromodomains
double chromodomains occur in chd proteins which are atp dependent chromatin remodeling factors implicated in rna polymerase ii transcription regulation biochemical studies suggest important differences in the histone h tail binding of different chd chromodomains in human and drosophila chd double chromodomains bind lysine  methylated histone h tail which is a hallmark of transcriptionally active chromatin in all eukaryotes here we present the crystal structure of the yeast chd double chromodomains and pinpoint their differences with that of the human chd double chromodomains the most conserved residues in these double chromodomains are the two chromoboxes that orient adjacently only a subset of chd chromoboxes can form an aromatic cage for methyllysine binding and methyllysine binding requires correctly oriented inserts these factors preclude yeast chd double chromodomains from interacting with the histone h tail despite great sequence similarity between the human chd and chd chromodomains variation within an insert likely prevents chd double chromodomains from binding lysine  methylated histone h tail as efficiently as in chd  by using the available structural and biochemical data we highlight the evolutionary specialization of chd double chromodomains and provide insights about their targeting capacities
