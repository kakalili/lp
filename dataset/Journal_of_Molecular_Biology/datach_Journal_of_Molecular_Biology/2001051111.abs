two dimensional crystallization of a membrane protein on a detergent resistant lipid monolayer edited by r huber
two dimensional crystals of a membrane protein the proton atpase from plant plasma membranes have been obtained by a new strategy based on the use of functionalized fluorinated lipids spread at the air water interface monolayers of the fluorinated lipids are stable even in the presence of high concentrations of various detergents as was established by ellipsometry measurements a nickel functionalized fluorinated lipid was spread into a monolayer at the air water interface the overexpressed his tagged atpase solubilized by detergents was added to the subphase  d crystals of the membrane protein embedded in a lipid bilayer formed as the detergent was removed by adsorption electron microscopy indicated that the d crystals were single layers with dimensions of   m or more image processing yielded a projection map at   resolution showing three well separated domains of the membrane embedded proton atpase
