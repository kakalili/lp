a protein  protein interaction platform involved in recruitment of gld  to the fbf  fem  mrna complex
the pumilio and fbf puf family of rna binding proteins interacts with protein partners to post transcriptionally regulate mrnas in eukaryotes the interaction between puf family member fem  binding factor fbf and germline development defective  gld  protein promotes spermatogenesis in caenorhabditis elegans by increasing expression of the fem  mrna defined here in these studies is the molecular basis for this critical interaction a  amino acid region within gld  is required for fbf binding while a  amino acid loop in fbf between puf repeats  and  is necessary for gld  binding these short sequences are conserved as other fbf binding proteins bear sequences similar to those in gld  and other c elegans puf proteins contain sequences similar to those in fbf the fbf binding region of gld  forms a ternary complex with fbf on the point mutation element pme in the fem    untranslated region and formation of this gld   fbf complex does not impact the rna binding activity of fbf these data raise the possibility of alternative models involving the formation of a gld   fbf  rna complex in the regulation of germline mrnas
