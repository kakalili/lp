structure of human endothelin converting enzyme i complexed with phosphoramidon
endothelin converting enzyme i ece  is a mammalian type ii integral membrane zinc containing endopeptidase ece  catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of endothelins in a rate limiting fashion through post translational conversion of the biologically inactive big endothelins endothelin  overproduction has been implicated in a heterogeneous list of diseases including systemic and pulmonary hypertension stroke and asthma cardiac and renal failure therefore ece  is a prime therapeutic target for the regulation of endothelin  production in vivo and there is considerable interest in selective inhibitors of this enzyme here we present the crystal structure of the extracellular domain residues      of human ece  c  s with the generic metalloprotease inhibitor phosphoramidon determined at     resolution the structure is closely related to that of human nep providing essential information for a detailed understanding of ligand binding specificity determinants as well as selectivity criteria selective inhibitors of ece s should have beneficial effects for the treatment of diseases in which an overproduction of ets plays a pathogenic role
