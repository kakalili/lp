a proteasome assembly defect in rpn mutants is associated with rpn  instability and increased sensitivity to stress
rpn  is a proteasome associated deubiquitinating enzyme that is essential for viability recent genetic studies showed that rpn  is functionally linked to rpn  a major multiubiquitin chain binding receptor in the proteasome mutations in rpn  and rpn  can reduce the level and or stability of proteasomes indicating that both proteins influence its structural integrity to characterize the properties of rpn  we examined its interactions with other subunits in the  s regulatory particle and detected strong binding to rpn  two previously described rpn mutants are sensitive to protein translation inhibitors and an amino acid analog these mutants also display a mitochondrial defect the abundance of intact proteasomes was significantly reduced in rpn mutants as revealed by strongly reduced binding between  s catalytic with  s regulatory particles proteasome interaction with the shuttle factor rad  was similarly reduced consequently higher levels of multiub proteins were associated with rad  and proteolytic substrates were stabilized the availability of rpn  is important for maintaining adequate levels of intact proteasomes as its depletion caused growth and proteolytic defects in rpn  these studies suggest that rpn  is stabilized following its incorporation into proteasomes the instability of rpn  and the defects of rpn mutants are apparently caused by a failure to recruit rpn  into mature proteasomes
