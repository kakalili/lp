regulatory and structural ef hand motifs of neuronal calcium sensor  mg  modulates ca  binding ca  induced conformational changes and equilibrium unfolding transitions
neuronal calcium sensor  ncs  is a major modulator of ca  signaling with a known role in neurotransmitter release ncs  has one cryptic ef  and three functional ef  ef  and ef  ef hand motifs however it is not known which are the regulatory ca  specific and structural ca  or mg  binding ef hand motifs to understand the specialized functions of ncs  identification of the ionic discrimination of the ef hand sites is important in this work we determined the specificity of ca  binding using nmr and ef hand mutants ca  titration as monitored by  n h heteronuclear single quantum coherence suggests that ca  binds to the ef and ef almost simultaneously followed by ef  our nmr data suggest that mg  binds to ef and ef  thereby classifying them as structural sites whereas ef is a ca  specific or regulatory site this was further corroborated using an ef ef disabled mutant which binds only ca  and not mg  ca  binding induces conformational rearrangements in the protein by reversing mg  induced changes in trp fluorescence and surface hydrophobicity in a larger physiological perspective exchanging or replacing mg  with ca  reduces the ca  binding affinity of ncs  from   nm to   nm which would be advantageous to the molecule by facilitating reversibility to the ca  free state although the equilibrium unfolding transitions of apo ncs  and mg  bound ncs  are similar the early unfolding transitions of ca  bound ncs  are partially influenced in the presence of mg  this study demonstrates the importance of mg  as a modulator of calcium homeostasis and active state behavior of ncs
