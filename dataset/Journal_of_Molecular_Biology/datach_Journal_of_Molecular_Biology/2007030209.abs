systematic rnai studies on the role of sp klf factors in globin gene expression and erythroid differentiation
sp klf family of factors regulates gene expression by binding to the caccc gc gt boxes in the dna through their highly conserved three zinc finger domains to investigate the role of this family of factors in erythroid differentiation and globin gene expression we first measured the expression levels of selected sp klf factors in primary cells of fetal and adult stages of erythroid development this quantitative analysis revealed that their expression levels vary significantly in cells of either stages of the erythroid development significant difference in their expression levels was observed between fetal and adult erythroid cells for some sp klf factors functional studies using rna interference revealed that the silencing of sp and klf resulted in elevated level of  globin expression in k  cells in addition k  cells become visibly red after sp knockdown benzidine staining revealed significant hemoglobinization of these cells indicating erythroid differentiation moreover the expression of pu  ets and notch is significantly down regulated in the cells that underwent erythroid differentiation following sp knockdown overexpression of pu  or ets efficiently blocked the erythroid differentiation caused by sp knockdown in k  cells the expression of c kit however was significantly up regulated these data indicate that sp may play an important role in erythroid differentiation
