structure of interacting segments in the growing amyloid fibril of   microglobulin probed with ir spectroscopy
inter segmental interaction at the growing tip of the amyloid fibril of   microglobulin   m was investigated using ir microscopy cross seeded fibril formation was implemented in which the amyloid fibril of the    fragment of  m fa     was generated on the  m amyloid fibril fa  m  as a seed differences between the ir spectra of the cross seeded fibril and those of the seed were attributed to the contribution from the tip whose structure is discussed the results indicated that     out of  residues of the fa     tip on fa  m are contained in a  sheet at ph   which was smaller than the corresponding value      residues of the spontaneous fa     at ph   the tip was suggested to have a planar structure indicating the planarity of the interacting segment the n terminal region of fa     in the fibril is more exposed to the solvent than that in the tip and vice versa for the c terminal region this is consistent with the different protonation levels of these regions and the direction of peptide in the fibrils is determined from these results
