the dimerization domain of hnf   structure and plasticity of an intertwined four helix bundle with application to diabetes mellitus edited by m f summers
maturity onset diabetes mellitus of the young mody is a human genetic syndrome most commonly due to mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor   hnf    here we describe the crystal structure of the hnf   dimerization domain at    resolution and assess its structural plasticity the crystal  s low solvent content    v v leads to tight packing of peptides in the lattice two independent dimers similar in structure are formed in the unit cell by a  fold crystallographic symmetry axis the dimers define a novel intertwined four helix bundle  hb  each protomer contains two  helices separated by a sharp non canonical turn dimer related  helices form anti parallel coiled coils including an n terminal  mini zipper  complementary in structure symmetry and surface characteristics to transcriptional coactivator dimerization cofactor of hnf  dcoh  a confluence of ten leucine side chains five per protomer forms a hydrophobic core isotope assisted nmr studies demonstrate that a similar intertwined dimer exists in solution comparison of structures obtained in multiple independent crystal forms indicates that the mini zipper is a stable structural element whereas the c terminal  helix can adopt a broad range of orientations segmental alignment of the mini zipper mean pairwise root mean square difference rmsd in c  coordinates of     is associated with a    mean c  rmsd displacement of the c terminal coiled coil the greatest c terminal structural variation     c  rmsd displacement is observed in the dcoh bound peptide diabetes associated mutations perturb distinct structural features of the hnf   domain one mutation l h destabilizes the domain but preserves structural specificity adjoining h  side chains in a native like dimer are predicted to alter the functional surface of the mini zipper involved in dcoh recognition the other mutation g r  by contrast leads to a dimeric molten globule as indicated by its h nmr features and fluorescent binding of  anilino  naphthalene sulfonate we propose that a glycine specific turn configuration enables specific interactions between the mini zipper and the c terminal coiled coil
