error prone and error restrictive mutations affecting ribosomal protein s
ribosomal protein s  plays a pivotal role in decoding functions on the ribosome x ray crystallographic analyses of ribosomal complexes have revealed that s  is involved in the inspection of codon  anticodon pairings in the ribosomal a site as well as in the succeeding domain rearrangements of the  s subunit that are essential for accommodation of aminoacyl trna a role for s  in trna selection is also well supported by classical genetic analyses mutations affecting s  are readily isolated in bacteria and organelles since specific alterations in s  confer resistance to the error inducing antibiotic streptomycin and the ribosomes from many such streptomycin resistant s  mutants display decreased levels of miscoding however substitutions that confer resistance to streptomycin likely represent a very distinct class of all possible s  mutants until recently the technical difficulties in generating random unselectable mutations in essential genes in complex operons have generally precluded the analysis of other classes of s  alterations using a recombineering approach we have targeted the escherichia coli rpsl gene encoding s  for random mutagenesis and screened the resulting mutants for effects on decoding fidelity we have recovered over  different substitutions located throughout the s  protein that alter the accuracy of translation without substantially affecting the sensitivity to streptomycin moreover this collection includes mutants that promote miscoding as well as those that restrict decoding errors these results affirm the importance of s  in decoding processes and indicate that alterations in this essential protein can have diverse effects on the accuracy of decoding
