chelerythrine and sanguinarine dock at distinct sites on bclxl that are not the classic bh binding cleft
the ratio of the levels of pro survival and pro apoptotic members of the bcl  protein family is thought to be an important regulatory factor for determining the sensitivity of the mammalian cells to apoptotic stimuli high levels of expression of pro survival members such as bclxl in human cancers were frequently found to be a good prognostic indicator predicting poor response to chemotherapy the pro survival members of the bcl  family mediate their effects through heterodimerization with the bh region of the pro apoptotic members structural analyses of the binding complex of the bh peptide and bclxl showed that a hydrophobic groove termed the bh binding cleft is the docking site for the bh region chemical mimetics of the bh region such as bh i  that target the bh binding cleft indeed exhibit pro apoptotic activities chelerythrine che and sanguinarine san are natural benzophenanthridine alkaloids that are structurally homologous to each other che was previously identified as an inhibitor of bclxl function from a high throughput screen of natural products but its mode of interaction with bclxl is not known by determining the effect of site directed mutagenesis on ligand binding and using saturation transfer difference std nmr experiments we have verified locations of these docked ligands surprisingly che and san bind separately at the bh groove and bh region of bclxl respectively different from the bh binding cleft where other known inhibitors of bclxl target interestingly certain residues on the flexible loop between helices   and   of bclxl are also perturbed upon che but not san or bh i  binding although che and san are similarly effective as bh i  in displacing bound bh peptide they are much more effective in inducing apoptosis raising the possibility that che and san might be able to antagonize other pro survival mechanisms in addition to the one that involves bh region binding
