lipid binding hsh domains in immune cell adapter proteins
sh domains represent versatile scaffolds within eukaryotic cells by targeting proline rich sequences within intracellular proteins more recently binding of sh domains to unusual peptide motifs folded proteins or lipids has been reported here we show that the newly defined hsh domains of immune cell adapter proteins bind lipid membranes with distinct affinities the interaction of the hsh domains of adhesion and degranulation promoting adapter protein adap and pram  promyelocytic retinoic acid receptor alpha target gene encoding an adaptor molecule   with phosphatidylcholine containing liposomes is observed upon incorporation of phosphatidylserine ps or phosphoinositides pis into the membrane bilayer mechanistically we show that stable association of the n terminal amphipathic helix with the  sheet scaffold favours lipid binding and that the interaction with pi   p containing liposomes is consistent with a single site non cooperative binding mechanism functional investigations indicate that deletion of both amphipathic helices of the hsh domains reduces the ability of adap to enhance adhesion and migration in stimulated t cells
