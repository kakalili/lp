heterocyst specific transcription of nsir  a non coding rna encoded in a tandem array of direct repeats in cyanobacteria
in response to nitrogen deficiency some cyanobacteria develop heterocysts a terminally differentiated cell type specialized for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in nostocales this differentiation process is controlled by two major regulators ntca and hetr but additional unknown factors are likely to be involved as well in the context of a genome wide search for potential non coding rnas we identified an array of  tandem repeats that is transcribed in large amounts when cells enter conditions that trigger cell differentiation and switch to nitrogen fixation the main accumulating transcript which we suggest designating nitrogen stress induced rna  nsir  has properties similar to regulatory non coding rnas in anabaena sp pcc    it is about   nt in length has a very distinct predicted secondary structure and is expressed very early and transiently after nitrogen step down moreover its expression requires hetr and ntca and is restricted to cells that are differentiating into heterocysts clearly placing nsir within the regulon that controls the switch to nitrogen fixation and heterocyst formation the genomic arrangement of nsir  located upstream of hetf a gene whose product is involved in heterocyst formation is conserved in all five nostocales whose genomes are completely sequenced additionally we detected nsir expression in  different heterocyst forming cyanobacteria our data suggest that every repeat is a complete transcriptional unit furnished with a cell type specific promoter and a rho independent terminator which gives rise to a very high nsir transcript level nsir is the first known bacterial non coding rna that is specifically upregulated in response to nitrogen step down
