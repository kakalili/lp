transcriptional activation of human matrix metalloproteinase  gene expression by multiple co activators
matrix metalloproteinase  mmp   a proteolytic enzyme for matrix proteins chemokines and cytokines is a major target in cancer and autoimmune diseases since it is aberrantly upregulated to control mmp  expression in pathological conditions it is necessary to understand the regulatory mechanisms of mmp  expression mmp  gene expression is regulated primarily at the transcriptional level in this study we investigated the role of multiple co activators in regulating mmp  transcription we demonstrate that multiple transcriptional co activators are involved in mmp  promoter activation including cbp p   pcaf carm and grip  furthermore enhancement of mmp  promoter activity requires the histone acetyltransferase activity of pcaf but not that of cbp p   and the methyltransferase activity of carm  more importantly these co activators are able to activate mmp  promoter activity independently and function in a synergistic manner significant synergy was observed among carm  p  and grip  which is dependent on the interaction of p  and carm with the ad and ad domains of grip  respectively this suggests the formation of a ternary co activator complex on the mmp  promoter chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that these co activators associate with the endogenous mmp  promoter and that sirna knockdown of expression of these co activators reduces endogenous mmp  expression taken together these studies demonstrate a new level of transcriptional regulation of mmp  expression by the cooperative action of co activators
