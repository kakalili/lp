single mhc mutation eliminates enthalpy associated with t cell receptor binding
the keystone of the adaptive immune response is t cell receptor tcr recognition of peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex pmhc molecules the crystal structure of ahiii tcr bound to mhc hla a  showed a large interface with an atypical binding orientation mhc mutations in the interface of the proteins were tested for changes in tcr recognition from the range of responses observed three representative hla a mutants t  a w  a and k a were selected for further study binding constants and co crystal structures of the ahiii tcr and the three mutants were determined k  in hla a makes contacts with both peptide and tcr and has been identified as a critical residue for recognition by numerous tcr the k a mutation resulted in the lowest ahiii t cell response and the lowest binding affinity which suggests that the t cell response may correlate with affinity importantly the k a mutation does not affect the conformation of the peptide the change in affinity appears to be due to a loss in hydrogen bonds in the interface as a result of a conformational change in the tcr complementarity determining region  cdr  loop isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed the loss of hydrogen bonding by a large loss in enthalpy our findings are inconsistent with the notion that the cdr and cdr loops of the tcr are responsible for mhc restriction while the cdr loops interact solely with the peptide instead we present here an mhc mutation that does not change the conformation of the peptide yet results in an altered conformation of a cdr
