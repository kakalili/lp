structural diversity of domain superfamilies in the cath database
the cath database of domain structures has been used to explore the structural variation of homologous domains in   well populated domain structure superfamilies each containing at least three sequence diverse relatives our analyses confirm some previously detected trends relating sequence divergence to structural variation but for a much larger dataset and in some superfamilies the new data reveal exceptional structural variation use of a new algorithm  dsec to analyse variability in secondary structure compositions across a superfamily sheds new light on how structures evolve  dsec detects inserted secondary structures that embellish the core of conserved secondary structures found throughout the superfamily analysis showed that for   of highly populated superfamilies  gt  sequence diverse relatives  there are twofold or more increases in the numbers of secondary structures in some relatives in some families fivefold increases occur sometimes modifying the fold of the domain manual inspection of secondary structure insertions or embellishments in  particularly variable superfamilies revealed that although these insertions were usually discontiguous in the sequence they were often co located in d resulting in a larger structural motif that often modified the geometry of the active site or the surface conformation promoting diverse domain partnerships and protein interactions these observations supported by automatic analysis of all well populated cath families suggest that accretion of small secondary structure insertions may provide a simple mechanism for evolving new functions in diverse relatives some layered domain architectures e g mainly beta and alpha beta sandwiches that recur highly in the genomes more frequently exploit these types of embellishments to modify function in these architectures aggregation occurs most often at the edges top or bottom of the  sheets information on structural variability across domain superfamilies has been made available through the cath dictionary of homologous structures dhs
