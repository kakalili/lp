equilibrium and pressure jump relaxation studies of the conformational transitions of p mtcp
the conformational transitions of a small oncogene product p mtcp  have been studied by high pressure fluorescence of the intrinsic tryptophan emission and high pressure d and d h   n nmr while the unfolding transition monitored by fluorescence is cooperative two kinds of nmr spectral changes were observed depending on the pressure range below    mpa pressure caused continuous non linear shifts of many of the  n and h signals suggesting the presence of an alternate folded conformer s in rapid equilibrium    ms with the basic native structure above    mpa pressure caused a sharp decrease in the intensity of the folded proteins signals while the peaks corresponding to disordered structures increased yielding a free energy of unfolding change of  kcal mol and associated volume change of    ml mol in agreement with the fluorescence result differential scanning calorimetry also reveals two transitions between  and   c confirming the existence of an additional species under mildly denaturing conditions we report here a real time observation of pressure jump unfolding kinetics by d nmr spectroscopy on p mtcp made possible due to its very long relaxation times at high pressure revealed by fluorescence studies within the dead time after the pressure jump the nmr spectra of the native conformer changed to those of the transient conformational species identified in the equilibrium studies demonstrating the equivalence between a transient species and an equilibrium excited state after these rapid spectral changes the intensities of all of the individual  n  h cross peaks decreased gradually and those of the disordered structure increased consistent with the slow relaxation to the unfolded form at this pressure rate constants of unfolding monitored at individual amide sites within the  barrel were similar to those obtained from fluorescence and from side chain protons in the hydrophobic core region consistent with nearly cooperative unfolding however some heterogeneity in the apparent unfolding rate constants is apparent across the sequence and can be understood as non uniform effects of pressure on the unfolding rate constant due to non uniform hydration
