uncovering the role of sgf  in maintaining saga deubiquitinating module structure and activity
the saga spt  ada  gcn acetyltransferase complex performs multiple functions in transcription activation including deubiquitinating histone h b which is mediated by a subcomplex called the deubiquitinating module dubm  the yeast dubm comprises a catalytic subunit ubp  and three additional subunits sgf  sus and sgf  all of which are required for dubm activity a portion of the non globular sgf  subunit lies between the ubp catalytic domain and the znf ubp domain and has been proposed to contribute to deubiquitinating activity by maintaining the catalytic domain in an active conformation we report structural and solution studies of the dubm containing two different sgf  point mutations that disrupt deubiquitinating activity we find that the sgf  mutations abrogate deubiquitinating activity by impacting the ubp ubiquitin binding fingers region and they have an unexpected effect on the overall folding and stability of the dubm complex taken together our data suggest a role for sgf  in maintaining both the organization and the ubiquitin binding conformation of ubp  thereby contributing to overall dubm activity
