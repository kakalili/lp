barrel topology of alzheimer s  amyloid ion channels
emerging evidence supports the ion channel mechanism for alzheimer s disease pathophysiology wherein small  amyloid a  oligomers insert into the cell membrane forming toxic ion channels and destabilizing the cellular ionic homeostasis solid state nmr based data of amyloid oligomers in solution indicate that they consist of a double layered  sheets where each monomer folds into  strand  turn   strand and the monomers are stacked atop each other in the membrane a  peptides are proposed to be  type structures experimental structural data available from atomic force microscopy afm imaging of a  oligomers in membranes reveal heterogeneous channel morphologies previously we modeled the channels in a non tilted organization parallel with the cross membrane normal here we modeled a  barrel like organization   barrels are common in transmembrane toxin pores typically consisting of a monomeric chain forming a pore organized in a single layered  sheet with antiparallel  strands and a right handed twist our explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of a range of channel sizes and polymorphic turns and comparisons of these with afm image dimensions support a  barrel channel organization different from the transmembrane  barrels where the monomers are folded into a circular  sheet with antiparallel  strands stabilized by the connecting loops these a  barrels consist of multimeric chains forming double  sheets with parallel  strands where the strands of each monomer are connected by a turn although the a  barrels adopt the right handed  sheet twist the barrels still break into heterogeneous loosely attached subunits in good agreement with afm images and previous modeling the subunits appear mobile allowing unregulated hence toxic ion flux
