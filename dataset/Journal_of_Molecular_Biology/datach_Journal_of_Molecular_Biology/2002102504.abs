a method for prediction of the locations of linker regions within large multifunctional proteins and application to a type i polyketide synthase
multifunctional proteins often appear to result from fusion of smaller proteins and in such cases typically can be separated into their ancestral components simply by cleaving the linker regions that separate the domains though possibly guided by sequence alignment structural evidence or light proteolysis determination of the locations of linker regions remains empirical we have developed an algorithm named uma to predict the locations of linker regions in multifunctional proteins by quantification of the conservation of several properties within protein families and the results agree well with structurally characterized proteins this technique has been applied to a family of fungal type i iterative polyketide synthases pks  allowing prediction of the locations of all of the standard pks domains as well as two previously unidentified domains using these predictions we report the cloning of the first fragment from the pks norsolorinic acid synthase responsible for biosynthesis of the first isolatable intermediate in aflatoxin production the expression light proteolysis and catalytic abilities of this acyl carrier protein  thioesterase didomain are discussed
