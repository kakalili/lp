energetic and structural interactions between  dendrotoxin and a voltage gated potassium channel edited by g von heijne
dendrotoxin proteins isolated from mamba snake venom block potassium channels with a high degree of specificity and selectivity using site directed mutagenesis we have identified residues that constitute the functional interaction surfaces of  dendrotoxin and its voltage gated potassium channel receptor   dendrotoxin uses a triangular patch formed by seven side chains lys  tyr  lys  leu  pro  arg  lys  to block k currents carried by a shaker potassium channel variant the inhibitory surface of the toxin interacts with channel residues at shaker positions           and   near the pore amino acid mutations that interact across the toxin channel interface were identified by mutant cycle analysis these results constrain the possible orientation of dendrotoxin with respect to the k channel structure we propose that dendrotoxin binds near the pore entryway but does not act as a physical plug
