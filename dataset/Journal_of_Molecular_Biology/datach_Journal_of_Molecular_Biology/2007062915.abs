crystal structures of two bordetella pertussis periplasmic receptors contribute to defining a novel pyroglutamic acid binding dctp subfamily
gram negative bacteria have developed several different transport systems for solute uptake one of these the tripartite atp independent periplasmic transport system trap t  makes use of an extracytoplasmic solute receptor esr which captures specific solutes with high affinity and transfers them to their partner permease complex located in the bacterial inner membrane we hereby report the structures of dctp and dctp  two such esrs from bordetella pertussis these two proteins display a high degree of sequence and structural similarity and possess the  venus flytrap  fold characteristic of esrs comprising two globular    domains hinged together to form a ligand binding cleft dctp and dctp both show a closed conformation due to the presence of one pyroglutamic acid molecule bound by highly conserved residues in their respective ligand binding sites blast analyses have revealed that the dctp and dctp residues involved in ligand binding are strictly present in a number of predicted trap t esrs from other bacteria in most cases the genes encoding these trap t systems are located in the vicinity of a gene coding for a pyroglutamic acid metabolising enzyme both the high degree of conservation of these ligand binding residues and the genomic context of these trap t coding operons in a number of bacterial species suggest that dctp and dctp constitute the prototypes of a novel trap t dctp subfamily involved in pyroglutamic acid transport
