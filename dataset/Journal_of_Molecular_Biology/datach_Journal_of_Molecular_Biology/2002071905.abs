a neutral molecule in a cation binding site specific binding of a peg sh to acetylcholinesterase from torpedo californica
the crystal structure of acetylcholinesterase from torpedo californica complexed with the uncharged inhibitor peg sh   containing mainly heptameric polyethylene glycol with a terminal thiol group is determined at    resolution this is an untypical acetylcholinesterase inhibitor since it lacks the cationic moiety typical of the substrate acetylcholine  in the crystal structure the elongated ligand extends along the whole of the deep and narrow active site gorge with the terminal thiol group bound near the bottom close to the catalytic site unexpectedly the cation binding site formed by the faces of aromatic side chains is occupied by ch groups of the inhibitor which are engaged in c  h   interactions that structurally mimic the cation   interactions made by the choline moiety of acetylcholine in addition the peg sh molecule makes numerous other weak but specific interactions of the c  h  o and c  h   types
