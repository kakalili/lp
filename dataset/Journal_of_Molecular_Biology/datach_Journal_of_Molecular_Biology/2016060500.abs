thermostabilization of the human endothelin type b receptor
the peptide hormone endothelin produced by the vascular endothelium is involved in several physiological functions including maintenance of vascular tone and humoral homeostasis endothelin transmits signals through the endothelin receptor a g protein coupled receptor structural studies of the endothelin type b receptor etbr have been unsuccessful due to its structural flexibility and instability in detergent solubilized solution to overcome these problems we explored thermostabilization of human etbr by establishing an etbr expression system in escherichia coli followed by systematic alanine scanning mutagenesis among   point mutations   thermostabilizing residues were selected and further mutated to other amino acids the thermostability indices of these residues represented by the ratios of endothelin  et  binding activities with or without heat treatment at   c for  min in a ligand free form were compared the ligand affinity and apparent melting temperature tm of the five most thermostable mutants r  y d  a k  a s  a and i  a were then examined the apparent tm of three single mutants r  y d  a and k  a was approximately  c higher than that of the wild type the apparent tm value of a combination of the five residues named the y etbr mutant was   c higher than that of the wild type the y etbr mutant exhibited an affinity for et  and activated gq similar to the wild type further investigation of the pharmacological properties affected by combinatorial mutations of et  et  txet  and k   suggested that y etbr is highly suitable for representing a ligand free form of etbr and is potentially applicable for studying an et  bound form
