all atom structural models for complexes of insulin like growth factors igf and igf with their cognate receptor
type  insulin like growth factor receptor igf r is a membrane spanning glycoprotein of the insulin receptor family that has been implicated in a variety of cancers the key questions related to molecular mechanisms governing ligand recognition by igf r remain unanswered partly due to the lack of testable structural models of apo or ligand bound receptor complexes using a homology model of the igf r ectodomain igf r   we present the first experimentally consistent all atom structural models of igf igf r   and igf igf r   complexes our explicit solvent molecular dynamics md simulation of apo igf r   shows that it displays asymmetric flexibility mechanisms that result in one of two binding pockets accessible to growth factors igf and igf  as demonstrated via an md assisted monte carlo docking procedure our md generated ensemble of structures of apo and igf bound igf r   agrees reasonably well with published small angle x ray scattering data we observe simultaneous contacts of each growth factor with sites  and  of igf r suggesting cross linking of receptor subunits our models provide direct evidence in favor of suggested electrostatic complementarity between the c domain igf  and the cysteine rich domain igf r  our igf igf r   model provides structural bases for the observation that a single igf molecule binds to igf r   at low concentrations in small angle x ray scattering studies we also suggest new possible structural bases for differences in the affinities of insulin igf  and igf for their noncognate receptors
