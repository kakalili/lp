solution structure and dynamics of the central ccp module pair of a poxvirus complement control protein edited by p e wright
the complement control protein ccp module also known as scr ccp or sushi domain is prevalent amongst proteins that regulate complement activation functional and mutagenesis studies have shown that in most cases two or more neighbouring ccp modules form specific binding sites for other molecules hence the orientation in space of a ccp module with respect to its neighbours and the flexibility of the intermodular junction are likely to be critical for function vaccinia virus complement control protein vcp is a complement regulatory protein composed of four tandemly arranged ccp modules the solution structure of the carboxy terminal half of this protein ccp modules  and  has been solved previously the structure of the central portion modules  and  vcp    has now also been solved using nmr spectroscopy at   c in addition the backbone dynamics of vcp     have been characterised by analysis of its  n relaxation parameters module  has a typical ccp module structure while module  in the context of vcp     has some modest but significant differences in structure and dynamics to module  within the   pair modules  and  do not share an extensive interface unlike modules  and  only two possible noes were identified between the bodies of the modules but a total of  noes between the short intermodular linker of vcp     and the bodies of the two modules determines a preferred elongated orientation of the two modules in the calculated structures the anisotropy of rotational diffusion has been characterised from  n relaxation data and this indicates that the time averaged structure is more compact than suggested by h h noes the data are consistent with the presence of many intermodular orientations some of which are kinked undergoing interconversion on a        second time scale a reconstructed representation of modules    allows visualisation of the spatial arrangement of the  substitutions that occur in the more potent complement inhibitor from variola small pox virus
