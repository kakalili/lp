mapping of protein  protein interaction sites by the  absence of interference  approach
protein  protein interactions are critical to most biological processes and locating protein  protein interfaces on protein structures is an important task in molecular biology we developed a new experimental strategy called the  absence of interference  approach to determine surface residues involved in protein  protein interaction of established yeast two hybrid pairs of interacting proteins one of the proteins is subjected to high level randomization by error prone pcr the resulting library is selected by yeast two hybrid system for interacting clones that are isolated and sequenced the interaction region can be identified by an absence or depletion of mutations for data analysis and presentation we developed a web interface that analyzes the mutational spectrum and displays the mutational frequency on the surface of the structure or a structural model of the randomized protein    http  biochem jacobs university de prima additionally this interface might be of use for the display of mutational distributions determined by other types of random mutagenesis experiments we applied the approach to map the interface of the catalytic domain of the dna methyltransferase dnmt a with its regulatory factor dnmt l dnmt a was randomized with high mutational load a total of  interacting clones were isolated and sequenced and   mutations were identified the mutational pattern allowed to identify a unique interaction region on the surface of dnmt a which comprises about         the results were confirmed by site directed mutagenesis and structural analysis the absence of interference approach will allow high throughput mapping of protein interaction sites suitable for functional studies and protein docking
