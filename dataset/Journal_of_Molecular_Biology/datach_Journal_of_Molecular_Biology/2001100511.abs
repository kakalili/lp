proteolytic analysis of the flih flii complex the atpase component of the type iii flagellar export apparatus of salmonella edited by m f moody
the atpase flii of the salmonella type iii flagellar protein export apparatus is a   amino acid residue cytoplasmic protein consisting of two regions an n terminal flagellum specific region and a c terminal atpase region it forms a complex with a regulatory protein flih in the cytoplasm multi angle light scattering studies indicate that flih forms a homodimer  flih  and that flih and flii together form a heterotrimer  flih flii mobility upon gel filtration chromatography gives much higher apparent molecular masses for both species whereas the mobility of flii is normal sedimentation velocity measurements indicate that both flih  and the flih flii complex are quite elongated we have analyzed flih flii and the flih flii complex for proteolytic sensitivity flii was degraded by clostripain into two stable fragments one of  kda fliicl  missing the first seven amino acid residues and the other of  kda fliicl  missing the first  residues  small amounts of two closely spaced  kda fragments fliicl  missing the first  and  residues respectively were also detected the flih homodimer was insensitive to clostripain proteolysis and provided protection to flii within the flih flii complex neither fliicl  nor fliicl  could form a complex with flih demonstrating that the n terminus of flii is essential for the interaction atp amp pnp and adp bound forms of flii within the flih flii complex regained sensitivity to clostripain cleavage also the sensitivity of the two fliicl  cleavage sites was much greater in the atp and amp pnp bound forms than in either the adp bound form or nucleotide free flii the atpase domain itself was insensitive to clostripain cleavage we suggest that the n terminal flagellum specific region of flii is flexible and changes its conformation during the atp hydrolysis cycle
