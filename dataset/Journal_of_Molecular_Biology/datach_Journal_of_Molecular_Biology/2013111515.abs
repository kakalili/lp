malachite green mediates homodimerization of antibody vl domains to form a fluorescent ternary complex with singular symmetric interfaces
we report that a symmetric small molecule ligand mediates the assembly of antibody light chain variable domains vls into a correspondent symmetric ternary complex with novel interfaces the l  fluorogen activating protein is a vl domain that binds malachite green mg dye to activate intense fluorescence crystallography of liganded l  reveals a   protein ligand complex with inclusive c symmetry where mg is almost entirely encapsulated between an antiparallel arrangement of the two vl domains unliganded l  vl domains crystallize as a similar antiparallel vl vl homodimer the complementarity determining regions are spatially oriented to form novel vl vl and vl ligand interfaces that tightly constrain a propeller conformer of mg binding equilibrium analysis suggests highly cooperative assembly to form a very stable vl mg vl complex such that mg behaves as a strong chemical inducer of dimerization fusion of two vl domains into a single protein tightens mg binding over   fold to low picomolar affinity without altering the large binding enthalpy suggesting that bonding interactions with ligand and restriction of domain movements make independent contributions to binding fluorescence activation of a symmetrical fluorogen provides a selection mechanism for the isolation and directed evolution of ternary complexes where unnatural symmetric binding interfaces are favored over canonical antibody interfaces as exemplified by l  these self reporting complexes may be useful as modulators of protein association or as high affinity protein tags and capture reagents
