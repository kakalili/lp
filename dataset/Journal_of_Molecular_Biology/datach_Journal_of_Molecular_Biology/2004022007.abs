crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human matrix metalloproteinase
the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinase   mmp   has been expressed in escherichia coli and its crystal structure solved at    resolution the availability of this structure allowed us to critically examine the small differences existing between the catalytic domains of mmp  and mmp   which show the highest sequence identity among all mmps furthermore the binding mode of n isobutyl n  methoxyphenylsulfonyl glycyl hydroxamic acid nngh  which is one of the most known commercial inhibitors of mmps is described for the first time
