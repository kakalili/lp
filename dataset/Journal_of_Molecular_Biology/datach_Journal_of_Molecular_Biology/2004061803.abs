structural similarities of micelle bound peptide yy pyy and neuropeptide y npy are related to their affinity profiles at the y receptors
here we investigate the structure of porcine peptide yy ppyy both when unligated in solution at ph   and when bound to dodecylphosphocholine dpc micelles at ph   ppyy in solution displays the pp fold with the n terminal segment being back folded onto the c terminal  helix which extends from residue  to   in contrast to the solution structure of keire et al published in the year   the c terminal helix does not display a kink around residue     the root mean square deviation rmsd for backbone atoms of the nmr ensemble of conformers to the mean structure is        for residues     the back fold is supported by values of      for the  n h noe and by generalized order parameters s of      for residues    which indicate that the peptide is folded in that segment we have additionally used dpc micelles as a membrane model and determined the structure of ppyy when bound to it therein an  helix occurs in the segment comprising residues     and the n terminus freely diffuses in solution the hydrophobic side of the amphipathic helix forms the micelle binding interface and hydrophobic side chains extend into the micelle interior a significant stabilization of helical conformation occurs in the c terminal pentapeptide which is important for receptor binding the latter is supported by positive values of the heteronuclear noe in that segment      compared to      for the unligated form and by values of s of      versus      for the unligated form  the structures of micelle bound ppyy and pnpy are much more similar than those of ppyy and bpp with pairwise rmsds of        or         respectively in contrast to the conformational similarities in the dpc bound state their structures in solution are very different in fact ppyy is more similar to bpp which with its strong preference for the y receptor displays a completely different binding profile considering the high degree of sequence homology of pnpy and ppyy  gt   and the fact that their binding affinities at all receptor subtypes are high and more importantly rather similar it is much more likely that pyy and npy are recognized by the y receptors from the membrane bound state as a consequence of the latter the pp fold is not important for recognition of pyy or npy at the y receptors to our knowledge this work provides for the first time strong arguments derived from structural data that support a membrane bound receptor recognition pathway
