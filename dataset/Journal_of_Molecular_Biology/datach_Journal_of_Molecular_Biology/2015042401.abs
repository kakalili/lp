multiscale modeling of a conditionally disordered ph sensing chaperone
the ph sensing chaperone hdea promotes the survival of enteropathogenic bacteria during transit through the harshly acidic environment of the mammalian stomach at low ph hdea transitions from an inactive folded dimer to chaperone active disordered monomers to protect against the acid induced aggregation of periplasmic proteins toward achieving a detailed mechanistic understanding of the ph response of hdea we develop a multiscale modeling approach to capture its ph dependent thermodynamics our approach combines pka logarithmic acid dissociation constant calculations from all atom constant ph molecular dynamics simulations with coarse grained modeling and yields new atomic level insights into hdea chaperone function that can be directly tested by experiment   ph triggers  that significantly destabilize the dimer are each located near the n terminus of a helix suggesting that their neutralization at low ph destabilizes the helix macrodipole as a mechanism of monomer disordering moreover we observe a non monotonic change in the ph dependent stability of hdea with maximal stability of the dimer near ph  this affect is attributed to the protonation glu  which exhibits an anomalously high pka value and is located within the hydrophobic dimer interface finally the ph dependent binding pathway of hdea comprises a partially unfolded dimeric intermediate that becomes increasingly stable relative to the native dimer at lower ph values and displays key structural features for chaperone  substrate interaction we anticipate that the insights from our model will help inform ongoing nmr and biochemical investigations
