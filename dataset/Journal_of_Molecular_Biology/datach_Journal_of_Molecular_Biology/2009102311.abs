crystal structure of the hexameric catabolic ornithine transcarbamylase from lactobacillus hilgardii structural insights into the oligomeric assembly and metal binding
catabolic ornithine transcarbamylase cotc ec     catalyzes the formation of ornithine orn and carbamoyl phosphate from citrulline which constitutes the second step of the degradation of arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway here we report the crystal structure of cotc from the lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus hilgardii lh cotc refined to     resolution the structure reveals that lh cotc forms a hexameric assembly which was also confirmed by gel filtration chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation the homohexamer with  point group symmetry represents a new oligomeric state within the members of the ornithine transcarbamylase family that are typically homotrimeric or homododecameric the c terminal end from each subunit constitutes a key structural element for the stabilization of the hexameric assembly in solution additionally the structure reveals for the first time in the ornithine transcarbamylase family a metal binding site located at the  fold molecular symmetry axis of each trimer
