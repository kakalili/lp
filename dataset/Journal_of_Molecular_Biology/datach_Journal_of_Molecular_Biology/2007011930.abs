selective photoaffinity labeling identifies the signal peptide binding domain on seca
seca an atpase crucial to the sec dependent translocation machinery in escherichia coli recognizes and directly binds the n terminal signal peptide of an exported preprotein this interaction plays a central role in the targeting and transport of preproteins via the secyeg channel here we identify the signal peptide binding groove spbg on seca addressing a key issue regarding the seca  preprotein interaction we employ a synthetic signal peptide containing the photoreactive benzoylphenylalanine to efficiently and specifically label seca containing a unique factor xa site comparison of the photolabeled fragment from the subsequent proteolysis of several secas which vary only in the location of the factor xa site reveals one  residue segment in common with the entire series the covalently modified seca segment produced is the same in aqueous solution and in lipid vesicles this spans amino acid residues   to   of the e coli protein which is distinct from a previously proposed signal peptide binding site and contributes to a hydrophobic peptide binding groove evident in molecular models of seca
