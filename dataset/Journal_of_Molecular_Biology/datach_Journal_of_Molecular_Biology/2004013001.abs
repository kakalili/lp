understanding protein  ligand interactions the price of protein flexibility
in order to design selective high affinity ligands to a target protein it is advantageous to understand the structural determinants for protein  ligand complex formation at the atomic level in a model system we have successively mapped the factor xa binding site onto trypsin showing that certain mutations influence both protein structure and inhibitor specificity our previous studies have shown that introduction of the  ssfi  sequence of factor xa into rat or bovine trypsin results in the destabilisation of the intermediate helix with burial of phe   the down conformation  surface exposure of the latter residue the up conformation is critical for the correct formation of the aromatic box found in factor xa  ligand complexes in the present study we investigate the influence of aromatic residues in position   replacement with the bulky tryptophan sswi shows reduced affinity for benzamidine based inhibitors   and   whereas removal of the side chain alanine ssai or exchange with a hydrophilic residue arginine ssri leads to a significant loss in affinity for all inhibitors studied the variants could be crystallised in the presence of different inhibitors in multiple crystal forms structural characterisation of the variants revealed three different conformations of the intermediate helix and   loop in ssai down up and super up  as well as a complete disorder of this region in one crystal form of ssri suggesting that the compromised affinity of these variants is related to conformational flexibility the influence of glu   peripheral to the ligand binding site in factor xa was investigated introduction of glu  into trypsin variants containing the ssfi sequence exhibited enhanced affinity for the factor xa ligands   and   the crystal structures of these variants also exhibited the down and super up conformations the latter of which could be converted to up upon soaking and binding of inhibitor   the improved affinity of the glu  containing variants appears to be due to a shift towards the up conformation thus the reduction in affinity caused by conformational variability of the protein target can be partially or wholly offset by compensatory binding to the up conformation the insights provided by these studies will be helpful in improving our understanding of ligand binding for the drug design process
