rna binding protein rbms is expressed in activated hepatic stellate cells and liver fibrosis and increases expression of transcription factor prx
hepatic stellate cells hscs are mesenchymal cells of the liver activation of which is responsible for excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix including type i collagen and development of liver fibrosis the activation of hscs is driven by transcription factors and pair related homeobox transcription factor prx was identified as one of the transcription factors involved in this process because transcription of collagen   i gene is stimulated by prx in hscs and in the liver here we show that expression of the rna binding protein rbms is upregulated in the activation of hscs and fibrotic livers immunoprecipitation followed by differential display identified prx mrna as one of the mrnas interacting with rbms  the rbms sequence specific binding site was mapped to   nt located    nt   of the stop codon of prx mrna ectopic expression of rbms in quiescent hscs which express trace amounts of type i collagen increased expression of prx mrna and collagen   i mrna expression of reporter prx mrna containing the rbms binding site was higher than the mrna lacking this site over expression of rbms further increased the steady state level of the reporter mrna containing rbms binding site but had no effect on the mrna lacking this site binding of rbms to the prx    utr increased the half life of this mrna resulting in increased protein synthesis these results suggest that rbms  by binding prx mrna in a sequence specific manner controls prx expression and indirectly collagen synthesis this is the first description of the function of rbms  as a key regulator of profibrotic potential of hscs representing a novel mechanism by which activated hscs contribute to liver fibrosis
