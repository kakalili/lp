structural and thermodynamic effects of post translational modifications in mutant and wild type cu zn superoxide dismutase
aggregation of cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  is implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis glutathionylation and phosphorylation of sod is omnipresent in the human body even in healthy individuals and has been shown to increase sod dimer dissociation which is the first step on the pathway toward sod aggregation we found that post translational modification of sod  especially glutathionylation promotes dimer dissociation we discovered an intermediate state in the pathway to dissociation a conformational change that involves a  loosening  of the  barrels and a loss or shift of dimer interface interactions in modified sod  this intermediate state is stabilized as compared to unmodified sod  the presence of post translational modifications could explain the environmental factors involved in the speed of disease progression because post translational modifications such as glutathionylation are often induced by oxidative stress post translational modification of sod could be a factor in the occurrence of sporadic cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis which represent   of all cases of the disease
