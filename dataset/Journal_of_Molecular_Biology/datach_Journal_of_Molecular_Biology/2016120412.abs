igpr  is required for endothelial cell  cell adhesion and barrier function
endothelial cell ec barrier function plays a prevalent regulatory mechanism for the integrity and homeostasis of blood vessels and modulates angiogenesis and immune responses cell adhesion molecules cams play a central role in the barrier function of ecs although ig containing and proline rich receptor  igpr  was recently identified as a novel cam expressed in ecs the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of igpr  in ecs remain uncharacterized in this report we investigated the role of igpr  in ec barrier function and the molecular mechanism of its activation in ecs we demonstrate that igpr  is localized to endothelial adherens junctions and through trans homophilic dimerization regulates endothelial cell  cell adhesion and barrier function trans homophilic dimerization of igpr  stimulates the phosphorylation of serine   ser   which is required for igpr  to regulate endothelial barrier function and angiogenesis moreover igpr  chimera which mimics the trans homophilic dimerization of igpr  induced a sustained phosphorylation of ser  upon stimulation with a ligand coordinated dimerization of igpr  and its homophilic interaction modulates its adhesive function and ser  phosphorylation this adhesive function of igpr  contributes to the barrier function of ecs
