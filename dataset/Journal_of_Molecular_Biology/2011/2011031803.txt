Mounting evidence points to the soluble oligomers of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide as important neurotoxic species in Alzheimer's disease, causing synaptic dysfunction and neuronal injury, and finally leading to neuronal death. The mechanism of the Aβ peptide self-assembly is still under debate. Here, Aβ1–40 peptide oligomers were studied using mass spectrometry combined with ion mobility spectrometry, which allowed separation of the signals of numerous oligomers and measurement of their collisional cross-section values (Ω). For several oligomers, at least two different species of different Ω values were detected, indicating the presence of at least two families of conformers: compact and extended. The obtained results are rationalized by a set of molecular models of Aβ1–40 oligomer structure that provided a very good correlation between the experimental and theoretical Ω values, both for the compact and the extended forms. Our results indicate that mass spectrometry detects oligomeric species that are on-pathway in the process of fibril formation or decay, but also alternative structures which may represent off-pathway evolution of oligomers.
