the    crystal structure of a bleomycin resistance determinant from bleomycin producing streptomyces verticillus edited by i a wilson
bleomycin bm binding protein designated blma which is a bm resistance determinant from bm producing streptomyces verticillus was crystallized in a form suitable for x ray diffraction analysis the diffraction intensity data were collected up to a resolution of    with a merging r value of    at a completeness of    the blma structure determined by the single isomorphous replacement method including the anomalous scattering effect sir as at a resolution of     was refined at    resolution the final r factor was    and rfree was    including  water molecules the crystal packing showed a dimer form which was generated by arm exchange the    high resolution experiment allowed an analysis of the side chain disorder of blma the structural comparison of blma with a homologous protein from streptoalloteichus hindustanus designated shble protein showed that a ser  gly  loop was farther from the groove which is a bm binding site in blma than in the shble protein furthermore the hydrophobicity of the groove in blma is much lower than that in the shble protein the structural differences between these proteins may be responsible for the observation that a half saturating concentration k   of bm is higher for blma than for the shble protein
