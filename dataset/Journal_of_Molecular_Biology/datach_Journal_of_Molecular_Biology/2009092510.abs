crystal structure of a periplasmic substrate binding protein in complex with calcium lactate
lactate is utilized in many biological processes and its transport across biological membranes is mediated with various types of transporters here we report the crystal structures of a lactate binding protein of a trap tripartite atp independent periplasmic secondary transporter from thermus thermophilus hb  the folding of the protein is typical for a type ii periplasmic solute binding protein and forms a dimer in a back to back manner one molecule of l lactate is clearly identified in a cleft of the protein as a complex with a calcium ion detailed crystallographic and biochemical analyses revealed that the calcium ion can be removed from the protein and replaced with other divalent cations this characterization of the structure of a protein binding with calcium lactate makes a significant contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms by which calcium and lactate are accommodated in cells
