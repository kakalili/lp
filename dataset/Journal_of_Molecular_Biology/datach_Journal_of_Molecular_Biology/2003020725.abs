identification of a novel gene linked to parkin via a bi directional promoter
mutations of the parkin gene on chromosome q   are the predominant genetic cause of early onset and autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism parkin is a multi domain protein with ubiquitin  protein e ligase activity that has a role in the proteasome mediated degradation of target substrates although the parkin gene contains an expanded intron exon structure and spans more than  mb we have identified a novel transcript that initiates  bp upstream of parkin and spans over  mb antisense to parkin we have tentatively named this novel gene parkin co regulated gene or pacrg a  bp site of bi directional transcription activation within the common promoter was mapped using dual luciferase assays this region appeared to be responsible for the majority of transcription regulation of both genes and comparison of the mouse and human sequences revealed conserved transcription factor binding sites a  bp interval within the activation region containing a non canonical myc binding site bound nuclear protein derived from human substantia nigra database analysis identified highly conserved homologs of pacrg encoded by the mouse and drosophila genomes and northern analysis demonstrated that pacrg and parkin were co expressed in many tissues including brain heart and muscle western analysis revealed a protein of the predicted size approximately  kda which was expressed in mouse and human brain although pacrg protein lacks known functional domains in silico prediction suggests a potential link to the ubiquitin proteasome system
