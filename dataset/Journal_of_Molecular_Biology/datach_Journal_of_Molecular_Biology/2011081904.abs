identification of  hydroxycytidine at position   concludes characterization of modified nucleotides in e coli  s rrna
complete characterization of a biomolecule s chemical structure is crucial in the full understanding of the relations between their structure and function the dominating components in ribosomes are ribosomal rnas rrnas  and the entire rrna  but a single modified nucleoside at position   in  s rrna  has previously been characterized in the bacterium escherichia coli despite a first report nearly   years ago the chemical nature of the modification at position   has remained elusive and attempts to isolate it have so far been unsuccessful we unambiguously identify this last unknown modification as  hydroxycytidine  a novel modification in rna identification of  hydroxycytidine was completed by liquid chromatography under nonoxidizing conditions using a graphitized carbon stationary phase in combination with ion trap tandem mass spectrometry and by comparing the fragmentation behavior of the natural nucleoside with that of a chemically synthesized ditto furthermore we show that  hydroxycytidine is also present in the equivalent position of  s rrna from the bacterium deinococcus radiodurans given the unstable nature of  hydroxycytidine this modification might be found in other rnas when applying the proper analytical conditions as described here
