a new model for schizosaccharomyces pombe telomere recognition the telomeric single stranded dna binding activity of pot
the protection of telomeres  pot  proteins specifically recognize the single stranded   end of the telomere an activity essential for sustained cellular viability and proliferation the current model for the telomeric single stranded dna ssdna binding activity of schizosaccharomyces pombe pot is based on a   kda fragment pot pn recent biochemical studies suggest that sppot contains a larger ssdna binding domain and we have identified a novel ssdna binding domain similar in size to the human pot domain this domain pot    binds extremely tightly to an oligonucleotide consisting of two conserved hexameric s pombe telomere repeats d ggttacggttac  with an affinity     fold tighter than pot pn binds its cognate ssdna the pot    ssdna complex exhibits a half life of   min consistent with that estimated for full length sppot and significantly longer than that of pot pn single nucleotide substitutions reveal that in contrast to pot pn tandem trinucleotide repeats gtt within d ggttacggttac are specifically recognized by pot    interestingly certain single nucleotide substitutions that impacted pot pn binding exhibited no effect on binding affinity by pot    however these substitutions reduced binding affinity when simultaneously substituted in each hexameric repeat the non additive nature of these substitutions suggests that certain nucleotides are coupled through the ability of the flexible ssdna oligonucleotide to adopt alternate thermodynamically equivalent conformations the biochemical behavior of pot    is more similar to that of the full length sppot protein than to that of pot pn making pot    a valuable domain for the future study of how full length sppot interacts with telomeric ssdna
