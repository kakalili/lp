structural and functional characterization of the  tubulin acetyltransferase mec
tubulin protomers undergo an extensive array of post translational modifications to tailor microtubules to specific tasks one such modification the acetylation of lysine  of  tubulin located in the lumen of microtubules is associated with stable long living microtubule structures mec  was recently identified as the acetyltransferase that mediates this event we have determined the crystal structure of the catalytic core of human mec  in complex with its cofactor acetyl coa at    resolution the structure reveals that the mec  core adopts a canonical gcn related n acetyltransferase gnat fold that is decorated with extensive surface loops an enzymatic analysis of  mec  surface mutants identifies hot spot residues for catalysis and substrate recognition a large evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic surface patch that is critical for enzymatic activity is identified suggesting that specificity is achieved by interactions with the  tubulin substrate that extend outside of the modified surface loop an analysis of mec  mutants in caenorhabditis elegans shows that enzymatic activity is dispensable for touch sensitivity
