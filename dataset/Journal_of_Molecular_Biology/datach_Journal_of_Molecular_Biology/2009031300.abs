sequence dependent nucleosome positioning
eukaryotic dna is organized into a macromolecular structure called chromatin the basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome which consists of two copies of each of the four core histones and dna the nucleosomal organization and the positions of nucleosomes have profound effects on all dna dependent processes understanding the factors that influence nucleosome positioning is therefore of general interest among the many determinants of nucleosome positioning the dna sequence has been proposed to have a major role here we analyzed more than     nucleosomal dna sequences to identify sequence features that guide the formation of nucleosomes in vivo we found that both a periodic enrichment of at base pairs and an out of phase oscillating enrichment of gc base pairs as well as the overall preference for gc base pairs are determinants of nucleosome positioning the preference for gc pairs can be related to a lower energetic cost required for deformation of the dna to wrap around the histones in line with this idea we found that only incorporation of both signal components into a sequence model for nucleosome formation results in maximal predictive performance on a genome wide scale in this manner one achieves greater predictive power than published approaches our results confirm the hypothesis that the dna sequence has a major role in nucleosome positioning in vivo
