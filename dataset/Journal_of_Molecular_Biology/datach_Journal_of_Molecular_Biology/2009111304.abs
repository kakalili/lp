stabilization of the tertiary structure of the cholera toxin a subunit inhibits toxin dislocation and cellular intoxication
cholera toxin ct moves from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum er by retrograde vesicular transport the catalytic subunit of ct cta  then crosses the er membrane and enters the cytosol in a process that involves the quality control mechanism of er associated degradation the molecular details of this dislocation event have not been fully characterized here we report that thermal instability in the cta subunit  specifically the loss of cta tertiary structure at    c  triggers toxin dislocation biophysical studies found that glycerol preferentially stabilized the tertiary structure of cta without having any noticeable effect on the thermal stability of its secondary structure the thermal disordering of cta tertiary structure normally preceded the perturbation of its secondary structure but in the presence of   glycerol the temperature induced loss of cta tertiary structure occurred at higher temperatures in tandem with the loss of cta secondary structure the glycerol induced stabilization of cta tertiary structure blocked cta dislocation from the er and instead promoted cta secretion into the extracellular medium this in turn inhibited ct intoxication glycerol treatment also inhibited the in vitro degradation of cta by the core  s proteasome collectively these findings indicate that toxin thermal instability plays a key role in the intoxication process they also suggest the stabilization of cta tertiary structure is a potential goal for novel antitoxin therapeutic agents
