solution structure of the yeast rad  fha complexed with a phosphothreonine peptide ptxxl comparison with the structures of fha pyxl and fha ptxxd complexes edited by m f summers
it was proposed previously that the fha domain of the yeast protein kinase rad  has dual specificity toward py and pt peptides the consensus sequences of py peptides for binding to fha  as well as the solution structures of free fha and fha complex with a py peptide derived from rad  have been obtained previously we now report the use of a pt library to screen for binding of pt peptides with the fha domain the results show that fha binds favorably to pt peptides with ile at the  position we then searched the rad sequences with a ptxxi l motif and tested the binding affinity of fha toward ten pt peptides derived from rad  one of the peptides   evel pt qelp   displayed the best binding affinity kd     m and the greatest chemical shift changes the structure of the fha complex with this peptide was then determined by solution nmr and the structure of the complex between fha and the py peptide  edi py yld  was further refined structural comparison of these two complexes indicates that the leu residue at the  position in the pt peptide and that at the  position in the py peptide occupy a very similar position relative to the binding site residues from fha  this can explain why fha is able to bind both pt and py peptides this position change from  to  could be the consequence of the size difference between thr and tyr further insight into the structural basis of ligand specificity of fha domains was obtained by comparing the structures of the fha ptxxl complex obtained in this work and the fha ptxxd complex reported in the accompanying paper
