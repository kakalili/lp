The flap endonucleases, or 5′ nucleases, are involved in DNA replication and repair. They possess both 5′-3′ exonucleolytic activity and the ability to cleave bifurcated, or branched DNA, in an endonucleolytic, structure-specific manner. These enzymes share a great degree of structural and sequence similarity. Conserved acidic amino acids, whose primary role appears to be chelation of essential divalent cation cofactors, lie at the base of the active site. A loop, or helical archway, is located above the active site. A conserved tyrosine residue lies at the base of the archway in phage T5 flap endonuclease. This residue is conserved in the structures of all flap endonucleases analysed to date. We mutated the tyrosine 82 codon in the cloned T5 5′ nuclease to one encoding phenylalanine. Detailed analysis of the purified Y82F protein revealed only a modest (3.5-fold) decrease in binding affinity for DNA compared with wild-type in the absence of cofactor. The modified nuclease retains both structure-specific endonuclease and exonuclease activities. Kinetic analysis was performed using a newly developed single-cleavage assay based on hydrolysis of a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide substrate. Substrate and products were resolved by denaturing HPLC. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl function did not significantly impair kcat. Pre-steady state analysis under single-turnover conditions also demonstrated little change in the rate of reaction compared to the wild-type protein. The pH dependence of the kinetic parameters for the Y82F enzyme-catalysed reaction was bell-shaped as for the wild-type protein. Thus, Y82 does not play a role in catalysis. However, steady-state analysis did detect a large (∽300-fold) defect in KM. These results imply that this conserved tyrosine plays a key role in ternary complex formation (protein–DNA–metal ion), a prerequisite for catalysis.
