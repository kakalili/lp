molecular enzymology of the eco rv dna adenine n  methyltransferase kinetics of dna binding and bending kinetic mechanism and linear diffusion of the enzyme on dna edited by j karn
the eco rv dna adenine n  methyltransferase recognizes gatatc sequences and modifies the first adenine residue within this site we show here that the enzyme binds to the dna and the cofactor s adenosylmethionine adomet in an ordered bi bi fashion with adomet being bound first m eco rv binds dna in a non specific manner and the enzyme searches for its recognition site by linear diffusion with a range of approximately   bp during linear diffusion the enzyme continuously scans the dna for the presence of recognition sites upon specific m eco rv dna complex formation a strong increase in the fluorescence of an oligonucleotide containing a  aminopurine base analogue at the gat ap tc position is observed which most likely is correlated with dna bending in contrast to the gat ap tc substrate a g ap tatc substrate in which the target base is replaced by  aminopurine does not show an increase in fluorescence upon m eco rv binding demonstrating that  aminopurine is not a general tool to detect base flipping stopped flow experiments show that dna bending is a fast process with rate constants gt  s   in the presence of cofactor the specific complex adopts a second conformation in which the target sequence is more tightly contacted by the enzyme m eco rv exists in an open and in a closed state that are in slow equilibrium closing the open state is a slow process rate constant    min   that limits the rate of dna methylation under single turnover conditions product release requires opening of the closed complex which is very slow rate constant        min   and limits the rate of dna methylation under multiple turnover conditions m eco rv methylates dna sequences containing more than one recognition sites in a distributive manner since the dissociation rate from non specific dna does not depend on the length of the dna fragment dna dissociation does not preferentially occur at the ends of the dna
