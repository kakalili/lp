crystal structures of mouse   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase apoenzyme and enzyme nadp h binary complex  identification of molecular determinants responsible for the unique   reductive activity of this enzyme
very recently the mouse   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase m   hsd  a member of the aldo keto reductase akr superfamily has been characterized and identified as the unique enzyme able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione    into epitestosterone epi t  the   epimer of testosterone indeed the other akr enzymes that significantly reduce keto groups situated at position c  of the steroid nucleus the human type    hsd h  hsd  the human and mouse type    hsd and the rabbit   hsd produce only   hydroxy derivatives although they possess more than   amino acid identity with m   hsd structural comparisons of these highly homologous enzymes thus offer an excellent opportunity of identifying the molecular determinants responsible for their      stereospecificity here we report the crystal structure of the m   hsd enzyme in its apo form     resolution as well as those of two different forms of this enzyme in binary complex with nadp h      and     resolution  interestingly one of these binary complex structures could represent a conformational intermediate between the apoenzyme and the active binary complex these structures provide a complete picture of the nadp h enzyme interactions involving the flexible loop b which can adopt two different conformations upon cofactor binding structural comparison with binary complexes of other akr c enzymes has also revealed particularities of the interaction between m   hsd and nadp h  which explain why it has been possible to crystallize this enzyme in its apo form close inspection of the m   hsd steroid binding cavity formed upon cofactor binding leads us to hypothesize that the residue at position  is of paramount importance for the stereospecificity of the reduction reaction mutagenic studies have showed that the m   hsd a y mutant exhibited a completely reversed stereospecificity producing testosterone only from   whereas the h  hsd y a mutant acquires the capacity to metabolize   into epi t
