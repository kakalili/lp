erythroid kruppel like factor regulates the g cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p ink c
erythroid kruppel like factor eklf klf  is an essential erythroid cell specific c h zinc finger transcription factor that binds cacc box elements in promoters and distant regulatory elements to activate transcription forced expression of eklf arrests cell division the cyclin dependent kinase cdk inhibitor p ink c was identified as a potential novel eklf target gene from an expression profiling study the p ink c protein functions as an inhibitor of cdk and cdk activity during early g phase of the cell cycle thus acting as a physiological brake on cell division we confirmed p ink c is downregulated in eklf null mice by real time pcr and western blotting and identified three closely associated and highly conserved eklf binding sites ccncncccn approximately  kb upstream of the p ink c transcriptional start site we showed that eklf binds to one of these elements by gel shift assay and demonstrated this site is capable of driving eklf dependent transcription we also determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation chip that this region of the p ink c promoter is bound by eklf in erythroid cells thus eklf is a direct regulator of p ink c gene expression and much of eklf s role in driving erythroid cell differentiation may occur via p ink c
