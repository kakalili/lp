molecular interactions of alzheimer s a  protofilaments with lipid membranes
amyloid fibrils and peptide oligomers play central roles in the pathology of alzheimer s disease type  diabetes parkinson s disease huntington s disease and prion related disease here we investigate the molecular interactions between preformed amyloid   a  molecular protofilaments and lipid bilayer membranes in the presence of explicit water molecules using computational models and all atom molecular dynamics these interactions play an important role in the stability and function of both a  fibrils and the adjacent cellular membrane taking advantage of the symmetry related and directional properties of the protofilaments we build models that cover several relative protofilament  membrane orientations our molecular dynamics simulations reveal the relative contributions of different structural elements to the dynamics and stability of a  protofilament segments near membranes and the first steps in the mechanism of fibril  membrane interactions during this process we observe a significant alteration of the side chain contact pattern in protofilaments although a fraction of the characteristic  sheet content is preserved as a major driving force we identify the electrostatic interactions between a  charged side chains including e  d  and k  and lipid headgroups together with hydrogen bonding with atoms from lipid headgroups these interactions can facilitate the penetration of hydrophobic c terminal amino acids through the lipid headgroup region which can finally lead both to further loss of the initial fibril structure and to local membrane thinning effects our results may guide new experiments that could test the extent to which the structural features of water formed amyloid fibrils are preserved lost or reshaped by membrane mediated interactions
