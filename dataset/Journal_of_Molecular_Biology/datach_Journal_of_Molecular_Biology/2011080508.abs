three dimensional structure of  crystallin domain dimers of human small heat shock proteins hspb and hspb
small heat shock proteins shsps are a family of evolutionary conserved atp independent chaperones these proteins share a common architecture defined by a signature  crystallin domain acd flanked by highly variable n and c terminal extensions the acd which has an immunoglobulin like fold plays an important role in shsp assembly this domain mediates dimer formation of individual protomers which then may assemble into larger oligomers in vertebrate shsps the dimer interface is formed by the symmetrical antiparallel pairing of two  strands    generating an extended  sheet on one face of the acd dimer recent structural studies of isolated acds from a number of vertebrate shsps suggest a variability in the register of the     strand interface which may in part give rise to the polydispersity often associated with the full length proteins to further analyze the structure of acd dimers we have employed a combination of x ray crystallography and solution small angle x ray scattering saxs to study the acd containing fragments of human hspb  hsp  and hspb  hsp   unexpectedly the obtained crystal structure of the hspb fragment does not reveal the typical     dimers but rather hexamers formed by an asymmetric contact between the   and the   strands from adjacent acds nevertheless in solution both acds form stable dimers via the symmetric antiparallel interaction of   strands using saxs we show that it is possible to discriminate between different putative registers of the     interface with the results indicating that under physiological conditions there is only a single register of the strands for both proteins
