conformational flexibility of four way junctions in rna
helical junctions are common architectural features in rna they are particularly important in autonomously folding molecules as exemplified by the hairpin ribozyme we have used single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy to study the dynamic properties of the perfect  h four way helical junction derived from the hairpin ribozyme in the presence of mg  the junction samples parallel and antiparallel conformations and both stacking conformers with a bias towards one antiparallel stacking conformer there is continual interconversion between the forms such that there are several transitions per second under physiological conditions our data suggest that interconversion proceeds via an open intermediate with reduced cation binding in which coaxial stacking between helices is disrupted the rate of interconversion becomes slower at higher mg  concentrations yet the activation barrier decreases under these conditions indicating that entropic effects are important transitions also occur in the presence of na only however the coaxial stacking appears incomplete under these conditions the polymorphic and dynamic character of the four way rna junction provides a source of structural diversity from which particular conformations required for biological function might be stabilised by additional rna interactions or protein binding
