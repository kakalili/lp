the ptdins   p ligand itself influences the localization of pkc  in the plasma membrane of intact living cells
rapamycin triggered heterodimerization strategy is becoming an excellent tool for rapidly modifying phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate ptdins   p  levels at the plasma membrane and for studying their influence in different processes in this work we studied the effect of modulation of the ptdins   p concentration on protein kinase c pkc   membrane localization in intact living cells we showed that an increase in the ptdins   p concentration enlarges the permanence of pkc  in the plasma membrane when pc  cells are stimulated with atp independently of the diacylglycerol generated the depletion of this phosphoinositide decreases both the percentage of protein able to translocate to the plasma membrane and its permanence there our results demonstrate that the polybasic cluster located in the c domain of pkc  is responsible for this phosphoinositide  protein interaction furthermore the c domain acts as a dominant interfering module in the neural differentiation process of pc  cells a fact that was also supported by the inhibitory effect obtained by knocking down pkc  with small interfering rna duplexes taken together these data demonstrate that ptdins   p itself targets pkc  to the plasma membrane through the polybasic cluster located in the c domain with this interaction being critical in the signaling network involved in neural differentiation
