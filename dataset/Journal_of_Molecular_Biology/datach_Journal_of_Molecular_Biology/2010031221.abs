different folding pathways taken by highly homologous proteins goat  lactalbumin and canine milk lysozyme
is the folding pathway conserved in homologous proteins to address this question we compared the folding pathways of goat  lactalbumin and canine milk lysozyme using equilibrium and kinetic circular dichroism spectroscopy both ca  binding proteins have   sequence identity and essentially identical backbone structures the  value analysis based on the effect of ca  on the folding kinetics showed that the ca  binding site was well organized in the transition state in  lactalbumin although it was not yet organized in lysozyme equilibrium unfolding and hydrogen exchange d nmr analysis of the molten globule intermediate also showed that different regions were stabilized in the two proteins in  lactalbumin the ca  binding site and the c helix were weakly organized whereas the a and b helices both distant from the ca  binding site were well organized in lysozyme the results thus provide an example of highly homologous proteins taking different folding pathways to understand the molecular origin of this difference we investigated the native three dimensional structures of the proteins in terms of non local contact clusters a parameter based on the residue  residue contact map and known to be well correlated with the folding rate of non two state proteins there were remarkable differences between the proteins in the distribution of the non local contact clusters and these differences provided a reasonable explanation of the observed difference in the folding initiation sites in conclusion the protein folding pathway is determined not only by the backbone topology but also by the specific side chain interactions of contacting residues
