quasi equivalence in site specific recombinase structure and function crystal structure and activity of trimeric cre recombinase bound to a three way lox dna junction edited by k morikawa
the crystal structure of a novel cre lox synapse was solved using phases from multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering and refined to     resolution in this complex a symmetric protein trimer is bound to a y shaped three way dna junction a marked departure from the pseudo  fold symmetrical tetramer associated with cre mediated loxp recombination the three way dna junction was accommodated by a simple kink without significant distortion of the adjoining dna duplexes although the mean angle between dna arms in the y and x structures was similar adjacent cre trimer subunits rotated    relative to those in the tetramers this rotation was accommodated at the protein protein and dna dna interfaces by interactions that are  quasi equivalent  to those in the tetramer analogous to packing differences of chemically identical viral subunits at non equivalent positions in icosahedral capsids this structural quasi equivalence extends to function as cre can bind to cleave and perform strand transfer with a three way lox substrate the structure explains the dual recognition of three and four way junctions by site specific recombinases as being due to shared structural features between the differently branched substrates and plasticity of the protein protein interfaces to our knowledge this is the first direct demonstration of quasi equivalence in both the assembly and function of an oligomeric enzyme
