stabilization of the transition state for the transfer of tyrosine to trnatyr by tyrosyl trna synthetase edited by a r fersht
aminoacylation of trnatyr involves two steps   tyrosine activation to form the tyrosyl adenylate intermediate and   transfer of tyrosine from the tyrosyl adenylate intermediate to trnatyr in bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl trna synthetase asp  tyr   and gln  have been shown to form hydrogen bonds with the  ammonium group of the tyrosine substrate during the first step of the aminoacylation reaction asp  and gln  stabilize the transition state complex for the first step of the reaction by hydrogen bonding with the   hydroxyl group of amp and the carboxylate oxygen atom of tyrosine respectively here the roles that asp  tyr   gln   asp   and gln  play in catalysis of the second step of the reaction are investigated pre steady state kinetic analyses of alanine variants at each of these positions shows that while the replacement of gln  by alanine does not affect the initial binding of the trnatyr substrate it destabilizes the transition state complex for the second step of the reaction by   kcal mol none of the other alanine substitutions affects either the initial binding of the trnatyr substrate or the stability of the transition state for the second step of the aminoacylation reaction taken together the results presented here and the accompanying paper are consistent with a concerted reaction mechanism for the transfer of tyrosine to trnatyr and suggest that catalysis of the second step of trnatyr aminoacylation involves stabilization of a transition state in which the scissile acylphosphate bond of the tyrosyl adenylate species is strained cleavage of the scissile bond on the breakdown of the transition state alleviates this strain
