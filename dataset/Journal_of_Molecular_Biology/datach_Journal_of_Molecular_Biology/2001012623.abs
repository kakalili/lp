different structural requirements for plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai  during latency transition and proteinase inhibition as evidenced by phage displayed hypermutated pai  libraries edited by j a wells
plasminogen activator inhibitor type  pai  is a member of the serine protease inhibitor serpin superfamily its highly mobile reactive center loop rcl is thought to account for both the rapid inhibition of tissue type plasminogen activator t pa  and the rapid and spontaneous transition of the unstable active form of pai  into a stable inactive latent conformation t  at   c   hours  we determined the amino acid residues responsible for the inherent instability of pai  to assess whether these properties are independent and consequently whether the structural basis for inhibition and latency transition is different for that purpose a hypermutated pai  library that is displayed on phage was pre incubated for increasing periods   to  hours at   c prior to a stringent selection for rapid t pa binding accordingly four rounds of phage display selection resulted in the isolation of a stable pai  variant st   t    hours with  amino acid mutations backcrossing by dna shuffling of this stable mutant with wt pai  was performed to eliminate non contributing mutations it was shown that the combination of mutations at positions                    and   increases the half life of pai    fold furthermore within the limits of detection the stable mutants isolated are functionally indistinguishable from wild type pai  with respect to the rate of inhibition of t pa cleavage by t pa and binding to vitronectin these stabilizing mutations constitute largely reversions to the stable  serpin consensus sequence  and are located in areas implicated in pai  stability e g the vitronectin binding domain and the proximal hinge  collectively our data provide evidence that the structural requirements for pai  loop insertion during latency transition and target proteinase inhibition can be separated
