molecular basis of bacterial defense against host lysozymes x ray structures of periplasmic lysozyme inhibitors plii and plic
lysozymes play a key role in the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan a vital component of the bacterial cell wall gram negative bacteria produce various types of lysozyme inhibitors that allow them to survive the bactericidal action of lysozyme when their outer membrane is permeabilized so far three lysozyme inhibitor families have been described the ivy inhibitor of vertebrate lysozyme family the mlic plic membrane associated periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of c type lysozyme family and the plii periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor of i type lysozyme family here we report high resolution crystal structures of salmonella typhimurium plic plic st and aeromonas hydrophila plii plii ah  the structure of plii ah is the first in the recently discovered plii family of lysozyme inhibitors while the structure of plic st is the first structure of a periplasmic lysozyme inhibitor from the plic mlic family using small angle x ray scattering we demonstrate that both plic st and plii ah form stable dimers in solution the functional dimer architecture of plic st is very different from that of the recently described mlic from pseudomonas aeruginosa mlic pa  despite the close resemblance of their monomers furthermore plii ah has distinctly different monomer and dimer folds compared to plic mlic and ivy proteins site directed mutagenesis suggests that the inhibitory action of plii ah proceeds via an insertion of a loop containing the conserved sgxy motif into the active center of i type lysozymes this motif is related to the functional sgxxy motif found in the mlic plic family
