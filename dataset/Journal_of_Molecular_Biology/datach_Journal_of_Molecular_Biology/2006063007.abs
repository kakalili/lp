dm cctg  cagg repeats are crossover hotspots that are more prone to expansions than the dm ctg  cag repeats in escherichia coli
myotonic dystrophy type  dm  is caused by the extreme expansion of the repeating tetranucleotide cctg  cagg sequence from lt  repeats in normal individuals to      for the full mutation in certain patients this repeat is in intron  of the zinc finger protein  gene on chromosome q  since prior work demonstrated that ctg  cag and gaa  ttc triplet repeats responsible for dm and friedreich s ataxia respectively can expand by genetic recombination we investigated the capacity of the dm tetranucleotide repeats to also expand during this process both gene conversion and unequal crossing over are attractive mechanisms to effect these very large expansions  cctg  cagg n where n       or   repeats showed high recombination crossover frequencies up to  fold higher than the non repeating control in an intramolecular plasmid system in escherichia coli furthermore a distinct orientation effect was observed where orientation ii cagg on the leading strand template was more prone to recombine expansions of up to double the length of the tetranucleotide repeats were found also the repeating tetranucleotide sequence was more prone to expansions to give lengths longer than a single repeating tract than deletions as observed for the ctg  cag and gaa  ttc repeats we determined that the dm tetranucleotide repeats showed a lower thermodynamic stability when compared to the dm trinucleotide repeats which could make them better targets for dna repair events thus explaining their expansion prone behavior genetic studies in sos repair mutants revealed high frequencies of recombination crossovers although the sos response itself was not induced thus the genetic instabilities of the cctg  cagg repeats may be mediated by a recombination repair mechanism that is influenced by dna structure
