phosphorylation of the n terminal domain regulates subcellular localization and dna binding properties of the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase hpar
human parvulin   hpar  is a folding helper enzyme belonging to the parvulin family of peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases ppiases  this enzyme is thought to play a role in cell cycle and chromatin remodeling although hpar  was nuclearly localized and bound to double stranded dna the molecular basis of the subcellular localization and the functional regulation remained unknown here we show that subcellular localization and dna binding ability of hpar  is regulated by posttranslational modification of its n terminal domain as proved by maldi tof mass spectrometry and ms ms fragmentation hpar  is phosphorylated at ser  in vitro and in vivo in human hela cells the protein is most likely modified by casein kinase  ck  phosphorylation of hpar  is inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by   dichloro   d ribofuranosyl benzimidazole drb  a specific inhibitor of ck activity mutation of ser  to ala abolishes phosphorylation and alters the subcellular localization of hpar  from predominantly nuclear to significantly cytoplasmic immunostaining shows that a glu  mutant of hpar  which mimics the phosphorylated state of ser  is localized around the nuclear envelope but does not penetrate into the nucleoplasm in contrast to wild type hpar  the in vitro dna binding affinity of the glu  mutant is strongly reduced suggesting that only the dephosphorylated protein is the active dna binding form of hpar  in the nucleus
