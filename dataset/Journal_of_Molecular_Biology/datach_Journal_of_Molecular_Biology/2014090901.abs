the presence of an rna dna hybrid that is prone to slippage promotes termination by t rna polymerase
intrinsic termination signals for multisubunit bacterial rna polymerases rnaps encode a gc rich stem  loop structure followed by a polyuridine poly u  tract and it has been proposed that steric clash of the stem  loop with the exit pore of the rnap imposes a shearing force on the rna in the downstream rna dna hybrid resulting in misalignment of the active site the structurally unrelated t rnap terminates at a similar type of signal t   suggesting a common mechanism for termination in the absence of a hairpin passive conditions  t rnap slips efficiently in both homopolymeric a and u tracts and we have found that replacement of the u tract in t  with a slippage prone a tract still allows efficient termination under passive conditions incorporation of a single g residue following a poly u tract which is the situation during termination at t  results in a  locked  complex that is unable to extend the transcript our results support a model in which transmission of the shearing force generated by steric clash of the hairpin with the exit pore is promoted by the presence of a slippery tracts downstream resulting in alterations in the active site and the formation of a locked complex that represents an early step in the termination pathway
