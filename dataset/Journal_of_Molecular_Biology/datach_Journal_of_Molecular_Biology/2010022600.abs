crystal structures of penicillin binding proteins  and  from haemophilus influenzae
we have determined high resolution apo crystal structures of two low molecular weight penicillin binding proteins pbps  pbp and pbp  from haemophilus influenzae one of the most frequently found pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of children novel  lactams with notable antimicrobial activity have been designed and crystal structures of pbp complexed with ampicillin and two of the novel molecules have also been determined comparing the apo form with those of the complexes we find that the drugs disturb the pbp structure and weaken x ray diffraction to very different extents pbp has recently been shown to act as a sensor of the presence of penicillins in pseudomonas aeruginosa and our models offer a clue to the structural basis for this effect covalently attached penicillins press against a phenylalanine residue near the active site and disturb the deacylation step the ready inhibition of pbp by  lactams compared to pbp also appears to be related to the weaker interactions holding key residues in a catalytically competent position
