visualization of two binding sites for the escherichia coli umud  c complex dna pol v on reca ssdna filaments edited by m gottesman
the heterotrimeric umud  c complex of escherichia coli has recently been shown to possess intrinsic dna polymerase activity dna pol v that facilitates error prone translesion dna synthesis sos mutagenesis  when overexpressed in vivo umud  c also inhibits homologous recombination in both activities umud  c interacts with reca nucleoprotein filaments to examine the biochemical and structural basis of these reactions we have analyzed the ability of the umud  c complex to bind to reca ssdna filaments in vitro as estimated by a gel retardation assay binding saturates at a stoichiometry of approximately one complex per two reca monomers visualized by cryo electron microscopy under these conditions umud  c is seen to bind uniformly along the filaments such that the complexes are completely submerged in the deep helical groove this mode of binding would impede access to dna in a reca filament thus explaining the ability of umud  c to inhibit homologous recombination at sub saturating binding the distribution of umud  c complexes along reca ssdna filaments was characterized by immuno gold labelling with anti umuc antibodies these data revealed preferential binding at filament ends most likely at one end  end specific binding is consistent with genetic models whereby such binding positions the umud  c complex pol v appropriately for its role in sos mutagenesis
