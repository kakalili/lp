specific recognition of a single stranded rna sequence by a synthetic antibody fragment
antibodies that bind rna represent an unrealized source of reagents for synthetic biology and for characterizing cellular transcriptomes however facile access to rna binding antibodies requires the engineering of effective fab libraries guided by the knowledge of the principles that govern rna recognition here we describe a fab identified from a minimalist synthetic library during phage display against a branched rna target the fab brg binds with  nm dissociation constant to a single stranded rna ssrna sequence adjacent to the branch site and can block the action of debranchase enzyme we report the crystal structure in complex with rna target at     the fab traps the rna in a hairpin conformation that contains a  bp duplex capped by a tetraloop the paratope surface consists of residues located in four complementarity determining regions including a major contribution from h  which adopts a helical structure that projects into a deep wide groove formed by the rna the amino acid composition of the paratope reflects the library diversity consisting mostly of tyrosine and serine residues and a small but significant contribution from a single arginine residue this structure involving the recognition of ssrna via a stem  loop conformation together with our two previous structures involving the recognition of an rna hairpin loop and an rna tertiary structure reveals the capacity of minimalist libraries biased with tyrosine serine glycine and arginine to form binding surfaces for specific rna conformations and distinct levels of rna structural hierarchy
