expression of connexin  in oligodendrocytes is regulated by the sox  transcription factor
in the central nervous system connexin  and connexin  are confined to oligodendrocytes where they contribute to myelin formation and maintenance and are essential for establishing a functional glial syncytium that ensures ionic homeostasis despite their importance not much is known about the regulation of connexin gene expression in oligodendrocytes here we identify group e sox proteins in particular sox  as essential transcriptional regulators of both connexins not only was expression of connexin  and connexin  severely compromised in spinal cords of mouse mutants with reduced amounts of group e sox proteins sox  also stimulated in transient transfections the connexin  promoter as well as connexin  promoter b which is the main connexin  promoter active in the postnatal spinal cord detailed characterization of connexin  promoter b identified a single monomer binding site that mediated sox  dependent promoter activation the region containing this binding site was also occupied by endogenous sox  in  b oligodendroglioma cells these results add connexin  and connexin  to the list of sox  target genes and argue that sox  may influence transcription of many terminal differentiation and myelination genes in oligodendrocytes as an essential regulatory component of the myelination program
