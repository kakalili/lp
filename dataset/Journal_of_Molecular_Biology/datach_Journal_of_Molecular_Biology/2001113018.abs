solution structure and backbone dynamics of an engineered arginine rich subdomain  of the hepatitis c virus ns rna helicase edited by m f summers
the ns protein of the hepatitis c virus hcv is a   amino acid residue bifunctional enzyme with a serine protease localized to the n terminal   residues and an rna helicase located in the c terminal   residues the hcv ns rna helicase consists of three well defined subdomains which all contribute to its helicase activity the second subdomain of the hcv helicase is flexibly linked to the remainder of the ns protein and could undergo rigid body movements during the unwinding of double stranded rna it also contains several motifs that are implicated in rna binding and in coupling ntp hydrolysis to nucleic acid unwinding and translocation as part of our efforts to use nmr techniques to assist in deciphering the enzyme  s structure function relationships and developing specific small molecule inhibitors we have determined the solution structure of an engineered subdomain  of the ns rna helicase of hcv d  hcvh and studied the backbone dynamics of this protein by  n relaxation experiments using a model free approach the nmr studies on this   residue construct reveal that overall subdomain  of the hcv helicase is globular and well structured in solution even in the absence of the remaining parts of the ns protein its solution structure is very similar to the corresponding parts in the x ray structures of the hcv ns helicase domain and intact bifunctional hcv ns protein slow hydrogen deuterium exchange rates map to a well structured stable hydrophobic core region away from the subdomain interfaces in contrast the regions facing the subdomain interfaces in the hcv ns helicase domain are less well structured in d  hcvh show fast hydrogen deuterium exchange rates and the analysis of the dynamic properties of d  hcvh reveals that these regions of the protein show distinct dynamical features in particular residues in motif v which may be involved in transducing allosteric effects of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis on rna binding exhibit slow conformational exchange on the milli to microsecond time scale the intrinsic conformational flexibility of this loop region may facilitate conformational changes required for helicase function
