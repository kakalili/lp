functional transfer of an essential aspartate for the ion binding site in the stator proteins of the bacterial flagellar motor
rotation of the bacterial flagellar motor exploits the electrochemical potential of the coupling ion h or na  as its energy source in the marine bacterium vibrio alginolyticus the stator complex is composed of poma and pomb and conducts na across the cytoplasmic membrane to generate rotation the transmembrane tm region of pomb which forms the na conduction pathway together with tm and tm of poma has a highly conserved aspartate residue asp  that is essential for flagellar rotation this residue contributes to the na binding site however it is not clear whether residues other than asp  are involved in binding the coupling ion we examined the possibility that loss of the negative charge of asp  can be suppressed by introduction of negatively charged residues in tm or tm of poma the motility defect associated with the d n substitution in pomb could be rescued only by a n  d substitution in poma this result suggests that there must be a negatively charged ion binding pocket in the stator complex but that the presence of a negatively charged residue at position  of pomb is not essential a tandemly fused poma dimer containing the n  d mutation either in its n terminal or c terminal half with pomb d n was functional suggesting that pomb d n can form an ion binding pocket with either subunit of poma dimer the findings obtained in this study provide important clues to the mechanism of ion binding in the stator complex
