solution structure of the k turn and specifier loop domains from the bacillus subtilis tyrs t box leader rna
in gram positive bacteria the rna transcripts of many amino acid biosynthetic and aminoacyl trna synthetase genes contain   untranslated regions or leader rnas that function as riboswitches these t box riboswitches bind cognate trna molecules and regulate gene expression by a transcription attenuation mechanism the specifier loop domain of the leader rna contains nucleotides that pair with nucleotides in the trna anticodon loop and is flanked on one side by a kink turn k turn  or ga sequence motif we have determined the solution nmr structure of the k turn sequence element within the context of the specifier loop domain the k turn sequence motif has several noncanonical base pairs typical of k turn structures but adopts an extended conformation the specifier loop domain contains a loop e structural motif and the single strand specifier nucleotides stack with their watson  crick edges displaced toward the minor groove mg  leads to a significant bending of the helix axis at the base of the specifier loop domain but does not alter the k turn isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that the k turn sequence causes a small enhancement of the interaction between the trna anticodon arm and the specifier loop domain one possibility is that the k turn structure is formed and stabilized when trna binds the t box riboswitch and interacts with stem i and the antiterminator helix this motif in turn anchors the orientation of stem i relative to the   half of the leader rna further stabilizing the trna  t box complex
