determination of intramolecular distance distribution during protein folding on the millisecond timescale edited by a r fersht
a method for determination of transient on the millisecond timescale intramolecular distance distributions idds by time resolved dynamic non radiative excitation energy transfer measurements was developed the time course of the development of the idd between residues  and   in the core domain of escherichia coli adenylate kinase throughout refolding from the guhcl induced denatured state was determined the mean of the apparent idd reduced to a value close to its magnitude in the native protein within  ms the dead time of the instrument  at that time the width of that distribution was rather large        the large width implies that the intramolecular diffusion coefficient of the labeled segment does not exceed    cm second in a second slower phase of the refolding transition the width was reduced to its native value
