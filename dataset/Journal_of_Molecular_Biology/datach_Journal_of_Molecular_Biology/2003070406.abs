stepwise conversion of a mesophilic to a thermophilic ribozyme
a fundamental question in rna folding is the mechanism of thermodynamic stability we investigated the equilibrium folding of a series of sequence variants in which one to three motifs of a   nucleotide mesophilic ribozyme were substituted with the corresponding motifs from its thermophilic homologue substitution of three crucial motifs individually or in groups results in a continual increase in the stability and folding cooperativity in a stepwise fashion we find an unexpected relationship between stability and folding cooperativity without changing the folding cooperativity rnas having a similar native structure can only achieve moderate change in stability and likewise without changing stability rnas having a similar native structure can only achieve moderate change in folding cooperativity this intricate relationship must be included in the predictions of tertiary rna stability
