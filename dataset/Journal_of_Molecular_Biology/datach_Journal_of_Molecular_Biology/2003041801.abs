crystals of urokinase type plasminogen activator complexes reveal the binding mode of peptidomimetic inhibitors
urokinase type plasminogen activator upa  a trypsin like serine proteinase plays an important role in normal tissue re modelling cell adhesion and cell motility in addition studies utilizing normal animals and potent selective upa inhibitors or genetically modified mice that lack functional upa genes have demonstrated that upa can significantly enhance tumor initiation growth progression and metastasis strongly suggesting that this enzyme may be a promising anti cancer target we have investigated the structure  activity relationship sar of peptidomimetic inhibitors of upa and solved high resolution x ray structures of key lead small molecule inhibitors e g phenethylsulfonamidino p  d seryl p  l alanyl p  l argininal p  and derivatives thereof in complex with the upa proteinase domain these potent inhibitors are highly selective for upa the non natural d seryl residue present at the p position in these inhibitors contributes substantially to both potency and selectivity because due to its d configuration its side chain binds in the s pocket to interact with the upa unique residues leu b and his  additional potency and selectivity can be achieved by optimizing the inhibitor p residue to bind a pocket known as s sub or s   that is adjacent to the primary specificity pocket of upa
