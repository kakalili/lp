structural similarity between the prion domain of het s and a homologue can explain amyloid cross seeding in spite of limited sequence identity
we describe a distant homologue of the fungal het s prion which is found in the fungus fusarium graminearum the domain fghet s       which corresponds to the prion domain in het s from podospora anserina forms amyloid fibrils in vitro and is able to efficiently cross seed het s      prion formation we structurally characterize fghet s       which displays   sequence identity with het s       solid state nmr and hydrogen deuterium exchange detected by nmr show that the fold and a number of structural details are very similar for the prion domains of the two proteins this structural similarity readily explains why cross seeding occurs here in spite of the sequence divergence
