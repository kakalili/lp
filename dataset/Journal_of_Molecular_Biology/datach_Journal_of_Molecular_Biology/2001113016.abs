interaction of the bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal protein s  with its   translational operator mrna edited by i tinoco
the bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal protein s  bs  binds both a three helix junction in the central domain of  s ribosomal rna and its cognate mrna native gel mobility shift assays show that bs  interacts specifically and with high affinity to the   untranslated region    utr of this cognate mrna with an apparent dissociation constant of     nm in order to localize the structural elements that are essential for bs  recognition a series of deletion mutants of the full cognate mrna were prepared and tested in the same gel shift assay the minimal binding site for bs  is a  nucleotide rna showing a close secondary structure resemblance to the bs  binding region from  s rrna there are two major structural motifs that must be maintained for high affinity binding the first being a purine rich three helix junction and the second being an internal loop the sequence identity of the internal loops differs greatly between the bs  mrna and rrna sites and this difference is correlated to discrimination between wild type bs  and a bs  h r mutant the association and dissociation kinetics measured for the   utr bs  interaction are quite slow but are typical for a ribosomal protein rna interaction the bs  mrna and  s rrna binding sites share a common secondary structure yet have little sequence identity the mrna and rrna may in fact present similar if not identical structural elements that confer bs  recognition
