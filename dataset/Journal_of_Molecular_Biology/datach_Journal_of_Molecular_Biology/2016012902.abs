pseudocontact shift driven iterative resampling for d structure determinations of large proteins
pseudocontact shifts pcss induced by paramagnetic lanthanides produce pronounced effects in nuclear magnetic resonance spectra which are easily measured and which deliver valuable long range structure restraints even sparse pcs data greatly enhance the success rate of d  dimensional structure predictions of proteins by the modeling program rosetta the present work extends this approach to d structures of larger proteins comprising more than   residues which are difficult to model by rosetta without additional experimental restraints the new algorithm improves the fragment assembly method of rosetta by utilizing pcss generated from paramagnetic lanthanide ions attached at four different sites as the only experimental restraints the sparse pcs data are utilized at multiple stages to identify native like local structures to rank the best structural models and to rebuild the fragment libraries the fragment libraries are refined iteratively until convergence the pcs driven iterative resampling algorithm is strictly data dependent and shown to generate accurate models for a benchmark set of eight different proteins ranging from   to   residues using solely pcss of backbone amide protons
