cooperative omega loops in cytochrome c role in folding and function
hydrogen exchange experiments under slow exchange conditions show that an omega loop in cytochrome c residues     acts as a cooperative unfolding refolding unit under native conditions this unit behavior accounts for an initial step on the unfolding pathway a final step in refolding and a number of other structural functional and evolutionary properties
