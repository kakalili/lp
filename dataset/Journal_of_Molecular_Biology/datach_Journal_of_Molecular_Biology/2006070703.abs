oligomerization of the bacterial flagellar atpase flii is controlled by its extreme n terminal region
salmonella flii is the flagellar atpase which converts the energy of atp hydrolysis into the export of flagellar proteins it forms a ring shaped oligomer in the presence of atp its analogs or phospholipids the extreme n terminal region of flii has an unstable conformation and is responsible for the interaction with other components of the export apparatus and for regulation of the catalytic mechanism to understand the role of this n terminal region in more detail we used multi angle light scattering analytical ultracentrifugation far uv cd and biochemical methods to characterize a partially functional variant of flii missing its first seven amino acid residues his flii     whose atpase activity is about ten times lower than that of wild type flii his flii    is monomeric in solution the deletion increased the content of  helix suggesting that the deletion stabilizes the unstable n terminal region into an  helical conformation the deletion did not influence the km value for atp however unlike the wild type atp and acidic phospholipids did not induce oligomerization of his flii    or increase its atpase activity these results suggest that the deletion suppresses the oligomerization of flii and that a conformational change in the unstable n terminal region is required for flii oligomerization to effectively couple the energy of atp hydrolysis to the translocation of flagellar proteins
