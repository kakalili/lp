crystal structure and role of glycans and dimerization in folding of neuronal leucine rich repeat protein amigo
amigo  is the parent member of a novel family of three cell surface leucine rich repeat lrr proteins its expression is induced by the binding of hmgb  high mobility group box  protein to rage receptor for advanced glycation end products on neurons binding of hmgb to rage is known to have a direct effect on cellular growth regulation and mobility and amigo  directly supports growth of neuronal processes and fasciculation of neurites in addition the second member of the amigo family amigo  has been implicated in adhesion of tumor cells in adenocarcinoma and survival of neurons we have determined the crystal structure of amigo  at     resolution which reveals a typical cell surface lrr domain arrangement with n and c terminal capping domains with disulfide bridges followed by a c type ig domain amigo  is a dimer with the lrr regions forming the dimer interface and sequence conservation analysis and static light scattering measurements suggest that all three amigo family proteins form similar dimers based on the amigo  structure we have also modeled amigo  and present small angle x ray scattering data on amigo  and amigo  our mutagenesis studies show that amigo  dimerization is necessary for proper cell surface expression and thus probably for proper or stable folding in the endoplastic reticulum and for the function of the protein based on the data presented earlier we also suggest that dimerization through the lrr  lrr interface is likely to be involved in cell  cell adhesion by amigo  while extensive glycosylation may have a role
