perturbed folding kinetics of circularly permuted rnas with altered topology
the folding pathway of the tetrahymena ribozyme correlates inversely with the sequence distance between native interactions or contact order the rapidly folding p  p domain has a low contact order while the slowly folding p  p region has a high contact order to examine the role of topology and contact order in rna folding we screened for circular permutants of the ribozyme that retain catalytic activity permutants beginning in the p  p domain fold  to  times more slowly than the wild type ribozyme by contrast   of a permuted rna that disjoins a non native interaction in p folds tenfold faster than the wild type ribozyme hence the probability of rapidly folding to the native state depends on the topology of tertiary domains
