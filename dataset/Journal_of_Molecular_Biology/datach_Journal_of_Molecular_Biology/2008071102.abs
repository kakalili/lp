novel structure of the conserved gram negative lipopolysaccharide transport protein a and mutagenesis analysis
lipopolysaccharide lps transport protein a lpta is an essential periplasmic localized transport protein that has been implicated together with msba lptb and the imp rlpb complex in lps transport from the inner membrane to the outer membrane thereby contributing to building the cell envelope in gram negative bacteria and maintaining its integrity here we present the first crystal structures of processed escherichia coli lpta in two crystal forms one with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and the other with eight in both crystal forms severe anisotropic diffraction was corrected which facilitated model building and structural refinement the eight molecule form of lpta is induced when lps or ra lps a rough chemotype of lps is included during crystallization the unique lpta structure represents a novel fold consisting of  consecutive antiparallel  strands folded to resemble a slightly twisted  jellyroll each lpta molecule interacts with an adjacent lpta molecule in a head to tail fashion to resemble long fibers site directed mutagenesis of conserved residues located within a cluster that delineate the n terminal  strands of lpta does not impair the function of the protein although their overexpression appears more detrimental to lps transport compared with wild type lpta moreover altered expression of both wild type and mutated proteins interfered with normal lps transport as witnessed by the production of an anomalous form of lps structural analysis suggests that head to tail stacking of lpta molecules could be destabilized by the mutation thereby potentially contributing to impair lps transport
