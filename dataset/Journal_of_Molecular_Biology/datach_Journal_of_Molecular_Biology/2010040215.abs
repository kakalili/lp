protein vivisection reveals elusive intermediates in folding
although most folding intermediates escape detection their characterization is crucial to the elucidation of folding mechanisms here we outline a powerful strategy to populate partially unfolded intermediates a buried aliphatic residue is substituted with a charged residue e g  leu  glu   to destabilize and unfold a specific region of the protein we applied this strategy to ubiquitin reversibly trapping a folding intermediate in which the   strand is unfolded the intermediate refolds to a native like structure upon charge neutralization under mildly acidic conditions characterization of the trapped intermediate using nmr and hydrogen exchange methods identifies a second folding intermediate and reveals the order and free energies of the two major folding events on the native side of the rate limiting step this general strategy may be combined with other methods and have broad applications in the study of protein folding and other reactions that require trapping of high energy states
