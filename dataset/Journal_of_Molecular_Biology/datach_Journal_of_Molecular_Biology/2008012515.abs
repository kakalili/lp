epistatic interaction between the k homology domain protein hek and sir at hmr and telomeres in yeast
in budding yeast telomeres the ribosomal dna array and hm loci are transcriptionally silenced by chromatin complexes containing sir proteins hek  a protein containing three evolutionary conserved rna binding k homology domains was identified as a suppressor of telomeric silencing telomeric position effect tpe  to explore the mechanisms of hek p action in gene silencing we examined its relationship with sir proteins this search revealed an epistatic interaction between hek and sir at telomeres both single mutations sir  and hek   enhanced tpe whereas the effect of double mutation sir   hek   did not exceed that of the single mutations the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrate that the tpe enhancement observed in these mutants is associated with increased binding of sir protein to telomeres at the hmr locus hek  rescues the silencing defect caused by sir  mutation and reverses the loss of sir p and sir p these data suggest that the epistatic interaction of hek and sir reflects competition between telomeres and hmr for sir  factors where hek acts to suppress silencing because chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis reveals the presence of hek p at a subtelomeric region and hmr its silencing effects at these loci are likely direct these observations suggest that hek regulates the composition of sir complexes at hmr and telomeres
