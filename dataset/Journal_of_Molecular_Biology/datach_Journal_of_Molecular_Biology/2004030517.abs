can contact potentials reliably predict stability of proteins
the simplest approximation of interaction potential between amino acid residues in proteins is the contact potential which defines the effective free energy of a protein conformation by a set of amino acid contacts formed in this conformation finding a contact potential capable of predicting free energies of protein states across a variety of protein families will aid protein folding and engineering in silico on a computationally tractable time scale we test the ability of contact potentials to accurately and transferably across various protein families predict stability changes of proteins upon mutations we develop a new methodology to determine the contact potentials in proteins from experimental measurements of changes in protein s thermodynamic stabilities   g upon mutations we apply our methodology to derive sets of contact interaction parameters for a hierarchy of interaction models including solvation and multi body contact parameters we test how well our models reproduce experimental measurements by statistical tests we evaluate the maximum accuracy of predictions obtained by using contact potentials and the correlation between parameters derived from different data sets of experimental   g values we argue that it is impossible to reach experimental accuracy and derive fully transferable contact parameters using the contact models of potentials however contact parameters may yield reliable predictions of   g for datasets of mutations confined to the same amino acid positions in the sequence of a single protein
