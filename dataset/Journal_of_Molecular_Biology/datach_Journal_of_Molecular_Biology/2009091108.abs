energetics of mazg unfolding in correlation with its structural features
mazg is a homodimeric  helical protein that belongs to the superfamily of all  ntp pyrophosphatases its function has been connected to the regulation of the toxin  antitoxin module mazef implicated in programmed growth arrest cell death of escherichia coli cells under conditions of amino acid starvation the goal of the first detailed biophysical study of a member of the all  ntp pyrophosphatase superfamily presented here is to improve molecular understanding of the unfolding of this type of proteins thermal unfolding of mazg monitored by differential scanning calorimetry circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorimetry at neutral ph in the presence of a reducing agent dithiothreitol can be successfully described as a reversible four state transition between a dimeric native state two dimeric intermediate states and a monomeric denatured state the first intermediate state appears to have a structure similar to that of the native state while the final thermally denatured monomeric state is not fully unfolded and contains a significant fraction of residual  helical structure in the absence of dithiothreitol disulfide cross linking causes misfolding of mazg that appears to be responsible for the formation of multimeric aggregates mazg is most stable at ph     while at ph  lt  it exists in a molten globule like state the thermodynamic parameters characterizing each step of mazg denaturation transition obtained by global fitting of the four state model to differential scanning calorimetry circular dichroism and fluorimetry temperature profiles are in agreement with the observed structural characteristics of the mazg conformational states and their assumed functional role
