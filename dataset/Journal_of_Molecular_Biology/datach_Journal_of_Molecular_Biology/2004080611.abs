a conserved element in the yeast rnase mrp rna subunit can participate in a long range base pairing interaction
rnase mrp is a ribonucleoprotein endoribonuclease involved in eukaryotic pre rrna processing the enzyme possesses a putatively catalytic rna subunit structurally related to that of rnase p a thorough structure analysis of saccharomyces cerevisiae mrp rna entailing enzymatic and chemical probing mutagenesis and thermal melting identifies a previously unrecognised stem that occupies a position equivalent to the p stem of rnase p inclusion of this p like stem confers on yeast mrp rna a greater degree of similarity to the core rnase p rna structure than that described previously and better delimits domain  the proposed specificity domain the additional stem is created by participation of a conserved sequence element ymcr ii in a long range base pairing interaction there is potential for this base pairing throughout the known yeast mrp rna sequences formation of a p like stem is not required however for the pre rrna processing or essential function of rnase mrp mutants that can base pair are nonetheless detrimental to rnase mrp function indicating that the stem will form in vivo but that only the wild type pairing is accommodated although the alternative mrp rna structure described is clearly not part of the active rnase mrp enzyme it would be the more stable structure in the absence of protein subunits and the probability that it represents a valid intermediate species in the process of yeast rnase mrp assembly is discussed
