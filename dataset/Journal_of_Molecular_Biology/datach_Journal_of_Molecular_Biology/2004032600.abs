solution structure of the kix domain of cbp bound to the transactivation domain of c myb
the hematopoietic transcription factor c myb activates transcription of target genes through direct interactions with the kix domain of the co activator cbp the solution structure of the kix domain in complex with the activation domain of c myb reveals a helical structure very similar to that adopted by kix in complex with the phosphorylated kinase inducible domain pkid of creb while pkid contains two helices  a and  b which interact with kix the structure of bound c myb reveals a single bent amphipathic helix that binds in the same hydrophobic groove as the  b helix of pkid the affinity of c myb for kix is lower than that of pkid and relies more heavily on optimal interactions of the single helix of c myb with residues in the hydrophobic groove in particular a deep hydrophobic pocket in kix accounts for more than half the interactions with c myb observed by nmr a bend in the  helix of c myb enables a critical leucine side chain to penetrate into this pocket more deeply than the equivalent leucine residue of pkid the components that mediate the higher affinity of pkid for kix i e the phosphate group and the  a helix are absent from c myb results from isothermal titration calorimetry together with the structural data point to a key difference between the two complexes in optimal ph for binding as a result of differential ph dependent interactions with histidine residues of kix these results explain the structural and thermodynamic basis for the observed constitutive versus inducible activation properties of c myb and creb
