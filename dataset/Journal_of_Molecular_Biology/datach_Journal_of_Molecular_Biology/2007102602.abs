protein folding kinetics provides a context independent assessment of  strand propensity in the fyn sh domain
structural database derived propensities for amino acids to adopt particular local protein structures such as  helix and  strand have long been recognized and effectively exploited for the prediction of protein secondary structure however the experimental verification of database derived propensities using mutagenesis studies has been problematic especially for  strand propensities because local structural preferences are often confounded by non local interactions arising from formation of the native tertiary structure thus the overall thermodynamic stability of a protein is not always altered in a predictable manner by changes in local structural propensity at a single position in this study we have undertaken an investigation of the relationship between  strand propensity and protein folding kinetics by characterizing the effects of a wide variety of amino acid substitutions at two different  strand positions in an sh domain we have found that the observed changes in protein folding rates are very well correlated to  strand propensities for almost all of the substitutions examined in contrast there is little correlation between propensities and unfolding rates these data indicate that  strand conformation is well formed in the structured portion of the sh domain transition state and that local structure propensity strongly influences the stability of the transition state since the transition state is known to be packed more loosely than the native state and likely lacks many of the non local stabilizing interactions seen in the native state we suggest that folding kinetics studies may generally provide an effective means for the experimental validation of database derived local structural propensities
