the common architecture of cross  amyloid
amyloid fibril deposition is central to the pathology of more than  unrelated diseases including alzheimer s disease and type  diabetes it is generally accepted that amyloid fibrils share common structural features despite each disease being characterised by the deposition of an unrelated protein or peptide the structure of amyloid fibrils has been studied using x ray fibre diffraction and crystallography solid state nmr and electron paramagnetic resonance and many different sometimes opposing models have been suggested many of these models are based on the original interpretation of the cross  diffraction pattern for cross  silk in which  strands run perpendicular to the fibre axis although alternative models include  helices and natively structured proteins here we have analysed opposing model structures and examined the necessary structural elements within the amyloid core structure as well as producing idealised models to test the limits of the core conformation our work supports the view that amyloid fibrils share a number of common structural features resulting in characteristic diffraction patterns this pattern may be satisfied by structures in which the strands align close to perpendicular to the fibre axis and are regularly arranged to form  sheet ribbons furthermore the fibril structure contains several  sheets that associate via side chain packing to form the final protofilament structure
