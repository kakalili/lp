structural mechanisms determining inhibition of the collagen receptor ddr by selective and multi targeted type ii kinase inhibitors
the discoidin domain receptors ddrs  ddr and ddr  form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by the binding of triple helical collagen excessive signaling by ddr and ddr has been linked to the progression of various human diseases including fibrosis atherosclerosis and cancer we report the inhibition of these unusual receptor tyrosine kinases by the multi targeted cancer drugs imatinib and ponatinib as well as the selective type ii inhibitor ddr in  ponatinib is identified as the more potent molecule which inhibits ddr and ddr with an ic  of nm co crystal structures of human ddr reveal a dfg out conformation dfg asp phe gly of the kinase domain that is stabilized by an unusual salt bridge between the activation loop and  d helix differences to abelson kinase abl are observed in the ddr p loop where a  hairpin replaces the cage like structure of abl p loop residues in ddr that confer drug resistance in abl are therefore accommodated outside the atp pocket whereas imatinib and ponatinib bind potently to both the ddr and abl kinases the hydrophobic interactions of the abl p loop appear poorly satisfied by ddr in  suggesting a structural basis for its ddr selectivity such inhibitors may have applications in clinical indications of ddr and ddr overexpression or mutation including lung cancer
