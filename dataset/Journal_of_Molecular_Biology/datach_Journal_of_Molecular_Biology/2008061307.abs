experimental and computational analyses of the energetic basis for dual recognition of immunity proteins by colicin endonucleases
colicin endonucleases dnases are bound and inactivated by immunity im proteins im proteins are broadly cross reactive yet specific inhibitors binding cognate and non cognate dnases with kd values that vary between    and     m characteristics that are explained by a  dual recognition  mechanism in this work we addressed for the first time the energetics of im protein recognition by colicin dnases through a combination of e dnase alanine scanning and double mutant cycles dmcs coupled with kinetic and calorimetric analyses of cognate im and non cognate im binding as well as computational analysis of alanine scanning and dmc data we show that differential   gs observed for four e dnase residues cumulatively distinguish cognate im association from non cognate im association e dnase phe  is the primary specificity hotspot residue in the centre of the interface which is coordinated by conserved and variable hotspot residues of the cognate im protein experimental dmc analysis reveals that only modest coupling energies to im residues are observed in agreement with calculated dmcs using the program rosetta and consistent with the largely hydrophobic nature of e dnase  im specificity contacts computed values for the  e dnase alanine mutants showed reasonable agreement with experimental   g data particularly for interactions not mediated by interfacial water molecules   g predictions for residues that contact buried water molecules calculated using solvated rotamer models met with mixed success however we were able to predict with a high degree of accuracy the location and energetic contribution of one such contact our study highlights how colicin dnases are able to utilise both conserved and variable amino acids to distinguish cognate from non cognate im proteins with the energetic contributions of the conserved residues modulated by neighbouring specificity sites
