high resolution crystal structures of caldicellulosiruptor strain rt b  carbohydrate binding module cbm   and its complex with mannohexaose
carbohydrate binding modules cbms are the most common non catalytic modules associated with enzymes active in plant cell wall hydrolysis despite the large number of putative cbms being identified by amino acid sequence alignments only few representatives have been experimentally shown to have a carbohydrate binding function caldicellulosiruptor strain rt b  man  is a thermostable modular glycoside hydrolase  mannanase which contains two non catalytic modules in tandem at its n terminus these modules were recently shown to function primarily as  mannan binding modules and have accordingly been classified as members of a novel family of cbms family   the n terminal cbm  cscbm   of man  from caldicellulosiruptor rt b  displays high binding affinity towards mannohexaose with a ka of    m   accordingly the high resolution crystal structures of cscbm   native and its mannohexaose complex were solved at    and    resolution respectively in the crystal cscbm   shows the typical  sandwich jellyroll fold observed in other cbms with a single metal ion bound which was identified as calcium the crystal structures reveal that the overall fold of cscbm   remains virtually unchanged upon sugar binding and that binding is mediated by three solvent exposed tryptophan residues and few direct hydrogen bonds based on binding affinity and thermal unfolding experiments this structural calcium is shown to play a role in the thermal stability of cscbm   at high temperatures the higher binding affinity of cscbm   to mannooligosaccharides when compared to other members of cbm family  might be explained by the different orientation of the residues forming the  aromatic platform  and by differences in the length of loops finally evidence is presented on the basis of fold similarities and the retention of the position of conserved motifs and a calcium ion for the consolidation of related cbm families into a superfamily of cbms
