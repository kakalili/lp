molecular framework of steroid retinoid discrimination in   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type  and photoreceptor associated retinol dehydrogenase
steroids and retinoids are signaling molecules that control a variety of physiological processes    hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type     hsd  catalyzes the reduction of estrone to estradiol supplying biologically active estrogen regulating sex specific differentiation photoreceptor associated retinol dehydrogenase prrdh is evolutionarily closely related to   hsd but reduces all trans retinal to all trans retinol contributing to rhodopsin regeneration in the visual cycle sequence alignment revealed a new enzyme specific conserved amino acid close to the active site methionine position   in human enzyme in prrdh and glycine position   in   hsd  we investigated the role of this residue in substrate discrimination in human and zebrafish enzymes both recombinant enzymes were expressed in hek   cells followed by normalization of expression by semiquantitative western blots changing of the prrdh specific methionine to glycine resulted in a gain of function the mutants now catalyzed the reduction of estrone and all trans retinal human and zebrafish wild type   hsd s efficiently catalyzed the reduction of all trans retinal to its alcohol exchange of glycine for methionine increased the catalytic activity of   hsd toward all trans retinal in zebrafish but not in the human enzyme in which the opposite effect was observed molecular modeling showed that the zebrafish   hsd substrate binding pocket is similar to that of prrdh and methionine insertion benefits all trans retinal reduction in contrast in human   hsd  the insertion of the bulky methionine causes a disruption of substrate binding site we demonstrate for the first time the role of a single amino acid in the evolution of these functionally diverse enzymes and suggest new physiological functions for   hsd in retinoid metabolism this has implications for the validation of inhibitors of   hsd developed for cancer treatment
