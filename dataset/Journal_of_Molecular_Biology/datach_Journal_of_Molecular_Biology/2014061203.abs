elucidating the mechanism of substrate recognition by the bacterial hsp  molecular chaperone
hsp  is a conformationally dynamic molecular chaperone known to promote the folding and activation of a broad array of protein substrates   clients   hsp  is believed to preferentially interact with partially folded substrates and it has been hypothesized that the chaperone can significantly alter substrate structure as a mechanism to alter the substrate functional state however critically testing the mechanism of substrate recognition and remodeling by hsp  has been challenging using a partially folded protein as a model system we find that the bacterial hsp  adapts its conformation to the substrate forming a binding site that spans the middle and c terminal domains of the chaperone cross linking and nmr measurements indicate that hsp  binds to a large partially folded region of the substrate and significantly alters both its local and long range structure these findings implicate hsp  s conformational dynamics in its ability to bind and remodel partially folded proteins moreover native state hydrogen exchange indicates that hsp  can also interact with partially folded states only transiently populated from within a thermodynamically stable native state ensemble these results suggest a general mechanism by which hsp  can recognize and remodel native proteins by binding and remodeling partially folded states that are transiently sampled from within the native ensemble
