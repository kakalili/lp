siv gp  binds to membranes both in the monomeric and trimeric states consequences for the neuropathology and inhibition of hiv infection edited by j karn
the viral envelope glycoprotein gp  mediates membrane fusion in hiv siv infection gp  ectodomain e gp  residues     which was shown to interact with phospholipid membranes exists in an equilibrium between the monomeric and trimeric states here we analyzed by intrinsic trp fluorescence and resonance energy transfer whether siv e gp  membrane interaction depends on the gp  oligomeric state we found that both gp  monomers and trimers bind membranes with the monomers  full binding being reached at substantially lower lipid to protein ratios furthermore the different characteristics of the trp fluorescence of monomers and trimers enabled us to detect binding of each form at concentrations at which both species were present cd spectroscopy revealed that the secondary structure of gp  monomers does not change upon membrane binding suggesting that membrane bound monomeric gp  is a possible target for dp   a potent peptide inhibitor of hiv infection the consequences of the interaction between monomeric and trimeric gp  with membranes in hiv siv infection its inhibition and its associated neuropathologies are discussed
