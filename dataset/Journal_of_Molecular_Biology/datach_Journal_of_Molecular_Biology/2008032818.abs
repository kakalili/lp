a phosphorylation dependent gating mechanism controls the sh domain interactions of the shc adaptor protein
the shc src homology collagen like adaptor protein plays a crucial role in linking stimulated receptors to mitogen activated protein kinase activation through the formation of dynamic signalling complexes shc comprises an n terminal phosphotyrosine binding ptb domain a c terminal src homology  sh  domain and a central proline rich collagen homology  domain the latter domain contains three tyrosine residues that are known to become phosphorylated we have expressed and purified the human p shc isoform and characterised its binding to different ligands cd spectra revealed that some parts of the shc protein are not fully folded remaining largely unaffected by the binding of ligands the ptb domain binds peptide and ins    p  but not ins    p  independently suggesting two distinct sites of interaction in the unphosphorylated shc the sh domain is non functional ligand binding to the ptb domain does not affect this however phosphorylation of the three tyrosine residues promotes binding to the sh domain thus shc has an intrinsic phosphorylation dependent gating mechanism where the sh domain adopts an open conformation only when tyrosine phosphorylation has occurred
