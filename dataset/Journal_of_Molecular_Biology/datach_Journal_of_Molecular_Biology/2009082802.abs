dimer interface migration in a viral sulfhydryl oxidase
large double stranded dna viruses including poxviruses and mimiviruses encode enzymes to catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds in viral proteins produced in the cell cytosol an atypical location for oxidative protein folding these viral disulfide catalysts belong to a family of sulfhydryl oxidases that are dimers of a small five helix fold containing a cys x x cys motif juxtaposed to a flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor we report that the sulfhydryl oxidase pb  l from african swine fever virus asfv uses for self assembly surface different from that observed in homologs from mammals plants and fungi within a protein family different packing interfaces for the same oligomerization state are extremely rare we find that the alternate dimerization mode seen in asfv pb  l is not characteristic of all viral sulfhydryl oxidases as the flavin binding domain from a mimivirus sulfhydryl oxidase assumes the same dimer structure as the known eukaryotic enzymes asfv pb  l demonstrates the potential of large double stranded dna viruses which have faster mutation rates than their hosts and the tendency to incorporate host genes to pioneer new protein folds and self assembly modes
