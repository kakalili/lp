different proteasome subtypes in a single tissue exhibit different enzymatic properties edited by r huber
it is concluded from many experiments that mammalian tissues and cells must contain a heterogeneous population of  s proteasome complexes we describe the purification and separation by chromatographic procedures of constitutive  s proteasomes   s immuno proteasomes and intermediate type  s proteasomes from a given tissue our data demonstrate that each of these three groups comprises more than one subtype and that the relative ratios of the subtypes differ between different rat tissues thus six subtypes could be identified in rat muscle tissue subtypes i and ii are constitutive proteasomes while subtypes v and vi comprise immuno proteasomes subtypes iii and iv belong to a group of intermediate type proteasomes the subtypes differ with regard to their enzymatic characteristics subtypes i iii exhibit high chymotrypsin like activity and high peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolysing activity while these activities are depressed in subtypes iv vi in contrast trypsin like activity of subtypes iv vi is enhanced in comparison to subtypes i iii importantly the subtypes also differ in their preferential cleavage site usage when tested by digestion of a synthetic  mer polypeptide substrate therefore the characteristics of proteasomes purified from tissues or cells represent the average of the different subtype activities which in turn may have different functions in vivo
