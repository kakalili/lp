probing hydration of monovalent cations condensed around polymeric nucleic acids
we report the relative molar sound velocity increments  u  partial molar volumes vo and partial molar adiabatic compressibilities kso of the li  na  k  rb  cs  nh  and n ch   salts of poly dadt poly dadt  poly dgdc poly dgdc  poly didc poly didc  poly ra poly ru  poly rg poly rc  poly ri poly rc  and poly ru at   c when analyzing these data we take into account the donnan membrane equilibrium effect comparison between the values of u  vo and kso exhibited by the nucleic acid salts and respective chlorides licl nacl kcl rbcl cscl nh cl and n ch  cl yields information about the state of counterion hydration in the vicinity of each nucleic acid structure studied here our analysis reveals that the poly dgdc poly dgdc  poly didc poly didc  and poly ri poly rc duplexes and single stranded poly ru do not significantly influence the hydration properties of their condensed counterions in the vicinity of these polymers counterions retain their full hydration shells within     by contrast counterions condensed around the poly dadt poly dadt  poly ra poly ru  and poly rg poly rc duplexes are significantly dehydrated and retain respectively only            and     of their original hydration shells taken together the volumetric data reported here provide important new information that ultimately may help us understand the central role that hydration and counterions play in modulating the conformational preferences of nucleic acids and the energetics of dna recognition events
