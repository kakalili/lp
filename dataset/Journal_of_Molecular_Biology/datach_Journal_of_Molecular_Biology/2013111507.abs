programming microbes using pulse width modulation of optical signals
cells transmit and receive information via signalling pathways a number of studies have revealed that information is encoded in the temporal dynamics of these pathways and has highlighted how pathway architecture can influence the propagation of signals in time and space the functional properties of pathway architecture can also be exploited by synthetic biologists to enable precise control of cellular physiology here we characterised the response of a bacterial light responsive two component system to oscillating signals of varying frequencies we found that the system acted as a low pass filter able to respond to low frequency oscillations and unable to respond to high frequency oscillations we then demonstrate that the low pass filtering behavior can be exploited to enable precise control of gene expression using a strategy termed pulse width modulation pwm  pwm is a common strategy used in electronics for information encoding that converts a series of digital input signals to an analog response we further show how the pwm strategy extends the utility of bacterial optogenetic control allowing the fine tuning of expression levels programming of temporal dynamics and control of microbial physiology via manipulation of a metabolic enzyme
