pk values of histidine residues in ribonuclease sa effect of salt and net charge
the primary goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of the effect of environment and ionic strength on the pk values of histidine residues in proteins the salt dependence of pk values for two histidine residues in ribonuclease sa rnase sa  pi   and a variant in which five acidic amino acids have been changed to lysine  k  pi    was measured and compared to pk values of model histidine containing peptides the pk of his  is elevated by two ph units pk    in rnase sa and by nearly one ph unit pk    in k at low salt relative to the pk of histidine in the model peptides pk    the pk for his  remains elevated in  m nacl pk    the elevated pk for his  is a result of screenable electrostatic interactions particularly with glu  and a non screenable hydrogen bond interaction with water the pk of his  in rnase sa and k is slightly below the model pk at low salt and merges with this value at  m nacl the pk of his  reflects mainly effects of long range coulombic interactions that are screenable by salt the tautomeric states of the neutral histidine residues are changed by charge reversal the histidine pk values in rnase sa are always higher than the pk values in the k variant these results emphasize that the net charge of the protein influences the pk values of the histidine residues structure based pk calculations capture the salt dependence relatively well but are unable to predict absolute histidine pk values
