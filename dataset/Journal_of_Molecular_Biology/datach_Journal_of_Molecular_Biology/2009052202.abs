human pinx mediates trf accumulation in nucleolus and enhances trf binding to telomeres
human pinx  hpinx  is known to interact with telomere repeat binding factor  trf  and telomerase here we report that hpinx regulates the nucleolar accumulation and telomeric association of trf  in hela ha hpinx was co localized with fibrillarin a nucleolar protein in   of the transfected cells and was present in the nucleoplasm of the remaining   mutant analysis showed that the c terminal region was important for nucleolar localization while the n terminus exhibited an inhibitory effect on nucleolar localization unlike ha and myc hpinx  gfp hpinx resided predominantly in the nucleolus nuclear hpinx bound to telomeres and other repeat sequences as well but despite its interaction with trf  nucleolar hpinx did not bind to telomeres nucleolar hpinx forced endogenous trf accumulation in the nucleolus furthermore trf binding to telomeres was upregulated in cells over expressing hpinx  in an alt cell line wi  va   trf did not co localize with hpinx in the nucleoli in summary hpinx likely interacts with trf in both the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm and excess hpinx results in increased telomere binding of trf  the pinx function of mediating trf nucleolar accumulation is absent from alt cells suggesting that it might be telomerase dependent
