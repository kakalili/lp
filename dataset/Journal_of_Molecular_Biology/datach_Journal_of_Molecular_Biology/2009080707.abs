sh dependent autophosphorylation within the tec family kinase itk
the tec family kinase itk interleukin  tyrosine kinase  undergoes an in cis autophosphorylation on y  within its src homology  sh  domain autophosphorylation of the itk sh domain by the itk kinase domain is strictly dependent on the presence of the intervening src homology  sh  domain a direct docking interaction between the itk kinase and sh domains brings the itk sh domain into the active site where y  is then phosphorylated we now identify the residues on the surface of the itk sh domain responsible for substrate docking and show that this sh surface mediates autophosphorylation in the full length itk molecule the canonical phospholigand binding site on the sh domain is not involved in substrate docking instead the docking site consists of side chains from three loop regions ab ef and bg and part of the  d strand these results are extended into btk bruton s tyrosine kinase  a tec family kinase linked to the b cell deficiency x linked agammaglobulinemia xla  our results suggest that some xla causing mutations might impair btk phosphorylation
