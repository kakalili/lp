structure of human ki  fha domain and its binding to a phosphoprotein fragment from hnifk reveal unique recognition sites and new views to the structural basis of fha domain functions
recent studies by use of short phosphopeptides showed that forkhead associated fha domains recognize ptxx d i l motifs solution structures and crystal structures of several different fha domains and their complexes with short phosphopeptides have been reported by several groups we now report the solution structure of the fha domain of human ki  a large nuclear protein associated with the cell cycle using fragments of its binding partner hnifk we show that ki  hnifk binding involves ca  residues without a ptxx d i l motif the pthr site of hnifk recognized by ki  fha is pthr  pro   a motif also recognized by the proline isomerase pin  heteronuclear single quantum coherence hsqc nmr was then used to map out the binding surface and structural analyses were used to identify key binding residues of ki  fha the results represent the first structural characterization of the complex of an fha domain with a biologically relevant target protein fragment detailed analyses of the results led us to propose that three major factors control the interaction of fha with its target protein the pt residue   to  residues and an extended binding surface and that variation in the three factors is the likely cause of the great diversity in the function and specificity of fha domains from different sources
