specificity of pyrrolysyl trna synthetase for pyrrolysine and pyrrolysine analogs
pyrrolysine the  nd amino acid is encoded by amber tag uag codons in certain methanogenic archaea and bacteria pyls the pyrrolysyl trna synthetase ligates pyrrolysine to trnapyl for amber decoding as pyrrolysine pyls and trnapyl have potential utility in making tailored recombinant proteins here we probed interactions necessary for recognition of substrates by archaeal pyls via synthesis of close pyrrolysine analogs and testing their reactivity in amino acid activation assays replacement of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine with cyclopentane indicated that solely hydrophobic interactions with the ring binding pocket of pyls are sufficient for substrate recognition however a   fold increase in the specificity constant of pyls was observed with an analog  amino   r tetrahydrofuran  carboxamido hexanoic acid  thf lys  in which tetrahydrofuran replaced the pyrrolysine methylpyrroline ring other analogs in which the electronegative atom was moved to different positions suggested pyls preference for a hydrogen bond accepting group at the imine nitrogen position in pyrrolysine  thf lys was a preferred substrate over a commonly employed pyrrolysine analog but the specificity constant for thf lys was  fold lower than for pyrrolysine itself largely due to the change in km the in vivo activity of the analogs in supporting uag suppression in escherichia coli bearing genes for pyls and trnapyl was similar to in vitro results with l pyrrolysine and thf lys supporting the highest amounts of uag translation increasing concentrations of either pyls substrate resulted in a linear increase in uag suppression providing a facile method to assay bioactive pyrrolysine analogs these results illustrate the relative importance of the h bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the recognition of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine and provide a promising new series of easily synthesized pyrrolysine analogs that can serve as scaffolds for the introduction of novel functional groups into recombinant proteins
