analysis of the roles of trna structure ribosomal protein l  and the bacteriophage t gene  bypassing signals during ribosome slippage on mrna edited by m gottesman
a  nucleotide coding gap divides bacteriophage t gene  into two open reading frames in response to cis acting stimulatory signals encrypted in the mrna the anticodon of the ribosome bound peptidyl trna dissociates from a gga codon at the end of the first open reading frame and pairs with a gga codon  nucleotides downstream just before the second open reading frame mutations affecting ribosomal protein l or trna gly the trna that decodes gga alter the efficiency of bypassing to understand the mechanism of ribosome slippage this work analyzes the influence of these bypassing signals and mutant translational components on   frameshifting at g gga and hopping over a stop codon immediately flanked by two gga glycine codons stop hopping  mutant variants of trna gly that impair bypassing mediate stop hopping with unexpected landing specificities suggesting that these variants are defective in ribosomal p site codon anticodon pairing in a direct competition between   frameshifting and stop hopping the absence of l promotes stop hopping at the expense of   frameshifting without substantially impairing the ability of mutant trna gly variants to re pair with the mrna by sub optimal pairing these observations suggest that l defects may stimulate ribosome slippage by enhancing mrna movement through the ribosome rather than by inducing an extended pause in translation or by destabilizing p site pairing two of the bypassing signals a cis acting nascent peptide encoded by the first open reading frame and a stemloop signal located in the   portion of the coding gap stimulate peptidyl trna slippage independently of the rest of the gene  context evidence is presented suggesting that the nascent peptide signal may stimulate bypassing by destabilizing p site pairing
