cooperativity smooth energy landscapes and the origins of topology dependent protein folding rates
the relative folding rates of simple single domain proteins proteins whose folding energy landscapes are smooth are highly dispersed and strongly correlated with native state topology in contrast the relative folding rates of small g  potential lattice polymers which also exhibit smooth energy landscapes are poorly dispersed and insignificantly correlated with native state topology here we investigate this discrepancy in light of a recent quantitative theory of two state folding kinetics the topomer search model this model stipulates that the topology dependence of two state folding rates is a direct consequence of the extraordinarily cooperative equilibrium folding of simple proteins we demonstrate that traditional g  polymers lack the extreme cooperativity that characterizes the folding of naturally occurring two state proteins and confirm that the folding rates of a diverse set of g   mers are poorly dispersed and effectively uncorrelated with native state topology upon modestly increasing the cooperativity of the g  potential however significantly increased dispersion and strongly topology dependent kinetics are observed these results support previous arguments that the cooperative folding of simple single domain proteins gives rise to their topology dependent folding rates we speculate that this cooperativity and thus indirectly the topology  rate relationship may have arisen in order to generate the smooth energetic landscapes upon which rapid folding can occur
