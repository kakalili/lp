characterization of the pressure induced intermediate and unfolded state of red shifted green fluorescent protein  a static and kinetic ftir uv vis and fluorescence spectroscopy study
the green fluorescence proteins gfp are widely used as reporters in molecular and cell biology for their use it in high pressure microbiology and biotechnology studies their structural properties thermodynamic parameters and stability diagrams have to be known we investigated the pressure stability of the red shifted green fluorescent protein rsgfp using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fluorescence and uv vis spectroscopy we found that rsgfp does not unfold up to   kbar at room temperature its unique three dimensional structure is held responsible for the high pressure stability at higher temperatures its secondary structure collapses below kbar e g the denaturation pressure at   c is  kbar  the analysis of the ir data shows that the pressure denatured state contains more disordered structures at the expense of a decrease of intramolecular  sheets as indicated by the large volume change of  v u        mlmol   at   c this highly cooperative transition can be interpreted as a collapse of the  can structure of rsgfp for comparison the temperature induced unfolding of rsgfp has also been studied at high temperature tm   c  the unfolding resulted in the formation of an aggregated state contrary to the pressure induced unfolding the temperature induced unfolding and aggregation of gfp is irreversible from the ft ir data a tentative p t stability diagram for the secondary structure collapse of gfp has been obtained furthermore changes in fluorescence and absorptivity were found which are not correlated to the secondary structural changes the fluorescence and uv vis data indicate smaller conformational changes in the chromophore region at much lower pressures   kbar which are probably accompanied by the penetration of water into the  can structure in order to investigate also the kinetics of this initial step pressure jump relaxation experiments were carried out the partial activation volumes observed indicate that the conformational changes in the chromophore region when passing the transition state are indeed rather small thus leading to a comparably small volume change of    ml mol   only the use of the chromophore absorption and fluorescence band of rsgfp in using gfp as reporter for gene expression and other microbiological studies under high pressure conditions is thus limited to pressures of about kbar which still exceeds the pressure range relevant for studies in vivo in micro organisms including piezophilic bacteria from deep sea environments
