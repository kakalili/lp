protein  rna dynamics in the central junction control  s ribosome assembly
interactions between ribosomal proteins rproteins and ribosomal rna rrna facilitate the formation of functional ribosomes s  is a central domain primary binding protein that has been shown to trigger a cascade of conformational changes in  s rrna forming the functional structure of the central domain previous biochemical and structural studies in vitro have revealed that s  binds a three way junction of helices     and   including nucleotides      and      all junction nucleotides except   are highly conserved among the bacteria to identify functionally important motifs within the junction we subjected nucleotides      and      to saturation mutagenesis and selected and analyzed functional mutants only  mutants with greater than   ribosome function in vivo were isolated s  overexpression complemented mutations in the junction loop in each of the partially active mutants although mutations that produced inactive ribosomes were not complemented by overexpression of s  single molecule f rster or fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret was used to study the mg  and s  induced conformational dynamics of selected junction mutants comparison of the structural dynamics of these mutants with the wild type in the presence and absence of s  revealed specific sequence and structural motifs in the central junction that are important in ribosome function
