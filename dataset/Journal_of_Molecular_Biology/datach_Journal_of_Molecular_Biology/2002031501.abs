crystallographic and functional studies of a modified form of eosinophil derived neurotoxin edn with novel biological activities edited by r huber
the crystal structure of a post translationally modified form of eosinophil derived neurotoxin edn with four extra residues on its n terminus    edn has been solved and refined at atomic resolution     two of the extra residues can be placed unambiguously while the density corresponding to two others is poor the modified n terminus appears to influence the position of the catalytically important his   possibly explaining the diminished catalytic activity of this variant however    edn has been shown to be cytotoxic to a kaposi  s sarcoma tumor cell line and other endothelial cell lines analysis of the structure and function suggests that the reason for cytotoxicity is most likely due to cellular recognition by the n terminal extension since the intrinsic activity of the enzyme is not sufficient for cytotoxicity and the n terminal extension does not affect the conformation of edn
