intertwined structured and unstructured regions of exrage identified by monitoring hydrogen  deuterium exchange
receptor for advanced glycation end products rage is a multiligand receptor that is engaged in many pathological processes potentially beneficial modification of its activity requires sound knowledge of its structural properties however up to now only the structures of its separated domains have been published or deposited in databases in this work we used hydrogen  deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry to gain insight into the structural properties of exrage extracellular region of rage  the full extracellular part of the protein the present work indicates the common and disparate features of full exrage as compared to the structural models of its separate domains the highlight of the present study is the contrasting behavior of the different regions of the protein with the protected regions neighboring fully exposed parts especially in the n terminal v domain
