temporal regulation of viral transcription during development of thermus thermophilus bacteriophage  ys
regulation of gene expression of lytic bacteriophage  ys  that infects the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus was investigated and three temporal classes of phage genes early middle and late were revealed  ys  does not encode a rnap and must rely on host rnap for transcription of its genes bioinformatic analysis using a model of thermus promoters predicted  putative  a dependent       class phage promoters a randomly chosen subset of those promoters was shown to be functional in vivo and in vitro and to belong to the early temporal class macroarray analysis primer extension and bioinformatic predictions identified  viral middle and late promoters these promoters have a single common consensus element which resembles host  a rnap holoenzyme    promoter consensus element sequence the mechanism responsible for the temporal control of the three classes of promoters remains unknown since host  a rnap holoenzyme purified from either infected or uninfected cells efficiently transcribed all  ys  promoters in vitro interestingly our data showed that during infection there is a significant increase and decreaseof transcript amounts of host translation initiation factors if and if  respectively this finding together with the fact that most middle and late  ys  transcripts were found to be leaderless suggests that the shift to late viral gene expression may also occur at the level of mrna translation
