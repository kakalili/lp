germline humanization of a non human primate antibody that neutralizes the anthrax toxin by in vitro and in silico engineering
fab  pa  is an antibody fragment of non human primate origin that neutralizes the anthrax lethal toxin human antibodies are usually preferred when clinical use is envisioned even though their framework regions fr may carry mutations introduced during affinity maturation these hypermutations can be immunogenic and therefore fr that are encoded by human germline genes encountered in igms and thus part of the  self  proteins are preferable accordingly the proportion of fr residues in  pa  that were encoded by human v and j germline genes i e the germinality index gi of  pa  was increased in a multistep cumulative approach in a first step the fr and fr residues of  pa  were changed simultaneously into their counterparts coded by  pa  s closest human germline genes without prior modelling the resulting derivative of  pa  had the same affinity as its parental fab in a second step the d structures of this first  pa  derivative carrying the same type of residue changes but in the fr and fr regions were modelled in silico from sequences some of the changes in fr or fr modified the predicted peptide backbone the changes that did not seem to alter the structure were introduced simultaneously in the fab by an in vitro method and resulted in a loss of reactivity which could however be fully restored by a single point mutation the final  pa  derivative had a gi higher than that of a fully human fab which had neutralization properties similar to  pa  and which was used as a benchmark in this study
