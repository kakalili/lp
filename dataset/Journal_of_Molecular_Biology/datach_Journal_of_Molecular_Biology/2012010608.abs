ddx is an rna dependent atpase involved in hiv  rev function and virus replication
the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rev protein is essential for the virus because it promotes nuclear export of alternatively processed mrnas and rev is also linked to translation of viral mrnas and genome encapsidation previously the human dead box helicase ddx was suggested to be involved in rev functions but this relationship is not well understood biochemical studies of ddx and its interactions with rev and model rna oligonucleotides were carried out to investigate the molecular basis for association of these components a combination of gel filtration chromatography and circular dichroism spectroscopy demonstrated that recombinant ddx expressed in escherichia coli is a well behaved folded protein binding assays using fluorescently labeled rev and cell based immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed a specific rna independent ddx  rev interaction additionally ddx was shown to be an rna activated atpase wherein rev bound rna was equally effective at stimulating atpase activity as protein free rna gel mobility shift assays further demonstrated that ddx forms complexes with rev bound rna rna silencing of ddx provided strong evidence that ddx is required for both rev activity and hiv production from infected cells collectively these studies demonstrate a clear link between ddx and hiv  rev in cell based assays of hiv  production and provide the first demonstration that recombinant ddx binds rev and rna and has rna dependent catalytic activity
