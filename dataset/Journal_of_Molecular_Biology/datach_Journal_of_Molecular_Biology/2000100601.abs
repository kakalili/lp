structural and biochemical features distinguish the foot and mouth disease virus leader proteinase from other papain like enzymes edited by r huber
the structures of the two leader protease lpro variants of foot and mouth disease virus known to date were solved using crystals in which molecules were organized as molecular fibers such crystals diffract to a resolution of only approximately    this singular pseudo polymeric organization is present in a new lpro crystal form showing a cubic packing as molecular fiber formation appeared unrelated to crystallization conditions we mutated the reactive cysteine   residue which makes a disulfide bridge between adjacent monomers in the fibers to serine none of the intermolecular contacts found in the molecular fibers was present in crystals of this variant analysis of this lpro structure refined at    resolution enables a detailed definition of the active center of the enzyme including the solvent organization assay of lpro activity on a fluorescent hexapeptide substrate showed that lpro in contrast to papain was highly sensitive to increases in the cation concentration and was active only across a narrow ph range examination of the lpro structure revealed that three aspartate residues near the active site not present in papain like enzymes are probably responsible for these properties
