probing the role of aromatic residues at the secondary saccharide binding sites of human salivary  amylase in substrate hydrolysis and bacterial binding
human salivary  amylase hsamy has three distinct functions relevant to oral health   hydrolysis of starch   binding to hydroxyapatite ha  and   binding to bacteria e g  viridans streptococci  although the active site of hsamy for starch hydrolysis is well characterized the regions responsible for bacterial binding are yet to be defined since hsamy possesses several secondary saccharide binding sites in which aromatic residues are prominently located we hypothesized that one or more of the secondary saccharide binding sites harboring the aromatic residues may play an important role in bacterial binding to test this hypothesis the aromatic residues at five secondary binding sites were mutated to alanine to generate six mutants representing either single w  a y  a and w  a  double y  a w  a and w  a w  a  or multiple w  a w  a y  a w  a w  a w  a human salivary  amylase aromatic residue multiple mutant hsamy ar  mutations the crystal structure of hsamy ar as an acarbose complex was determined at a resolution of     and compared with the existing wild type acarbose complex the wild type and the mutant enzymes were characterized for their abilities to exhibit enzyme activity starch binding activity ha binding activity and bacterial binding activity our results clearly showed that   mutation of aromatic residues does not alter the overall conformation of the molecule   single or double mutants showed either moderate or minimal changes in both starch binding activity and bacterial binding activity whereas hsamy ar showed significant reduction in these activities   starch hydrolytic activity was reduced by  fold in hsamy ar   oligosaccharide hydrolytic activity was reduced in all mutants but the action pattern was similar to that of the wild type enzyme and   ha binding was unaffected in hsamy ar these results clearly show that the aromatic residues at the secondary saccharide binding sites in hsamy play a critical role in bacterial binding and in starch hydrolytic functions of hsamy
