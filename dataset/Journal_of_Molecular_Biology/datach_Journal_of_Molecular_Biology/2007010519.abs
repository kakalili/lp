gene expression analysis in blood cells in response to unmodified and   modified sirnas reveals tlr dependent and independent effects
ribonucleic nucleic acid recognition by toll like receptors tlrs induces innate immune responses however no comprehensive analysis of gene expression in human blood cells in response to unmodified and   modified immunostimulatory rnas has been reported using oligonucleotide microarrays we show that around   genes were significantly p lt    altered in peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc in response to either single stranded ss or double stranded ds small interfering rnas sirnas  most of the upregulated genes encode proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune responses including proinflammatory cytokines interferons chemokines and chemokine receptors genes encoding proteins involved in lymphocyte activation e g cd  cd  and cd  and in regulation of the immune responses e g socs proteins were upregulated also genes encoding for antiviral proteins mx  mx  trim proteins  and interferon regulatory factors e g irf  were upregulated around   of the genes   out of   affected by r   a specific ligand for tlr and tlr  were also affected by ss sirnas or ds sirnas indicating that the signaling pathways activated by r   are also activated by immunostimulatory sirnas in addition to immunoactivation via tlrs ss sirnas and ds sirnas induced tlr independent gene alterations surprisingly replacement of only uridine bases with either   fluoro or   o methyl modified counterparts abrogated all the observed bystander effects collectively these microarray data offer for the first time an insight into human pmbc response to immunostimulatory rnas such as ss sirnas and ds sirnas the data should help to define strategies to either enhance or avoid the non specific effects of sirnas in order to develop safe therapeutics
