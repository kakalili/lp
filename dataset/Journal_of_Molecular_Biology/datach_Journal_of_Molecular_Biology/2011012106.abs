visualizing active site dynamics in single crystals of heptp opening of the wpd loop involves coordinated movement of the e loop
phosphotyrosine hydrolysis by protein tyrosine phosphatases ptps involves substrate binding by the ptp loop and closure over the active site by the wpd loop the e loop located immediately adjacent to the ptp and wpd loops is conserved among human ptps in both sequence and structure yet the role of this loop in substrate binding and catalysis is comparatively unexplored hematopoietic ptp heptp is a member of the kinase interaction motif kim ptp family compared to other ptps kim ptps have e loops that are unique in both sequence and structure in order to understand the role of the e loop in the transition between the closed state and the open state of heptp we identified a novel crystal form of heptp that allowed the closed state to open state transition to be observed within a single crystal form these structures which include the first structure of the heptp open state show that the wpd loop adopts an  atypically open  conformation and importantly that ligands can be exchanged at the active site which is critical for heptp inhibitor development these structures also show that tetrahedral oxyanions bind at a novel secondary site and function to coordinate the ptp wpd and e loops finally using both structural and kinetic data we reveal a novel role for e loop residue lys  in enhancing heptp catalytic activity through its interaction with asp  of the wpd loop providing the first evidence for the coordinated dynamics of the wpd and e loops in the catalytic cycle which as we show is relevant to multiple ptp families
