solution structures of human and porcine  microseminoprotein
microseminoprotein msp is a small cysteine rich protein molecular mass about   kda first isolated from human seminal plasma and later identified in several other organisms the function of msp is not known but a recent study has shown msp to bind crisp  a protein present in neutrophilic granulocytes the amino acid sequence is highly variable between species raising the question of the evolutionary conservation of the d structure here we present nmr solution structures of both the human and the porcine msp the two proteins sequence identity   have a very similar d structure with the secondary structure elements well conserved and with most of the amino acid substitutions causing a change of charge localized to one side of the molecule msp is a  sheet rich protein with two distinct domains the n terminal domain is composed of a four stranded  sheet with the strands arranged according to the greek key motif and a less structured part the c terminal domain contains two two stranded  sheets with no resemblance to known structural motifs the two domains connected to each other by the peptide backbone one disulfide bond and interactions between the n and c termini are oriented to give the molecule a rather extended structure this global fold differs markedly from that of a previously published structure for porcine msp in which the two domains have an entirely different orientation to each other the difference probably stems from a misinterpretation of ten specific inter domain noes
