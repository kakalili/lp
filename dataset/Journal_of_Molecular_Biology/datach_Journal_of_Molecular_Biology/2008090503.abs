structural basis of the lov dimerization of arabidopsis phototropins  and
phototropin phot is a blue light receptor protein that triggers phototropic responses chloroplast relocation and stomata opening to maximize the efficiency of photosynthesis in higher plants phot is composed of three functional domains the n terminal half folds into two light  oxygen  voltage sensing domains called lov and lov  each binding a flavin mononucleotide to absorb blue light the c terminal half is a serine threonine kinase domain that causes light dependent autophosphorylation leading to cellular signaling cascades lov domain is primarily responsible for activation of the kinase and lov domain is thought to act as a dimerization site and to regulate sensitivity to activation by blue light here we show the crystal structures of lov domains of arabidopsis phot and phot in the dark at resolutions of     and     respectively either lov domain forms a dimer through face to face association of  scaffolds in the crystallographic asymmetric unit three types of interactions stabilizing the dimer structures found are as follows contacts of side chains in their  scaffolds hydrophobic interactions of a short helix found in the n terminus of a subunit with the  scaffolds of both subunits and hydrogen bonds mediated by hydration water molecules filling the dimer interface the critical residues for dimerization are cys   forming a disulfide bridge between subunits in phot lov domain and thr  and met  in phot lov  the topology in homodimeric associations of the lov domains is discussed when referring to those of homodimers or heterodimers of light  oxygen  voltage sensing or per arnt sim domains the present results also provide clues to understanding structural basis in dimeric interactions of per arnt sim protein modules in cellular signaling
