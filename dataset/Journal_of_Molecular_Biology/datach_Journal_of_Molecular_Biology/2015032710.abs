single fibril growth kinetics of  synuclein
neurodegenerative disorders associated with protein misfolding are fatal diseases that are caused by fibrillation of endogenous proteins such as  synuclein   syn in parkinson s disease pd or amyloid  in alzheimer s disease fibrils of  syn are a major pathological hallmark of pd and certain aggregation intermediates are postulated to cause synaptic failure and cell death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra for the development of therapeutic approaches the mechanistic understanding of the fibrillation process is essential here we report real time observation of  syn fibril elongation on a glass surface imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy using thioflavin t fluorescence fibrillation on the glass surface occurred in the same time frame and yielded fibrils of similar length as fibrillation in solution time resolved imaging of fibrillation on a single fibril level indicated that  syn fibril elongation follows a stop and go mechanism that is fibrils either extend at a homogenous growth rate or stop to grow for variable time intervals the fibril growth kinetics were compatible with a model featuring two states a growth state and a stop state which were approximately isoenergetic and interconverted with rate constants of       s   in the growth state   syn monomers were incorporated into the fibril with a rate constant of     m  s   fibril elongation of  syn is slow compared to other amyloidogenic proteins
