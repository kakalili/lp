bending stiffness of a crystalline actin bundle
the acrosomal process of the sperm of the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus is a unique crystalline actin bundle consisting of multiple actin filaments cross linked by the actin bundling protein scruin for successful fertilization the acrosomal bundle must penetrate through a   m thick jelly coat surrounding the egg and thus it must be sufficiently stiff here we present two measurements of the bending stiffness of a single crystalline bundle of actin results from these measurements indicate that the actin scruin composite bundle has an average elastic modulus of  gpa which is similar to that of a single actin filament and a bending stiffness that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of a bundle of uncross linked actin filaments due to stiffening by the scruin matrix
