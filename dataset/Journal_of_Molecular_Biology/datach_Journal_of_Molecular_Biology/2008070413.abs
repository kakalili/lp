activation of the escherichia coli mara soxs rob regulon in response to transcriptional activator concentration
the paralogous transcriptional activators mara soxs and rob activate a common set of promoters the mara soxs rob regulon of escherichia coli by binding a cognate site marbox upstream of each promoter the extent of activation varies from one promoter to another and is only poorly correlated with the in vitro affinity of the activator for the specific marbox here we examine the dependence of promoter activation on the level of activator in vivo by manipulating the steady state concentrations of mara and soxs in lon protease mutants and by measuring promoter activation using lacz transcriptional fusions we found that  i the mara concentrations needed for half maximal stimulation varied by at least  fold among the  promoters tested  ii most marboxes were not saturated when there were    molecules of mara per cell  iii the correlation between the mara concentration needed for half maximal promoter activity in vivo and marbox binding affinity in vitro was poor and iv the two activators differed in their promoter activation profiles the marrab and soda promoters could both be saturated by mara and soxs in vivo however saturation by mara resulted in greater marrab and lesser soda transcription than did saturation by soxs implying that the two activators interact with rna polymerase in different ways at the different promoters thus the concentration and nature of activator determine which regulon promoters are activated as well as the extent of their activation
