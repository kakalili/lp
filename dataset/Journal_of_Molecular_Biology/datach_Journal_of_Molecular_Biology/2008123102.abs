pathogenic activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in mammalian membranes
the mechanism of receptor tyrosine kinase rtk over activation due to mutations in their transmembrane tm domain is not well understood and different mechansims have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis here we address the effect of two such pathogenic mutations v  e in neu and a  e in fibroblast growth factor receptor  fgfr  on receptor activation in mammalian cells we develop a quantitative description of receptor activation in terms of free energies of activation and generate mathematical predictions of active fractions as a function of receptor expression we test the mathematical predictions by comparing them to western blot measurements of active fractions of neu and chimeric neu fgfr receptors in cho cells we show that the predictions describe the experimental data thus yielding a quantitative measure of receptor over activation due to the two mutations studied in cho cells the v  e mutation increases the neu activation propensity by about    kcal mol while the increase due to the a  e mutation is about    kcal mol the two values are similar and likely represent glu mediated stabilization of the active dimeric state thus an increase of the order of     kcal mol may be sufficient to transform normal signaling processes into pathogenic processes the results of this study increase our knowledge of the mechanism behind rtk mediated pathologies and highlight the potential utility of inhibitors that target the dimerization process they also suggest the cellular response to stimuli can be understood and predicted based on quantitative knowledge of interaction strengths between proteins involved in signaling
