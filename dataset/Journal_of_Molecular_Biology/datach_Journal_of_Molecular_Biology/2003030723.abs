a calcium driven conformational switch of the n terminal and core domains of annexin a
in    huber and co workers published the structure of an n terminally truncated version of human annexin a lacking the first  amino acid residues pdb code  ain  in    we reported the structure of full length porcine annexin a including the n terminal domain in the absence of calcium ions pdb code  hm  the latter structure did not reflect a typical annexin core fold but rather a surprising interaction of the n terminal domain and the core domain comparing these two structures revealed that in the full length structure the first  residues of the n terminal domain insert into the core of the protein thereby replacing and unwinding one of the  helices helix d in repeat  that is involved in calcium binding we hypothesized that this structure in the absence of calcium ions represents the inactive form of the protein furthermore we proposed that upon calcium binding the n terminal domain would be expelled from the core domain and that the core d helix would reform in the proper conformation for calcium coordination herein we report the x ray structure of full length porcine annexin a in the presence of calcium this new structure shows a typical annexin core structure as we hypothesized with the d helix back in place for calcium coordination while parts of the now exposed n terminal domain are disordered we could locate eight calcium ions in this structure two of which are octa coordinated and two of which were not observed in the structure of the n terminally truncated annexin a  possible implications of this calcium induced conformational switch for the membrane aggregation properties of annexin a will be discussed
