conformational effects of gly  x  gly interruptions in the collagen triple helix
the collagen model peptide with sequence pro  hyp  gly   pro  gly  pro  hyp  gly  contains a central gly  pro  gly interruption in the consensus collagen sequence its high resolution crystal structure defines the molecular consequences of such an interruption for the collagen triple helical conformation and provides insight into possible structural and biological roles of similar interruptions in the  gly  x  y  repeating pattern found in non fibrillar collagens the peptide denoted as the hyp minus peptide or hyp   forms a rod like triple helix structure without any bend or kink and crystallizes in a quasi hexagonal lattice the two pro  hyp  gly zones adopt the typical triple helical collagen conformation with standard rich and crick ii hydrogen bonding topology notably the central zone containing the gly  pro  gly interruption deviates from the standard structure in terms of hydrogen bonding topology torsion angles helical and superhelical parameters these deviations are highly localized such that the standard features are regained within one to two residues on either side conformational variations and high temperature factors seen for the six chains of the asymmetric unit in the zone around the interruption point to the presence of a local region of considerable plasticity and flexibility embedded within two highly rigid and ordered standard triple helical segments the structure suggests a role for gly  x  gly interruptions as defining regions of flexibility and molecular recognition in the otherwise relatively uniform repeating collagen conformation
