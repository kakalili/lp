sds facilitated in vitro formation of a transmembrane b type cytochrome is mediated by changes in local ph
the folding and stabilization of  helical transmembrane proteins are still not well understood following cofactor binding to a membrane protein provides a convenient method to monitor the formation of appropriate native structures we have analyzed the assembly and stability of the transmembrane cytochrome b    which can be efficiently assembled in vitro from a heme binding psbf homo dimer by combining free heme with the apo cytochrome b    unfolding of the protein dissolved in the mild detergent dodecyl maltoside may be induced by addition of sds which at high concentrations leads to dimer dissociation surprisingly absorption spectroscopy reveals that heme binding and cytochrome formation at ph   are optimal at intermediate sds concentrations stopped flow kinetics revealed that genuine conformational changes are involved in heme binding at these sds concentrations gps global protein folding state mapping nmr measurements showed that optimal heme binding is intimately related to a change in the degree of histidine protonation in the absence of sds the ph curve for heme binding is bell shaped with an optimum at around ph     at alkaline ph values the negative electrostatic potential of sds lowers the local ph sufficiently to restore efficient heme binding provided the amount of sds needed for this does not denature the protein accordingly the higher the ph value above    the more sds is needed to improve heme binding and this competes with the inherent tendency of sds to dissociate cytochrome b    our work highlights that in addition to its denaturing properties sds can affect protein functions by lowering the local ph
