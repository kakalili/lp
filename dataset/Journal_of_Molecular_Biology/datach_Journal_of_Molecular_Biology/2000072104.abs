structures of type  peroxisomal targeting signals in two trypanosomatid aldolases
trypanosomatids unicellular organisms responsible for several global diseases contain unique organelles called glycosomes in which the first seven glycolytic enzymes are sequestered we report the crystal structures of glycosomal fructose   bisphosphate aldolase from two major tropical pathogens trypanosoma brucei and leishmania mexicana the causative agents of african sleeping sickness and one form of leishmaniasis respectively unlike mammalian aldolases the t brucei and l mexicana aldolases contain nonameric n terminal type  peroxisomal targeting signals pts s to direct their import into the glycosome in both tetrameric trypanosomatid aldolases the pts s from two different subunits form two closely intertwined structures these  pts dimers   which have very similar conformations in the two aldolase structures are the first reported conformations of a glycosomal or peroxisomal pts  and provide opportunities for the design of trypanocidal compounds
