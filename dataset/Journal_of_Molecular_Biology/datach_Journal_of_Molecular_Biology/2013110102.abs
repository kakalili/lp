advances in molecular modeling of human cytochrome p  polymorphism
cytochrome p   cyp is a supergene family of metabolizing enzymes involved in the phase i metabolism of drugs and endogenous compounds cyp oxidation often leads to inactive drug metabolites or to highly toxic or carcinogenic metabolites involved in adverse drug reactions adr  during the last decade the impact of cyp polymorphism in various drug responses and adr has been demonstrated of the drugs involved in adr   are metabolized by polymorphic phase i metabolizing enzymes   among them being cyp here we review the major cyp polymorphic forms their impact for drug response and current advances in molecular modeling of cyp polymorphism we focus on recent studies exploring cyp polymorphism performed by the use of sequence based and or protein structure based computational approaches the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms related to cyp polymorphism and drug response at the atomic level is outlined
