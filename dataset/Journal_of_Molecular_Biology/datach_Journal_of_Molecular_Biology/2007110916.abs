tracing changes in protonation a prerequisite to factorize thermodynamic data of inhibitor binding to aldose reductase
to prevent diabetic complications derived from enhanced glucose flux via the polyol pathway the development of aldose reductase inhibitors aris has been established as a promising therapeutic concept here we study the binding process of inhibitors to aldose reductase alr  with respect to changes of the protonation inventory upon complex formation knowledge of such processes is a prerequisite to factorize the binding free energy into enthalpic and entropic contributions on an absolute scale our isothermal titration calorimetry itc measurements suggest a proton uptake upon complex formation with carboxylate type inhibitors as the protonation event will contribute strongly to the enthalpic signal recorded during itc experiments knowledge about the proton accepting and releasing functional groups of the system is of utmost importance however this is intricate to retrieve if as in the present case both binding site and ligand possess several titratable groups here we present pka calculations complemented by mutagenesis and thermodynamic measurements suggesting a tyrosine residue located in the catalytic site tyr  as a likely candidate to act as proton acceptor upon inhibitor binding as it occurs deprotonated to a remarkable extent if only the cofactor nadp is bound we furthermore provide evidence that the protonation state and binding thermodynamics depend strongly on the oxidation state of the cofactor s nicotinamide moiety binding thermodynamics of idd   idd   tolrestat sorbinil and fidarestat are discussed in the context of substituent effects
