crystal structure of the engineered neutralizing antibody m  complexed to domain  of the anthrax protective antigen
the virulence of bacillus anthracis is critically dependent on the cytotoxic components of the anthrax toxin lethal factor lf and edema factor ef  lf and ef gain entry into host cells through interactions with the protective antigen pa  which binds to host cellular receptors such as cmg  antibodies that neutralize pa have been shown to confer protection in animal models and are undergoing intense clinical development a murine monoclonal antibody  b  has been reported to interact with domain  of pa pad  and block its binding to cmg  more recently the  b antibody was used as the platform for the selection of very high affinity single chain antibodies that have tremendous potential as a combination anthrax prophylactic and treatment here we report the high resolution x ray structures of three high affinity single chain antibodies in the  b family  b and two high affinity variants h and m  in addition we present the first neutralizing antibody  pa structure m  in complex with pad at     resolution these structures provide insights into the mechanism of neutralization and the effect of various mutations on antibody affinity and enable a comparison between the binding of the m  antibody and cmg with pad
