pentamerization of single domain antibodies from phage libraries a novel strategy for the rapid generation of high avidity antibody reagents
we describe a novel type of molecule in which single domain antibodies sdabs isolated from a na  ve llama single domain antibody library are linked to an oligomerization domain to generate high avidity antigen binding reagents an sdab is fused to the b subunit of escherichia coli verotoxin or shiga like toxin which self assembles to form a homopentamer and results in simultaneous sdab pentamerization and introduction of avidity molecular modeling indicated that this fusion protein pdb  ojf  termed pentabody has structural flexibility for binding to surface presented antigen in the instance of an sdab specific for a peptide antigen pentamerization resulted in a dramatic increase in functional affinity for immobilized antigen the pentabody was expressed in high yield in e coli in a non aggregated state and exhibited excellent thermostability and protease resistance this technology provides a relatively rapid means of generating novel antigen binding molecules that bind strongly to immobilized antigen it is expected that pentavalent sdabs will have general applicability in proteomics immunochemical staining cancer diagnosis and other applications in which antigens are presented multivalently
