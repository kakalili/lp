an antiparallel four helix bundle orients the high affinity rna binding sites in hnrnp c a mechanism for rna chaperonin activity edited by j karn
previous studies have shown that the c protein of  s hnrnp complexes contains a leucine zipper domain residues     and that a  residue highly basic domain immediately preceding the zipper is responsible for almost all of the free energy of rna binding to c protein because this domain arrangement is like that seen in the bzip transcription factors it has been termed the bzip like motif or bzlm we report here that the zipper domain drives c protein oligomerization through its spontaneous assembly into an anti parallel four helix bundle approximately    in length the anti parallel nature of the four helix bundle positions the tetramer  s four high affinity rna binding domains at opposing ends of a rigid core formed by the helix bundle this domain topology is ideally suited to accommodate and direct a double wrapping of rna around the tetramer and is fully consistent with c protein  s ability to bind and order   nt lengths of pre mrna through a highly cooperative rna binding mode we have used a novel sequence specific  c  n labeling strategy and multidimensional nmr spectroscopy to define the anti parallel orientation of the four helix bundle and its molecular dimensions in vitro reconstitution and hydrodynamic studies on native c protein on several c protein fragments and on various synthetic peptides are consistent with the proposed model and indicate that c protein  s canonical rna recognition motifs probably function in tetramer tetramer interactions during  s hnrnp assembly
