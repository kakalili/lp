characterization of a dual function domain that mediates membrane insertion and excision of ff filamentous bacteriophage
the filamentous phage ff f  fd or m  of escherichia coli is assembled at the cell membranes by a process that is morphologically similar to that of pilus assembly the release of the filament virion is mediated by excision from the membrane conversely entry into a host cell is mediated by insertion of the virion coat proteins into the membrane the n terminal domains of the minor virion protein piii have the sole role of binding to host receptors during infection in contrast the c domain of piii is required for two opposite functions insertion of the virion into the membrane during infection and excision at the termination step of assembly secretion we identified a  residue long segment in the piii c domain which is required for phage entry but dispensable for release from the membrane at the end of assembly this segment which we named the infection competence segment ics  works only in cis with the n terminal receptor binding domains and does not require the equivalent ics sequences in other subunits within the virion cap the ics contains a predicted amphipathic  helix and is rich in small amino acids gly ala and ser which are arranged as a small xxx small xx small xxx small xxx small motif scanning ala gly mutagenesis of ics showed that small residues are compatible with infection overall organization of the c domain is reminiscent of  helical pore forming toxins membrane insertion domains the unique ability of piii to mediate both membrane insertion and excision allowed us to compare these two fundamental membrane transactions and to show that receptor triggered insertion is a more complex process than excision from membranes
