generation of the bfii restriction endonuclease from the fusion of a dna recognition domain to a non specific nuclease from the phospholipase d superfamily
the bfii endonuclease cleaves dna at fixed positions downstream of an asymmetric sequence unlike other restriction enzymes it functions without metal ions the n terminal half of bfii is similar to nuc an edta resistant nuclease from salmonella typhimurium that belongs to the phosphoplipase d superfamily nuc is a dimer with one active site at its subunit interface as is bfii but it cuts dna non specifically bfii was cleaved by thermolysin into an n terminal domain which forms a dimer with non specific nuclease activity and a c terminal domain which lacks catalytic activity but binds specifically to the recognition sequence as a monomer on denaturation with guanidinium bfii underwent two unfolding transitions one at a relatively low concentration of guanidinium to a dimeric non specific nuclease a second at a higher concentration to an inactive monomer the isolated c terminal domain unfolded at the first relatively low concentration the isolated n terminal at the second hence bfii consists of two physically separate domains with catalytic and dimerisation functions in the n terminus and dna recognition functions in the c terminus it is the first example of a restriction enzyme generated by the evolutionary fusion of a dna recognition domain to a phosphodiesterase from the phospholipase d superfamily bfii may consist of three structural units a stable central core with the active site made from two copies of the n terminal domain flanked by relatively unstable c terminal domains that each bind a copy of the recognition sequence
