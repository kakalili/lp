the unstructured linker arms of mlh  pms are important for interactions with dna during mismatch repair
dna mismatch repair mmr models have proposed that msh muts homolog proteins identify dna polymerase errors while interacting with the dna replication fork mlh mutl homolog proteins primarily mlh  pms in baker s yeast then survey the genome for lesion bound msh proteins the resulting msh  mlh complex formed at a dna lesion initiates downstream steps in repair mlh proteins act as dimers and contain long     nm unstructured arms that connect two terminal globular domains these arms can vary between   and   amino acids in length are highly divergent between organisms and are resistant to amino acid substitutions to test the roles of the linker arms in mmr we engineered a protease cleavage site into the mlh linker arm domain of baker s yeast mlh  pms  cleavage of the mlh linker arm in vitro resulted in a defect in mlh  pms dna binding activity and in vivo proteolytic cleavage resulted in a complete defect in mmr we then generated a series of truncation mutants bearing mlh and pms linker arms of varying lengths this work revealed that mmr is greatly compromised when portions of the mlh linker are removed whereas repair is less sensitive to truncation of the pms linker arm purified complexes containing truncations in mlh and pms linker arms were analyzed and found to have differential defects in dna binding that also correlated with the ability to form a ternary complex with msh  msh and mismatch dna these observations are consistent with the unstructured linker domains of mlh proteins providing distinct interactions with dna during mmr
