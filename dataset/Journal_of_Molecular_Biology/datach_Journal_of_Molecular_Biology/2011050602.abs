characterizing the existing and potential structural space of proteins by large scale multiple loop permutations
worldwide structural genomics projects are increasing structure coverage of sequence space but have not significantly expanded the protein structure space itself i e  number of unique structural folds since    discovering new structural folds experimentally by directed evolution and random recombination of secondary structure blocks is also proved rarely successful meanwhile previous computational efforts for large scale mapping of protein structure space are limited to simple model proteins and led to an inconclusive answer on the completeness of the existing observed protein structure space here we build novel protein structures by extending naturally occurring circular single loop permutation to multiple loop permutations mlps  these structures are clustered by structural similarity measure called tm score the computational technique allows us to produce different structural clusters on the same naturally occurring packed stable core but with alternatively connected secondary structure segments a large scale mlp of   domains from structural classification of protein domains reproduces those existing structural clusters    mostly as hubs for many nonredundant sequences and illustrates newly discovered novel clusters as islands adopted by a few sequences only results further show that there exist a significant number of novel potentially stable clusters for medium size or large size single domain proteins in particular  gt   amino acid residues that are either not yet adopted by nature or adopted only by a few sequences this study suggests that mlp provides a simple yet highly effective tool for engineering and design of novel protein structures including naturally knotted proteins  the implication of recovering new fold targets from critical assessment of structure prediction techniques casp by mlp on template based structure prediction is also discussed our mlp structures are available for download at the publication page of the web site http  sparks informatics iupui edu
