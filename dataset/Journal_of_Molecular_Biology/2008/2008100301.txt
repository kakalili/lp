The SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 protein is structurally classified into the SWI2/SNF2 superfamily of DNA-dependent ATPases that are catalytic subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes. Although the importance of other members of the SWR1-like subfamily in chromatin remodeling (EP400, INOC1, and SRCAP) has already been elucidated, the biological function of SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 in transcriptional regulation remains to be clarified. To gain insight into the role of this protein, we generated a specific antibody against SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 and used it for chromatin and protein immunoprecipitation assays. We employed high-resolution genome tiling microarrays in chromatin immunoprecipitation and found the binding sites of SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 in the vicinity of the transcriptional start site of 69 candidate target genes. In the protein immunoprecipitation assay, we found that endogenous SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 binds with TRIM28, a recently highlighted transcriptional regulator in the cancer field. From these findings, we propose a novel model for gene regulation via the SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 protein complex.
