structural and functional studies of fkpa from escherichia coli a cis trans peptidyl prolyl isomerase with chaperone activity
the protein fkpa from the periplasm of escherichia coli exhibits both cis trans peptidyl prolyl isomerase ppiase and chaperone activities the crystal structure of the protein has been determined in three different forms as the full length native molecule as a truncated form lacking the last  residues and as the same truncated form in complex with the immunosuppressant ligand fk   fkpa is a dimeric molecule in which the   residue subunit is divided into two domains the n terminal domain includes three helices that are interlaced with those of the other subunit to provide all inter subunit contacts maintaining the dimeric species the c terminal domain which belongs to the fk  binding protein fkbp family binds the fk  ligand the overall form of the dimer is v shaped and the different crystal structures reveal a flexibility in the relative orientation of the two c terminal domains located at the extremities of the v the deletion mutant fkpnl comprising the n terminal domain only exists in solution as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric species and exhibits chaperone activity by contrast a deletion mutant comprising the c terminal domain only is monomeric and although it shows ppiase activity it is devoid of chaperone function these results suggest that the chaperone and catalytic activities reside in the n and c terminal domains respectively accordingly the observed mobility of the c terminal domains of the dimeric molecule could effectively adapt these two independent folding functions of fkpa to polypeptide substrates
