the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of crambin using an all atom monte carlo simulation edited by a r fersht
we present a novel monte carlo simulation of protein folding in which all heavy atoms are represented as interacting hard spheres this model includes all degrees of freedom relevant to folding all side chain and backbone torsions and uses a g  potential in this study we focus on the  residue    protein crambin and two of its structural components the helix and helix hairpin for a wide range of temperatures we recorded multiple folding events of these three structures from random coils to native conformations that differ by less than   c  drms from their crystal structure coordinates the thermodynamics and kinetic mechanism of the helix coil transition obtained from our simulation shows excellent agreement with currently available experimental and molecular dynamics data based on insights obtained from folding its smaller structural components a possible folding mechanism for crambin is proposed we observed that the folding occurs via a cooperative first order like process and that many folding pathways to the native state exist one particular sequence of events constitutes a  fast folding  pathway where kinetic traps are avoided at very low temperatures a kinetic trap arising from the incorrect packing of side chains was observed these results demonstrate that folding to the native state can be observed in a reasonable amount of time on desktop computers even when an all atom representation is used provided the energetics sufficiently stabilize the native state
