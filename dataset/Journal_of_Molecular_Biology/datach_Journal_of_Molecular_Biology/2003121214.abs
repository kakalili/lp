eclipse  synchrony relationship in escherichia coli strains with mutations affecting sequestration initiation of replication and superhelicity of the bacterial chromosome
initiation of replication from oric on the escherichia coli chromosomes occurs once and only once per generation at the same cell mass per origin during rapid growth there are overlapping replication cycles and initiation occurs synchronously at two or more copies of oric since the bacterial growth can vary over a wide range from three divisions per hour to   hours or more per division the frequency of initiation should change in coordination with bacterial growth prevention of reinitiation from a newly replicated origin by temporary sequestration of the hemi methylated gatc sites in the origin region provides the molecular genetic basis for the maintenance of the eclipse period between two successive rounds of replication sequestration is also believed to be responsible for initiation synchrony since inactivation of either the seqa or the dam gene abolishes synchrony while drastically reducing the eclipse in this work we attempted to examine the functional relationship s between the eclipse period and the synchrony of initiation in e coli strains by direct measurements of these parameters by density shift centrifugation and flow cytometric analyses respectively the eclipse period measured as a fraction of dna duplication times varied continuously from   for the wild type e coli k  to   for strains with mutations in seqa dam dnaa topa and gyr genes all of which have been shown to cause asynchrony and their various combinations the asynchrony index a quantitative indicator for the loss of synchrony of initiation changed from low synchronous to high asynchronous values in a step function like relationship with the eclipse an eclipse period of approximately   generation time appeared to be the critical value for the switch from synchronous to asynchronous initiation
