selectivity and permeation of alkali metal ions in k channels
ion conduction in k channels is usually described in terms of concerted movements of k progressing in a single file through a narrow pore permeation is driven by an incoming ion knocking on those ions already inside the protein a fine tuned balance between high affinity binding and electrostatic repulsive forces between permeant ions is needed to achieve efficient conduction while k channels are known to be highly selective for k over na  some k channels conduct na in the absence of k  other ions are known to permeate k channels with a more moderate preference and unusual conduction features we describe an extensive computational study on ion conduction in k channels rendering free energy profiles for the translocation of three different alkali ions and some of their mixtures the free energy maps for rb translocation show at atomic level why experimental rb conductance is slightly lower than that of k  in contrast to k or rb  external na block k currents and the sites where na transport is hindered are characterized translocation of k na mixtures is energetically unfavorable owing to the absence of equally spaced ion binding sites for na  excluding na from a channel already loaded with k
