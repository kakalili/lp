structural basis of human cytoglobin for ligand binding
cytoglobin cgb  a newly discovered member of the vertebrate globin family binds o reversibly via its heme as is the case for other mammalian globins hemoglobin hb  myoglobin mb and neuroglobin ngb  while cgb is expressed in various tissues its physiological role is not clearly understood here the x ray crystal structure of wild type human cgb in the ferric state at    resolution is reported in the crystal structure ferric cgb is dimerized through two intermolecular disulfide bonds between cys  b  and cys  e  and the dimerization interface is similar to that of lamprey hb and ngb the overall backbone structure of the cgb monomer exhibits a traditional globin fold with a three over three  helical sandwich in which the arrangement of helices is basically the same among all globins studied to date a detailed comparison reveals that the backbone structure of the cd corner to d helix region the n terminus of the e helix and the f helix of cgb resembles more closely those of pentacoordinated globins mb lamprey hb  rather than hexacoordinated globins ngb rice hb  however the his  e  imidazole group coordinates directly to the heme iron as a sixth axial ligand to form a hexcoordinated heme like ngb and rice hb the position and orientation of the highly conserved residues in the heme pocket phe cd  val e   distal his e  and proximal his f  are similar to those of other globin proteins two alternative conformations of the arg  e  guanidium group were observed suggesting that it participates in ligand binding to cgb as is the case for arg e  of aplysia mb and lys e  of ngb the structural diversities and similarities among globin proteins are discussed with relevance to molecular evolutionary relationships
