bcr abl expression of myeloid progenitors increases   integrin mediated adhesion to stromal cells
the expression of the fusion protein bcr abl is a hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia bcr abl is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase influencing cell proliferation apoptosis and differentiation to what extent and by which mechanism bcr abl affects the adhesion of leukemic cells to bone marrow stromal cells bmsc is controversial to characterize adhesion of bcr abl transformed  d cells  d bcr abl to the bmsc line m  b  we used washing assays and single cell force spectroscopy scfs  compared to control  d cells  d v   d bcr abl developed threefold higher adhesion forces this enhanced cell adhesion could be reduced to control levels after specifically inhibiting the activity of the tyrosine kinase bcr abl using imatinib mesylate im  scfs showed that the adhesion forces of  d bcr abl were strongest to fibronectin and collagen type i suggesting that   integrin has a major role in mediating the adhesion of leukemic cells to bmsc indeed the   integrin blocking antibody ha  abrogated the attachment of  d v and  d bcr abl cells to bmsc although  d bcr abl cells show significantly increased   integrin expression no significant difference of   integrin mrna levels could be detected indicating a post transcriptional regulation of   comprising integrin heterodimers by bcr abl the data presented here argue that the interaction of   integrin and extracellular matrix components is functionally important in leukemic cells expressing high levels of bcr abl and could provide a rationale for the development of optimized targeted therapies
