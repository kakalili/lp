characterization of the folding kinetics of a three helix bundle protein via a minimalist langevin model edited by a r fersht
we use a simple off lattice langevin model of protein folding to characterize the folding and unfolding of a fast folding   residue three helix bundle under conditions at which the c terminal helix is   stable we observe a clear three state folding mechanism in the on pathway intermediate state the middle and c terminal helices are folded and in contact with each other while the n terminal region remains disordered nevertheless under these conditions this intermediate is thermodynamically unstable relative to its unfolded state the first and highest folding barrier corresponds to the organization of the hinge between the middle and c terminal helices a subsequent major barrier corresponds to the organization of the hinge between the middle and n terminal helices hyperstabilizing the hinge regions leads to twice the folding rate that is obtained from hyperstabilizing the helices even though much fewer contacts are involved in hinge hyperstabilization than in helix hyperstabilization unfolding follows single exponential kinetics even at temperatures only slightly above the folding transition temperature
