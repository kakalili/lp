domain   of the   subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase modulates the formation of stable polymerase promoter complexes
the sigma      subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase specifies transcription from promoters that are responsible for basal gene expression during vegetative growth when   is present within polymerase holoenzyme two of its domains   and   interact with sequences within the    and    regions respectively of promoter dna however in free    dna binding is prevented by domain   the n terminal domain of the protein previous work has demonstrated that the presence of domain   is required for efficient transcription initiation at the lambda promoter pr to investigate whether this is a general property of domain   we have used five promoters to compare polymerases with and without domain   in in vitro transcription assays and in assays assessing the formation and decay of stable pretranscription complexes we find that the absence of domain   does not render the polymerase defective at all of these promoters depending on the promoter the absence of domain   can promote or inhibit transcription initiation by affecting the formation of stable pretranscription complexes however domain   does not affect the stability of these complexes once they are formed for polymerases containing domain   the efficiency of stable complex formation correlates with how well the    and    regions of a promoter match the ideal   recognition sequences however when domain   is absent having this match becomes less important in determining how efficiently stable complexes are made we suggest that domain   influences initiation by constraining polymerase to assess a promoter primarily by the fitness of its    and    regions to the canonical sequences
