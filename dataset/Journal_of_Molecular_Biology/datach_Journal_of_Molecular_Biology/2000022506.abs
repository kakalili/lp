is  transposition is regulated by protein protein interactions via a leucine zipper motif edited by i b holland
efficient intermolecular transposition of bacterial insertion sequence is  involves the activities of two element encoded proteins the transposase orfab and a regulatory factor orfa orfa shares the majority of its amino acid sequence with the n terminal part of orfab this includes a putative helix turn helix and three of four heptads of a leucine zipper motif orfa strongly stimulates orfab mediated intermolecular transposition both in vivo and in vitro the present results support the notion that this is accomplished by direct interaction between these two proteins via the leucine zipper we used both a genetic approach based on gene fusions with phage  repressor and a physical approach involving co immunoprecipitation to show that orfa not only undergoes oligomerisation but is capable of engaging with orfab to form heteromultimers and that the leucine zipper is necessary for both types of interaction furthermore mutation of the leucine zipper in orfa inactivated its regulatory function previous observations demonstrated that the integrity of the leucine zipper motif was also important for orfab binding to the is  terminal inverted repeats here we show in gel shift experiments using a derivative of orfab deleted for the c terminal catalytic domain orfab     that the protein is capable of pairing two inverted repeats to generate a species resembling a  synaptic complex   preincubation of orfab    with orfa dramatically reduced formation of this complex and favored formation of an alternative complex devoid of orfa together these results suggest that orfa exerts its regulatory effect by interacting transiently with orfab via the leucine zipper and modifying orfab binding to the inverted repeats
