the evolution of catalytic efficiency and substrate promiscuity in human theta class   glutathione transferase
theta class glutathione transferases gst from various species exhibit markedly different catalytic activities in conjugating the tripeptide glutathione gsh to a variety of electrophilic substrates for example the human theta   enzyme hgstt   is   fold less efficient than the rat theta   enzyme rgstt   with the fluorogenic substrate  amino  chloromethyl coumarin cmac  large libraries of hgstt  constructed by error prone pcr dna shuffling or saturation mutagenesis were screened for improved catalytic activity towards cmac in a quantitative fashion using flow cytometry an iterative directed evolution approach employing random mutagenesis in conjunction with homologous recombination gave rise to enzymes exhibiting up to a    fold increase in kcat km compared to hgstt   all highly active clones encoded one or more mutations at residues     or   combinatorial saturation mutagenesis was used to evaluate the full complement of natural amino acids at these positions and resulted in the isolation of enzymes with catalytic rates comparable to those exhibited by the fastest mutants obtained via directed evolution the substrate selectivities of enzymes resulting from random mutagenesis dna shuffling and combinatorial saturation mutagenesis were evaluated using a series of distinct electrophiles the results revealed that promiscuous substrate activities arose in a stochastic manner as they did not correlate with catalytic efficiency towards the cmac selection substrate in contrast chimeric enzymes previously constructed by homology independent recombination of hgstt  and rgstt  exhibited very different substrate promiscuity profiles and showed a more defined relationship between evolved and promiscuous activities
