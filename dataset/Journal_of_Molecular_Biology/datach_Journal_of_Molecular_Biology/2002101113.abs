d structure of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor
the dihydropyridine receptors dhpr are l type voltage gated calcium channels that regulate the flux of calcium ions across the cell membrane here we present the three dimensional  d structure at     resolution of purified skeletal muscle dhpr as determined by electron microscopy and single particle analysis here both biochemical and d structural data indicate that dhpr is dimeric dhpr dimers are composed of two arch shaped monomers     across and     thick that interact very tightly at each end of the arch the roughly toroidal structure of the two monomers encloses a cylindrical space of     diameter which is then closed on each side by two dome shaped protein densities reaching over from each monomer arch the dome shaped domains have a length of       and a maximum height of     small orifices punctuate their exterior surface the d structure disclosed here may have important implications for the understanding of dhpr ca  channel function we also propose a model for its in vivo interactions with the calcium release channel at the junctional sarcoplasmic recticulum
