an archaeal dim like protein adim p forms a ternary complex with a eif  and the   end fragment of  s rrna
dim p is a eukaryal small ribosomal subunit rna processing factor required for the maturation of  s rrna here we show that an archaeal homolog of dim p adim p forms a ternary complex with the archaeal homolog of eif   a eif   and the rna fragment that possesses the   end sequence of  s rrna both in solution and in crystal the    crystal structure of the ternary complex reveals that two kh domains of adim p kh  and   are involved in binding the anti shine  dalgarno core sequence ccucc    and a highly conserved adjacent sequence    ggauca  respectively of the target rrna fragment the surface plasmon resonance results show that the interaction of adim p with the target rrna fragment is very strong with a dissociation constant of        m and that adim p has a strong nucleotide sequence preference for the   end sequence of  s rrna on the other hand adim p interacts with the isolated  subunit and the intact    complex of a eif  irrespective of the rna binding these results suggest that adim p is a possible archaeal pre rrna processing factor recognizing the   end sequence    gaucaccucc    of  s rrna and may have multiple biological roles in vivo by interacting with other proteins such as a eif and ario p
