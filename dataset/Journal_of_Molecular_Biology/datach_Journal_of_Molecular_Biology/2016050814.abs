regulation of microtubule assembly by tau and not by pin
the molecular mechanism by which the microtubule associated protein map tau regulates the formation of microtubules mts is poorly understood the activity of tau is controlled via phosphorylation at specific ser thr sites of those phosphorylation sites   precede a proline making them potential recognition sites for the peptidyl prolyl isomerase pin  pin binding and catalysis of phosphorylated tau at the at  epitope which was implicated in alzheimer s disease has been reported to be crucial for restoring tau s ability to promote mt polymerization in vitro and in vivo   surprisingly we discover that pin does not promote phosphorylated tau induced mt formation in vitro refuting the commonly accepted model in which pin binding and catalysis on the a  epitope restores the function of the alzheimer s associated phosphorylated tau in tubulin assembly    using turbidity assays time resolved small angle x ray scattering saxs  and time resolved negative stain electron microscopy em  we investigate the mechanism of tau mediated mt assembly and the role of the thr  and ser  phosphorylation on this process we discover novel gtp tubulin ring shaped species which are detectable in the earliest stage of tau induced polymerization and may play a crucial role in the early nucleation phase of mt assembly finally by nmr and saxs experiments we show that the tau molecules must be located on the surface of mts and tubulin rings during the polymerization reaction the interaction between tau and tubulin is multipartite with a high affinity interaction of the four tubulin binding repeats and a weaker interaction with the proline rich sequence and the termini of tau
