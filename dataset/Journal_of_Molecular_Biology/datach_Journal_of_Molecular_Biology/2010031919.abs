structural basis for the recognition and cleavage of polysialic acid by the bacteriophage k f tailspike protein endonf
an    linked polysialic acid polysia capsule confers immune tolerance to neuroinvasive pathogenic prokaryotes such as escherichia coli k and neisseria meningitidis and supports host infection by means of molecular mimicry bacteriophages of the k family infecting e coli k  specifically recognize and degrade this polysia capsule utilizing tailspike endosialidases while the crystal structure for the catalytic domain of the endosialidase of bacteriophage k f endonf has been solved there is yet no structural information on the mode of polysia binding and cleavage available the crystal structure of activity deficient active site mutants of the homotrimeric endonf cocrystallized with oligomeric sialic acid identified three independent polysia binding sites in each endonf monomer the bound oligomeric sialic acid displays distinct conformations at each site in the active site a sia molecule is bound in an extended conformation representing the enzyme  product complex structural and biochemical data supported by molecular modeling enable to propose a reaction mechanism for polysia cleavage by endonf
