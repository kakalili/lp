the folding mechanics of a knotted protein
an increasing number of proteins are being discovered with a remarkable and somewhat surprising feature a knot in their native structures how the polypeptide chain is able to  knot  itself during the folding process to form these highly intricate protein topologies is not known here we perform a computational study on the   amino acid homodimeric protein yibk which like other proteins in the spou family of mtases contains a deep trefoil knot in its c terminal region in this study we use a coarse grained c  chain representation and langevin dynamics to study folding kinetics we find that specific attractive nonnative interactions are critical for knot formation in the absence of these interactions i e  in an energetics driven entirely by native interactions knot formation is exceedingly unlikely further we find in concert with recent experimental data on yibk two parallel folding pathways that we attribute to an early and a late formation of the trefoil knot respectively for both pathways knot formation occurs before dimerization a bioinformatics analysis of the spou family of proteins reveals further that the critical nonnative interactions may originate from evolutionary conserved hydrophobic segments around the knotted region
