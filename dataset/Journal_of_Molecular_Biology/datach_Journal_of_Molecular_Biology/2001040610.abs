evolution of function in protein superfamilies from a structural perspective edited by a r fersht
the recent growth in protein databases has revealed the functional diversity of many protein superfamilies we have assessed the functional variation of homologous enzyme superfamilies containing two or more enzymes as defined by the cath protein structure classification by way of the enzyme commission ec scheme combining sequence and structure information to identify relatives the majority of superfamilies display variation in enzyme function with   of superfamilies in the pdb having members of different enzyme types we determined the extent of functional similarity at different levels of sequence identity for     homologous pairs enzyme enzyme and enzyme non enzyme  with structural and sequence relatives included for single and multi domain proteins variation in ec number is rare above   sequence identity and above    the first three digits may be predicted with an accuracy of at least    for more distantly related proteins sharing less than   sequence identity functional variation is significant and below this threshold structural data are essential for understanding the molecular basis of observed functional differences to explore the mechanisms for generating functional diversity during evolution we have studied in detail  diverse structural enzyme superfamilies for which structural data are available a large number of variations and peculiarities are observed at the atomic level through to gross structural rearrangements almost all superfamilies exhibit functional diversity generated by local sequence variation and domain shuffling commonly substrate specificity is diverse across a superfamily whilst the reaction chemistry is maintained in many superfamilies the position of catalytic residues may vary despite playing equivalent functional roles in related proteins the implications of functional diversity within supefamilies for the structural genomics projects are discussed more detailed information on these superfamilies is available at http  www biochem ucl ac uk bsm fam ec
