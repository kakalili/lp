structure of a  alanine linked polyamide bound to a full helical turn of purine tract dna in the   motif
polyamides composed of n methylpyrrole py  n methylimidazole im and n methylhydroxypyrrole hp amino acids linked by  alanine   bind the minor groove of dna in   and   ligand to dna stoichiometries although the energetics and structure of the   complex has been explored extensively there is remarkably less understood about   recognition beyond the initial studies on netropsin and distamycin we present here the   solution structure of impy    im    impy   dp bound in a single orientation to its match site within the dna duplex   ccaaagagaagcg      cgcttctctttgg    match site in bold  as determined by d h nmr methods the representative ensemble of  conformers has no distance constraint violations greater than    and a pairwise rmsd over the binding site of     intermolecular noes place the polyamide deep inside the minor groove and oriented n  c with the       direction of the purine rich strand analysis of the high resolution structure reveals the ligand bound   completely within the minor groove for a full turn of the dna helix the dna is b form average rise    twist    with a narrow minor groove closing down to       in the binding site the ligand and dna are aligned in register with each polyamide nh group forming bifurcated hydrogen bonds of similar length to purine n and pyrimidine o atoms on the floor of the minor groove each imidazole group is hydrogen bonded via its n atom to its proximal guanine s exocyclic amino group the important roles of  alanine and imidazole for   binding are discussed
