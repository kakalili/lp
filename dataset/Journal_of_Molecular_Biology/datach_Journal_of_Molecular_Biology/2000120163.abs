a story unpaired adenosine bases in ribosomal rnas edited by d e draper
in   an analysis of the escherichia coli  s rrna covariation based structure model revealed a strong bias for unpaired adenosines the same analysis revealed that the majority of the g c and u bases were paired these biases are now consistent with the high percentage of unpaired adenosine nucleotides in several structure motifs an analysis of a larger set of bacterial comparative  s and  s rrna structure models has substantiated this initial finding and revealed new biases in the distribution of adenosine nucleotides in loop regions the majority of the adenosine nucleotides are unpaired while the majority of the g c and u bases are paired in the covariation based structure model the unpaired adenosine nucleotides predominate in the middle and at the   end of loops and are the second most frequent nucleotide type at the   end of loops g is the most common nucleotide  there are additional biases for unpaired adenosine nucleotides at the   end of loops and adjacent to a g at the   end of the helix the most prevalent consecutive nucleotides are gg ga ag and aa a total of   of the gg sequences are within helices while more than   of the aa sequences are unpaired nearly   of the ga sequences are unpaired and approximately one third of the ag sequences are within helices while another third are at the   loop   helix junction unpaired positions with an adenosine nucleotide in more than   of the sequences at the   end of  s and  s rrna loops were identified and arranged into the a motif categories xaz aaz xag aag and aag u where g or z is paired g u is a base pair and x is not an a and z is not a g in more than   of the sequences these sequence motifs were associated with several structural motifs such as adenosine platforms e and e like loops a a and a g pairings at the end of helices g a tandem base pairs gnra tetraloop hairpins and u turns
