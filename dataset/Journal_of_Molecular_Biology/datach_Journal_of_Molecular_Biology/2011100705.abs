the antibacterial threaded lasso peptide capistruin inhibits bacterial rna polymerase
capistruin a ribosomally synthesized post translationally modified peptide produced by burkholderia thailandensis e   efficiently inhibits growth of burkholderia and closely related pseudomonas strains the functional target of capistruin is not known capistruin is a threaded lasso peptide lariat peptide consisting of an n terminal ring of nine amino acids and a c terminal tail of  amino acids threaded through the ring the structure of capistruin is similar to that of microcin j  mccj   a threaded lasso antibacterial peptide that is produced by some strains of escherichia coli and targets dna dependent rna polymerase rnap  here we show that capistruin like mccj  inhibits wild type e coli rnap but not mutant mccj  resistant e coli rnap we show further that an e coli strain resistant to mccj  as a result of a mutation in an rnap subunit gene exhibits resistance to capistruin the results indicate that the structural similarity of capistruin and mccj  reflects functional similarity and suggest that the functional target of capistruin and possibly other threaded lasso peptides is bacterial rnap
