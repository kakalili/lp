water and ion binding around r upa  and d tpa  oligomers  comparison with rna and dna cpg  duplexes edited by i tinoco
the structural and dynamic properties of the water and ion first coordination shell of the r a u and d a t base pairs embedded within the r upa  and d tpa  duplexes are described on the basis of two   ns molecular dynamics simulations performed in a neutralizing aqueous environment with   m added kcl the results are compared to previous molecular dynamics simulations of the r cpg  and d cpg  structures performed under similar conditions it can be concluded that  i rna helices are more rigid than dna helices of identical sequence as reflected by the fact that rna duplexes keep their initial a form shape while dna duplexes adopt more sequence specific shapes  ii around these base pairs the water molecules occupy  to  well defined hydration sites some of which are partially occupied by potassium ions  iii these hydration sites are occupied by an average of          and   solvent molecules water and ions around the r g c  r a u  d g c  and d a t pairs respectively  iv from a dynamic point of view the stability of the hydration shell is the strongest for the r g c pairs and the weakest for the d a t pairs  v for rna the observed long lived hydration patterns are essentially non sequence dependent and involve water bridges located in the deep groove and linking or atoms of adjacent phosphate groups maximum lifetimes are close to   ps  vi in contrast for dna long lived hydration patterns are sequence dependent and located in the minor groove for d cpg   water bridges linking the g n and c o with the o   atoms of adjacent nucleotides with   ps maximum lifetimes are characterized while no such bridges are observed for d tpa   vii potassium ions are observed to bind preferentially to deep major groove atoms at rpy steps essentially d gpc  r gpc  and r apu  by forming ion bridges between electronegative atoms of adjacent base pairs on average about half an ion is observed per base pair positive ion binding determinants are related to the proximity of two or more electronegative atoms negative binding determinants are associated with the electrostatic and steric hindrance due to the proximity of electropositive amino groups and neutral methyl groups potassium ions form only transient contacts with phosphate groups
