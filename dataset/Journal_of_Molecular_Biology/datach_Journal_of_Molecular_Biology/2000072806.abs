transcriptional repressor copr the structured acidic c terminus is important for protein stability edited by j karn
the transcriptional repressor copr is one of the two copy number control components of plasmid pip   copr binds as a dimer at two consecutive major grooves on the same face of the dna previously equilibrium dissociation constants of copr dimers and the copr dna complex and the intracellular copr concentration were calculated amino acid residues involved in dna binding and dimerization were determined here we provide a detailed analysis of the acidic c terminus of copr a series of c terminally truncated copr mutants were analysed with regard to activity and half life in vivo and dna binding dimerization structure and stability in vitro the last  amino acid residues of copr were not essential for dna binding and dimerization but for protein stability however whereas cop   was in spite of drastically shortened half life still    active in vivo cop   and cop   retained only   activity in vivo stability could be restored only partially by adding a c terminal tail previously shown to stabilize the  repressor n terminus however substitution of seven glu residues by lys within the last  residues drastically reduced half life our results clearly demonstrate that the acidic c terminus is important for the stability of copr using cd measurements we show that the c terminus of copr is structured
