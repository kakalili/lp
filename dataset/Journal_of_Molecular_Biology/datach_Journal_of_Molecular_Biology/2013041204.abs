brucella immunogenic bp  forms a channel like structure
an outer membrane protein bp  omp  of brucella bp  is identified as a major immunodominant antigen and widely used as a diagnostic marker and for vaccination against brucellosis bp  belongs to the family of proteins that contains a simpl signaling molecule that associates with the mouse pelle like kinase domain whose structure and function have been unknown here we present the crystal structure of bp  revealing that  bp  molecules form a novel channel like assembly as also shown by electron microscopy analysis eight bp  molecules forming a ring structure contain a hole at the center of the octamer and another octamer interacts with each other to form a channel having a large internal cavity bp  is found to be structurally similar to a bacteriophage protein involved in infection implicating that bp  might function during brucella infection in addition the bp  structure suggests that the protein functions as a multimeric channel like form and provides a canonical model for the simpl domains
