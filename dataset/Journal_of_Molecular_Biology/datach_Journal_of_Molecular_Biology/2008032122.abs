exploration of specificity in germline monoclonal antibody recognition of a range of natural and synthetic epitopes
to explore the molecular basis of antigen recognition by germline antibodies we have determined to high resolution the structures of the near germline monoclonal antibody s   in complex with seven distinct carbohydrate antigens based on the bacterial sugar  deoxy  d manno oct  ulosonic acid kdo  in contrast to previous findings the inherited germline kdo monosaccharide binding site is not restricted to this bacterial sugar but is able to accommodate an array of substitutions and chemical modifications of kdo including naturally occurring antigens containing the related monosaccharide d glycero  d talo oct  ulosonic acid as well as nonterminal kdo residues however we show by surface plasmon resonance and elisa how antibody s   specificity is so dependent on the context in which the antigen is presented that a free disaccharide displays strong binding while the same lipid a bound disaccharide does not bind these structures provide insight into how inherited germline genes code for immunoglobulins of limited flexibility that are capable of binding a range of epitopes from which affinity matured antibodies are generated
