crossbridge and tropomyosin positions observed in native interacting thick and thin filaments edited by w baumeister
tropomyosin movements on thin filaments are thought to sterically regulate muscle contraction but have not been visualized during active filament sliding in addition although  d visualization of myosin crossbridges has been possible in rigor it has been difficult for thick filaments actively interacting with thin filaments in the current study using three dimensional reconstruction of electron micrographs of interacting filaments we have been able to resolve not only tropomyosin but also the docking sites for weak and strongly bound crossbridges on thin filaments in relaxing conditions tropomyosin was observed on the outer domain of actin and thin filament interactions with thick filaments were rare in contracting conditions tropomyosin had moved to the inner domain of actin and extra density reflecting weakly bound cycling myosin heads was also detected on the extreme periphery of actin in rigor conditions tropomyosin had moved further on to the inner domain of actin and strongly bound myosin heads were now observed over the junction of the inner and outer domains we conclude   that tropomyosin movements consistent with the steric model of muscle contraction occur in interacting thick and thin filaments   that myosin induced movement of tropomyosin in activated filaments requires strongly bound crossbridges and   that crossbridges are bound to the periphery of actin at a site distinct from the strong myosin binding site at an early stage of the crossbridge cycle
