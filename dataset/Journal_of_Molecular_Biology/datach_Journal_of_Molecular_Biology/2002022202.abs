snapdragon a method to delineate protein structural domains from sequence data edited by j thornton
we describe a method to identify protein domain boundaries from sequence information alone based on the assumption that hydrophobic residues cluster together in space snapdragon is a suite of programs developed to predict domain boundaries based on the consistency observed in a set of alternative ab initio three dimensional  d models generated for a given protein multiple sequence alignment this is achieved by running a distance geometry based folding technique in conjunction with a d domain assignment algorithm the overall accuracy of our method in predicting the number of domains for a non redundant data set of   multiple alignments representing   single and   multiple domain proteins is     using domain linker regions observed in the tertiary structures associated with each query alignment as the standard of truth inter domain boundary positions are delineated with an accuracy of    for proteins comprising continuous domains only and    for proteins with discontinuous domains overall domain boundaries are delineated with an accuracy of     the prediction accuracy values are independent of the pair wise sequence similarities within each of the alignments these results demonstrate the capability of our method to delineate domains in protein sequences associated with a wide variety of structural domain organisation
