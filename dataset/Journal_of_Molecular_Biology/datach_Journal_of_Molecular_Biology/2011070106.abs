role of   connector channel loops in late stage dna packaging
double stranded dna bacteriophages and their eukaryotic virus counterparts have  fold head  tail connector assemblages embedded at a unique capsid vertex this vertex is the site of assembly of the dna packaging motor and the connector has a central channel through which viral dna passes during genome packaging and subsequent host infection crystal structures of connectors from different phages reveal either disordered residues or structured loops that project into the connector channel given the proximity to the translocating dna substrate these loops have been proposed to play a role in dna packaging previous models have proposed structural motions in either the packaging atpase or the connector channel loops as the driving force that translocates the dna into the prohead here we mutate the channel loops of the bacillus subtilis bacteriophage   connector and show that these loops have no active role in translocation of dna instead they appear to have an essential function near the end of packaging acting to retain the packaged dna in the head in preparation for motor detachment and subsequent tail assembly and virion completion
