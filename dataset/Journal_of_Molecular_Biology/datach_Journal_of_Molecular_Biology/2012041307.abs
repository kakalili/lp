the role of hydration in protein stability comparison of the cold and heat unfolded states of yfh
protein unfolding occurs at both low and high temperatures although in most cases only the high temperature transition can be experimentally studied a pressing question is how much the low and high temperature denatured states although thermodynamically equivalent are structurally and kinetically similar we have combined experimental and computational approaches to compare the high and low temperature unfolded states of yfh  a natural protein that at physiologic ph undergoes cold and heat denaturation around   c and    c without the help of ad hoc destabilization we observe that the two denatured states have similar but not identical residual secondary structures different kinetics and compactness and a remarkably different degree of hydration we use molecular dynamics simulations to rationalize the role of solvation and its effect on protein stability
