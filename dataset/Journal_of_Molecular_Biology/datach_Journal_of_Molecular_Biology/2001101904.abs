an intramolecular quadruplex of gga  triplet repeat dna with a g g g g tetrad and a g a g a g a g heptad and its dimeric interaction  edited by i tinoco
the structure of d ggaggaggagga containing four tandem repeats of a gga triplet sequence has been determined under physiological k conditions d ggaggaggagga folds into an intramolecular quadruplex composed of a g g g g tetrad and a g a g a g a g heptad four g g segments of d ggaggaggagga are aligned parallel with each other due to six successive turns of the main chain at each of the gga and gagg segments two quadruplexes form a dimer stabilized through a stacking interaction between the heptads of the two quadruplexes comparison of the structure of d ggaggaggagga with the reported structure of d ggaggan  n g or t containing two tandem repeats of the gga triplet revealed that although the two structures resemble each other to some extent the extension of the repeats of the gga triplet leads to distinct structural differences intramolecular quadruplex for  mer versus intermolecular quadruplex for  mer heptad versus hexad in the quadruplex and three sheared g a base pairs versus two sheared g a base pairs plus one a a base pair per quadruplex it was also suggested that d ggaggaggagga forms a similar quadruplex under low salt concentration conditions this is in contrast to the case of d ggaggan  n g or t  which forms a duplex under low salt concentration conditions on the basis of these results the structure of naturally occurring gga triplet repeat dna is discussed
