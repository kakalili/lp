mechanistic insights into the kinetics of hiv  nucleocapsid protein facilitated trna annealing to the primer binding site
hiv  reverse transcriptase uses human trnalys  as a primer to initiate reverse transcription prior to initiation the     nucleotides of this trna are annealed to a complementary sequence on the rna genome known as the primer binding site pbs  here we show that the hiv  nucleocapsid protein nc enhances this annealing by approximately five orders of magnitude in vitro decreasing the transition state enthalpy from approximately  kcalmol   for the uncatalyzed reaction to  kcalmol   for the nc catalyzed process moreover the annealing follows second order kinetics consistent with the nucleation of the intermolecular duplex being the rate limiting step this nucleation is preceded by melting of a small duplex region within the original structure and is followed by much faster zipping of the rest of the  base pair bp duplex a trna mutational analysis shows that destabilization of the trna acceptor stem has only a minor effect on the annealing rate in contrast addition of bases to the   end of trna that are complementary to its single stranded   end interferes with duplex nucleation and therefore has a much larger effect on the net reaction rate assuming that the apparent transition free energy of the annealing reaction  g   is a sum of the melting  gm and nucleation  gnuc free energies we show that nc affects both  gm and  gnuc we estimate that ten to   fold of the overall rate enhancement is due to nc induced destabilization of a  bp helix in the pbs while the additional factor of      rate enhancement is a result of nc facilitated duplex nucleation the apparently similar effectiveness of wild type and sshs nc a mutant that lacks the zinc finger structures in facilitating the trna annealing reaction is most likely the result of the mutual cancellation of two factors sshs nc is less effective than wild type nc as a duplex destabilizer but more effective as a duplex nucleating agent
