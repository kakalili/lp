intrinsic bending and deformability at the t a step of cctttaaagg a comparative analysis of t a and a t steps within a tracts edited by i tinoco
introduction of a t a or pyrimidine purine step into a straight and rigid a tract can cause a positive roll deformation that kinks the dna helix at that step in cctttaaagg the central t a step has an    bend toward the major groove we report the structural analysis of cctttaaagg and a comparison with  other representative crystal structures from the ndb containing at least four consecutive a or t bases on average more local bending occurs at the disruptive t a step     than at an a t step      in addition a tracts containing an a t step are more bent than are pure a tracts and hence a a and a t steps are not equivalent all t a steps examined exhibit positive roll bending towards the major groove while a t steps display negative roll and bend slightly towards the minor groove this illustrates how inherent negative and positive roll are respectively at a t and t a steps within a tracts t a steps are more deformable showing larger and more variable deformations of minor groove width rise cup twist and buckle standard deviations of twist rise and cup for t a steps are         and     versus         and    for a t steps packing constraints determine which local values of these helical parameters an individual t a step will adopt for instance with cctttaaagg and three isomorphous structures cgattaatcg cgatatatcg and cgatcgatcg crystal packing forces lead to a series of correlated changes widened minor groove large slide low twist and large rise the difference in helical parameters between a t steps lying within a tracts versus a t steps within alternating at sequences demonstrates the importance of neighboring steps on the conformation of a given dinucleotide step
