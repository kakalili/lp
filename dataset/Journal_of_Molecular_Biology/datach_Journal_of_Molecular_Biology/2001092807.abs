the type iii restriction modification enzyme ecop i requires the interaction of two unmethylated inversely oriented recognition sites   cagcag in head to head configuration to allow an efficient dna cleavage it has been hypothesized that two convergent dna translocating enzyme substrate complexes interact to form the active cleavage complex and that translocation is driven by atp hydrolysis using a half automated fluorescence based detection method we investigated how the distance between two inversely oriented recognition sites affects dna cleavage efficiency we determined that ecop i cleaves dna efficiently even for two adjacent head to head or tail to tail oriented target sites hence dna translocation appears not to be required for initiating dna cleavage in these cases furthermore we report here that ecop i is able to cleave single site substrates when we analyzed the interaction of ecop i with dna substrates containing adjacent target sites in the presence of non hydrolyzable atp analogues we found that cleavage depended on the hydrolysis of atp moreover we show that cleavage occurs at only one of the two possible cleavage positions of an interacting pair of target sequences when ecop i bound to a dna substrate containing one recognition site in the absence of atp we observed a  nucleotide dnasei footprint that is asymmetric on both strands all of our footprinting experiments showed that the enzyme did not cover the region around the cleavage site analyzing a dna fragment with two head to head oriented recognition sites ecop i protected     nucleotides around the recognition sequence including an additional region of  bp between both cleavage sites for all dna substrates examined the presence of atp caused altered footprinting patterns we assume that the altered patterns are most likely due to a conformational change of the enzyme overall our data further refine the tracking collision model for type iii restriction enzymes
