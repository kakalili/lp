a dna translocating snf molecular motor saccharomyces cerevisiae rdh  displays processive translocation and extrudes dna loops
we have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy tirfm to investigate the characteristics of the yeast homologous recombination factor rdh  on dna our results demonstrate translocation of rdh  on dna and extrusion of dna loops by rdh  in an atp hydrolysis dependent manner the translocating rdh  was highly processive and displayed a variety of behavior including variations in translocation rate and distance pauses and reversals we provide evidence that the dna loops generated encompass an average of  kb and rdh  often abruptly releases the extruded dna rdh  forms a multimeric complex which we speculate has at least two functionally distinct dna binding sites one of which enables translocation while the other remains anchored to another dna locale our work together with other recent studies suggests that translocation coupled dna loop extrusion is a common mechanistic feature among the snf family of chromatin remodeling proteins
