functional role of the sarcin  ricin loop of the  s rrna in the elongation cycle of protein synthesis
the sarcin  ricin loop srl is one of the longest conserved sequences in the  s ribosomal rna the srl has been accepted as crucial for the activity of the ribosome because it is targeted by cytotoxins such as  sarcin and ricin that completely abolish translation nevertheless the precise functional role of the srl in translation is not known recent biochemical and structural studies indicate that the srl is critical for triggering gtp hydrolysis on elongation factor tu ef tu and elongation factor g ef g  to determine the functional role of the srl in the elongation stage of protein synthesis we analyzed mutations in the srl that are known to abolish protein synthesis and are lethal to cells here we show that the srl is not critical for gtp hydrolysis on ef tu and ef g the srl also is not essential for peptide bond formation our results instead suggest that the srl is crucial for anchoring ef g on the ribosome during mrna  trna translocation
