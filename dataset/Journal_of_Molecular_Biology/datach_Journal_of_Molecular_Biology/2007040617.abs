kinetics of the intramolecular disulfide exchange between the periplasmic domains of dsbd
dsbd from escherichia coli catalyzes the transport of electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to the periplasmic substrate proteins dsbc dsbg and ccmg dsbd consists of a periplasmic n terminal domain ndsbd  a central transmembrane domain and a periplasmic c terminal domain cdsbd  each of these domains contains two essential cysteine residues that are required for intermolecular disulfide exchange between dsbd and substrates and intramolecular disulfide exchange between the three dsbd domains in order to determine the rate of intramolecular electron transfer from cdsbd to ndsbd we constructed a redox sensitive tryptophan variant of cdsbd cdsbdw that shows an approximately threefold increase in fluorescence upon reduction and has the same redox potential and reactivity as wild type cdsbd cdsbdw was then used for the construction of fusion proteins with ndsbd and cdsbdw connected via flexible linkers of different length using the dsbd substrate dsbc which can only be reduced by ndsbd and does not react with cdsbd we could directly measure the intramolecular electron transfer from cdsndw to ndsbb in the fusion proteins we show that the intramolecular disulfide exchange is significantly faster than the reaction between isolated ndsbd and cdsbd nevertheless the effective concentration of   mm of the domains in the fusions is comaparably low the rate of  s   for the intramolecular disulfide exchange in the fusions was independent of the linker length and may represent the upper limit for the substrate turnover of full length dsbd
