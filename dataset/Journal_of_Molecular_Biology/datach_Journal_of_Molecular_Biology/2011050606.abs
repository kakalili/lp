simple rules for efficient assembly predict the layout of a packaged viral rna
single stranded rna ssrna viruses which include major human pathogens package their genomes as they assemble their capsids we show here that the organization of the viral genomes within the capsids provides intriguing insights into the highly cooperative nature of the assembly process a recent cryo electron microscopy structure of bacteriophage ms  determined with only  fold symmetry averaging has revealed the asymmetric distribution of its encapsidated genome here we show that this rna distribution is consistent with an assembly mechanism that follows two simple rules derived from experiment   the binding of the ms maturation protein to the rna constrains its conformation into a loop and   the capsid must be built in an energetically favorable way these results provide a new level of insight into the factors that drive efficient assembly of ssrna viruses in vivo
