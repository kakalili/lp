concerted evolution between duplicated genetic elements in helicobacter pylori edited by j miller
the helicobacter pylori genome includes a family of outer membrane proteins omps with substantial n and c terminal identity to better understand their evolution the nucleotide sequences for two members baba and babb were determined from a worldwide group of  strains the geographic origin of each strain was found to be the major determinant of phylogenetic structure with strains of eastern and western origin showing greatest divergence for strains    japan and    usa  the   regions of babb are replaced with baba sequences demonstrating that recombination occurs between the two loci baba and babb have nearly equivalent variation in nucleotide and amino acid identity and frequencies of synonymous and non synonymous substitutions both genes have segmental conservation but within the   segment substitution patterns are nearly identical although baba and babb   and midregion segment phylogenies show strong interstrain similarity the   segments show strong intrastrain similarity indicative of concerted evolution within these   segments the lower intrastrain than interstrain frequencies of nucleotide substitutions which are below mean background h pylori substitution frequencies indicate selection against intrastrain diversification since baba babb gene conversions likely underlie the concerted evolution of the   segments in an experimental system we demonstrate that gene conversions can frequently     occur in h pylori that these events are reca dependent and dnase resistant indicates their likely cause is intragenomic recombination
