influence of internal dna pressure on stability and infectivity of phage
viruses must remain infectious while in harsh extracellular environments an important aspect of viral particle stability for double stranded dna viruses is the energetically unfavorable state of the tightly confined dna chain within the virus capsid creating pressures of tens of atmospheres here we study the influence of internal genome pressure on the thermal stability of viral particles using differential scanning calorimetry to monitor genome loss upon heating we find that internal pressure destabilizes the virion resulting in a smaller activation energy barrier to trigger dna release these experiments are complemented by plaque assay and electron microscopy measurements to determine the influence of intra capsid dna pressure on the rates of viral infectivity loss at higher temperatures      c  failure to retain the packaged genome is the dominant mechanism of viral inactivation conversely at lower temperatures      c  a separate inactivation mechanism dominates which results in non infectious particles that still retain their packaged dna most significantly both mechanisms of infectivity loss are directly influenced by internal dna pressure with higher pressure resulting in a more rapid rate of inactivation at all temperatures
