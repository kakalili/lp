structure of a phage display derived variant of human growth hormone complexed to two copies of the extracellular domain of its receptor evidence for strong structural coupling between receptor binding sites edited by i a wilson
the structure of the ternary complex between the phage display optimized high affinity site  variant of human growth hormone hgh and two copies of the extracellular domain ecd of the hgh receptor hghr has been determined at    resolution there are widespread and significant structural differences compared to the wild type ternary hgh hghr complex the hgh variant hghv contains  site  mutations and binds gt   tighter to the hghr ecd hghr  at site  it is biologically active and specific to hghr the hghv site  interface is somewhat smaller and   more hydrophobic compared to the wild type wt counterpart of the ten hormone receptor h bonds in the site only one is the same as in the wt complex additionally several regions of hghv structure move up to   in forming the interface the contacts between the c terminal domains of two receptor ecds hghr hghr  are conserved however the large changes in site  appear to cause global changes in the domains of hghr that affect the hghv hghr interface indirectly this coupling is manifested by large changes in the conformation of groups participating in the site  interaction and results in a structure for the site that is reorganized extensively the hghv hghr interface contains seven h bonds only one of which is found in the wt complex several groups on hghv and hghr undergo conformational changes of up to    asp  of hghv plays a central role in the reorganization of site  by forming two new h bonds to the side chains of trp  r and trp  r  which are the key binding determinants of the receptor the fact that a different binding solution is possible for site  where there were no mutations or binding selection pressures indicates that the structural elements found in these molecules possess an inherent functional plasticity that enables them to bind to a wide variety of binding surfaces
