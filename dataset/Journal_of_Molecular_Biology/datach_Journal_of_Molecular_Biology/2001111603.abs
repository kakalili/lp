folding properties of the nucleotide exchange factor grpe from thermus thermophilus grpe is a thermosensor that mediates heat shock response  edited by a r fersht
hsp  proteins like dnak bind unfolded polypeptides in a nucleotide dependent manner the switch from high affinity adp state to low affinity atp state with concomitant substrate release is accelerated significantly by grpe proteins grpe thus fulfils an important role in regulation of the chaperone cycle here we analysed the thermal stability of grpe from thermus thermophilus using differential scanning calorimetry and cd spectroscopy the protein exhibits unusual unfolding characteristics with two observable thermal transitions the first transition is cd spectroscopically silent with a transition midpoint at   c the second transition mainly constituting the cd signal ranges between   and    c depending on the grpetth concentration according to the model n   i   u using a c terminally truncated version of grpetth it was possible to assign the second thermal transition to the dimerisation of grpetth while the first transition represents the completely reversible unfolding of the globular c terminal domain the unfolding of this domain is accompanied by a distinct decrease in nucleotide exchange rates and impaired binding to dnaktth under heat shock conditions the dnak adp protein substrate complex is thus stabilised by a reversibly inactivated grpe protein that refolds under permissive conditions in combination with studies on grpe from escherichia coli presented recently by christen and co workers it thus appears that the general role of grpe is to function as a thermosensor that modulates nucleotide exchange rates in a temperature dependent manner to prevent substrate dissociation at non permissive conditions
