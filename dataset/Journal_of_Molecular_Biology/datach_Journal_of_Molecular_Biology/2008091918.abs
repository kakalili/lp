the solution structure of the c terminal modular pair from clostridium perfringens  toxin reveals a noncellulosomal dockerin module
the genome of the opportunistic pathogen clostridium perfringens encodes a large number of secreted glycoside hydrolases their predicted activities indicate that they are involved in the breakdown of complex carbohydrates and other glycans found in the mucosal layer of the human gastrointestinal tract within the extracellular matrix and on the surface of host cells one such group of these enzymes is the family  glycoside hydrolases which has predicted hyaluronidase activity and comprises five members c perfringens glycoside hydrolase family   cpgh  a  e  the first identified member cpgh a corresponds to the  toxin whose modular architecture includes an n terminal catalytic domain four family  carbohydrate binding modules three fivar modules of unknown function and a c terminal putative calcium binding module here we report the solution nmr structure of the c terminal modular pair from the  toxin the three helix bundle fivar module displays structural homology to a heparin binding module within the n terminal of the a c protein from group b streptoccocus the c terminal module has a typical calcium binding dockerin fold comprising two anti parallel helices that form a planar face with ef hand calcium binding loops at opposite ends of the module the size of the helical face of the  toxin dockerin module is approximately equal to the planar region recently identified on the surface of a cohesin like x  module of cpgh c size exclusion chromatography and heteronuclear nmr based chemical shift mapping studies indicate that the helical face of the dockerin module recognizes the cpgh c x  module these studies represent the structural characterization of a noncellulolytic dockerin module and its interaction with a cohesin like x  module dockerin x  mediated enzyme complexes may have important implications in the pathogenic properties of c perfringens
