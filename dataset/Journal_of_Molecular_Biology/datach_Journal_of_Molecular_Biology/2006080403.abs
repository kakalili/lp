structural basis for phosphotyrosine recognition by the src homology  domains of the adapter proteins sh b and aps
sh b aps and lnk constitute a family of adapter proteins that modulate signaling by protein tyrosine kinases these adapters contain an n terminal dimerization region a pleckstrin homology domain and a c terminal src homology  sh  domain sh b is recruited via its sh domain to various protein tyrosine kinases including janus kinase  jak  and the insulin receptor here we present the crystal structure at     resolution of the sh domain of sh b in complex with a phosphopeptide representing the sh b recruitment site in jak  ptyr   the structure reveals a canonical sh domain phosphopeptide binding mode but with specific recognition of a glutamate at the  position relative to phosphotyrosine in addition to recognition of a hydrophobic residue at the  position biochemical studies of sh b and aps demonstrate that although the sh domains of these two adapter proteins share   sequence identity the sh b sh domain binds preferentially to jak  whereas the aps sh domain has higher affinity for the insulin receptor this differential specificity is attributable to the difference in the oligomeric states of the two sh domains monomeric for sh b and dimeric for aps
