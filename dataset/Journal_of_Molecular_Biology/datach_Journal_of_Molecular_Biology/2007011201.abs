mutational patterns associated with the  insertion complex in multi drug resistant hiv  reverse transcriptase that confer increased excision activity and high level resistance to zidovudine
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  strains having dipeptide insertions in the fingers subdomain and other drug resistance related mutations scattered throughout their reverse transcriptase rt coding region show high level resistance to zidovudine azt and other nucleoside analogues those phenotypic effects have been correlated with their increased atp dependent phosphorolytic activity on chain terminated primers mutations t s and t  y and a dipeptide insertion i e ser ser between positions  and  are required to achieve low level resistance to thymidine analogues however additional amino acid substitutions are necessary to achieve the high level phenotypic resistance to azt shown by clinical hiv isolates carrying a dipeptide insertion in their rt coding region in order to identify those mutations that contribute to resistance in the sequence context of an insertion containing rt derived from an hiv clinical isolate designated as ss rt  we expressed and purified a series of chimeric enzymes containing portions of the wild type or ss rt sequences atp mediated excision activity measurements using azt and stavudine d t terminated primers and phenotypic assays showed that molecular determinants of high level resistance to azt were located in the fingers subdomain of the polymerase further studies using recombinant rts obtained by site directed mutagenesis revealed that m l a v and in a lesser extent k r were the key mutations that together with t s t  y and the dipeptide insertion conferred high levels of atp dependent phosphorolytic activity on azt and d t terminated primers excision activity correlated well with azt susceptibility measurements and was consistent with phenotypic resistance to d t structural analysis of the location of the implicated amino acid substitutions revealed a coordinated effect of m l and a v on the positioning of the      hairpin loop which plays a key role in the resistance mechanism
