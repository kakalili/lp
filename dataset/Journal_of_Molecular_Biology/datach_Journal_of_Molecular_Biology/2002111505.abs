co evolutionary analysis reveals insights into protein  protein interactions
protein  protein interactions play crucial roles in biological processes experimental methods have been developed to survey the proteome for interacting partners and some computational approaches have been developed to extend the impact of these experimental methods computational methods are routinely applied to newly discovered genes to infer protein function and plausible protein  protein interactions here we develop and extend a quantitative method that identifies interacting proteins based upon the correlated behavior of the evolutionary histories of protein ligands and their receptors we have studied six families of ligand  receptor pairs including the syntaxin unc  family the gpcr g  s the tgf  tgf  receptor system the immunity colicin domain collection from bacteria the chemokine chemokine receptors and the vegf vegf receptor family for correlation scores above a defined threshold we were able to find an average of   of all known binding partners we then applied this method to find plausible binding partners for proteins with uncharacterized binding specificities in the syntaxin unc  protein and tgf  tgf  receptor families analysis of the results shows that co evolutionary analysis of interacting protein families can reduce the search space for identifying binding partners by not only finding binding partners for uncharacterized proteins but also recognizing potentially new binding partners for previously characterized proteins we believe that correlated evolutionary histories provide a route to exploit the wealth of whole genome sequences and recent systematic proteomic results to extend the impact of these studies and focus experimental efforts to categorize physiologically or pathologically relevant protein  protein interactions
