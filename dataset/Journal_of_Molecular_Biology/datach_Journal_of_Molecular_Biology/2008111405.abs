crystal structure of the escherichia coli  s rrna m c methyltransferase rlmi yccw reveals evolutionary links between rna modification enzymes
methylation is the most common rna modification in the three domains of life transfer of the methyl group from s adenosyl l methionine adomet to specific atoms of rna nucleotides is catalyzed by methyltransferase mtase enzymes the rrna mtase rlmi rrna large subunit methyltransferase gene i previously known as yccw specifically modifies escherichia coli  s rrna at nucleotide c   to form  methylcytosine here we report the crystal structure of rlmi refined at    to a final r factor of    rfree     the rlmi molecule comprises three domains the n terminal pua domain the central domain which resembles a domain previously found in rna  methyluridine mtases and the c terminal catalytic domain which contains the adomet binding site the central and c terminal domains are linked by a  hairpin structure that has previously been observed in several mtases acting on nucleic acids or proteins based on bioinformatics analyses we propose a model for the rlmi  adomet  rna complex comparative structural analyses of rlmi and its homologs provide insight into the potential function of several structures that have been solved by structural genomics groups and furthermore indicate that the evolutionary paths of rna and dna  methyluridine and  methylcytosine mtases have been closely intertwined
