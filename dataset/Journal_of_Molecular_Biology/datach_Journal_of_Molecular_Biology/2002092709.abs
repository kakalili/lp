efficient folding of the fc ri  chain membrane proximal domain d depends on the presence of the n terminal domain d
human high affinity receptor for ige is a membrane glycoprotein multichain complex presenting two extracellular ig modules in its  chain d d  the receptor ige binding region is located within the membrane proximal module d  while the n terminal module d appears to promote an optimal receptor conformation for ige binding to understand the structural relationship between the two modules we dissected fc ri  chain into its discrete ig units and expressed them in mammalian cells unexpectedly d was secreted as a disulphide linked dimer while d was monomeric active secretion and full glycosylation of dimeric d suggest a native like conformation of the protein justifying the escape from the endoplasmic reticulum golgi quality control systems we then propose a domain swapping model for d  in which two interdigitated polypeptide chains assume the overall conformation of two ig modules as observed for rat cd n terminal domain fusion of an unrelated ig fold moiety at the n terminus of d did not interfere with its dimerisation while d d assumes a correct fold co expression of both isolated domains in the same cell did not restore monomeric folding of d  thus d appears to assist the appropriate folding of fc ri  chain acting as an uncleavable intramolecular chaperone like block towards d
