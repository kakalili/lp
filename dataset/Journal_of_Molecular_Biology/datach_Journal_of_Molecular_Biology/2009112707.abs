the  s proteasome as an assembly platform for the  s regulatory complex
s proteasomes consist of cylindrical  s proteasomes with  s regulatory complexes attached to the ends treatment with high concentrations of salt causes the regulatory complexes to separate into two sub complexes the base which is in contact with the  s proteasome and the lid which is the distal part of the  s complex here we describe two assembly intermediates of the human regulatory complex one is a dimer of the two atpase subunits rpt and rpt  the other is a complex of nascent rpn  rpn  rpn  rpn  and txnl  attached to preexisting  s proteasomes this early assembly complex does not yet contain rpn or any of the atpase subunits of the base thus assembly of  s regulatory complexes takes place on preexisting  s proteasomes and part of the lid is assembled before the base
