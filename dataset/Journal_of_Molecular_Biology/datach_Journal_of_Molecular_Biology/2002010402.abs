helices vii and x in the lactose permease of escherichia coli proximity and ligand induced distance changes edited by i b holland
by using functional lactose permease devoid of native cys residues with a discontinuity in the periplasmic loop between helices vii and viii n c split permease  cross linking between engineered paired cys residues in helices vii and x was studied with the homobifunctional thiol specific cross linkers   methanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate     n n  o phenylenedimaleimide    and n n  p phenylenedimaleimide     mutant asp    cys helix vii lys    cys helix x cross links most efficiently with the   reagent providing direct support for studies indicating that asp  and lys  are in close proximity and charge paired furthermore cross linking the two positions inactivates the protein other cys residues more disposed towards the middle of helix vii cross link to cys residues in the approximate middle of helix x while no cross linking is evident with paired cys residues at the periplasmic or cytoplasmic ends of these helices thus helices vii and x are in close proximity in the middle of the membrane in the presence of ligand the distance between cys residues at positions   helice vii and   helix x increases in contrast the distance between paired cys residues more disposed towards the cytoplasmic face of the membrane decreases in a manner suggesting that ligand binding induces a scissors like movement between the two helices the results are consistent with a recently proposed mechanism for lactose h symport in which substrate binding induces a conformational change between helices vii and x during transfer of h from his   helix x glu   helix viii to glu   helix x
