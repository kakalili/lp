conformation of prpc on the cell surface as probed by antibodies
we have investigated the conformation of syrian hamster prpc on the surface of transfected cho cells by performing cross competition experiments between a set of nine monoclonal antibody fragments fab directed to defined epitopes throughout the protein no competition was observed between antibodies recognizing epitopes located within the unstructured n terminal portion of prpc and those recognizing epitopes located within the ordered c terminal half of the molecule however competition was observed between antibodies recognizing overlapping epitopes and between antibodies recognizing epitopes lying adjacent to one another in the prp sequence titrating the reactivity of each fab against cell surface prpc revealed a clear heterogeneity in the accessibility of different specific epitopes fab d  recognizing sequence incorporating the first  helix of prpc bound the largest fraction of the cell surface prp population in contrast fab e   binding an epitope at the extreme n terminus of prp and fab  a  binding an epitope in the central region of prp were able to recognize fewer than half the number of prpc molecules bound by fab d  the pattern of antibody reactivity we observed may in part result from n terminal truncation of a proportion of prpc molecules found at the cell surface however truncation cannot account for the marked disparity between exposure of the fab d  and  a epitopes which lie adjacent in the prp sequence the relative inaccessibility of the  a epitope likely reflects either prpc  prpc interaction interaction between prpc and other constituents on the cell membrane or the existence of prpc subspecies with distinct conformations
