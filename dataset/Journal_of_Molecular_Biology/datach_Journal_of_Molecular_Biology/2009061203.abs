knockdown of human cox  affects assembly and supramolecular organization of cytochrome c oxidase
assembly of cytochrome c oxidase the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain requires a concerted activity of a number of chaperones and factors for the insertion of subunits accessory proteins cofactors and prosthetic groups it is now well accepted that the multienzyme complexes of the respiratory chain are organized in vivo as supramolecular functional structures so called supercomplexes here we investigate the role of cox  in the biogenesis of the respiratory chain in hela cells in accordance with its predicted function as a copper chaperone and its role in formation of the binuclear copper centre of cytochrome c oxidase cox  sirna knockdown affects activity and assembly of cytochrome c oxidase while the abundance of cytochrome c oxidase dimers seems to be unaffected blue native gel electrophoresis reveals the disappearance of cox containing supercomplexes as an early response we observe the accumulation of a novel     kda complex that contains cox  but not cox  this observation may indicate that the absence of cox  interferes with copper delivery to cox  but not to cox  we suggest that supercomplex formation is not simply due to assembly of completely assembled complexes an interdependent assembly scenario for the formation of supercomplexes that rather requires the coordinated synthesis and association of individual complexes is proposed
