dynamic regulatory interactions of rad  rad  and replication protein a in recombination intermediates
rad  rad  and replication protein a rpa play crucial roles in the repair of dna double strand breaks in saccharomyces cerevisiae rad  mediates dna strand exchange a key reaction in dna recombination rad  recruits rad  into single stranded dnas ssdnas that are saturated with rpa rad  also promotes annealing of ssdna strands that are complexed with rpa specific protein  protein interactions are involved in these reactions here we report new biochemical characteristics of these protein interactions first rad   rpa interaction requires multiple molecules of rpa to be associated with ssdna suggesting that multiple contacts between the rad  ring and rpa  ssdna filament are needed for stable binding second rpa t  which is a recombination deficient mutant of rpa displays a defect in interacting with rad  in the presence of salt above   mm explaining the defect in rad  mediated ssdna annealing in the presence of this mutation third ssdna annealing promoted by rad  is preceded by aggregation of multiple rpa  ssdna complexes with rad  and rad  inhibits this aggregation these results suggest a regulatory role for rad  that suppresses ssdna annealing and facilitates dna strand invasion finally the rad   double stranded dna complex disrupts rad   rpa interaction in ssdna and titrates rad  from rpa this suggests an additional regulatory role for rad  following dna strand invasion where rad   double stranded dna may inhibit illegitimate second end capture to ensure the error free repair of a dna double strand break
