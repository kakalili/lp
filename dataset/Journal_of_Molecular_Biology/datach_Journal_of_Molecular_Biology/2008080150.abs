crystal structure of the c terminal domain of a flagellar hook capping protein from xanthomonas campestris
the crystal structure of the c terminal domain of a hook capping protein flgd from the plant pathogen xanthomonas campestris xc has been determined to a resolution of ca     using x ray crystallography the monomer of whole flgd comprises   amino acids with a molecular mass of    kda but the flexible n terminus is cleaved for up to  residues during crystallization the final structure of the c terminal domain reveals a novel hybrid comprising a tudor like domain interdigitated with a fibronectin type iii domain the c terminal domain of xcflgd forms three types of dimers in the crystal in agreement with this analytical ultracentrifugation and gel filtration experiments reveal that they form a stable dimer in solution from these results we propose that the xc flagellar hook cap protein flgd comprises two individual domains a flexible n terminal domain that cannot be detected in the current study and a stable c terminal domain that forms a stable dimer
