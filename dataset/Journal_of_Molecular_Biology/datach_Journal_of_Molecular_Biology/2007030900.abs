structural characterisation of the insecticidal toxin xpta  reveals a    mda tetramer with a cage like structure
a recently identified class of proteins conferring insecticidal activity to several bacteria within the enterobacteriaceae family have potential for control of commercially important insect pests here we report the first purification biophysical characterisation and  d structural analysis of one of the toxin components xpta  from xenorhabdus nematophila pmfi  to a resolution of     membrane binding studies indicate that the three component toxin system has a different mode of action from that of proteins from bacillus thuringiensis bt  biophysical characterisation of xpta suggests a mechanism of action of xpta whereby it first binds to the cell membrane forming a structure with a central cavity and forms a complex with its partners xptb and xptc producing the full insecticidal toxin the structure of xpta is shown by a combination of electron microscopy ultracentrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy to be a   mda tetramer with a cage like structure each of the four symmetry related subunits has three well defined domains and a longitudinal twist with one end narrower than the other one third of the residues of xpta are  helical and it is suggested the subunits associate partly via an  helical coiled coil interaction xpta itself shows the same secondary structure at neutral ph and in an alkaline environment up to ph   this ph tolerance indicates that the folded xpta can pass through the midgut of lepidopteran insects susceptible to the insecticidal toxin complex this implies therefore that its folded structure is important for its biological activity
