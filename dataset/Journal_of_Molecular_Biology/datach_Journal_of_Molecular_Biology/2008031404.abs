an scfv intrabody against the nonamyloid component of  synuclein reduces intracellular aggregation and toxicity
prevention of abnormal misfolding and aggregation of  synuclein syn protein in vulnerable neurons should be viable therapeutic strategies for reducing pathogenesis in parkinson s disease the nonamyloid component nac region of  syn shows strong tendencies to form  sheet structures and deletion of this region has been shown to reduce aggregation and toxicity in vitro and in vivo the binding of a molecular species to this region may mimic the effects of such deletions single chain variable fragment scfv antibodies retain the binding specificity of antibodies and when genetically manipulated to create high diversity libraries allow in vitro selection against peptides accordingly we used a yeast surface display library of an entire na ve repertoire of human scfv antibodies to select for binding to a nac peptide candidate scfv antibodies after transfer to mammalian expression vectors were screened for viability in a neuronal cell line by transient cotransfection with a t mutant  syn this provided a ranking of the protective efficacies of the initial panel of intracellular antibodies intrabodies  high steady state expression levels and apparent conformational epitope binding appeared more important than in vitro affinity in these assays none of the scfv antibodies selected matched the sequences of previously reported anti  syn scfv antibodies a stable cell line expressing the most effective intrabody nac  showed highly significant reductions in abnormal aggregation in two separate models recently intrabodies have shown promising antiaggregation and neuroprotective effects against misfolded mutant huntingtin protein the nac  study extends such work significantly by utilizing information about the pathogenic capacity of a specific  syn region to offer a new generation of in vitro derived antibody fragments both for further engineering as direct therapeutics and as a tool for rational drug design for parkinson s disease
