design characterization and structure of a biologically active single chain mutant of human ifn   edited by i a wilson
a mutant form of human interferon   ifn  sc  that binds one ifn  receptor  chain ifn  r  has been designed and characterized ifn  sc was derived by linking the two peptide chains of the ifn  dimer by a seven residue linker and changing his  in the first chain to an aspartic acid residue isothermal titration calorimetry shows that ifn  sc forms a   complex with its high affinity receptor ifn  r  with an affinity of     nm the crystal structure of ifn  sc has been determined at    resolution from crystals grown in   m citrate solutions at ph   comparison of the wild type receptor binding domain and the asp  containing domain of ifn  sc show that they are structurally equivalent but have very different electrostatic surface potentials as a result surface charge rather than structural changes is likely responsible for the inability of the his    asp domain of to bind ifn  r  the ab loops of ifn  sc adopt conformations similar to the ordered loops of ifn  observed in the crystal structure of the ifn  ifn  r  complex thus ifn  r  binding does not result in a large conformational change in the ab loop as previously suggested the structure also reveals the final six c terminal amino acid residues of ifn  sc  residues      that have not been observed in any other reported ifn  structures despite binding to only one ifn  r  ifn  sc is biologically active in cell proliferation mhc class i induction and anti viral assays this suggests that one domain of ifn  is sufficient to recruit ifn  r  and ifn  r  into a complex competent for eliciting biological activity the current data are consistent with the main role of the ifn  dimer being to decrease the dissociation constant of ifn  for its cellular receptors
