nmr structure of the bank vole prion protein at    c contains a structured loop of residues
the recent introduction of bank vole clethrionomys glareolus as an additional laboratory animal for research on prion diseases revealed an important difference when compared to the mouse and the syrian hamster since bank voles show a high susceptibility to infection by brain homogenates from a wide range of diseased species such as sheep goats and humans in this context we determined the nmr structure of the c terminal globular domain of the recombinant bank vole prion protein bvprp  bvprp       at    c bvprp      has the same overall architecture as other mammalian prps with three  helices and an antiparallel  sheet but it differs from prp of the mouse and most other mammalian species in that the loop connecting the second  strand and helix   is precisely defined at    c this is similar to the previously described structures of elk prp and the designed mouse prp mprp variant mprp s  n n  t       whereas syrian hamster prp displays a structure that is in between these limiting cases studies with the newly designed variant mprp s  n       which contains the same loop sequence as bvprp now also showed that the single amino acid substitution s  n in mprp is sufficient for obtaining a well defined loop thus providing the rationale for this local structural feature in bvprp
