crystal structures of paenibacillus polymyxa  glucosidase b complexes reveal the molecular basis of substrate specificity and give new insights into the catalytic machinery of family i glycosidases
bacteria species involved in degradation of cellulosic substrates produce a variety of enzymes for processing related compounds along the hydrolytic pathway paenibacillus polymyxa encodes two homologous  glucosidases bgla and bglb presenting different quaternary structures and substrate specificities we previously reported the d structure of bgla which is highly specific against cellobiose here we present structural analysis of bglb a monomeric enzyme that acts as an exo  glucosidase hydrolyzing cellobiose and cellodextrins of higher degree of polymerization the crystal structure of bglb shows that several polar residues narrow the active site pocket and contour additional subsites the structure of the bglb  cellotetraose complex confirms these subsites revealing the substrate binding mode and shows the oligosaccharide enzyme recognition pattern in detail comparison between bgla and bglb crystal structures suggests that oligomerization in bgla can assist in fine tuning the specificity of the active centre by modulating the loops surrounding the cavity we have solved the crystal structure of bglb with bound thiocellobiose a competitive inhibitor which together with the bglb  cellotetraose complex delineate the general features of the aglycon site the detailed characterization of the atomic interactions at the aglycon site show a recognition pattern common to all bacterial  glucosidases and presents some differences with the aglycon site in plant  glycosidases essentially by means of a different orientation of the basal trp the crystal structures of of bglb with a covalently bound inhibitor derived from  fluoroglucoside and glucose produced by hydrolysis of the substrate in the crystal  provide additional pictures of the binding events and the intermediates formed during the reaction altogether this information can assist in the understanding of subtle differences of the enzyme mechanism and substrate recognition within this family of enzymes and consequently it can help in the development of new enzymes with improved activity or specificity
