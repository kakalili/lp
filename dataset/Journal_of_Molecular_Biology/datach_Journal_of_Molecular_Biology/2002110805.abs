negative autoregulation speeds the response times of transcription networks
cells regulate gene expression using networks of transcription interactions it is of interest to discover the principles that govern the dynamical behavior of such networks an important characteristic of these systems is the rise time the delay from the initiation of production until half maximal product concentration is reached here we employ synthetic gene circuits in escherichia coli to measure the rise times of non self regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units non self regulated units have a rise time of one cell cycle we demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback also termed autogenous control reduces the rise time to about one fifth of a cell cycle this agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation this may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation which appears in over   of known transcription factors in e coli
