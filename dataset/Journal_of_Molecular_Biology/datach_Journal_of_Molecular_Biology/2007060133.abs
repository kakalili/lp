sequence determinants of e e ap binding affinity and specificity
the conjugation of ubiquitin to substrates requires a series of enzymatic reactions consisting of an activating enzyme e  conjugating enzymes e  and ligases e  tagging the appropriate substrate with ubiquitin is achieved by specific e  e and e  substrate interactions e ap a member of the hect family of e s has been previously shown to bind and function with the e s ubch and ubch  to decipher the sequence determinants of this specificity we have developed a quantitative e  e binding assay based on fluorescence polarization and used this assay to measure the affinity of wild type and mutant e  e ap interactions alanine scanning of the e ap  ubch binding interface identified four side chains on ubch and six side chains on e ap that contribute more than  kcal mol to the binding free energy two of the hot spot residues from ubch  k  and k   are conserved in ubch but vary across other e s to determine if these are key specificity determining residues we attempted to induce a tighter association between the e ubch b and e ap by mutating the corresponding positions in ubch b to lysine residues surprisingly the mutations had little effect but rather a mutation at ubch position  which is not at a hot spot on the ubch  e ap interface significantly strengthened ubch bs affinity for e ap this result indicates that e  e binding specificities are a function of both favorable interactions that promote binding and unfavorable interactions that prevent binding with unwanted partners
