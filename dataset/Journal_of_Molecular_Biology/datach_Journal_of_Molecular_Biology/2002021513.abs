engineered improvements in dna binding function of the mata homeodomain reveal structural changes involved in combinatorial control edited by p e wright
we have engineered enhanced dna binding function into the a homeodomain by making changes in a loop distant from the dna binding surface comparison of the free and bound a structures suggested a mechanism linking van der waals stacking changes in this loop to the ordering of a final turn in the dna binding helix of a  inspection of the protein sequence revealed striking differences in amino acid identity at positions  and  compared to related homeodomain proteins these positions lie in the loop connecting helix  and helix  which is involved in heterodimerization with the   protein a series of single and double amino acid substitutions a q r a s y a s f and a q r s y were engineered expressed and purified for biochemical and biophysical study calorimetric measurements and hsqc nmr spectra confirm that the engineered variants are folded and are equally or more stable than the wild type a homeodomain nmr analysis of a q r s y demonstrates that the dna recognition helix helix  is extended by at least one turn as a result of the changes in the loop connecting helix  and helix  as shown by emsa the engineered variants bind dna with enhanced affinity   fold in the absence of the   cofactor and the variant   a heterodimers bind cognate dna with specificity and affinity reflective of the enhanced a binding affinity importantly in vivo assays demonstrate that the a q r s y protein binds with fivefold greater affinity than wild type a and is able to partially suppress defects in repression by   mutants as a result of these studies we show how subtle differences in residues at a surface distant from the functional site code for a conformational switch that allows the a homeodomain to become active in dna binding in association with its cofactor
