episomally driven antisense mrna abrogates the hyperinducible expression and function of a unique cell surface class i nuclease in the primitive trypanosomatid parasite crithidia luciliae
here we show that crithidia luciliae a primitive trypanosomatid purine auxotroph up expressed its unique bi functional surface membrane   nucleotidase nuclease cl   nt nu activity by     fold in response to purine starvation a second surface membrane phospho monoesterase i e a tartrate resistant acid phosphatase cl macp was also found to be up expressed in such purine starved cells here we used homologous episomal expression of an antisense construct of the cl  nt nu to dissect the functional expression of these two surface membrane enzymes in antisense transfected cells a large excess of the antisense transcript was produced and no trace of any endogenous cl  nt nu sense message was detected further the purine starvation hyper induced levels of   nt nu enzyme activity were completely abrogated in these transfected cells versus controls moreover such antisense transcription completely abolished the ability of these transfectants to grow in poly a containing medium demonstrating the essential nature of the   nt nu for the growth survival of this parasite in contrast antisense transcription had no apparent deleterious effects on either endogenous or purine starvation induced levels of macp enzyme activity its steady state mrna levels or the constitutive expression of house keeping genes e g cl  tubulin in these transfectants cumulatively results of our antisense experiments demonstrated that the functional nuclease activity of the surface membrane cl   nt nu was in fact critical essential for the growth and development of these primitive parasites
