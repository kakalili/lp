a functional role for a flexible loop containing glu  in the class ii fructose   bisphosphate aldolase from escherichia coli edited by d rees
class ii fructose   bisphosphate aldolases fbp aldolases catalyse the zinc dependent reversible aldol condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap and glyceraldehyde  phosphate g p to form fructose   bisphosphate fbp  analysis of the structure of the enzyme from escherichia coli in complex with a transition state analogue phosphoglycolohydroxamate pgh suggested that substrate binding caused a conformational change in the     loop of the enzyme and that this caused the relocation of two glutamate residues glu  and glu   into the proximity of the active site site directed mutagenesis of these two glutamate residues e  a and e  a along with another active site glutamate glu   was carried out and the mutant enzymes characterised using steady state kinetics mutation of glu   e  a resulted in an enzyme which was severely crippled in catalysis in agreement with its position as a zinc ligand in the enzyme  s structure the e  a mutant showed the same properties as the wild type enzyme indicating that the residue played no major role in substrate binding or enzyme catalysis in contrast mutation of glu   e  a demonstrated that glu  is important in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme furthermore the measurement of deuterium kinetic isotope effects using  s  h dhap showed that for the wild type enzyme proton abstraction was not the rate determining step whereas in the case of the e  a mutant this step had become rate limiting providing evidence for the role of glu  in abstraction of the c proton from dhap in the condensation direction of the reaction glu  lies in a loop of polypeptide which contains four glycine residues gly   gly   gly  and gly   and a quadruple mutant where each glycine was converted to alanine showed that flexibility of this loop was important for the correct functioning of the enzyme probably to change the microenvironment of glu  in order to perturb its pka to a value suitable for its role in proton abstraction these results highlight the need for further studies of the dynamics of the enzyme in order to fully understand the complexities of loop closure and catalysis in this enzyme
