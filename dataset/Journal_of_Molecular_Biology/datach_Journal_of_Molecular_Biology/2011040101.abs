association of the disordered c terminus of cdc  with a catalytically bound ubiquitin
cell division cycle protein   cdc  is a key e ubiquitin ub conjugating enzyme responsible for the polyubiquitination of proteins controlling the g s stages of cell division the acidic c terminus of the enzyme is required for this function although there is little structural information providing details for a mechanism one logical time point involving the c terminus is the cdc   ub thiolester complex that precedes ub transfer to a substrate to examine this we used a cdc   ub disulfide complex that structurally mimics the thiolester intermediate nmr spectroscopy was used to show that the cdc  c terminus is disordered but can intramolecularly interact with the catalytically bound ub using chemical shift perturbation analysis we mapped two interacting regions on the surface of ub in the cdc   ub complex the first site comprises a hydrophobic patch typical of other ub complexes that associates with the cdc  catalytic domain a novel second site dependent on the c terminus of cdc  comprises a lysine rich surface k  k  k  and k  on the opposite face of ub further nmr experiments show that this interaction is described by two slowly exchanging states  a compact conformation where the c terminus of cdc  interacts with bound ub and an extended structure where the c terminus is released this work provides the first structural details that show how the c terminus of cdc  might direct a thiolester bound ub to control polyubiquitin chain formation
