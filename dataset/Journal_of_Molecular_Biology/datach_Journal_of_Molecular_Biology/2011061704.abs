asymmetric assembly of merkel cell polyomavirus large t antigen origin binding domains at the viral origin
the double stranded dna polyomavirus merkel cell polyomavirus mcv causes merkel cell carcinoma an aggressive but rare human skin cancer that most often affects immunosuppressed and elderly persons as in other polyomaviruses the large t antigen of mcv recognizes the viral origin of replication by binding repeating g a g ggc pentamers the spacing number orientation and necessity of repeats for viral replication differ however from other family members such as sv  and murine polyomavirus we report here the    crystal structure of the mcv large t antigen origin binding domain obd in complex with a dna fragment from the mcv origin of replication consistent with replication data showing that three of the g a g ggc like binding sites near the center of the origin are required for replication the crystal structure contains three copies of the obd this stoichiometry was verified using isothermal titration calorimetry the affinity for g a g ggc containing double stranded dna was found to be     nm approximately  fold weaker than the equivalent domain in sv  for the analogous region of the sv  origin the difference in affinity is partially attributable to dna binding residue lys   arg  in sv   in contrast to sv  a small protein  protein interface is observed between mcv obds when bound to the central region of the origin this protein  protein interface is reminiscent of that seen in bovine papilloma virus e protein mutational analysis indicates however that this interface contributes little to dna binding energy
