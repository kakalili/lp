sugar binding sites of the ha subcomponent of clostridium botulinum type c progenitor toxin
clostridium botulinum type c  s progenitor toxin contains a hemagglutinin ha subcomponent designated ha  which appears to play an important role in the effective internalization of the toxin in gastrointestinal epithelial cells and in creating a broad specificity for the oligosaccharide structure that corresponds to various targets in this study using the recombinant protein fused to glutathione s transferase we investigated the binding specificity of the ha subcomponent to sugars and estimated the binding sites of ha based on x ray crystallography and soaking experiments using various sugars n acetylneuraminic acid n acetylgalactosamine and galactose effectively inhibited the binding that occurs between glutathione s transferase  ha and mucins whereas n acetylglucosamine and glucose did not inhibit it the crystal structures of ha complex with n acetylneuraminic acid n acetylgalactosamine and galactose were also determined there are two sugar binding sites sites i and ii site i corresponds to the electron densities noted for all sugars and is located at the c terminal  trefoil domain while site ii corresponds to the electron densities noted only for galactose an aromatic amino acid residue trp   at site i has a stacking interaction with the hexose ring of the sugars on the other hand there is no aromatic residue at site ii thus the interaction with galactose seems to be poor the double mutant w  a at site i and d  f at site ii has no avidity for n acetylneuraminic acid but has avidity for galactose in this report the binding specificity of botulinum c s toxin ha to various sugars is demonstrated based on its structural features
