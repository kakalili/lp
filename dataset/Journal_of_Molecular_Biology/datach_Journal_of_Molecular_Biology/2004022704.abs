a dissection of specific and non specific protein  protein interfaces
we compare the geometric and physical  chemical properties of interfaces involved in specific and non specific protein  protein interactions in crystal structures reported in the protein data bank specific interactions are illustrated by  protein  protein complexes and by subunit contacts in   homodimeric proteins non specific interactions are illustrated by   pairs of monomeric proteins making crystal packing contacts selected to bury more than    of protein surface a majority of these pairs have  fold symmetry and form  crystal dimers  that cannot be distinguished from real dimers on the basis of the interface size or symmetry the chemical and amino acid compositions of the large crystal packing interfaces resemble the protein solvent accessible surface these interfaces are less hydrophobic than in homodimers and contain much fewer fully buried atoms we develop a residue propensity score and a hydrophobic interaction score to assess preferences seen in the chemical and amino acid compositions of the different types of interfaces and we derive indexes to evaluate the atomic packing which we find to be less compact at non specific than at specific interfaces we test the capacity of these parameters to identify homodimeric proteins in crystal structures and show that a simple combination of the non polar interface area and the fraction of buried interface atoms assigns the quaternary structure of   of the homodimers and   of the monomers in our data set correctly these success rates increase to     when the residue propensity score of the interfaces is taken into consideration
