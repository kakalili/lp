multi site phosphorylation of pho by the cyclin cdk pho  pho  is semi processive with site preference edited by s reed
as part of a nutrient responsive signaling pathway the budding yeast cyclin cdk complex pho  pho  phosphorylates the transcription factor pho on five sites and inactivates it here we describe the kinetic reaction between pho  pho  and pho  through experimentation and computer modeling we have determined that pho  pho  phosphorylates pho in a semi processive fashion that results from a balance between kcat and koff in addition we show that pho  pho  phosphorylates certain sites preferentially phosphorylation of the site with the highest preference inhibits the transcriptional activity of pho when it is in the nucleus while phosphorylation of the lowest preference sites is required for export of pho from the nucleus this method of phosphorylation may allow pho  pho  to quickly inactivate pho in the nucleus and efficiently phosphorylate pho to completion
