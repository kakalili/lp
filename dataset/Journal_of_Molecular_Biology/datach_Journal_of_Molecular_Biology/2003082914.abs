the role of tryptophan   in the conformational changes of    galactosyltransferase i
galactosyltransferase i   gal t  undergoes critical conformational changes upon substrate binding from an open conformation conf i to the closed conformation conf ii  this change involves two flexible loops the small residues      and the long loop residues       upon substrate binding trp  in the small flexible loop moves towards the catalytic pocket and interacts with the donor and the acceptor substrates for a better understanding of the role played by trp  in the conformational changes of  gal t  we mutated it to ala and carried out substrate binding proteolytic and crystallographic studies the w  a mutation reduces the enzymatic activity binding to substrates and to the modifier protein   lactalbumin la  by over   the limited proteolysis with glu c or lys c proteases shows differences in the rate of cleavage of the long loop of the wild type and mutant w  a indicating conformational differences in the region between the two proteins without substrate the mutant crystallizes in a conformation conf i      resolution crystal structure  that is not identical with but close to an open conformation conf i  whereas its complex with the substrates and  lactalbumin crystallizes in a conformation    resolution crystal structure that is identical with the closed conformation conf ii  this study shows the crucial role trp  plays in the conformational state of the long loop in the binding of substrates and in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme
