electrostatic effects in a network of polar and ionizable groups in staphylococcal nuclease
his  and his  are embedded in a network of polar and ionizable groups on the surface of staphylococcal nuclease to examine how membership in a network affects the electrostatic properties of ionizable groups the tautomeric state and the pka values of these histidines were measured with nmr spectroscopy in the wild type nuclease and in  variants designed to disrupt the network in the background protein his  and his  titrate with pka values of   and   respectively in the variants where the network was disrupted the pka values range from   to   for his   and   to   for his   the largest decrease in a pka was observed when the favorable coulomb interaction between his  and glu  was eliminated the largest increase was observed when tyr  or tyr  was substituted with ala or phe in all variants the dominant tautomeric state at neutral ph was the n  state at one level the network behaves as a rigid unit that does not readily reorganize when disrupted crystal structures of the e a or e q variants show that even when the pivotal glu  is removed the overall configuration of the network was unaffected on the other hand a few key hydrogen bonds appear to govern the conformation of the network and when these bonds are disrupted the network reorganizes coulomb interactions within the network report an effective dielectric constant of   whereas a dielectric constant of  is more consistent with the magnitude of medium to long range coulomb interactions in this protein the data demonstrate that when structures are treated as static rigid bodies structure based pka calculations with continuum electrostatics method are not useful to treat ionizable groups in cases where pka values are governed by short range polar and coulomb interactions
