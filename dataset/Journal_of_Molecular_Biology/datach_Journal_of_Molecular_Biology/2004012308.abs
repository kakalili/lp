two types of alzheimer s  amyloid     peptide membrane interactions aggregation preventing transmembrane anchoring versus accelerated surface fibril formation
the     amino acid long amphipathic amyloid  peptide a  is one of the key components involved in alzheimer s disease ad  in the neuropathology of ad a  presumably exerts its neurotoxic action via interactions with neuronal membranes in our studies a combination of  p mas nmr magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and cd circular dichroism spectroscopy suggest fundamental differences in the functional organization of supramolecular a     membrane assemblies for two different scenarios with potential implication in ad a  peptide can either be firmly anchored in a membrane upon proteolytic cleavage thereby being prevented against release and aggregation or it can have fundamentally adverse effects when bound to membrane surfaces by undergoing accelerated aggregation causing neuronal apoptotic cell death acidic lipids can prevent release of membrane inserted a     by stabilizing its hydrophobic transmembrane c terminal part residue     in an  helical conformation via an electrostatic anchor between its basic lys  residue and the negatively charged membrane interface however if a     is released as a soluble monomer charged membranes act as two dimensional aggregation templates where an increasing amount of charged lipids possible pathological degradation products causes a dramatic accumulation of surface associated a     peptide followed by accelerated aggregation into toxic structures these results suggest that two different molecular mechanisms of peptide  membrane assemblies are involved in a   s pathophysiology with the finely balanced type of a   lipid interactions against release of a  from neuronal membranes being overcompensated by an a   membrane assembly which causes toxic  structured aggregates in ad therefore pathological interactions of a  peptide with neuronal membranes might not only depend on the oligomerization state of the peptide but also the type and nature of the supramolecular a   membrane assemblies inherited from a   s origin
