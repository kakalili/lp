molecular basis of bcl xl  s target recognition versatility revealed by the structure of bcl xl in complex with the bh domain of beclin
beclin  originally identified as a bcl  binding protein is an evolutionarily conserved protein required for autophagy the direct interaction between beclin  and bcl  or bcl xl provides a potential convergence point for apoptosis and autophagy two programmed cell death processes given the functional significance of the interaction between beclin  and bcl  bcl xl we performed detailed biochemical and structural characterizations of this interaction we demonstrated that the bcl xl binding domain of beclin  contains a bh domain therefore beclin  is a new member of the bh only family proteins the structure of bcl xl in complex with the beclin  bh domain was determined at high resolution by nmr spectroscopy although similar to other known bh domains the beclin  bh domain displays its own distinct features in the complex with bcl xl systematic analysis of all known bcl xl bh domain complexes helped us to identify the molecular basis underlying the capacity of bcl xl to recognize diverse target sequences
