downstream dna selectively affects a paused conformation of human rna polymerase ii
transcriptional pausing by human rna polymerase ii rnapii in the hiv  ltr is caused principally by a weak rna dna hybrid that allows rearrangement of reactive or catalytic groups in the enzyme s active site this rearrangement creates a transiently paused state called the unactivated intermediate that can backtrack into a more long lived paused species we report that three different regions of the not yet transcribed dna just downstream of the pause site affect the duration of the hiv  pause and also can influence pause formation downstream dna in at least one region a t tract from  to   increases pause duration by specifically affecting the unactivated intermediate without corresponding effects on the active or backtracked states we suggest this effect depends on rnapii modulated dna plasticity and speculate it is mediated by the  trigger loop  thought to participate in rnap s catalytic cycle these findings provide a new framework for understanding downstream dna effects on rnap
