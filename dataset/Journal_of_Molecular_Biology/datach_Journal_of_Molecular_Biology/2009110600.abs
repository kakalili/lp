pilz protein structure and interactions with pilb and the fimx eal domain implications for control of type iv pilus biogenesis
the pilz protein was originally identified as necessary for type iv pilus t p biogenesis since then a large and diverse family of bacterial pilz homology domains have been identified some of which have been implicated in signaling pathways that control important processes including motility virulence and biofilm formation furthermore many pilz homology domains though not pilz itself have been shown to bind the important bacterial second messenger bis       cyclic digmp c digmp  the crystal structures of the pilz orthologs from xanthomonas axonopodis pv citri pilzxac   this work and from xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xc   present significant structural differences to other pilz homologs that explain its failure to bind c digmp nmr analysis of pilzxac   shows that these structural differences are maintained in solution in spite of their emerging importance in bacterial signaling the means by which pilz proteins regulate specific processes is not clear in this study we show that pilzxac   binds to pilb an atpase required for t p polymerization and to the eal domain of fimxxac   which regulates t p biogenesis and localization in other bacterial species these interactions were confirmed in nmr two hybrid and far western blot assays and are the first interactions observed between any pilz domain and a target protein while we were unable to detect phosphodiesterase activity for fimxxac   in vitro we show that it binds c digmp both in the presence and in the absence of pilzxac   site directed mutagenesis studies for conserved and exposed residues suggest that pilzxac   interactions with fimxxac   and pilbxac   are mediated through a hydrophobic surface and an unstructured c terminal extension conserved only in pilz orthologs the fimx pilz pilb interactions involve a full set of  degenerate  ggdef eal and pilz domains and provide the first evidence of the means by which pilz orthologs and fimx interact directly with the tp machinery
