at low concentrations   dihydroxyphenylacetic acid dopac binds non covalently to  synuclein and prevents its fibrillation
several studies have shown that catecholamines can inhibit the fibrillation of  synuclein   syn  a small presynaptic protein whose aggregation is believed to be a critical step in the etiology of parkinson s disease and several other neurodegenerative disorders however the mechanism of this inhibition is uncertain we show here that substoichiometric concentrations of   dihydroxyphenylacetic acid dopac  a normal product of the metabolism of dopamine can inhibit the fibrillation of  syn due to non covalent binding of dopac to  syn monomer intriguingly the presence of  syn accelerates the spontaneous oxidation of dopac and the oxidized form of dopac the quinone is responsible for the fibrillation inhibition in addition the presence of dopac leads to the oxidation of the methionine residues of  syn probably due to the h o production as a by product of dopac oxidation the lack of fibrillation results from the formation of stable oligomers which are very similar to those observed transiently at early stages of the  syn fibrillation a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that dopac stabilizes the normally transient oligomers and prevents them from subsequent fibril formation the analysis of the  syn y w variant suggests that dopac binds non covalently to the same n terminal region of  syn as lipid vesicles probably in the vicinity of residue   in contrast to the compounds with   dihydroxyphenyl groups dopac and catechol  their   dihydroxyphenyl isomers hydroquinone and homogentisic acid are able to modify  syn covalently probably due to the less steric hindrance in the michael addition
