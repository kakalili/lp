dodecameric structure and atpase activity of the human tip  tip  complex
tip  and tip  are two related and highly conserved eukaryotic aaa proteins with an essential biological function and a critical role in major pathways that are closely linked to cancer they are found together as components of several highly conserved chromatin modifying complexes both proteins show sequence homology to bacterial ruvb but the nature and mechanism of their biochemical role remain unknown recombinant human tip  and tip  were assembled into a stable high molecular mass equimolar complex and tested for activity in vitro tip  tip  complex formation resulted in synergistic increase in atpase activity but atp hydrolysis was not stimulated in the presence of single stranded double stranded or four way junction dna and no dna helicase or branch migration activity could be detected complexes with catalytic defects in either tip  or tip  had no atpase activity showing that both proteins within the tip  tip  complex are required for atp hydrolysis the structure of the tip  tip  complex was examined by negative stain electron microscopy three dimensional reconstruction at    resolution revealed that the tip  tip  complex consisted of two stacked hexameric rings with c symmetry the top and bottom rings showed substantial structural differences interestingly tip  formed oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides whilst tip  did not the results point to biochemical differences between tip  and tip  which may explain the structural differences between the two hexameric rings and could be significant for specialised functions that the proteins perform individually
