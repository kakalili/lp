viral membrane protein topology is dictated by multiple determinants in its sequence
the targeting insertion and topology of membrane proteins have been extensively studied in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes however the mechanisms used by viral membrane proteins to generate the correct topology within cellular membranes are less well understood here the effect of flanking charges and the hydrophobicity of the n terminal hydrophobic segment on viral membrane protein topogenesis are examined systematically experimental data reveal that the classical topological determinants have only a minor effect on the overall topology of p  a plant viral movement protein since only a few individual sequence alterations cause an inversion of p topology its topological stability is robust this result further indicates that the protein has multiple and perhaps redundant structural features that ensure that it always adopts the same topology these critical topogenic sequences appear to be recognized and acted upon from the initial stages of protein biosynthesis even before the ribosome ends protein translation
