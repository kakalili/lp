on the existence of a possible a a  d    arrestin complex a a agonist modulation of d agonist induced  arrestin recruitment
given that coactivation of adenosine a a a ar and dopamine d  d r receptors results in the coaggregation cointernalization and codesensitization of the a ar and d r and the role of scaffolding protein  arrestin in the desensitization internalization and signaling of g protein coupled receptors in this study we explored the ability of the a ar agonist cgs   in a ar  d r coexpressing cells to modulate the d r agonist induced recruitment of  arrestin to the d r by means of proximity based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer bret  and co trafficking analysis we found evidence that cgs   can increase the maximal bret signal between  arrestin rluc and d lrgfp upon d r activation by increasing the potency of the d r agonist to exert this action in addition this change was associated with an increased formation of cytoplasmic clusters containing  arrestin gfp and d lryfp as seen from the co trafficking analysis furthermore the a ar agonist advanced the time for the increase in akt phosphorylation obtained with the d r agonist finally using a novel bioinformatics approach to predict the protein  protein interface we have also found that amino acid pro triplets tny lls raf and vsr may be crucial for the induced  arrestin recruitment by a ar  d r heteromers taken together the results indicate that the antagonistic a ar  d r allosteric receptor  receptor interaction in a ar  d r heteromers favors  arrestin recruitment to the d lr protomer with subsequent cointernalization associated with a reduced time onset of akt phosphorylation followed by a rapid dephosphorylation thus   arrestin action becomes more rapid and short lasting and in this way mimics g protein mediated signaling
