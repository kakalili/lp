fucose depletion from human igg oligosaccharide enhances binding enthalpy and association rate between igg and fc riiia
depletion of fucose from human igg oligosaccharide improves its affinity for fc  receptor iiia fc riiia  this is the first case where a glycoform modification is shown to improve glycoprotein affinity for the receptors without carbohydrate binding capacity suggesting a novel glyco engineering strategy to improve ligand  receptor binding to address the mechanisms of affinity improvement by the fucose depletion we used isothermal titration calorimetry itc and biosensor analysis with surface plasmon resonance itc demonstrated that igg  fc riiia binding was driven by favorable binding enthalpy  h but opposed by unfavorable binding entropy change  s  fucose depletion from igg enhanced the favorable  h leading to the increase in the binding constant of igg for the receptor by a factor of     the increase in the affinity was mainly attributed to an enhanced association rate a triple amino acid substitution in igg  s  a e  a k  a is also known to improve igg affinity for fc riiia itc demonstrated that the amino acid substitution attenuated the unfavorable  s resulting in a three to fourfold increase in the binding constant the affinity enhancement by the amino acid substitution was due to a reduced dissociation rate these results indicate that the mechanism of affinity improvement by the fucose depletion is quite distinct from that by the amino acid substitution defucosylated igg exhibited higher antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc than s  a e  a k  a igg  showing a correlation between igg affinity for fc riiia and adcc we also examined the effect of fc riiia polymorphism val  phe   on igg  fc riiia binding the phe to val substitution increased fc riiia affinity for igg in an enthalpy driven manner with the reduced dissociation rate these results together highlight the distinctive functional improvement of affinity by igg defucosylation and suggest that engineering of non interfacial monosaccharides can improve glycoprotein affinity for receptors via an enthalpy driven and association rate assisted mechanism
