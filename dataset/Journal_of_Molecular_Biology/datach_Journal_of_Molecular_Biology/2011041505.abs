the alternating access mechanism of mfs transporters arises from inverted topology repeats
lactose permease lacy is the prototype of the major facilitator superfamily mfs of secondary transporters available structures of lacy reveal a state in which the substrate is exposed to the cytoplasm but is occluded from the periplasm however the alternating access transport mechanism requires the existence of a periplasm facing state we recently showed that inverted topology structural repeats provide the foundation for the mechanisms of two transporter families with folds distinct from the mfs here we generated a structural model of lacy by swapping the conformations of inverted topology repeats identified in its two domains the model exhibits all required properties of an outward facing conformation i e  closure of the binding site to the cytoplasm and exposure to the periplasm furthermore the model agrees with double electron  electron resonance distance changes accessibility to cysteine modifying reagents cysteine cross linking data and a recent structure of a distantly related transporter analysis of the intradomain differences between the two states suggests a role for conserved sequence motifs in occluding the central pathway through kinking of the pore lining helices in addition predicted re pairing of critical salt bridging residues in the binding sites agrees remarkably well with previous proposals allowing a description of the proton sugar transport mechanism more fundamentally our model demonstrates that inverted topology repeats provide the foundation for the alternating access mechanisms of mfs transporters
