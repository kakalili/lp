crystal structure of a proteolytically generated functional monoferric c lobe of bovine lactoferrin at    resolution
this is the first crystal structure of a proteolytically generated functional c lobe of lactoferrin the purified samples of iron saturated c lobe were crystallized in   m mes buffer ph   containing   v v polyethyleneglycol monomethyl ether   m and   m zinc sulphate heptahydrate the x ray intensity data were collected with   mm imaging plate scanner mounted on a rotating anode generator the structure was determined by the molecular replacement method using the coordinates of the c terminal half of bovine lactoferrin as a search model and refined to an r factor of    for all data to    resolution the final model comprises   protein atoms residues      and         carbohydrate atoms from ten monosaccharide units in three glycan chains  one fe  one co    two zn  and   water molecules the overall folding of the c lobe is essentially the same as that of c terminal half of bovine lactoferrin but differs slightly in conformations of some of the loops and reveals a number of new interactions there are  cys residues in the c lobe forming ten disulphide links out of these one involving cys  cys  provides an inter domain link at    while another cys  cys  is formed between the main c lobe     and the hydrolyzed pentapeptide     fragment six inter domain hydrogen bonds have been observed in the structure whereas only four were reported in the structure of intact lactoferrin although domain orientations have been found similar in the two structures the good quality of electron density has also revealed all the ten oligosaccharide units in the structure the observation of two metal ions at sites other than the iron binding cleft is another novel feature of the present structure these zinc ions stabilize the crystal packing this structure is also notable for extensive inter molecular hydrogen bonding in the crystals therefore the present structure appears to be one of the best packed crystal structures among the proteins of the transferrin superfamily
