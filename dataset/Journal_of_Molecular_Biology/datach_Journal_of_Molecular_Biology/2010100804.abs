thermodynamic characterization of ppgpp binding to ef g or if and of initiator trna binding to free if in the presence of gdp gtp or ppgpp
in addition to their natural substrates gdp and gtp the bacterial translational gtpases initiation factor if  and elongation factor g ef g interact with the alarmone molecule guanosine tetraphosphate ppgpp  which leads to gtpase inhibition we have used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the affinities of ppgpp for if and ef g at a temperature interval of      c we find that ppgpp has a higher affinity for if than for ef g        m kd versus        m kd at      c  suggesting that during stringent response in vivo if is more responsive to ppgpp than to ef g we investigated the effects of ppgpp gdp and gtp on if interactions with fmet trnafmet demonstrating that if binds to initiator trna with submicromolar kd and that affinity is altered by the g nucleotides only slightly this  in conjunction with earlier reports on if interactions with fmet trnafmet in the context of the  s initiation complex where ppgpp was suggested to strongly inhibit fmet trnafmet binding and gtp was suggested to strongly promote fmet trnafmet binding  sheds new light on the mechanisms of the g nucleotide regulated fmet trnafmet selection
