superoxide dismutase from the eukaryotic thermophile alvinella pompejana structures stability mechanism and insights into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
prokaryotic thermophiles supply stable human protein homologs for structural biology yet eukaryotic thermophiles would provide more similar macromolecules plus those missing in microbes alvinella pompejana is a deep sea hydrothermal vent worm that has been found in temperatures averaging as high as    c with spikes up to    c here we used cu zn superoxide dismutase sod to test if this eukaryotic thermophile can provide insights into macromolecular mechanisms and stability by supplying better stable mammalian homologs for structural biology and other biophysical characterizations than those from prokaryotic thermophiles identification cloning characterization x ray scattering small angle x ray scattering saxs  and crystal structure determinations show that a pompejana sod apsod is superstable homologous and informative saxs solution analyses identify the human like apsod dimer the crystal structure shows the active site at     resolution plus anchoring interaction motifs in loops and termini accounting for enhanced stability of apsod versus human sod such stabilizing features may reduce movements that promote inappropriate intermolecular interactions such as amyloid like filaments found in sod mutants causing the neurodegenerative disease familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or lou gehrig s disease apsod further provides the structure of a long sought sod product complex at     resolution suggesting a unified inner sphere mechanism for catalysis involving metal ion movement notably this proposed mechanism resolves apparent paradoxes regarding electron transfer these results extend knowledge of sod stability and catalysis and suggest that the eukaryote a pompejana provides macromolecules highly similar to those from humans but with enhanced stability more suitable for scientific and medical applications
