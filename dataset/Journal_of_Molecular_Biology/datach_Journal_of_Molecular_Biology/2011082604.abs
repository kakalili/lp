a myristoyl phosphoserine switch controls camp dependent protein kinase association to membranes
the camp dependent protein kinase protein kinase a pka  mediates a myriad of cellular signaling events and its activity is tightly regulated in both space and time among these regulatory mechanisms is n myristoylation whose biological role has been elusive using a combination of thermodynamics kinetics and spectroscopic methods we analyzed the effects of n myristoylation and phosphorylation at ser  on the interactions of pka with model membranes we found that in the absence of lipids the myristoyl group is tucked into the hydrophobic binding pocket of the enzyme myr in state  upon association with lipid bilayers the myristoyl group is extruded and inserts into the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer myr out state  nmr data indicate that the enzyme undergoes conformational equilibrium between myr in and myr out states which can be shifted byeither interaction with membranes and or phosphorylation at ser  our results provide evidence that the membrane binding motif of the myristoylated c subunit of pka pka c steers the enzyme toward lipids independent of its regulatory subunit or an a kinase anchoring protein providing an additional mechanism to localize the enzyme near membrane bound substrates
