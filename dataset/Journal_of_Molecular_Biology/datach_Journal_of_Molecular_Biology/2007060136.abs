nucleotide substrate recognition by udp n acetylglucosamine acyltransferase lpxa in the first step of lipid a biosynthesis
lipid a is an integral component of the lipopolysaccharide lps that forms the selective and protective outer monolayer of gram negative bacteria and is essential for bacterial growth and viability udp n acetylglucosamine acyltransferase lpxa initiates lipid a biosynthesis by catalyzing the transfer of r  hydroxymyristic acid from acyl carrier protein to the   hydroxyl group of udp glcnac the enzyme is a homotrimer and previous studies suggested that the active site lies within a positively charged cleft formed at the subunit  subunit interface the crystal structure of escherichia coli lpxa in complex with udp glcnac reveals details of the substrate binding site with prominent hydrophilic interactions between highly conserved clusters of residues asn   glu   arg  and arg   with udp and asp  his   his  and gln   with the glcnac moiety these interactions serve to bind and orient the substrate for catalysis the crystallographic model supports previous results which suggest that acylation occurs via nucleophilic attack of deprotonated udp glcnac on the acyl donor in a general base catalyzed mechanism involving a catalytic dyad of his  and asp   his   the general base interacts with the   hydroxyl group of udp glcnac to generate the nucleophile the asp  side chain accepts a hydrogen bond from his  and helps orient the general base to participate in catalysis comparisons with an lpxa peptide inhibitor complex indicate that the peptide competes with both nucleotide and acyl carrier protein substrates
