dna replication arrest in response to genotoxic stress provokes early activation of stress activated protein kinases sapk jnk
the impact of dna damage induced replication blockage for early activation of stress kinases stress activated protein kinase sapk c jun n terminal kinase jnk  is largely unknown here we show that induction of dual phosphorylation of sapk jnk by the dna polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin was not ameliorated by additional exposure to ultraviolet uv light indicating that overlapping mechanisms participate in signaling to sapk jnk triggered by both agents uv induced dna replication blockage cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation and dna strand break induction coincided with sapk jnk phosphorylation at early     min but not late    h time points after exposure genotoxin stimulated sapk jnk activation was attenuated in nonproliferating cells indicating that s phase dependent mechanisms are involved in signaling to sapk jnk correspondingly uv induced phosphorylation of sapk jnk was higher in s phase cells as compared with g phase cells activation of sapk jnk by genotoxins was below detection limit in nonproliferating human peripheral blood lymphocytes whereas peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated to proliferation displayed clear sapk jnk activation uv induced phosphorylation of sapk jnk was attenuated in xpc defective cells ameliorated in brca mutated cells and not changed in cells lacking atm dna pk csb xpa p  ercc or parp as compared with the corresponding wild types based on these data we suggest that dna replication blockage caused by genotoxin induced dna damage contributes to early activation of sapk jnk
