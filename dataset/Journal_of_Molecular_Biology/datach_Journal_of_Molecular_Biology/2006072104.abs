analysis of the folding of the b domain of protein a using multiple optical probes
we examined the co operativity of ultra fast folding of a protein and whether the  value analysis of its transition state depended on the location of the optical probe we incorporated in turn a tryptophan residue into each of the three helices of the b domain of protein a each trp mutant of the three helix bundle protein was used as a pseudo wild type parent for  analysis in which the intrinsic trp fluorescence probed the formation of each helix during the transition state apart from local effects in the immediate vicinity of the probe the three separate sets of  values were in excellent agreement demonstrating the overall co operativity of folding and the robustness of the  analysis the transition state of folding of protein a contains the second helix being well formed with many stabilizing tertiary hydrophobic interactions in contrast the first and the third helices are more poorly structured in the transition state the mechanism of folding thus involves the concurrent formation of secondary and tertiary interactions and is towards the nucleation  condensation extreme in the nucleation  condensation framework continuum of mechanism with helix  being the nucleus we provide an error analysis of  values derived purely from the kinetics of two state chevron plots
