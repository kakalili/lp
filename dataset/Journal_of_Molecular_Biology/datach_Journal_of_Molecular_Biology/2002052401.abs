quantification of the influence of hprser p on ccpa  cre interaction
carbon catabolite repression ccr of the bacillus megaterium xyl operon is dependent on the catabolite responsive element cre the catabolite control protein ccpa and the histidine containing phosphocarrier protein phosphorylated at the serine  residue hprser p  the latter is formed in the presence of glucose and mediates ccr via ccpa we present evidence for the presence of hprser p in a ternary complex with ccpa and cre we also demonstrate increased stability of this complex compared to the ccpa  cre complex by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis emsa  this stabilization by hprser p is the same for the xyl cre and an improved cre thus hprser p is a co repressor for ccpa in addition surface plasmon resonance spr experiments yielded binding constants of ccpa and the ccpa  hprser p complex with cre hprser p stimulated ccpa binding to cre  fold the binding constant is        m   non phosphorylated hpr did not affect the complex formation between ccpa and cre previously proposed effects by glucose  phosphate fructose   diphosphate and nadp on ccpa  cre or ccpa  hprser p  cre formation were not found in emsa and spr experiments
