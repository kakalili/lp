crystal structure of thermus thermophilus trna m a  methyltransferase and biophysical characterization of its interaction with trna
methyltransferases from the m a  trna methyltransferase trmi family catalyze the s adenosyl l methionine dependent n methylation of trna adenosine   the crystal structure of thermus thermophilus trmi in complex with s adenosyl l homocysteine was determined at     resolution this structure is closely related to that of mycobacterium tuberculosis trmi and their comparison enabled us to enlighten two grooves in the trmi structure that are large enough and electrostatically compatible to accommodate one trna per face of trmi tetramer we have then conducted a biophysical study based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry site directed mutagenesis and molecular docking first we confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization state of trmi and we showed that this protein remains tetrameric upon trna binding with formation of complexes involving one to two molecules of trna per trmi tetramer second three key residues for the methylation reaction were identified the universally conserved d  and two conserved aromatic residues y  and y   we then used molecular docking to position a n methyladenine in the active site of trmi the n methyladenine snugly fits into the catalytic cleft where the side chain of d  acts as a bidentate ligand binding the amino moiety of s adenosyl l methionine and the exocyclic amino group of the adenosine y  interacts with the n methyladenine ring whereas y  can stabilize the sugar ring from our results we propose that the conserved residues that form the catalytic cavity d   y  and y   are essential for fashioning an optimized shape of the catalytic pocket
