a conserved insertion in protein primed dna polymerases is involved in primer terminus stabilisation
protein primed dna polymerases form a subgroup of the eukaryotic type dna polymerases family also called family b or  like a multiple amino acid sequence alignment of this subgroup of dna polymerases led to the identification of two insertions tpr  and tpr  in the polymerisation domain we showed previously that asp  of the tpr  insertion of   dna polymerase is involved in the correct orientation of the terminal protein tp for the initiation of replication in this work the functional role of two other conserved residues from tpr  lys  and tyr   has been analysed the four mutant derivatives constructed k  i k  r y  a and y  f displayed a wild type       exonuclease activity on single stranded dna however when assayed on double stranded dna such activity was higher than that of the wild type enzyme this activity led to a reduced pol exo ratio suggesting a defect in stabilising the primer terminus at the polymerase active site on the other hand although mutant polymerases k  i and y  a were able to couple processive dna polymerisation to strand displacement they were severely impaired in   tp dna replication the possible role of the tpr  insertion in the set of interactions with the nascent chain during the first steps of tp dna replication is discussed
