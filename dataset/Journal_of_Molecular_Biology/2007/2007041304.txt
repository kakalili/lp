We have probed the structure of the human mitochondrial DNA helicase, an enzyme that uses the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to unwind duplex DNA during mitochondrial DNA replication. This novel helicase shares substantial amino acid sequence and functional similarities with the bacteriophage T7 primase-helicase. We show in velocity sedimentation and gel filtration analyses that the mitochondrial DNA helicase exists as a hexamer. Limited proteolysis by trypsin results in the production of several stable fragments, and N-terminal sequencing reveals distinct N and C-terminal polypeptides that represent minimal structural domains. Physical analysis of the proteolytic products defines the region required to maintain oligomeric structure to reside within amino acid residues ∼405–590. Truncations of the N and C termini affect differentially DNA-dependent ATPase activity, and whereas a C-terminal domain polypeptide is functional, an N-terminal domain polypeptide lacks ATPase activity. Sequence similarity and secondary structural alignments combined with biochemical data suggest that amino acid residue R609 serves as the putative arginine finger that is essential for ATPase activity in ring helicases. The hexameric conformation and modular architecture revealed in our study document that the mitochondrial DNA helicase and bacteriophage T7 primase-helicase share physical features. Our findings place the mitochondrial DNA helicase firmly in the DnaB-like family of replicative DNA helicases.
