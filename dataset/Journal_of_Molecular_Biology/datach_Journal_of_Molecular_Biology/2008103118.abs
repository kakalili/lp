segregation of type i collagen homo and heterotrimers in fibrils
normal type i collagen is a heterotrimer of two   i and one   i chains but various genetic and environmental factors result in synthesis of homotrimers that consist of three   i chains the homotrimers completely replace the heterotrimers only in rare recessive disorders in the general population they may compose just a small fraction of type i collagen nevertheless they may play a significant role in pathology for example synthesis of     homotrimers due to a polymorphism in the   i gene may contribute to osteoporosis homotrimer triple helices have different stability and less efficient fibrillogenesis than heterotrimers their fibrils have different mechanical properties however very little is known about their molecular interactions and fibrillogenesis in mixtures with normal heterotrimers here we studied the kinetics and thermodynamics of fibril formation in such mixtures by combining traditional approaches with d confocal imaging of fibrils in which homo and heterotrimers were labeled with different fluorescent colors in a mixture following a temperature jump from  to    c we observed a rapid increase in turbidity most likely caused by formation of homotrimer aggregates the aggregates promoted nucleation of homotrimer fibrils that served as seeds for mixed and heterotrimer fibrils the separation of colors in confocal images indicated segregation of homo and heterotrimers at a subfibrillar level throughout the process the fibril color patterns continued to change slowly after the fibrillogenesis appeared to be complete due to dissociation and reassociation of the pepsin treated homo and heterotrimers but this remixing did not significantly reduce the segregation even after several days independent homo and heterotrimer solubility measurements in mixtures confirmed that the subfibrillar segregation was an equilibrium property of intermolecular interactions and not just a kinetic phenomenon we argue that the subfibrillar segregation may exacerbate effects of a small fraction of   i homotrimers on formation properties and remodeling of collagen fibers
