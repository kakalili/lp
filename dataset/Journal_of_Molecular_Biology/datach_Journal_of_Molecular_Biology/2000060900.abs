strengthening the dimerisation interface of lac repressor increases its thermostability by  deg c edited by m yaniv
we increased drastically the heat stability of lac repressor lacr of escherichia coli wild type tetrameric lacr denatures irreversibly at   c improving hydrophobic packing at the dimerisation interface by a single substitution increases lacr heat resistance by  deg c without abolishing inducer binding at high and low temperatures tetrameric lacr mutants carrying substitutions of the positively charged amino acid lys  by each of the hydrophobic amino acids leu ile and met resist heating to temperatures up to   c we performed iptg binding assays at   c and found the mutant lac repressors active and thus the core intact furthermore the activity of lacr following heating is shown at room temperature by a gel retardation assay which demonstrates normal oligomerisation state and function of the headpiece the same mutations k l i m in the dimer lacr  stop carrying a stop codon in amino acid   increase thermostability of the dimer from   c to   c lacrk m represses  galactosidase activity in vivo as well as the wild type and is sufficiently induced to allow growth on lactose the results with both tetramer and dimer variants of lacr indicate mutual stabilisation of the tetramerisation region and the stable core
