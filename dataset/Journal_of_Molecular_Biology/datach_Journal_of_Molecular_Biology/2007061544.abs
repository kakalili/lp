the geometry of interactions between catalytic residues and their substrates
the process of deducing the catalytic mechanism of an enzyme from its structure is highly complex and requires extensive experimental work to validate a proposed mechanism as one step towards improving the reliability of this process we have gathered statistics describing the typical geometry of catalytic residues with regard to the substrate and one another in order to analyse residue substrate interactions we have assembled a dataset of structures of enzymes of known mechanism bound to substrate product or a substrate analogue despite the challenges presented in obtaining such experimental data we were able to include  enzyme structures we have also assembled a separate dataset of catalytic residues which act upon other catalytic residues using a set of  enzyme structures for both datasets we have extracted the distances between residues with a given catalytic function and their target moieties the geometry of residues whose function involves the transfer or sharing of hydrogens either with substrate or another residue was analysed more closely the results showed that the geometry for such productive interactions prior to the transition state closely resembles that seen in non catalytic hydrogen bonds with distances and angles in the normal expected range such statistics provide limits on  expected geometries  for catalytic residues which will help to identify these residues and elucidate enzyme mechanisms
