crystal structure of human peroxiredoxin  a novel type of mammalian peroxiredoxin at    resolution edited by r huber
the peroxiredoxins define an emerging family of peroxidases able to reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides with the use of reducing equivalents derived from thiol containing donor molecules such as thioredoxin glutathione trypanothione and ahpf peroxiredoxins have been identified in prokaryotes as well as in eukaryotes peroxiredoxin  prdx  is a novel type of mammalian thioredoxin peroxidase widely expressed in tissues and located cellularly to mitochondria peroxisomes and cytosol functionally prdx has been implicated in antioxidant protective mechanisms as well as in signal transduction in cells we report here the    resolution crystal structure of human prdx in its reduced form the crystal structure reveals that prdx presents a thioredoxin like domain interestingly the crystal structure shows also that prdx does not form a dimer like other mammalian members of the peroxiredoxin family in the reduced form of prdx  cys  and cys  are distant of     although these two cysteine residues are thought to be involved in peroxide reductase activity by forming an intramolecular disulfide intermediate in the oxidized enzyme these data suggest that the enzyme would necessitate a conformational change to form a disulfide bond between catalytic cys  and cys  upon oxidation according to proposed peroxide reduction mechanisms moreover the presence of a benzoate ion a hydroxyl radical scavenger was noted close to the active site pocket the possible role of benzoate in the antioxidant activity of prdx is discussed
