conserved folding pathways of  lactalbumin and lysozyme revealed by kinetic cd fluorescence nmr and interrupted refolding experiments
in this report it is shown by a combination of stopped flow cd fluorescence and time resolved nmr studies that the ca  induced refolding of bovine  lactalbumin bla at constant denaturant concentration   m urea exhibits triple exponential kinetics in order to distinguish between parallel folding pathways and a strictly sequential formation of the native state interrupted refolding experiments were conducted we show here that the ca  induced refolding of bla involves parallel pathways and the transient formation of a folding intermediate on the millisecond timescale our data furthermore suggest that the two structurally homologous proteins bla and hen egg white lysozyme share a common folding mechanism we provide evidence that the guiding role of long range interactions in the unfolded state of lysozyme in mediating intersubdomain interactions during folding is replaced in the case of bla by the ca  binding site time resolved nmr spectroscopy in combination with fast ion release from caged compounds enables the measurement of complex protein folding kinetics at protein concentrations as low as    m and the concomitant detection of conformational transitions with rate constants of up to  s
