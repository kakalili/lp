transient structure and sh interaction sites in an intrinsically disordered fragment of the hepatitis c virus protein ns a
understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in virus replication and particle assembly is of primary fundamental and biomedical importance intrinsic conformational disorder plays a prominent role in viral proteins and their interaction with other viral and host cell proteins via transiently populated structural elements here we report on the results of an investigation of an intrinsically disordered   residue fragment of the hepatitis c virus non structural protein a ns a  which contains a classical poly proline src homology  sh  binding motif using sensitivity and resolution optimized multidimensional nmr methods complemented by small angle x ray scattering data our study provides detailed atomic resolution information on transient local and long range structure as well as fast time scale dynamics in this ns a fragment in addition we could characterize two distinct interaction modes with the sh domain of bin  bridging integrator protein   a pro apoptotic tumor suppressor despite being largely disordered the protein contains three regions that transiently adopt  helical structures partly stabilized by long range tertiary interactions two of these transient  helices form a noncanonical sh binding motif which allows low affinity sh binding our results contribute to a better understanding of the role of the ns a protein during hepatitis c virus infection the present work also highlights the power of nmr spectroscopy to characterize multiple binding events including short lived transient interactions between globular and highly disordered proteins
