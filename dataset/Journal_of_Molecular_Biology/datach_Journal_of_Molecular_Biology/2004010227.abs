crystal structure of type iie restriction endonuclease ecorii reveals an autoinhibition mechanism by a novel effector binding fold
ecorii is a type iie restriction endonuclease that interacts with two copies of the dna recognition sequence   ccwgg one being the actual target of cleavage the other serving as the allosteric effector the mode of enzyme activation by effector binding is unknown to investigate the molecular basis of activation and cleavage mechanisms by ecorii the crystal structure of ecorii mutant r a has been solved at    resolution the ecorii monomer has two domains linked through a hinge loop the n terminal effector binding domain has a novel dna recognition fold with a prominent cleft the c terminal catalytic domain has a restriction endonuclease like fold structure based sequence alignment identified the putative catalytic site of ecorii that is spatially blocked by the n terminal domain the structure together with the earlier characterized ecorii enzyme activity enhancement in the absence of its n terminal domain reveal an autoinhibition activation mechanism of enzyme activity mediated by a novel effector binding fold this is the first case of autoinhibition a mechanism described for many transcription factors and signal transducing proteins of a restriction endonuclease
