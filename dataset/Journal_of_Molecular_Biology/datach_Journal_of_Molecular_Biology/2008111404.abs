yccw is the m c methyltransferase specific for  s rrna nucleotide
methylation at the  position of cytosine m c  methylcytidine  occurs at three rna nucleotides in escherichia coli all these modifications are at highly conserved nucleotides in the rrnas and each is catalyzed by its own m c methyltransferase enzyme two of the enzymes rsmb and rsmf are already known and methylate  s rrna at nucleotides c  and c   respectively here we report the identity of the third e coli m c methyltransferase analysis of rrnas by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry showed that inactivation of the yccw gene leads to loss of m c methylation at nucleotide   in e coli  s rrna this methylation is restored by complementing the knockout strain with a plasmid encoded copy of the yccw gene purified recombinant yccw protein retains its specificity for c   in vitro and methylates naked  s rrna isolated from the yccw knockout strain however yccw does not methylate assembled  s subunits and this is somewhat surprising as the published crystal structures show nucleotide c   to be fully accessible at the subunit interface yccw directed methylation at nucleotide c   is conserved in bacteria and loss of this methylation in e coli marginally reduces its growth rate yccw had previously eluded identification because it displays only limited sequence similarity to the m c methyltransferases rsmb and rsmf and is in fact more similar to known m u  methyluridine rna methyltransferases in keeping with the previously proposed nomenclature system for bacterial rrna methyltransferases yccw is now designated as the rrna large subunit methyltransferase gene rlmi
