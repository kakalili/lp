regulation signaling and physiological functions of g proteins
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding regulatory proteins g proteins mainly relay the information from g protein coupled receptors gpcrs on the plasma membrane to the inside of cells to regulate various biochemical functions depending on the targeted cell types tissues and organs these signals modulate diverse physiological functions the basic schemes of heterotrimeric g proteins have been outlined in this review we briefly summarize what is known about the regulation signaling and physiological functions of g proteins we then focus on a few less explored areas such as the regulation of g proteins by non gpcrs and the physiological functions of g proteins that cannot be easily explained by the known g protein signaling pathways there are new signaling pathways and physiological functions for g proteins to be discovered and further interrogated with the advancements in structural and computational biological techniques we are closer to having a better understanding of how g proteins are regulated and of the specificity of g protein interactions with their regulators
