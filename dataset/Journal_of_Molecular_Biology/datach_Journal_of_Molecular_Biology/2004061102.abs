distinguishing humans from great apes with aluyb repeats   motto biology is full of patterns it is the process that matters
humans and chimpanzees share some   of dna and amino acid identity yet they exhibit important biomedical morphological and cognitive differences difficult to accommodate within the remaining  of sequence diversity other types of genetic variation must be responsible for the taxonomic differences here we trace the evolution of aluyb repeats from a single origin at the roots of higher primates to a large increase in their number in humans we identify nine aluyb dna repeats in the chimpanzee genome compared to over   repeats in the human which represents a   fold increase in the rate of change in the human lineage and far outweighs the   sequence similarity between the two species it is estimated that the average age of the human yb alus is about   million years my  almost   of them are identical in sequence and hence are of recent origin genomic variations of this magnitude distinguishing humans from great apes have not been realized this explosive alu expansion must have had a profound effect on the organization of our genome and the architecture of our chromosomes inferentially altering profiles of gene expression and chromosome choreography in cell division additionally we conclude that this major evolutionary process of alu proliferation is driven by internal forces written in the chemistry of dna rather than by external selection
