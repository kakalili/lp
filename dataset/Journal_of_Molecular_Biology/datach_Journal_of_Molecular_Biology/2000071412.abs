distinct rna structural domains cooperate to maintain a specific cleavage site in the   utr of igf ii mrnas  edited by d e draper
the insulin like growth factor ii mrnas are targets for site specific endonucleolytic cleavage in the   utr which results in a very stable   cleavage product of   kb consisting of   utr sequences and a poly a tail the   cleavage product contains the coding region and is rapidly degraded thus cleavage is thought to provide an additional way to control igf ii protein synthesis we had established that cleavage requires two widely separated sequence elements i and ii in the   utr that form a stable duplex of  nucleotides the cleavage site itself is located in an internal loop preceded by two stable stem loop structures furthermore in a study which was based on rna folding algorithms we have shown that there are specific sequence and structural requirements for the cleavage reaction here the functions of the different structural domains in cleavage were assessed by deletion mutational analyses and biochemical structure probing assays were performed to characterize better the rna structures formed and to verify the computer folding predictions the data suggest that the stem loop domain contributes to maintain a highly specific c leavage site by preventing the formation of alternative structures in the cleavage site domain involvement of the nucleotides in the cleavage site loop itself in non watson crick interactions may be important for providing a specific recognition surface for an endoribonuclease activity
