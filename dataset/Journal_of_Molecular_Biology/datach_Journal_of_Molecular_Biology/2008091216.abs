insights into the impact of histone acetylation and methylation on sir protein recruitment spreading and silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae
silent chromatin formation in saccharomyces cerevisiae begins with the recruitment of silent information regulator sir proteins to silencers at the silent mating type loci and to telomere ends next sir   proteins propagate across these loci as histones are deacetylated by the nad dependent histone deacetylase sir p ultimately resulting in the cessation of transcription and in the loss of set  and dot dependent methylation of histone h within silent chromatin we analyzed the effects of modifiable lysine residues on histones h and h on experimentally defined steps in silencing recruitment of sir proteins to silencers sir protein spreading and transcriptional repression loss of acetylation but not methylation facilitated both sir recruitment and spreading and sir spreading across hypoacetylated chromatin could disrupt set  and dot dependent histone methylation without silencing underlying genes our data indicate that loss of methylation of k and k  on histone h reflects intermediate events during the formation of silent chromatin and that retention of a positive charge at a single residue on histone h  k  was both necessary and sufficient to permit sir spreading beyond sites of their recruitment
