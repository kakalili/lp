structural and functional studies of the yeast class ii hda histone deacetylase complex
yeast class ii hda histone deacetylase hdac complex is an h b and h specific hdac in saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting of three previously identified subunits the catalytic subunit schda p and two non catalytic structural subunits schda p and schda p we co expressed and co purified recombinant yeast class ii hdac complex from bacteria as a functionally active and trichostatin a sensitive hetero tetrameric complex according to an extensive analysis of domain organization and interaction of all subunits or domains  the n terminal domain of schda p associates through the c terminal coiled coil domains ccds of the schda p  schda p sub complex yielding a truncated schda phdac  schda pccd  schda pccd complex with indistinguishable deacetylase activity compared to the full length complex in vitro we characterized the interaction of the hdac complex with either single stranded or double stranded dna and identified the n terminal halves of schda p and schda p as binding modules a high resolution structure of the schda p dna binding domain by x ray crystallography is presented the crystal structure shows an unanticipated structural homology with the c terminal helicase lobes of swi snf chromatin remodeling domains of the rad  family enzymes dna binding is unspecific for nucleotide sequence and structure similar to the rad  enzymes in vitro our structural and functional analyses of the budding yeast class ii hda hdac complex provide insight into dna recognition and deacetylation of histones in nucleosomes
