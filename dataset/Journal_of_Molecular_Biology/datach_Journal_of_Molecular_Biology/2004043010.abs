molecular dynamics simulations of transducin interdomain and front to back communication in activation and nucleotide exchange
the dynamic events that underlie the nucleotide exchange process for the g  subunit of transducin g t were studied with nanosecond time scale molecular dynamics simulations the modeled systems include the active and inactive forms of the wild type g t and three of its mutants gdp bound form only  f  a a  s and q  a that are known to exhibit various degrees of enhancement of their basal and receptor catalyzed rates of nucleotide exchange   fold   fold and wt like respectively  the results of these computational experiments reveal a number of nucleotide dependent structural and dynamic changes involving the  b   c loop the inter domain orientation of the helical and gtpase domains and the   helix that were not observed in the various crystal structures of g t notably the results show the existence of a front to back communication device involving the      hairpin the   helix and the   helix  strategically located near all elements susceptible to be involved in receptor mediated activation nucleotide exchange the wild type simulations suggest that the dynamic interplay between the elements of this device would be critical for the activation of the g t subunit this inference is confirmed by the results of the computational experiments on the mutants that show that even in their gdp bound forms the a  s and f  a mutants acquire an  active like  structure and dynamics phenotype the same is not true for the q  a mutant whose structural and dynamic properties remain similar to those of the gdp bound wt taken together the results suggest a nucleotide exchange mechanism analogous to that found in the arf family gtpases in which a partially activated state achievable from a receptor mediated action of the front to back communication device either by displacement of the c terminal   helix of the n terminal  n helix or of the g   subunit could precede the dissociation of gdp from the native g  subunit
