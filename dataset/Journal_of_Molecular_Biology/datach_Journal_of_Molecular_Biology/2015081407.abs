oligomerization of the uapa purine transporter is critical for er exit plasma membrane localization and turnover
central to the process of transmembrane cargo trafficking is the successful folding and exit from the er endoplasmic reticulum through packaging in copii vesicles here we use the uapa purine transporter of aspergillus nidulans to investigate the role of cargo oligomerization in membrane trafficking we show that uapa oligomerizes at least dimerizes and that oligomerization persists upon uapa endocytosis and vacuolar sorting using a validated bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay we provide evidence that a uapa oligomerization is associated with er exit and turnover as er retained mutants due to either modification of a tyr based n terminal motif or partial misfolding physically associate but do not associate properly co expression of er retained mutants with wild type uapa leads to in trans plasma membrane localization of the former confirming that oligomerization initiates in the er genetic suppression of an n terminal mutation in the tyr motif and mutational analysis suggest that transmembrane  helix  affects the oligomerization interface our results reveal that transporter oligomerization is essential for membrane trafficking and turnover and is a common theme in fungi and mammalian cells
