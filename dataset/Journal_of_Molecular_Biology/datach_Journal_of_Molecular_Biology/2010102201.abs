conformational exchange is critical for the productivity of an oxidative folding intermediate with buried free cysteines
much has been learned about the folding of proteins from comparative studies of the folding of proteins that are related in sequence and structure observation of the effects of mutations helps account for sequence specific properties and large variations in folding rates observed in homologous proteins which are not explained by structure derived descriptions the folding kinetics of variants of a  stranded protein toxin  from naja nigricollis depends on the length of their loop lk  these proteins named tox  tox  and tox  contain four disulfide bonds we show that their oxidative refolding pathways are similar differences in these pathways are restricted to the last step of the reaction that is the closure of the last disulfide at this step two species of three disulfide intermediates are observed intermediate c lacking the b disulfide and intermediate d lacking the b disulfide surprisingly d is the most productive intermediate for tox  despite the low accessibility of its free cysteines however in the case of tox  its conversion efficiency drops by  orders of magnitude and c becomes the most productive intermediate nmr was used in order to study the structural dynamics of each of these intermediates both three disulfide intermediates of tox  exist in two forms exchanging on the  to   ms scale one of these forms is structurally very close to the native tox  whereas the other is always significantly more flexible on a picosecond to nanosecond timescale on the other hand in the case of tox  the three disulfide intermediates only show a native like structure the higher conformational heterogeneity of tox  intermediate d allows an increased accessibility of its free cysteines to oxidative agents which explains its faster native disulfide formation thus residue deletion in loop lk probably abrogates stabilizing intramolecular interactions creates conformational heterogeneity and increases the folding rate of tox  and tox  compared to tox
