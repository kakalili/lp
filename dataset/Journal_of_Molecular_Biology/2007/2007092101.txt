The Escherichia coli Rsd protein binds tightly and specifically to the RNA polymerase (RNAP) σ70 factor. Rsd plays a role in alternative σ factor-dependent transcription by biasing the competition between σ70 and alternative σ factors for the available core RNAP. Here, we determined the 2.6 Å-resolution X-ray crystal structure of Rsd bound to σ70 domain 4 (σ704), the primary determinant for Rsd binding within σ70. The structure reveals that Rsd binding interferes with the two primary functions of σ704, core RNAP binding and promoter −35 element binding. Interestingly, the most highly conserved Rsd residues form a network of interactions through the middle of the Rsd structure that connect the σ704-binding surface with three cavities exposed on distant surfaces of Rsd, suggesting functional coupling between σ704 binding and other binding surfaces of Rsd, either for other proteins or for as yet unknown small molecule effectors. These results provide a structural basis for understanding the role of Rsd, as well as its ortholog, AlgQ, a positive regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence, in transcription regulation.
