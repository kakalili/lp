three dimensional structure of fez  a monomeric subclass b metallo  lactamase from fluoribacter gormanii in native form and in complex with d captopril
the  lactamases are involved in bacterial resistance to penicillin and related compounds members of the metallo enzyme class are now found in many pathogenic bacteria and are thus becoming of major clinical importance the structures of the zn  lactamase from fluoribacter gormanii fez  in the native and in the complex form are reported here fez  is a monomeric enzyme which possesses two zinc binding sites these structures are discussed in comparison with those of the tetrameric l enzyme produced by stenotrophomonas maltophilia from this analysis amino acids involved in the oligomerization of l are clearly identified despite the similarity in fold the active site of fez  was found to be significantly different two residues which were previously implicated in function are not present in l or in fez  the broad spectrum substrate profile of zn  lactamases arises from the rather wide active site cleft where various  lactam compounds can be accommodated
