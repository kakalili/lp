identification of residues on hsp  and hsp  ubiquitinated by the cochaperone chip
molecular chaperones hsp  and hsp  are in part responsible for maintaining the viability of cells by facilitating the folding and maturation process of many essential client proteins the ubiquitin ligase c terminus of hsc  interacting protein chip has been shown in vitro and in vivo to associate with hsp  and hsp  and ubiquitinate them thus targeting them to the proteasome for degradation here we study one facet of this chip mediated turnover by determining the lysine residues on human hsp  and hsp  ubiquitinated by chip we performed in vitro ubiquitination reactions of the chaperones using purified components and analyzed the samples by tandem mass spectrometry to identify modified lysine residues six such ubiquitination sites were identified on hsp  k   k   k   k   k   and k   and  ubiquitinated lysine residues were found on hsp  k   k   k   k   k   k   k   k   k   k   k   k   and k   we mapped the ubiquitination sites on homology models of almost full length human hsp  and hsp  which were found to cluster in certain regions of the structures furthermore we determined that chip forms polyubiquitin chains on hsp  and hsp  linked via k  k  k  and k  these findings clarify the mode of ubiquitination of hsp  and hsp  by chip which ultimately leads to their degradation
