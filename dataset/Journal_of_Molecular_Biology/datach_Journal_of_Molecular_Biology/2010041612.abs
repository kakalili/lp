crystal structure of p  ipk tpr fragment reveals the mechanism for its molecular chaperone activity in upr
p  ipk might function as an endoplasmic reticulum molecular chaperone to maintain protein folding homeostasis during unfolded protein responses p  ipk contains nine tetratricopeptide repeat tpr motifs and a c terminal j domain within its primary sequence to investigate the mechanism by which p  ipk functions to promote protein folding within the endoplasmic reticulum we have determined the crystal structure of p  ipk tpr fragment to     resolution by the sad method the crystal structure of p  ipk revealed three domains i  iii with similar folds and each domain contains three tpr motifs an elisa assay indicated that p  ipk acts as a molecular chaperone by interacting with misfolded proteins such as luciferase and rhodanese the p  ipk structure reveals a conserved hydrophobic patch located in domain i that might be involved in binding the misfolded polypeptides structure based mutagenesis for the conserved hydrophobic residues located in domain i significantly reduced the molecular chaperone activity of p  ipk
