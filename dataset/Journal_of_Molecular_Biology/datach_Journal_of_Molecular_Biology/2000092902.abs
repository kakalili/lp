the three dimensional structure of a complex of an fab from a murine igg b   antibody nc    with a high potency sweet tasting hapten n p cyanophenyl n   diphenylmethyl n   carboxymethyl guanidine nc   has been determined to    resolution by x ray crystallography this complex crystallized in the triclinic space group p  with two molecules in the asymmetric unit in contrast to a companion monoclonal antibody nc   with a  type light chain and similar high affinity for the nc  ligand the nc   antibody possessed a large and deep antigen combining site bounded primarily by the third complementarity determining regions cdr s of the light and heavy chains cdr of the heavy chain dominated the site and its crown protruded into the external solvent as a type     turn nc  was nested against hcdr and was held in place by two tryptophan side chains l  and l  from lcdr  the diphenyl rings were accommodated on an upper tier of the binding pocket that is largely hydrophobic at the floor of the site a positively charged arginine side chain h  stabilized the orientation of the electronegative cyano group of the hapten the negative charge on the acetate group was partially neutralized by a hydrogen bond with the phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine h  comparisons of the modes of binding of nc  to the nc  and nc   antibodies illustrate the enormous structural and mechanistic diversity manifest by immune responses
