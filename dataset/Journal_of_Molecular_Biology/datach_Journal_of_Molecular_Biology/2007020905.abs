new insights on the role of the  herpesvirus uracil dna glycosylase leucine loop revealed by the structure of the epstein barr virus enzyme in complex with an inhibitor protein
epstein barr virus ebv is a human gamma herpesvirus within its  open reading frame containing genome two enzymes avoiding uracil incorporation into dna can be found uracil triphosphate hydrolase and uracil dna glycosylase ung  the latter one excises uracil bases that are due to cytosine deamination or uracil misincorporation from double stranded dna substrates the ebv enzyme belongs to family  ungs we solved the three dimensional structure of ebv ung in complex with the uracil dna glycosylase inhibitor protein ugi from bacteriophage pbs  at a resolution of     by x ray crystallography the structure of ebv ung encoded by the bkrf reading frame shows the excellent global structural conservation within the solved examples of family  enzymes four out of the five catalytic motifs are completely conserved whereas the fifth one the leucine loop carries a seven residue insertion despite this insertion catalytic constants of ebv ung are similar to those of other ungs modelling of the ebv ung  dna complex shows that the longer leucine loop still contacts dna and is likely to fulfil its role of dna binding and deformation differently than the enzymes with previously solved structures we could show that despite the evolutionary distance of ebv ung from the natural host protein bacteriophage ugi binds with an inhibitory constant of  nm to ung this is due to an excellent specificity of ugi for conserved elements of ung four of them corresponding to catalytic motifs and a fifth one corresponding to an important beta turn structuring the catalytic site
