The photochemical reactions of Arabidopsis phototropin 2 light- oxygen-voltage domain 2 (LOV2) with the linker region (LOV2-linker), without the linker (LOV2), and LOV1 were studied using the time-resolved transient grating (TG) and transient lens (TrL) methods. Although the absorption spectra did not change after the formation of the adduct species, a small volume expansion process with a time constant of 9 ms was observed for LOV2. For the LOV2-linker, at 293 K, a volume contraction process with a time constant of 140 μs was observed in addition to a volume expansion process with 9 ms and the diffusion coefficient change with 2 ms. The reaction intermediate species were characterized on the basis of their thermodynamic properties, such as changes in enthalpy, thermal expansion, and heat capacity. For the first intermediate (S390), the values of these properties were similar to those of the ground state for both LOV2 and LOV2-linker. A relatively large thermal expansion volume (0.09 cm3mol−1K−1) and a positive heat capacity change (4.7 kJ mol−1K−1) were detected for the intermediates of LOV2-linker. These characteristic features were interpreted in terms of structural fluctuation and exposure of hydrophobic residues in the linker domain, respectively. The enthalpy change of S390 of the LOV1 domain was significantly greater than changes for the LOV2 or LOV2-linker samples. Data from this study support a major conformational change of the linker region in the photochemical reaction of phototropin.
