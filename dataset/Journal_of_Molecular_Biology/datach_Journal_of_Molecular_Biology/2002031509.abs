solution structure of protein srp  of archaeoglobus fulgidus signal recognition particle edited by d draper
protein srp  is an essential rna binding component of the signal recognition particle srp in archaea and eucarya a three dimensional solution structure of the   residue srp  from the hyperthermophilic archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus designated as af  was determined by nmr spectroscopy af  contains three  strands two  helical regions arranged in a      topology a   helix and a disordered c terminal tail this fold is similar to the       rnp motif present in numerous other rna binding proteins which engage their cognate rnas using conserved sequence motifs present within  strands  and  mutagenesis studies of human srp  however reveal the major contact sites with srp rna reside within loops    and  these contacts were verified by the crystal structure of human srp  complexed to srp rna helix  reported subsequent to the submission of the manuscript the crystal structure also reveals that unlike canonical rnp motifs srp  does not engage specific rna bases through conserved sequence motifs present within  strands  and  instead srp  uses residues both within and flanking  strand  to stabilize the complex through direct and indirect contacts to the phosphate backbone of the tetraloop leaving the bases of the tetraloop exposed this coupled with the fact that srp  appears relatively rigid and undergoes only minor changes in structure upon rna binding may underlie the molecular basis by which srp  functions to initiate srp assembly
