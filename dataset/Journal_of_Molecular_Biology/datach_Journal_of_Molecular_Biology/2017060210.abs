mutant p  in cancer accumulation gain of function and therapy
tumor suppressor p  plays a central role in tumor suppression p  is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and over half of human cancers contain p  mutations majority of p  mutations in cancer are missense mutations leading to the expression of full length mutant p  mutp  protein while the critical role of wild type p  in tumor suppression has been firmly established mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor associated mutp  proteins not only lose the tumor suppressive function of wild type p  but also gain new activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild type p  termed gain of function mutant p  protein often accumulates to very high levels in tumors contributing to malignant progression recently mutp  has become an attractive target for cancer therapy further understanding of the mechanisms underlying mutp  protein accumulation and gain of function will accelerate the development of targeted therapies for human cancer harboring mutp  in this review we summarize the recent advances in the studies on mutp  protein accumulation and gain of function and targeted therapies for mutp  in human cancer
