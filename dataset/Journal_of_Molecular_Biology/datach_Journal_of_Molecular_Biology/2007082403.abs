experiments suggest that simulations may overestimate electrostatic contributions to the mechanical stability of a fibronectin type iii domain
steered molecular dynamics simulations have previously been used to investigate the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin the simulations suggest that the mechanical stability of the tenth type iii domain from fibronectin fnfn  is largely determined by a number of critical hydrogen bonds in the peripheral strands interestingly the simulations predict that lowering the ph from  to    will increase the mechanical stability of fnfn  significantly by     due to the protonation of a few key acidic residues in the a and b strands to test this simulation prediction we used single molecule atomic force microscopy afm to investigate the mechanical stability of fnfn  at neutral ph and at lower ph where these key residues have been shown to be protonated our afm experimental results show no difference in the mechanical stability of fnfn  at these different ph values these results suggest that some simulations may overestimate the role played by electrostatic interactions in determining the mechanical stability of proteins
