mechanism of translesion synthesis past an equine estrogen dna adduct by y family dna polymerases
hydroxyequilenin  ohen dc is a major potentially mutagenic dna adduct induced by equine estrogens used for hormone replacement therapy to study the miscoding property of  ohen dc and the involvement of y family human dna polymerases pols     and  in that process we incorporated  ohen dc into oligodeoxynucleotides and used them as templates in primer extension reactions catalyzed by pol    and   pol  inserted damp opposite  ohen dc accompanied by lesser amounts of dcmp and dtmp incorporation and base deletion pol  promoted base deletions as well as direct incorporation of damp and dcmp pol  worked in conjunction with pol   but not with pol   at a replication fork stalled by the adduct resulting in increased dtmp incorporation our results provide a direct evidence that y family dna pols can switch with one another during synthesis past the lesion no direct incorporation of dgmp the correct base was observed with y family enzymes the miscoding potency of  ohen dc may be associated with the development of reproductive cancers observed in women receiving hormone replacement therapy
