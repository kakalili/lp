biochemical characterization of the caenorhabditis elegans fbf  cpb  translational regulation complex identifies conserved protein interaction hotspots
caenorhabditis elegans cpb  cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein homolog  and fbf fem  mrna binding factor are evolutionary conserved regulators of mrna translation that belong to the cpeb cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding and puf pumilio and fbf protein families respectively in hermaphrodite worms cpb  and fbf control key steps during germline development including stem cell maintenance and sex determination while cpb  and fbf are known to interact the molecular basis and function of the cpb   fbf complex are not known the surface of cpb  that interacts with fbf was localized using in vivo and in vitro methods to a  residue region at the n terminus of the protein and these residues are present in the fbf binding protein gld  germline development defective   puf proteins are characterized by the presence of eight  helical repeats puf repeats arranged side by side in an elongated structure critical residues for cpb  binding are found in the extended loop that connects puf repeats  and  the same fbf residues also mediate binding to gld  indicating a conserved binding mode between different protein partners cpb  binding was competitive with gld  suggestive of mutual exclusivity in vivo rna binding measurements demonstrated that cpb  alters the affinity of fbf for specific rna sequences implying a functional model where the coregulatory protein cpb  modulates fbf target selection
