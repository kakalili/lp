crystal structure of  galactosidase from trichoderma reesei and its complex with galactose implications for catalytic mechanism
the crystal structures of  galactosidase from the mesophilic fungus trichoderma reesei and its complex with the competitive inhibitor   d galactose have been determined at    and    resolution respectively the  galactosidase structure was solved by the quick cryo soaking method using a single cs derivative the refined crystallographic model of the  galactosidase consists of two domains an n terminal catalytic domain of the     barrel topology and a c terminal domain which is formed by an antiparallel  structure the protein contains four n glycosylation sites located in the catalytic domain some of the oligosaccharides were found to participate in inter domain contacts the galactose molecule binds to the active site pocket located in the center of the barrel of the catalytic domain analysis of the  galactosidase galactose complex reveals the residues of the active site and offers a structural basis for identification of the putative mechanism of the enzymatic reaction the structure of the  galactosidase closely resembles those of the glycoside hydrolase family   the conservation of two catalytic asp residues identified for this family is consistent with a double displacement reaction mechanism for the  galactosidase modeling of possible substrates into the active site reveals specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions that could explain peculiarities of the enzyme kinetics
