nmr evidence for progressive stabilization of native like structure upon aggregation of acid denatured lysn edited by p e wright
the acid denatured form of the protein lysn aggregates reversibly at ph   the strength of self association increases with increasing cl  anion concentration at low concentrations of protein or cl  anion resonances of denatured lysn are in slow exchange with a minor form of the protein which shows native like nmr chemical shifts the minor native like resonances increase in intensity with increasing protein concentration demonstrating that a native like monomer fold is stabilized on aggregation of the acid denatured protein at high concentrations of protein or cl  anion interconversion between the major and minor resonances appears to shift from slow to intermediate exchange on the nmr timescale nmr line broadening is more pronounced for the major resonances of the denatured protein which show sigmoidal decay curves with increasing cl  concentration the mid points of the decay curves for residues in different parts of the molecule are non coincident we propose that differences in the nmr line broadening transitions of individual residues reflect a stepwise stabilization of native like structure on aggregation starting with the segments of the protein that form the initial association interface the resonances of the denatured protein with the greatest sensitivity to self association correspond roughly to those that are most perturbed in the native protein on binding of the natural substrate trnalys this suggests that the hydrophobic surfaces that promote intermolecular misfolding of acid denatured lysn may resemble those used for substrate binding by the native protein
