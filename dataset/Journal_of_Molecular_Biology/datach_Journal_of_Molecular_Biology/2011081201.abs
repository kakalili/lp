functional coupling between a distal interaction and the cleavage site in bacterial rnase p rna mediated cleavage
bacterial rnase p consists of one protein and one rna rnase p rna rpr  rpr can process trna precursors correctly in the absence of the protein here we have used model hairpin loop substrates corresponding to the acceptor t stem and t loop of a precursor trna to study the importance of the t loop structure in rpr alone reaction t stem loop tsl interacts with a region in rpr tsl binding site tbs  forming tsl tbs interaction altering the t loop structure affects both cleavage site selection and rate of cleavage at the correct site  and at the alternative site    the magnitude of variation depended on the structures of the t loop and the tbs region with as much as a   fold reduction in the rate of cleavage at   interestingly for one t loop structure mutant no difference in the rate at   was detected compared to cleavage of the substrate with an unchanged t loop indicating that in this case the altered t loop structure primarily influences events required for efficient cleavage at the correct site   we also provide data supporting a functional link between a productive tsl tbs interaction and events at the cleavage site collectively our findings emphasize the interplay between separate regions upon formation of a productive rpr substrate that leads to efficient and accurate cleavage these new data provide support for an induced fit mechanism in bacterial rpr mediated cleavage at the correct site
