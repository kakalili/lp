crystal structure of a cocaine binding antibody edited by d rees
murine monoclonal antibody gnc h was elicited by active immunization with a cocaine immunoconjugate and binds free cocaine with excellent specificity and moderate affinity improvement of affinity as well as humanization of gnc h  would be advantageous in immunopharmacotherapy for cocaine addiction and for emergency cases of drug overdose toward this end the crystal structure of an engineered murine human chimeric fab of gnc h complexed with cocaine was determined at    resolution structural analysis reveals a binding pocket with high shape and charge complementarity to the cocaine framework which explains the specificity for cocaine as opposed to the pharmacologically inactive cocaine metabolites importantly the structure provides a foundation for mutagenesis to enhance the binding affinity for cocaine and potent cocaine derivatives such as cocaethylene and for additional humanization of the antibody
