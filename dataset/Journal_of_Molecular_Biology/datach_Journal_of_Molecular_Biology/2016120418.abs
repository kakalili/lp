structural basis of novel iron uptake route and reaction intermediates in ferritins from gram negative bacteria
iron and oxygen chemistry is mediated by iron proteins for many biological functions carboxylate bridged diiron enzymes including ferritin have the common mechanism of oxygen activation via peroxodiferric intermediates however the route for iron uptake and the structural identification of intermediates still remain incomplete the  fold symmetry channel of helicobacter pylori ferritin was previously proposed as the iron uptake route in eubacteria but the amino acid residues at the  fold channel are not highly conserved here we show evidence for a short path for iron uptake from his  on the surface to the ferroxidase center in h pylori ferritin and escherichia coli ferritin the amino acid residues along this path are highly conserved in gram negative bacteria and some archaea and the mutants containing s a and h l showed significantly decreased iron oxidation surprisingly the e coli ferritin s a crystal structure showed oxygen binding and side on symmetric      peroxodiferric and oxodiferric intermediates the results provide the structural basis for understanding the chemical nature of intermediates in iron oxidation in bacteria and some of archaea
