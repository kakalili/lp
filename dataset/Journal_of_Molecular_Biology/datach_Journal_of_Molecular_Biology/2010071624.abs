the down regulation of the human myc gene by the nuclear hormone    dihydroxyvitamin d is associated with cycling of corepressors and histone deacetylases
myc is a pleiotropic transcription factor that coordinates the expression of diverse programs that are together necessary for the growth and expansion of somatic cells the nuclear hormone    dihydroxyvitamin d down regulates myc expression but the exact mechanism is still elusive we found in rwpe  normal human prostate cells that    dihydroxyvitamin d down regulates myc mrna with a periodicity of     min in silico screening of the myc gene locus identified six putative binding sites vitamin d response elements vdres  for the vitamin d receptor vdr  two of these vdres efficiently bound vdr  retinoid x receptor heterodimers in vitro and their genomic regions associated with vdr in rwpe  cells gene specific small inhibitory rna silencing indicated that basal myc mrna expression as well as its down regulation depended on the exchange factor tbl x transducer  like  x linked  the corepressor silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and histone deacetylases hdacs    and   assaying the association of these five proteins with the vdre containing genomic regions of the myc gene locus showed characteristic ligand dependent profiles of tbl x silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor hdac  and hdac  in particular on an evolutionarily conserved vdre in conclusion our data suggest that dynamically composed protein complexes that dock via vdr to the two vdres may explain the repression of the myc gene
