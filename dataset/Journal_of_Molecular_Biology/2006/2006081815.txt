Alongside the well-studied membrane spanning helices, α-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins contain several functionally and structurally important types of substructures. Here, existing 3D structures of transmembrane proteins have been used to define and study the concept of reentrant regions, i.e. membrane penetrating regions that enter and exit the membrane on the same side.We find that these regions can be divided into three distinct categories based on secondary structure motifs, namely long regions with a helix–coil–helix motif, regions of medium length with the structure helix–coil or coil–helix and regions of short to medium length consisting entirely of irregular secondary structure. The residues situated in reentrant regions are significantly smaller on average compared to other regions and reentrant regions can be detected in the inter-transmembrane loops with an accuracy of ∼70% based on their amino acid composition.Using TOP-MOD, a novel method for predicting reentrant regions, we have scanned the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The results suggest that more than 10% of transmembrane proteins contain reentrant regions and that the occurrence of reentrant regions increases linearly with the number of transmembrane regions. Reentrant regions seem to be most commonly found in channel proteins and least commonly in signal receptors.
