crystal structures of the clock protein ea from the silkworm bombyx mori
many insects pass the winter in an arrested developmental stage called diapause either as eggs as pupae or even as adults exposure to the prolonged cold of winter is required to permit awakening from diapause in the spring in the diapause eggs of the silkworm bombyx mori a metalloglycoprotein esterase a  ea  has been suggested to serve as a cold duration clock because its characteristic atpase activity is transiently elevated at the end of the necessary cold period this timer property of ea is known to start with the dissociation of an inhibitory peptide called  peptidyl inhibitory needle   under cold conditions but its time measuring mechanism is completely unknown here we present the crystal structures and functional properties of ea with and without glycosylation we show that ea is a homodimeric atpase with each subunit consisting of a copper  zinc superoxide dismutase fold there is an additional short n terminal region that is capable of binding one more copper ion suggesting a timer mechanism in which this ion is involved the sugar chain appears to reinforce the binding of peptidyl inhibitory needle which may in turn stabilize the initial conformation of the n terminal domain explaining the requirement for glycosylation and for the peptide to set the clock
