dopamine and the dopamine oxidation product   dihydroxylindole promote distinct on pathway and off pathway aggregation of  synuclein in a ph dependent manner
the deposition of  synuclein   syn aggregates in dopaminergic neurons is a key feature of parkinson s disease while dopamine da can modulate  syn aggregation it is unclear which other factors can regulate the actions of da on  syn in this study we investigated the effect of solution conditions buffer salt and ph on the oligomerization of  syn by da we show that  syn oligomerization is dependent on the oxidation of da into reactive intermediates under acidic ph conditions da is stable and da mediated oligomerization of  syn is inhibited from ph   to ph    da is unstable and undergoes redox reactions promoting the formation of sds resistant soluble oligomers of  syn we show that the reactive intermediate   dihydroxylindole mediates the formation of  syn soluble oligomers under physiological conditions ph    in contrast under acidic conditions ph      dihydroxylindole promotes the formation of sds resistant insoluble oligomers that further associate to form sheet like fibrils with  sheet structure that do not bind the dye thioflavin t these results suggest that distinct reactive intermediates of da and not da itself interact with  syn to generate the  syn aggregates implicated in parkinson s disease
