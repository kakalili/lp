iron incorporation in streptococcus suis dps like peroxide resistance protein dpr requires mobility in the ferroxidase center and leads to the formation of a ferrihydrite like core
the dps like peroxide resistance protein dpr is a dodecameric protein that protects the human and swine pathogen streptococcus suis from hydrogen peroxide by removing free fe  from the cytosol subsequent oxidation of iron by dpr results in the deposition of fe  inside the protein s central cavity structural changes that occur in the ferroxidase center were studied by x ray crystallography after soaking dpr crystals with fe  in the presence of sodium dithionite twelve iron binding sites were identified with each site formed by residues asp  and glu  from one subunit and asp  his  and his  from a  fold symmetry related subunit compared to the iron free dpr asp  and glu  were found to be the most flexible amino acid residues and able to adopt a variety of conformations in different subunits the crystal structure of an asp ala dpr mutant soaked with a fe  solution revealed variations in the asp  position and no iron bound to the ferroxidase center these results indicate an intrinsic flexibility in the active site that may be important for the catalytic reaction and subsequent nucleation events two iron cores with remarkably different features were identified in dpr using x ray absorption spectroscopy purified dpr was found to have a small size iron core with only    iron atoms dodecamer forming a ferritin like ferrihydrite structure because of its size this core represents the smallest iron core identified so far in ferritins and other dps like proteins a large size core     iron atoms dodecamer formed after incubating the protein with a ferrous solution shows differences in iron coordination compared to the small size core characterization of the two iron cores in dpr could provide insights into nucleation events and the mechanism of iron core growth in the dps family of proteins
