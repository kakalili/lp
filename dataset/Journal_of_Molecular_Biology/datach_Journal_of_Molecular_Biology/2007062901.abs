structure of the cytochrome b f complex quinone analogue inhibitors as ligands of heme cn
a native structure of the cytochrome b f complex with improved resolution was obtained from crystals of the complex grown in the presence of divalent cadmium two cd  binding sites with different occupancy were determined  i a higher affinity site cd  which bridges his  of cytochrome f and the acidic residue glu  of cyt b  in addition cd is coordinated by    h o or    cl   ii a second site cd  of lower affinity for which three identified ligands are asp  subunit iv  glu  petg subunit and glu  petm subunit binding sites of quinone analogue inhibitors were sought to map the pathway of transfer of the lipophilic quinone across the b f complex and to define the function of the novel heme cn two sites were found for the chromone ring of the tridecyl stigmatellin tds quinone analogue inhibitor one near the p side  fe s cluster a second tds site was found on the n side of the complex facing the quinone exchange cavity as an axial ligand of heme cn a similar binding site proximal to heme cn was found for the n side inhibitor nqno binding of these inhibitors required their addition to the complex before lipid used to facilitate crystallization the similar binding of nqno and tds as axial ligands to heme cn implies that this heme utilizes plastoquinone as a natural ligand thus defining an electron transfer complex consisting of hemes bn cn and pq and the pathway of n side reduction of the pq pool the nqno binding site explains several effects associated with its inhibitory action the negative shift in heme cn midpoint potential the increased amplitude of light induced heme bn reduction and an altered epr spectrum attributed to interaction between hemes cn and bn a decreased extent of heme cn reduction by reduced ferredoxin in the presence of nqno allows observation of the heme cn soret band in a chemical difference spectrum
