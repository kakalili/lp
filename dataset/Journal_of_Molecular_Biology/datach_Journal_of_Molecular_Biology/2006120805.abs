serpin of arabidopsis thaliana is a suicide inhibitor for metacaspase
metacaspases are distant relatives of animal caspases found in plants fungi and protozoa we demonstrated previously that two type ii metacaspases of arabidopsis thaliana atmc and atmc are arg lys specific cysteine dependent proteases we screened a combinatorial tetrapeptide library of     substrates with atmc  here we show that atmc is a strict arg lys specific protease based on the position specific scoring matrix derived from the substrate library results the tetrapeptide val arg pro arg was identified as an optimized substrate atmc had a kcat km of     m   s   for ac val arg pro arg amido  methyl coumarin representing a more than  fold improvement over existing fluorogenic substrates a yeast two hybrid screen with catalytically inactive atmc as bait identified a serine protease inhibitor designated atserpin  which was found to be a potent inhibitor of atmc activity in vitro through cleavage of its reactive center loop and covalent binding to atmc  on the basis of the substrate profiling of atmc and confirmation through site directed mutagenesis the inhibitory p p cleavage site of atserpin was determined to be ile lys leu arg   further mutagenesis of the atserpin inhibitory cleavage site modulated atmc inhibition positively or negatively both atmc and atserpin were localized in the extracellular space suggesting an in vivo interaction as well to our knowledge this is the first report of plant protease inhibition by a plant serpin
