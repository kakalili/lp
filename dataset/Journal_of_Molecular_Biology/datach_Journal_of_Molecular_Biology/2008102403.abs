the tim  tim  complex has multiple substrate binding sites and binds cooperatively to tim
the tim  tim  complex located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space functions in the tim  import pathway that mediates the import of the mitochondrial carriers tim  tim  and tim  into the mitochondrial inner membrane the tim  tim  complex assembles as a hexamer and binds to the substrate tim  to chaperone the hydrophobic tim  across the aqueous intermembrane space however both structural features of the tim  tim  complex and the binding interaction to tim  remain poorly defined the crystal structure of the yeast tim  tim  complex reported here at     resolution reveals that the architecture of the tim  tim  complex is similar to those of other chaperones such as tim  tim  prefoldin and skp in which long helices extend from a central body like tentacles from a jellyfish surface plasmon resonance was applied to investigate interactions between the tim  tim  complex and tim  the tim  tim  complex contained approximately six binding sites and showed a complex binding interaction indicative of positive cooperativity rather than a simple bimolecular interaction by combining results from the structural and binding studies we provide a molecular model of the tim  tim  complex binding to tim  the regions where the tentacle helices attach to the body of the tim  tim  complex contain six hydrophobic pockets that likely interact with specific sequences of tim  and possibly other substrates smaller hydrophobic patches on the tentacles themselves likely interact nonspecifically with the substrate s transmembrane helices shielding it from the aqueous intermembrane space the central region of tim  which enters the intermembrane space first may serve to nucleate the binding of the tim  tim  complex thereby initiating the chaperoned translocation of tim  to the mitochondrial inner membrane
