Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin/cadherin5) is specifically expressed in adherens junctions of endothelial cells and exerts important functions in cell–cell adhesion as well as signal transduction. To analyze the mechanism of VE-cadherin homoassociation, the ectodomains CAD1-5 were connected by linker sequences to the N terminus of the coiled-coil domain of cartilage matrix protein (CMP). The chimera VECADCMP were expressed in mammalian cells. The trimeric coiled-coil domain leads to high intrinsic domain concentrations and multivalency promoting self-association. Ca2+-dependent homophilic association of VECADCMP was detected in solid phase assays and cross-linking experiments. A striking analogy to homoassociation of type I (“classical”) cadherins like E, N or P-cadherin was observed when interactions in VECADCMP and between these trimeric proteins were analyzed by electron microscopy. Ca2+-dependent ring-like and double ring-like arrangements suggest interactions between domains 1 and 2 of the ectodomains, which may be correlated with lateral and adhesive contacts in the adhesion process. Association to complexes composed of two VECADCMP molecules was also demonstrated by chemical cross-linking. No indication for an antiparallel association of VECAD ectodomains to hexameric complexes as proposed by Legrand et al. was found. Instead the data suggest that homoassociation of VE-cadherin follows the conserved mechanism of type I cadherins.
