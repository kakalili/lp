transcription profile of thermus thermophilus crispr systems after phage infection
the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr systems composed of dna direct repeats designated as crisprs and several crispr associated cas genes which are present in many prokaryotic genomes make up a host defense system against invading foreign replicons such as phages in order to investigate the altered expression profiles of the systems after phage infection using a model organism thermus thermophilus hb  which has  crispr loci genome wide transcription profiling of the strain infected with lytic phage  ys  was performed by dna microarray analysis significant alteration of overall mrna expression gradually increased during infection i e  from the eclipse period to the period of host cell lysis  interestingly the expression of most camp receptor protein crp  regulated genes including two crispr associated cas operons was most markedly up regulated especially around the beginning of host cell lysis although up regulation of the crp gene was not observed the expression of the crp regulated genes was less up regulated in a crp deficient strain than in the wild type thus it is suggested that camp is a signaling molecule that transmits information on phage infection to crp to up regulate these genes on the other hand the expression of several cas genes and that of crisprs were up regulated independent of crp suggesting the involvement of unidentified regulatory factor s induced by phage infection on analysis of the expression profile of the entire genome we could speculate that upon phage infection the signal was transmitted to the cells with host response systems including crispr defense systems being activated while the overall efficiencies of transcription translation and metabolism in the cells decreased these findings will facilitate understanding of the host response mechanism following phage infection
