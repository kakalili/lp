To determine if variable sequences (spacers) between conserved positions in a sequence motif or pattern share a consensus structure, three-dimensional structures containing PROSITE patterns with spacers of fixed length greater than three residues were analyzed. Structural similarities of a given pattern were evaluated by computing the backbone φ, ψ and side-chain χ1 dihedral order parameters. The exact bias information in analyzing the conformational variability of the patterns was taken into account by introducing a new parameter, the bias coefficient, which describes the number and distribution of residue types found at each position of a pattern in the structures. The results of the analyses show that backbone conformational heterogeneity at a given position in a sequence motif does not necessarily correlate with the residue-type variability at that position, and the long spacer region can adopt a well-defined backbone conformation, in addition to the conserved residues. Furthermore, a PROSITE pattern may be redefined to yield two or more “refined” regular expressions, each corresponding to a distinct backbone conformation. A way in which the observed structural consensus in a pattern may be employed to improve the accuracy of function prediction from sequence is suggested.
