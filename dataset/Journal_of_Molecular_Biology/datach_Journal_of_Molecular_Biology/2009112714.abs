relb and rele of escherichia coli form a tight complex that represses transcription via the ribbon  helix  helix motif in relb
relb the ribbon  helix  helix rhh repressor encoded by the relbe toxin  antitoxin locus of escherichia coli interacts with rele and thereby counteracts the mrna cleavage activity of rele in addition relb dimers repress the strong relbe promoter and this repression by relb is enhanced by rele that is rele functions as a transcriptional co repressor relb is a lon protease substrate and lon is required both for activation of relbe transcription and for activation of the mrna cleavage activity of rele here we characterize the molecular interactions important for transcriptional control of the relbe model operon using an in vivo screen for relb mutants we identified multiple nucleotide changes that map to important amino acid positions within the dna binding domain formed by the n terminal rhh motif of relb analysis of dna binding of a subset of these mutant rhh proteins by gel shift assays transcriptional fusion assays and a structure model of relb  dna revealed amino acid residues making crucial dna  backbone contacts within the operator relo dna mutational and footprinting analyses of relo showed that relb dimers bind on the same face of the dna helix and that the rhh motif recognizes four  bp repeats within the bipartite binding site the spacing between each half site was found to be essential for cooperative interactions between adjacently bound relb dimers stabilized by the co repressor rele kinetic and stoichiometric measurements of the interaction between relb and rele confirmed that the proteins form a high affinity complex with a   stoichiometry lon degraded relb in vitro and degradation was inhibited by rele consistent with the proposal that rele protects relb from proteolysis by lon in vivo
