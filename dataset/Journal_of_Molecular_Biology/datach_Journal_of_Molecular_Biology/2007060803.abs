aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator and upstream stimulatory factor regulate cytochrome p   a transcription through a common e box site
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator arnt belongs to the basic helix loop helix bhlh transcription factors and regulates several genes as heterodimers with other bhlh proteins arnt is also able to homodimerize but no mammalian target genes for the homodimer have been shown we identified a palindromic e box element in the   regulatory region of the murine cytochrome p   cyp  a gene that was found to be important for cyp a transcription in primary hepatocytes and was found by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to interact with arnt electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments with in vitro translated arnt showed binding without heterodimerization partner indicating binding as a homodimer transfection studies in wild type and arnt deficient hepa  cells revealed that arnt expression is necessary for full activity of the cyp a promoter in the liver specific arnt null mouse line the level of hepatic cyp a mrna was decreased significantly co transfection studies with an arnt expression vector lacking the transactivation domain tad demonstrated that the arnt tad is needed for cyp a activation which suggests that arnt transactivates cyp a as a homodimer in primary hepatocytes the mrna levels of both cyp a and arnt splice variant  were increased during cultivation upstream stimulatory factors  and a were also able to bind to the same e box as arnt indicating that there may be competition for dna binding between these factors indeed the upstream stimulatory factors activated the cyp a promoter through the e box only in the presence of hepatocyte nuclear factor   while arnt transactivation was independent of hepatocyte nuclear factor   in conclusion these results indicate that arnt controls cyp a transcription and thus for the first time suggest active involvement of the arnt homodimer in mammalian gene regulation
