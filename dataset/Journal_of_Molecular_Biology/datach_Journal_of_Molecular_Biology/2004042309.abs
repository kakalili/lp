early events during folding of wild type staphylococcal nuclease and a single tryptophan variant studied by ultrarapid mixing
a continuous flow mixing device with a dead time of    s coupled with intrinsic tryptophan and  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonate ans fluorescence was used to monitor structure formation during early stages of the folding of staphylococcal nuclease snase  a variant with a unique tryptophan fluorophore in the n terminal  barrel domain trp  snase was obtained by replacing the single trp  in wild type snase with his in combination with trp substitution of phe  a common background of p g p  g and h  l mutations was chosen in order to stabilize the protein and prevent accumulation of cis proline isomers under native conditions in contrast to wt  snase which shows no changes in tryptophan fluorescence prior to the rate limiting folding step     ms  the f w w  h variant shows additional changes enhancement during an early folding phase with a time constant of   s both proteins exhibit a major increase in ans fluorescence and identical rates for this early folding event these findings are consistent with the rapid accumulation of an ensemble of states containing a loosely packed hydrophobic core involving primarily the  barrel domain while the specific interactions in the  helical domain involving trp  are formed only during the final stages of folding the fact that both variants exhibit the same number of kinetic phases with very similar rates confirms that the folding mechanism is not perturbed by the f w w  h mutations however the trp at position  reports on the rapid formation of a hydrophobic cluster in the n terminal  sheet region while the wild type trp  is silent during this early stage of folding quantitative modeling of the un folding kinetics and thermodynamics of these two proteins versus urea concentration revealed that the f w w  h mutation selectively destabilizes the native state relative to wt  snase while the stability of transient intermediates remains unchanged leading to accumulation of intermediates under equilibrium conditions at moderate denaturant concentrations
