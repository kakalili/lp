The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is the major exporter of Ca2+ across the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes. The activity of the exchanger is regulated by a large intracellular loop that contains two Ca2+-binding domains, calcium-binding domain (CBD) 1 and CBD2. CBD1 binds Ca2+ with much higher affinity than CBD2 and is considered to be the primary Ca2+ sensor. The effect of Ca2+ on the structure and dynamics of CBD1 has been characterized by NMR spectroscopy using chemical shifts, residual dipolar couplings, and spin relaxation. Residual dipolar couplings are used in a new way for residue selection in the determination of the anisotropic rotational diffusion tensor from spin relaxation data. The results provide a highly consistent description across these complementary data sets and show that Ca2+ binding is accompanied by a selective conformational change among the binding site residues. Residues that exhibit a significant conformational change are also sites of altered dynamics. In particular, Ca2+ binding restricts the mobility of the major acidic segment and affects the dynamics of several nearby binding loops. These observations indicate that Ca2+ elicits a local transition to a well-ordered coordination geometry in the CBD1-binding site.
