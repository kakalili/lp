structure of the flexible amino terminal domain of prion protein bound to a sulfated glycan
the intrinsically disordered amino proximal domain of hamster prion protein prp contains four copies of a highly conserved octapeptide sequence phgggwgq that is flanked by two polycationic residue clusters this n terminal domain mediates the binding of sulfated glycans which can profoundly influence the conversion of prp to pathological forms and the progression of prion disease to investigate the structural consequences of sulfated glycan binding we performed multidimensional heteronuclear  h  c  n nmr nuclear magnetic resonance  circular dichroism cd  and fluorescence studies on hamster prp residues      prp      and fragments thereof when bound to pentosan polysulfate pps  while the majority of prp     remain disordered upon pps binding the octarepeat region adopts a repeating loop  turn structure that we have determined by nmr the  like turns within the repeats are corroborated by cd data demonstrating that these turns are also present although less pronounced without pps binding to pps exposes a hydrophobic surface composed of aligned tryptophan side chains the spacing and orientation of which are consistent with a self association or ligand binding site the unique tryptophan motif was probed by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence which displayed enhanced fluorescence of prp     when bound to pps consistent with the alignment of tryptophan side chains chemical shift mapping identified binding sites on prp     for pps which include the octarepeat histidine and an n terminal basic cluster previously linked to sulfated glycan binding these data may in part explain how sulfated glycans modulate prp conformational conversions and oligomerizations
