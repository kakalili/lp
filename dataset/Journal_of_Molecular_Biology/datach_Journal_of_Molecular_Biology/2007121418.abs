predicting knot or catenane type of site specific recombination products
site specific recombination on supercoiled circular dna yields a variety of knotted or catenated products here we present a topological model of this process and characterize all possible products of the most common substrates unknots unlinks and torus knots and catenanes this model tightly prescribes the knot or catenane type of previously uncharacterized data we also discuss how the model helps to distinguish products of distributive recombination and in some cases determine the order of processive recombination products
