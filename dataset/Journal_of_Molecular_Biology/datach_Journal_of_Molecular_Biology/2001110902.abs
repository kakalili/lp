crystal structure of a protein repair methyltransferase from pyrococcus furiosus with its l isoaspartyl peptide substrate edited by i a wilson
protein l isoaspartyl d aspartyl methyltransferases ec      are found in almost all organisms these enzymes catalyze the s adenosylmethionine adomet dependent methylation of isomerized and racemized aspartyl residues in age damaged proteins as part of an essential protein repair process here we report crystal structures of the repair methyltransferase at resolutions up to    from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus refined structures include binary complexes with the active cofactor adomet its reaction product s adenosylhomocysteine adohcy  and adenosine the enzyme places the methyl donating cofactor in a deep electrostatically negative pocket that is shielded from solvent across the multiple crystal structures visualized the presence or absence of the methyl group on the cofactor correlates with a significant conformational change in the enzyme in a loop bordering the active site suggesting a role for motion in catalysis or cofactor exchange we also report the structure of a ternary complex of the enzyme with adenosine and the methyl accepting polypeptide substrate vyp l isoasp ha at     the substrate binds in a narrow active site cleft with three of its residues in an extended conformation suggesting that damaged proteins may be locally denatured during the repair process in cells manual and computer based docking studies on different isomers help explain how the enzyme uses steric effects to make the critical distinction between normal l aspartyl and age damaged l isoaspartyl and d aspartyl residues
