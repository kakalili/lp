mis  independently recognizes histone h and the cenp acnp specific chaperone scm sp
cenp a is a centromere specific histone h variant that is required for kinetochore assembly and accurate chromosome segregation for it to function properly cenp a must be specifically localized to centromeres in fission yeast scm sp and the mis  complex composed of mis  eic  and mis  function as a cenp acnp specific chaperone and a recruiting factor respectively and together ensure accurate delivery of cenp acnp to centromeres although how scm sp specifically recognizes cenp acnp has been revealed recently the recruiting mechanism of cenp acnp via the mis  complex remains unknown in this study we have determined crystal structures of schizosaccharomyces japonicus mis  alone and in complex with the helix  of histone h  h    crystal structures followed by mutant analysis and affinity pull downs have revealed that mis  recognizes both h   and scm sp independently within the cenp acnp h scm sp complex this observation suggests that mis  gains cenp acnp specificity by recognizing both scm sp and histone h  our studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying specific recruitment of cenp acnp h scm sp into centromeres
