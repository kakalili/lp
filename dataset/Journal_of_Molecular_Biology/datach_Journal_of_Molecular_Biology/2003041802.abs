the caenorhabditis elegans homologue of down syndrome critical region  rcn  inhibits multiple functions of the phosphatase calcineurin
a conserved family of calcineurin regulating proteins whose members have been implicated in several disease models such as down syndrome alzheimer s disease and cardiac hypertrophy has been identified in several organisms including yeast mice and humans we have characterized caenorhabditis elegans rcn  which belongs to this family of calcineurin regulators and shows approximately   identity with the human homologue dscr  rcn  is expressed in hypodermal cells nerve cords and various neurons vulva epithelial and muscle cells marginal cells of the pharynx and structures of the male tail rcn  expression is upregulated by calcineurin activity rcn  binds to calcineurin a from c elegans lysate in a calcium dependent manner and inhibits bovine calcineurin phosphatase activity dose dependently in addition overexpression of rcn  results in calcineurin deficient phenotypes such as small body size cuticle defects fertility defects slow growth and serotonin resistant egg laying defects moreover phenotypes observed in gain of function calcineurin mutant animals were restored to normal by rcn  overexpression these results demostrate an effective and specific inhibition of calcineurin in vitro as well as in vivo by rcn
