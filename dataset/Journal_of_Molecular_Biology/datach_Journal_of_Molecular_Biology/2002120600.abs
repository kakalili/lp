solution structure and ligand recognition of the ww domain pair of the yeast splicing factor prp
the yeast splicing factor pre mrna processing protein   prp  comprises two n terminal ww domains separated by a ten residue linker and six consecutive ff domains in the spliceosome the prp  ww domains participate in cross intron bridging by interacting with proline rich regions present in the branch point binding protein bbp and the u small nuclear ribonucleoprotein component prp  furthermore binding of prp  to the phosphorylated c terminal domain ctd of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii is thought to link splicing to transcription to gain insight into this complex interaction network we have determined the solution structure of the tandem prp  ww domains by nmr spectroscopy and performed chemical shift mapping experiments with different proline rich peptides the ww domains each adopt the characteristic triple stranded  sheet structure and are connected by a stable  helical linker on the basis of a detailed analysis of residual dipolar couplings rdc and  n relaxation data we show that the tandem prp  ww domains behave in solution as a single folded unit with unique alignment and diffusion tensor respectively using  h   n rdcs we were able to accurately define the relative orientation of the ww domains revealing that the binding pockets of each domain face opposite sides of the structure furthermore we found that both prp  ww domains interact with ppxy motifs where x is any residue present in peptides derived from the splicing factors bbp and prp  moreover the prp  ww domains are shown to bind proline rich peptides devoid of aromatic residues which are also recognised by the abl sh domain and the ww domain of the mammalian prp  orthologue formin binding protein   in contrast no interaction was observed between the prp  ww domains and the ctd repeats used in this work
