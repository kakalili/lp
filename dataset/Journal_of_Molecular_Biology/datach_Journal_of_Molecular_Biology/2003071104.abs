the crystal structure of af   a protein from archaeoglobus fulgidus with homology to the non histone domain of macroh a
macroh a is an unusual histone h a variant that has an extensive c terminal tail that comprises approximately two thirds of the protein the c terminal non histone domain of macroh a is also found in a number of other proteins and has been termed the macro domain here we report the crystal structure to    of af   a protein consisting of a stand alone macro domain from archaeoglobus fulgidus the structure has a mixed    fold that closely resembles the n terminal dna binding domain of the escherichia coli leucine aminopeptidase pepa the structure also shows some similarity to members of the p loop family of nucleotide hydrolases
