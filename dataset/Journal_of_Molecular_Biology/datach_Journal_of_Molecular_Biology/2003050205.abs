crystal structure of proteus vulgaris chondroitin sulfate abc lyase i at    resolution
chondroitin sulfate abc lyase i from proteus vulgaris is an endolytic broad specificity glycosaminoglycan lyase which degrades chondroitin chondroitin  sulfate dermatan sulfate chondroitin  sulfate and hyaluronan by  elimination of   hexosaminidic bond to unsaturated disaccharides and tetrasaccharides its structure revealed three domains the n terminal domain has a fold similar to that of carbohydrate binding domains of xylanases and some lectins the middle and c terminal domains are similar to the structures of the two domain chondroitin lyase ac and bacterial hyaluronidases although the middle domain shows a very low level of sequence identity with the catalytic domains of chondroitinase ac and hyaluronidase the residues implicated in catalysis of the latter enzymes are present in chondroitinase abc i the substrate binding site in chondroitinase abc i is in a wide open cleft consistent with the endolytic action pattern of this enzyme the tryptophan residues crucial for substrate binding in chondroitinase ac and hyaluronidases are lacking in chondroitinase abc i the structure of chondroitinase abc i provides a framework for probing specific functions of active site residues for understanding the remarkably broad specificity of this enzyme and perhaps engineering a desired specificity the electron density map showed clearly that the deposited dna sequence for residues      of chondroitin abc lyase i the segment containing two putative active site residues contains a frame shift error resulting in an incorrectly translated amino acid sequence
