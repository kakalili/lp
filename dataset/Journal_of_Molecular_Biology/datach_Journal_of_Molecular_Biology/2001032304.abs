effects of ligand binding on the association properties and conformation in solution of retinoic acid receptors rxr and rar edited by m f moody
in higher eukaryotes vitamin a derived metabolites such as  cis and all trans retinoic acid ra  are involved in the regulation of several essential physiological processes their pleiotropic physiological effects are mediated through direct binding to cognate nuclear receptors rxrs and rars that act as regulated transcription factors belonging to the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors hormone binding to the structurally conserved ligand binding domain lbd of these receptors triggers a conformational change that principally affects the conserved c terminal transactivation helix h  involved in transcriptional activation we report an extensive biophysical solution study of rar  rxr  lbds and their corresponding rxr  rar  lbd heterodimers combining analytical ultracentrifugation auc  small angle x ray and neutron scattering saxs and sans and ab initio three dimensional shape reconstruction at low resolution we show that the crystal structures of rxrs and rars lbds correlate well with the average conformations observed in solution furthermore we demonstrate the effects of  cisra and all transra binding on the association properties and conformations of rxr  and rar  lbds in solution the present study shows that in solution rar  lbd behaves as a monomer in both unliganded and liganded forms it confirms the existence in solution of a ligand induced conformational change towards a more compact form of the lbd it also confirms the stability of the predicted rxr  rar  lbd heterodimers in solution sas measurements performed on three different types of rxr  rar  lbd heterodimers apo apo apo holo and holo holo with respect to their ligand binding site occupancy show the existence of three conformational states depending on the progressive binding of ra stereoisomers on rar  and rxr  lbd subunits in the heterodimeric context these results suggest that the subunits are structurally independent within the heterodimers our study also underlines the particular behaviour of rxr  lbd in solution unliganded rxr  lbd is observed as two species that are unambiguously identified as homotetramers and homodimers molecular modelling combined with sas data analysis allows us to propose a structural model for this autorepressed apo tetramer in contrast to the monomeric state observed in the crystal structure our data show that in solution active holo rxr  lbd bound to  cisra is a homodimer regardless of the protein concentration this study demonstrates the crucial role of ligands in the regulation of homodimeric versus heterodimeric association state of rxr in the nr signalling pathways
