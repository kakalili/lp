nmr solution structure of hpar  reveals similarity to the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase domain of the mitotic regulator hpin but indicates a different functionality of the protein edited by a fersht
the   amino acid residue parvulin like human peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase ppiase hpar  was shown to exhibit sequence similarity to the regulator enzyme for cell cycle transitions human hpin  but specificity for catalyzing pser thr pro cis trans isomerizations was lacking to determine the solution structure of hpar  the h  c and  n chemical shifts of this protein have been assigned using heteronuclear two and three dimensional nmr experiments on unlabeled and uniformly  n  c labeled recombinant protein isolated from escherichia coli cells that overexpress the protein the chemical shift assignments were used to interpret the noe data which resulted in a total of   noe restraints the noe restraints were used along with  dihedral angle restraints and  hydrogen bonding restraints to produce  low energy structures the hpar  folds into a       structure and contains an unstructured  amino acid basic tail n terminal to the catalytic core that replaces the ww domain of hpin homologs the three dimensional structures of hpar  and the ppiase domain of human hpin reveal a high degree of conservation the root mean square deviations of the mean atomic coordinates of the heavy atoms of the backbone between residues  to    to    to    to     to   and   to   of hpar  were         the hpar  model structure provides insight into how this class of ppiases may select preferential secondary catalytic sites and also allows identification of a putative dna binding motif in parvulin like ppiases
