molecular characterization of htlv  tax interaction with the kix domain of cbp p
the viral oncoprotein tax mediates transcriptional activation of human t cell leukemia virus type  htlv   both tax and the cellular transcription factor creb bind to viral cyclic amp response elements vcres located in the viral promoter tax and serine   phosphorylated creb pcreb bound to the htlv  promoter facilitate viral transcription via the recruitment of the large cellular coactivators cbp p   while the interaction between the phosphorylated kinase inducible domain pkid of pcreb and the kix domain of cbp p  has been well characterized the molecular interactions between kix full length tax and pcreb have not been examined here we biochemically characterized the interaction between tax and kix in a physiologically relevant complex containing pcreb and vcre dna our data show that tax and pcreb simultaneously and independently bind two distinct surfaces on the kix domain tax binds kix at the previously characterized mixed lineage leukemia mll protein interaction surface while pcreb binds kix at the pkid  kix interface these results provide evidence for a model in which tax and pcreb bind distinct surfaces of kix for effective cbp p  recruitment to the htlv  promoter we also show that mll competes with tax for kix binding suggesting a novel mechanism of tax oncogenesis in which normal mll function is disrupted by tax
