the surface location of individual residues in a bacterial s layer protein
bacterial surface layer s layer proteins self assemble into large two dimensional crystalline lattices that form the outermost cell wall component of all archaea and many eubacteria despite being a large class of self assembling proteins little is known about their molecular architecture we investigated the s layer protein sbsb from geobacillus stearothermophilus pv  p to identify residues located at the subunit  subunit interface and to determine the s layer s topology twenty three single cysteine mutants which were previously mapped to the surface of the sbsb monomer were subjected to a cross linking screen using the photoactivatable sulfhydryl reactive reagent n   p azidosalicylamido butyl       pyridyldithio propionamide gel electrophoretic analysis on the formation of cross linked dimers indicated that  out of the  residues were located at the interface in combination with surface accessibility data for the assembled protein   residues were assigned to positions at the inner cell wall facing lattice surface while  residues were mapped to the outer ambient exposed lattice surface in addition the cross linking screen identified six positions of intramolecular cross linking within the assembled protein but not in the monomeric s layer protein most likely these intramolecular cross links result from conformational changes upon self assembly the results are an important step toward the further structural elucidation of the s layer protein via for example x ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy our approach of identifying the surface location of residues is relevant to other planar supramolecular protein assemblies
