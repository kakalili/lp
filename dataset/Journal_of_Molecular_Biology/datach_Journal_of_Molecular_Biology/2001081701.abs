solution structure and function of a conserved protein sp   encoded by an essential streptococcus pneumoniae gene edited by m f summers
streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that causes high mortality and morbidity rates and has developed resistance to many antibiotics the genome of s pneumoniae has recently been completely sequenced revealing many genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown function we have found that the gene encoding one such conserved protein sp   is essential for growth of s pneumonia since it is essential sp   represents a potential target for drug discovery here we describe the three dimensional solution structure of sp   as determined by nmr spectroscopy the structure consists of two domains each with an    fold the n terminal domain contains two  helices and a three stranded  sheet while the c terminal domain is composed of one  helix and a five stranded  sheet the n terminal domain of the protein contains a highly negatively charged surface and resembles the fold of the n terminal domain of thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein s  the c terminal domain has a protein fold similar to human small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sm d and haloarcula marismortui ribosomal protein l e the two domains of the protein tumble in solution overall as a whole with an overall molecular rotational correlation time  m of   ns at   c the relative orientation of the two domains is not defined by the nuclear overhauser effect data indeed residual dipolar couplings and the structure calculations indicate that the relative orientation of the two domains is not rigidly oriented with respect to one another in solution
