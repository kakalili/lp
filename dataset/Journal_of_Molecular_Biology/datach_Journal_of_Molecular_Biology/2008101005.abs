hypertonia associated protein trak is a novel regulator of endosome to lysosome trafficking
hypertonia which is characterized by stiff gait abnormal posture jerky movements and tremor is associated with a number of neurological disorders including cerebral palsy dystonia parkinson s disease stroke and spinal cord injury recently a spontaneous mutation in the gene encoding trafficking protein kinesin binding  trak  was identified as the genetic defect that causes hypertonia in mice the subcellular localization and biological function of trak remain unclear here we report that trak interacts with hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate hrs  an essential component of the endosomal sorting and trafficking machinery double label immunofluorescence confocal studies show that the endogenous trak protein partially colocalizes with hrs on early endosomes like hrs both overexpression and small interfering rna mediated knockdown of trak inhibit degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor receptors through a block in endosome to lysosome trafficking our findings support a role for trak in the regulation of hrs mediated endosomal sorting and have important implications for understanding hypertonia associated with neurological disorders
