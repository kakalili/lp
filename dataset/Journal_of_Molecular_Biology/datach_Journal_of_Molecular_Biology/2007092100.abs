the crystal and solution studies of glucosamine  phosphate synthase from candida albicans
glucosamine  phosphate glcn  p synthase is an ubiquitous enzyme that catalyses the first committed step in the reaction pathway that leads to formation of uridine   diphospho n acetyl d glucosamine udp glcnac  a precursor of macromolecules that contain amino sugars despite sequence similarities the enzyme in eukaryotes is tetrameric whereas in prokaryotes it is a dimer the activity of eukaryotic glcn  p synthase known as gfa p is regulated by feedback inhibition by udp glcnac the end product of the reaction pathway whereas in prokaryotes the glcn  p synthase known as glms is not regulated at the post translational level in bacteria and fungi the enzyme is essential for cell wall synthesis in human the enzyme is a mediator of insulin resistance for these reasons gfa p is a target in anti fungal chemotherapy and in therapeutics for type  diabetes the crystal structure of the gfa p isomerase domain from candida albicans has been analysed in complex with the allosteric inhibitor udp glcnac and in the presence of glucose  phosphate fructose  phosphate and an analogue of the reaction intermediate  amino  deoxy d mannitol  phosphate admp  a solution structure of the native gfa p has been deduced using small angle x ray scattering saxs  the tetrameric gfa p can be described as a dimer of dimers with each half similar to the related enzyme from escherichia coli the core of the protein consists of the isomerase domains udp glcnac binds together with a metal cation in a well defined pocket on the surface of the isomerase domain the residues responsible for tetramerisation and for binding udp glcnac are conserved only among eukaryotic sequences comparison with the previously studied glms from e coli reveals differences as well as similarities in the isomerase active site this study of gfa p focuses on the features that distinguish it from the prokaryotic homologue in terms of quaternary structure control of the enzymatic activity and details of the isomerase active site
