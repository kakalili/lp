the assembly pathway of an icosahedral single stranded rna virus depends on the strength of inter subunit attractions
the strength of attraction between capsid proteins cps of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ccmv is controlled by the solution ph additionally the strength of attraction between cp and the single stranded rna viral genome is controlled by ionic strength by exploiting these properties we are able to control and monitor the in vitro co assembly of ccmv cp and single stranded rna as a function of the strength of cp  cp and cp  rna attractions using the techniques of velocity sedimentation and electron microscopy we find that the successful assembly of nuclease resistant virus like particles vlps depends delicately on the strength of cp  cp attraction relative to cp  rna attraction if the attractions are too weak the capsid cannot form if they are too strong the assembly suffers from kinetic traps separating the process into two steps  by first turning on cp  rna attraction and then turning on cp  cp attraction  allows for the assembly of well formed vlps under a wide range of attraction strengths these observations establish a protocol for the efficient in vitro assembly of ccmv vlps and suggest potential strategies that the virus may employ in vivo
