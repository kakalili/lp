Bacteriophage T4 middle-mode transcription requires Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, phage-encoded transcriptional activator MotA and co-activator AsiA that form a complex at a middle promoter DNA. T4 middle promoters have been defined by a consensus sequence deduced from the list of 14 middle promoters identified in earlier studies. To date, 33 middle promoters have been mapped on the T4 genome. Of these, 12 contain differences even at the highly conserved positions of the consensus sequence. In the T4 prereplicative gene cluster between genes e and rpbA, we have identified 12 new middle promoters, most of which contain differences from the consensus sequence deduced previously. Analysis of base conservation in the different sequence positions of new middle promoters, as well as those identified previously, revealed some new features of middle T4 promoters. We propose to define these promoters by a MotA box (a/t)(a/t)(a/t)TGCTTtA centred at the position −30, the sequence TAtaAT centred at −10 relative to the transcriptional start site, and the spacer region of 12(±1) base-pairs between them.
