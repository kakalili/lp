characterization of membrane protein interactions by isothermal titration calorimetry
understanding the structure folding and interaction of membrane proteins requires experimental tools to quantify the association of transmembrane tm helices here we introduce isothermal titration calorimetry itc to measure integrin  iib  tm complex affinity to study the consequences of helix  helix preorientation in lipid bilayers and to examine protein induced lipid reorganization phospholipid bicelles served as membrane mimics the association of  iib  proceeded with a free energy change of       kcal mol at bicelle conditions where the sampling of random helix  helix orientations leads to complex formation at bicelle conditions that approach a true bilayer structure in effect an entropy saving of gt kcal mol was obtained from helix  helix preorientation the magnitudes of enthalpy and entropy changes increased distinctly with bicelle dimensions indicating long range changes in bicelle lipid properties upon  iib  tm association nmr spectroscopy confirmed itc affinity measurements and revealed  iib  association and dissociation rates of     s   and     s   respectively thus itc is able to provide comprehensive insight into the interaction of membrane proteins
