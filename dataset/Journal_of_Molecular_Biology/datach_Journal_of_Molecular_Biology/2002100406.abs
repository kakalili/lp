p  contains large unstructured regions in its native state
the human tumor suppressor protein p  is understood only to some extent on a structural level we performed a comprehensive biochemical and biophysical structure  function analysis of p  full length protein and p  fragments the analysis showed that p  and the fragments investigated form stable functional units full length p  and the tetrameric fragment n p  residues      are however destabilized significantly compared to the monomeric core domain residues      and the monomeric fragment p c   residues      at the physiological temperature of   c and in the absence of modifications or stabilizing partners wild type p  is more than   unfolded correlating with a   loss in dna binding activity furthermore the analysis of cd spectra revealed that full length p  contains large unstructured regions in its n and c terminal parts our results indicate that full length p  is a modular protein consisting of defined structured and unstructured regions we propose that p  belongs to the growing family of loosely folded or partially unstructured native proteins the lack of a rigid structure combined with the low overall stability may allow the physiological interaction of p  with a multitude of partner proteins and the regulation of its turnover
