effect of metal loading and subcellular ph on net charge of superoxide dismutase
the net charge of a folded protein is hypothesized to influence myriad biochemical processes e g  protein misfolding electron transfer molecular recognition  however few tools exist for measuring net charge and this elusive property remains undetermined  at any ph  for nearly all proteins this study used lysine acetyl  protein charge ladders  and capillary electrophoresis to measure the net charge of superoxide dismutase  sod   whose aggregation causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  as a function of coordinated metal ions and ph the net negative charge of apo sod was similar to predicted values however the binding of a single zn  or cu  ion reduced the net negative charge by a greater magnitude than predicted i e   units instead of   whereas the sod protein underwent charge regulation upon binding    metal ions from ph to ph  i e  a range consistent with the multiple subcellular loci of sod  the holo sod protein underwent smaller fluctuations in net negative charge than predicted i e   units instead of   and did not undergo charge inversion at its isoelectric point pi   but remained anionic the regulation of sod net charge along its pathways of metal binding and across solvent ph provides insight into its metal induced maturation and enzymatic activity which remains diffusion limited across ph    the anionic nature of holo sod across subcellular ph suggests that   different als linked mutations to sod will reduce its net negative charge regardless of subcellular localization
