the large subunit of bacteriophage   s terminase plays a role in dna translocation and packaging termination edited by m gottesman
the dna packaging enzyme of bacteriophage   terminase is a heteromultimer composed of a small subunit gpnu  and a large subunit gpa products of the nu and a genes respectively the role of terminase in the initial stages of packaging involving the site specific binding and cutting of the dna has been well characterized while it is believed that terminase plays an active role in later post cleavage stages of packaging such as the translocation of dna into the head shell this has not been demonstrated accordingly we undertook a generalized mutagenesis of   s a gene and found ten lethal mutations nine of which cause post cleavage packaging defects all were located in the amino terminal two thirds of gpa separate from the carboxy terminal region where mutations affecting the protein  s endonuclease activity have been found the mutants fall into five groups according to their packaging phenotypes   two mutants package part of the  chromosome   one mutant packages the entire chromosome but very slowly compared to wild type   two mutants do not package any dna   four mutants though inviable package the entire  chromosome and   one mutant may be defective in both early and late stages of dna packaging these results indicate that gpa is actively involved in late stages of packaging including dna translocation and that this enzyme contains separate functional domains for its early and late packaging activities
