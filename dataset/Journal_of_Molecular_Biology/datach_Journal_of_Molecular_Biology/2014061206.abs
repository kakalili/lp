alanine scanning mutagenesis identifies an asparagine  arginine  lysine triad essential to assembly of the shell of the pdu microcompartment
bacterial microcompartments mcps are the simplest organelles known they function to enhance metabolic pathways by confining several related enzymes inside an all protein envelope called the shell in this study we investigated the factors that govern mcp assembly by performing scanning mutagenesis on the surface residues of pdua a major shell protein of the mcp used for   propanediol degradation biochemical genetic and structural analysis of  mutants allowed us to determine that pdua k  n  and r  are crucial residues that stabilize the shell of the   propanediol mcp in addition we identify two pdua mutants k a and k a that impair mcp function most likely by altering the permeability of its protein shell these are the first studies to examine the phenotypic effects of shell protein structural mutations in an mcp system the findings reported here may be applicable to engineering protein containers with improved stability for biotechnology applications
