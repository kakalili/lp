the lonepair triloop a new motif in rna structure
the lonepair triloop lptl is an rna structural motif that contains a single   lone   base pair capped by a hairpin loop containing three nucleotides the two nucleotides immediately outside of this motif    and   to the lonepair are not base paired to one another restricting the length of this helix to a single base pair four examples of this motif along with three tentative examples were initially identified in the  s and  s rrnas with covariation analysis an evaluation of the recently determined crystal structures of the thermus thermophilus  s and haloarcula marismortui  s ribosomal subunits revealed the authenticity for all of these proposed interactions and identified  more lptls in the s  s and  s rrnas this motif is found in the t loop in the trna crystal structures the lonepairs are positioned in nearly all examples immediately   to a regular secondary structure helix and are stabilized by coaxial stacking onto this flanking helix in all but two cases the nucleotides in the triloop are involved in a tertiary interaction with another section of the rrna establishing an overall three dimensional function for this motif of these  examples   occur in multi stem loops seven in hairpin loops and three in internal loops while the most common lonepair u a occurs in ten of the  lptls the remaining  lptls contain seven different base pair types only a few of these lonepairs adopt the standard watson  crick base pair conformations while the majority of the base pairs have non standard conformations while the general three dimensional conformation is similar for all examples of this motif characteristic differences lead to several subtypes present in different structural environments at least one triloop nucleotide in  of the  lptls in the rrnas and trnas forms a tertiary interaction with another part of the rna when a lptl containing the gnr or uyr triloop sequence forms a tertiary interaction with the first and second triloop nucleotide it recruits a fourth nucleotide to mediate stacking and mimic the tetraloop conformation approximately half of the lptl motifs are in close association with proteins the majority of these lptls are positioned at sites in rrnas that are conserved in the three phylogenetic domains a few of these occur in regions of the rrna associated with ribosomal function including the presumed site of peptidyl transferase activity in the  s rrna
