kinetics and energetics of the translocation of maltose binding protein folding mutants
protein translocation in escherichia coli is mediated by the translocase that in its minimal form comprises a protein conducting pore secyeg and a motor protein seca  the secyeg complex forms a narrow channel in the membrane that allows passage of secretory proteins preproteins in an unfolded state only it has been suggested that the seca requirement for translocation depends on the folding stability of the mature preprotein domain here we studied the effects of the signal sequence and secb on the folding and translocation of folding stabilizing and destabilizing mutants of the mature maltose binding protein mbp  although the mutations affect the folding of the precursor form of mbp these are drastically overruled by the combined unfolding stabilization of the signal sequence and secb consequently the translocation kinetics the energetics and the seca and secb dependence of the folding mutants are indistinguishable from those of wild type prembp these data indicate that unfolding of the mature domain of prembp is likely not a rate determining step in translocation when the protein is targeted to the translocase via secb
