kinetic analysis of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of trapp a multimeric ypt p exchange factor
trapp complexes which are large multimeric assemblies that function in membrane traffic are guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs that activate the rab gtpase ypt p here we measured rate and equilibrium constants that define the interaction of ypt p with guanine nucleotide guanosine  diphosphate and guanosine  triphosphate guanosine       imido triphosphate and the core trapp subunits required for gef activity these parameters allowed us to identify the kinetic and thermodynamic bases by which trapp catalyzes nucleotide exchange from ypt p nucleotide dissociation from ypt p is slow       s   and accelerated gt   fold by trapp acceleration of nucleotide exchange by trapp occurs via a predominantly mg  independent pathway thermodynamic linkage analysis indicates that trapp weakens nucleotide affinity by lt  fold and vice versa in contrast to most other characterized gef systems that weaken nucleotide binding affinities by    orders of magnitude the overall net changes in nucleotide binding affinities are small because trapp accelerates both nucleotide binding and dissociation from ypt p weak thermodynamic coupling allows trapp ypt p and nucleotide to exist as a stable ternary complex analogous to strain sensing cytoskeleton motors these results illustrate a novel strategy of guanine nucleotide exchange by trapp that is particularly suited for a multifunctional gef involved in membrane traffic
