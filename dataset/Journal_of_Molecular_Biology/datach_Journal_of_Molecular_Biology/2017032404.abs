self oligomerizing structure of the flagellar cap protein flid and its implication in filament assembly
flid is a self oligomerizing structural protein that caps the growing end of the bacterial flagellar filament flid also plays a key role in the flagellar system by continuously adding a new flagellin protein to the tip of the filament to structurally characterize flid oligomerization and to provide a flid mediated flagellin polymerization mechanism we have determined the crystal structures of flid proteins from escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium ecflid and stflid respectively  ecflid consists of three domains d  d  and d  and forms a hexamer plate of the d and d domains that resembles a six pointed star with legs consisting of the d domain in contrast the d and d domains of stflid assemble into a pentamer as a five pointed star plate despite their distinct oligomeric states ecflid and stflid engage a common molecular surface for oligomerization flid also features interdomain and intersubunit flexibility suggesting that flid reorganizes its domains and adjacent subunits depending on the flid binding partner the similarity of the flid shape to flagellin and the structural dynamics of flid led us to propose a flid catalyzed filament elongation mechanism in this model flid occupies a position in place of a nascent flagellin until the flagellin reaches the growing end of the filament and then flid moves aside to repeat the positional replacement
