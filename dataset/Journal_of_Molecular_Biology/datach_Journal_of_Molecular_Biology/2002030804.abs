amino acid determinants of  hairpin conformation in erythropoeitin receptor agonist peptides derived from a phage display library edited by p e wright
display of peptide libraries on filamentous phage has led to the identification of peptides of the form x  cx gpxtwxcx   where x is a variable residue that bind to the extra cellular portion of the erythropoietin receptor epo r  these peptides adopt  hairpin conformations when co crystallized with epo r solution nmr studies reveal that the peptide is conformationally heterogeneous in the absence of receptor due to cis trans isomerization about the gly pro peptide bond replacement of the conserved threonine residue with glycine at the turn i   position produces a stable  hairpin conformation in solution although this peptide no longer has activity in an epo r dependent cell proliferation assay a truncated form of the epo r binding peptide containing the i   glycine residue also forms a highly populated monomeric  hairpin in contrast phage derived peptide antagonists of insulin like growth factor binding protein  igfbp  have a high level of sequence identity with the truncated epo r peptide eight of  residues yet adopt a turn  helix conformation in solution peptides containing all possible pairwise amino acid substitutions between the epo r and igfbp  peptides have been analyzed to assess the degree to which the non conserved residues stabilize the hairpin or helix conformation all four residues present in the original sequence are required for maximum population of either the  hairpin or  helix conformation although some substitutions have a more dominant effect the results demonstrate that within a given sequence the observed conformation can be dictated by a small subset of the residues in this case four out of
