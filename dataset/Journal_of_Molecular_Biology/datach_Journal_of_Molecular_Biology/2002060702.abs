delineating the site of interaction on the piii protein of filamentous bacteriophage fd with the f pilus of escherichia coli
the minor coat protein piii at one end of the filamentous bacteriophage fd mediates the infection of escherichia coli cells displaying an f pilus piii has three domains d  d and d  terminating with a short hydrophobic segment at the c terminal end domain d binds to the tip of f pilus which is followed by retraction of the pilus and penetration of the e coli cell membrane the latter involving an interaction between domain d and the tola protein in the membrane surface residues on the d domain of piii were replaced systematically with alanine mutant virions were screened for d pilus interaction in vivo by measuring the release of infectious virions from e coli f cells infected with the mutants a competitive elisa was developed to measure in vitro the ability of mutant phages to bind to purified pili this allowed the identification of amino acid residues involved in binding to f and to edp  pili these residues were found to cluster on the outer rim of the d structure of the d domain unexpectedly identifying this as the f pilus binding region on the piii protein
