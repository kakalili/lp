a cytotoxic ribonuclease variant with a discontinuous nuclear localization signal constituted by basic residues scattered over three areas of the molecule
nuclear import of proteins is determined by specific signals that allow them to bind to receptors that mediate their energy dependent transport through the nuclear pore these signals are termed nuclear localization signals and do not constitute a specific consensus sequence among them the most characterized correspond to monopartite and bipartite nuclear localization signals which interact with the importin    heterodimer we previously described a cytotoxic variant of human pancreatic ribonuclease that is actively transported into the nucleus here we show that this protein interacts with importin  through different basic residues including lys and the arginine clusters     and     although these residues are scattered along the sequence they are close in the three dimensional structure of the protein and their topological disposition strongly resembles that of a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal
