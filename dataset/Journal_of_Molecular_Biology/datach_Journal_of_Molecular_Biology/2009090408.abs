nucleic acid binding activity of human cockayne syndrome b protein and identification of ca  as a novel metal cofactor
the cockayne syndrome group b protein csb is a member of the swi snf subgroup of superfamily  atpases nucleic acid translocases helicases and is defective in the autosomal recessive segmental progeroid disorder cockayne syndrome this study examines the atp dependent and the atp independent biochemical functions of human csb we show that ca  is a novel metal cofactor of csb for atp hydrolysis mainly through the enhancement of kcat and that a variety of biologically relevant model nucleic acid substrates can function to activate csb atpase activity with either mg  or ca  present however csb lacked detectable atp dependent helicase and single or double stranded nucleic acid translocase activities in the presence of either divalent metal csb was found to support atp independent complementary strand annealing of dna dna dna rna and rna rna duplexes with ca  again promoting optimal activity csb formed a stable protein dna complex with a  mer double stranded dna in electrophoretic mobility shift assays independent of divalent metal or nucleotide e g atp  moreover csb was able to form a stable complex with a range of nucleic acid substrates including bubble and  pseudo triplex  double stranded dnas that resemble replication and transcription intermediates as well as forked duplexes of dna dna dna rna and rna rna composition the latter two of which do not promote csb atpase activity association of csb with dna independent of atp binding or hydrolysis was seemingly sufficient to displace or rearrange a stable pre bound protein dna complex a property potentially important for its roles in transcription and dna repair
