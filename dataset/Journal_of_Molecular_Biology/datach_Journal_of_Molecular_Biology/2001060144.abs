kidney dialysis associated amyloidosis a molecular role for copper in fiber formation edited by r ebright
in the us alone more than     people have impaired renal function that necessitates treatment by dialysis a debilitating complication of long term treatment is the deposition of   microglobulin   m as amyloid fibers within the joint space however the intrinsic propensity of isolated   m protein to initiate in vitro fiber formation is negligible under conditions matched to the neutral ph and ionic conditions of serum here we present evidence for a novel interaction between  m and cu  at a concentration within institutionally recommended limits for this metal ion in dialysate solution mass spectrometry using electrospray ionization from native conditions demonstrates that the binding of cu  is specific over ca  or zn  despite maintaining a native like conformation upon cu  binding the folded protein is unusually destabilized against thermal and urea denaturation we further demonstrate that destabilization by cu  uniquely promotes de novo fiber formation at   c and neutral ph since the incidence of amyloidosis is dramatically reduced upon elimination of copper from dialysis membranes our results provide a molecular understanding for dialysis associated amyloid formation by  m
