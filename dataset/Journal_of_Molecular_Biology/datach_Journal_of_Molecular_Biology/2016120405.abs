differences in the phosphorylation dependent regulation of prenylation of rap a and rap b
two isoforms of the small gtpase rap  rap a and rap b participate in cell adhesion rap a promotes steady state adhesion while rap b regulates dynamic changes in cell adhesion these events depend on the prenylation of rap  which promotes its membrane localization here we identify previously unsuspected differences in the regulation of prenylation of rap a versus rap b due in part to their different phosphorylation dependent interactions with the chaperone protein smggds   previous studies indicate that the activation of g s protein coupled receptors gpcrs phosphorylates s   and s   in the polybasic region pbr of rap b which inhibits rap b binding to smggds   and diminishes rap b prenylation and membrane localization in this study we investigate how phosphorylation in the pbr of multiple small gtpases including k ras b rhoa rap a and rap b affects their binding to smggds with emphasis on differences between rap a and rap b we identify the amino acids in smggds   necessary for binding of rap a and rap b and present homology models examining the binding between rap a or rap b and smggds   unlike rap b phosphorylation in the pbr of rap a does not detectably inhibit its prenylation or its binding to smggds   activation of gpcrs suppresses rap a prenylation but unlike this effect on rap b the gpcr mediated suppression of rap a prenylation can occur independently of rap a phosphorylation and does not detectably diminish rap a membrane localization these data demonstrate unexpected evolutionarily conserved differences in the ability of gpcrs to regulate the prenylation of rap b compared to rap a
