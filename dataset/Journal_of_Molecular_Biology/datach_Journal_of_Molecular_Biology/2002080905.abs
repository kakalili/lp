solution structure of the dff c domain of dff  icad a structural basis for the regulation of apoptotic dna fragmentation
dff  icad has dual functions in the final stage of apoptosis by acting as both a folding chaperone and a dnase inhibitor of dff  cad here we present the solution structure of the c terminal domain of dff  which is essential for its chaperone like activity the structure of this domain dff c consists of four  helices which are folded in a novel helix packing arrangement the d structure reveals a large cluster of negatively charged residues on the molecular surface of dff c this observation suggests that charge complementation plays an important role in the interaction of dff c with the positively charged catalytic domain of dff  and thus for the chaperone activity of dff  the structure of dff c also provides a rationale for the loss of the chaperone activity in dff  a short isoform of dff  indeed in dff  the amino acid sequence is truncated in the middle of the second  helix constituting the structure of dff c and thus both the hydrophobic core and the cluster of negative charges are disrupted
