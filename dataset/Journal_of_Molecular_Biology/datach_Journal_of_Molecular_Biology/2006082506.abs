small proteins fold through transition states with native like topologies
the folding pathway of common type acyl phosphatase ctacp is characterized using  analysis which identifies specific chain  chain contacts using bi histidine bihis metal ion binding sites in the transition state ensemble tse  the majority of the protein is structured with a near native topology only lacking one  strand and an  helix   values are zero or unity for all sites except one at the amino terminus of helix h  this fractional  value remains unchanged when three metal ions of differing coordination geometries are used indicating this end of the helix experiences microscopic heterogeneity through fraying in the tse ubiquitin the other globular protein characterized using  analysis also exhibits a single consensus tse structure hence the tse of both proteins have converged to a single configuration albeit one that contains some fraying at the periphery models of the tse of both proteins are created using all atom langevin dynamics simulations using distance constraints derived from the experimental  values for both proteins the relative contact order of the ts models is    of the native value this shared value viewed in the context of the known correlation between contact order and folding rates suggests that other proteins will have a similarly high fraction of the native contact order this constraint greatly limits the range of possible configurations at the rate limiting step
