aimp p  controls translational initiation by mediating the delivery of charged initiator trna to initiation complex
aminoacyl trna synthetase interacting multifunctional proteins aimps are nonenzymatic scaffolding proteins that comprise multisynthetase complex msc with nine aminoacyl trna synthetases in higher eukaryotes among the three aimps aimp p  is strongly anchored to methionyl trna synthetase mrs in the msc mrs attaches methionine met to initiator trna trnaimet and plays an important role in translation initiation it is known that aimp is dispatched to nucleus or nuclear membrane to induce dna damage response or senescence however the role of aimp in translation as a component of msc and the meaning of its interaction with mrs are still unclear herein we observed that aimp specifically interacted with met trnaimet in vitro while it showed little or reduced interaction with unacylated or lysine charged trnaimet in addition aimp discriminates met trnaimet from met charged elongator trna based on filter binding assay pull  down assay revealed that aimp and mrs had noncompetitive interaction with eukaryotic initiation factor  eif   subunit eif   which is in charge of binding with met trnaimet for the delivery of met trnaimet to ribosome aimp recruited active eif  to the mrs  aimp complex and the level of met trnaimet bound to eif complex was reduced by aimp knockdown resulting in reduced protein synthesis all these results suggested the novel function of aimp as a critical mediator of met trnaimet transfer from mrs to eif complex for the accurate and efficient translation initiation
