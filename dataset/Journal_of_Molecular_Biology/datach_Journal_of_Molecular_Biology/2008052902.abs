nhp p and med p regulate gene expression by controlling the local subunit composition of rna polymerase ii
nhp p is an architectural saccharomyces cerevisiae non histone chromosomal protein that bends dna and plays an important role in transcription and genome stability we used the split ubiquitin system to isolate proteins that interact with nhp p in vivo and we confirmed  of these protein  protein interactions with glutathione s transferase pull down experiments in vitro most of the nhp p interacting proteins are involved in transcription and dna repair we utilized the zds  pur and ume genes which are repressed by nhp p and its interacting partners rpb p and med p to study the chromosomal localization of these three proteins in wild type and gene deletion strains nhp p med p and rpb p were found at the promoters of zds  pur and ume  indicating that the repressing effects the three proteins had on the expression of these three genes had been direct ones we also found that med p inhibited promoter clearance of rna polymerase ii which contained the dissociable subunit rpb p while nhp p recruited rpb p to the basal promoters of zds  pur and ume  our results further suggest that rpb p inhibits transcription initiation but stimulates transcription elongation and that nhp p and med p regulate gene expression by controlling the local subunit composition of rna polymerase ii
