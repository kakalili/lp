structure of the third intracellular loop of the vasopressin v receptor and conformational changes upon binding to gc qr
the v vasopressin receptor is a g protein coupled receptor that regulates the renal antidiuretic response its third intracellular loop is involved in the coupling not only with the g s protein but also with gc qr a potential chaperone of g protein coupled receptors in this report we describe the nmr solution structure of the v i loop under a cyclized form i cyc and characterize its interaction with gc qr i cyc formed a left twisted  helical hairpin structure the building of a model of the entire v receptor including the i cyc nmr structure clarified the side chain orientation of charged residues in agreement with literature mutagenesis reports in the model the i loop formed a rigid helical column protruding deep inside the cytoplasm as does the i loop in the recently elucidated structure of squid rhodopsin however its higher packing angle resulted in a different structural motif at the intracellular interface which may be important for the specific recognition of g s moreover we could estimate the apparent kd of the i cyc gc qr complex by anisotropy fluorescence using a shorter and more soluble version of i cyc which encompassed the putative site of gc qr binding we showed by nmr saturation transfer difference spectroscopy that the binding surface corresponded to the central arginine cluster binding to gc qr induced the folding of the otherwise disordered short peptide into a spiral like path formed by a succession of i and iv turns our simulations suggested that this folding would rigidify the arginine cluster in the entire i loop and would alter the conformation of the cytosolic extensions of tm v and tm vi helices in agreement with this conformational rearrangement we observed that binding of gc qr to the full length receptor modifies the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence binding curves of v to an antagonist
