The exaptation of transposed elements into protein-coding domains by a process called exonization is one important evolutionary pathway for generating novel variant functions of gene products. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) modification is a recently discovered, RNA-editing-mediated mechanism that contributes to the exonization of previously unprocessed mRNA introns. In the human nuclear prelamin A recognition factor gene transcript, the alternatively spliced exon 8 results from an A-to-I editing-generated 3′ splice site located within an intronic Alu short interspersed element. Sequence comparisons of representatives of all primate infraorders revealed the critical evolutionary steps leading to this editing-mediated exonization. The source of exon 8 was seeded within the primary transcript about 58–40 million years ago by the head-to-head insertions of two primate-specific Alu short interspersed elements in the common ancestor of anthropoids. The latent protein-coding potential was realized 34–52 million years later in a common ancestor of gorilla, chimpanzee, and human as a result of numerous changes at the RNA and DNA level. Comparisons of 426 processed mRNA clones from various primate species with their genomic sequences identified seven different RNA-editing-mediated alternative splice variants. In total, 30 A-to-I editing sites were identified. The gorilla, chimpanzee, and human nuclear prelamin A recognition factor genes exemplify the versatile interplay of pre- and posttranscriptional modifications leading to novel genetic potential.
