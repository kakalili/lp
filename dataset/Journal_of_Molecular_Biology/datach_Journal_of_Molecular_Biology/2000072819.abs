modeling of the tcr mhc peptide complex edited by j thornton
the methodology for generating a homology model of the t tcr pbcs kd class i major histocompatibility complex mhc class i complex is presented the resulting model provides a qualitative explanation of the effect of over  different mutations in the region of the complementarity determining region cdr loops of the t cell receptor tcr  the peptide and the mhc  s     helices the peptide is modified by an azido benzoic acid photoreactive group which is part of the epitope recognized by the tcr the construction of the model makes use of closely related homologs the a tcr tax hla a complex the c tcr the   d tcr v  chain the    tcr v  chain and the h  kb ovalbumine peptide  ab initio sampling of cdr loops conformations and experimental data to select from the set of possibilities the model shows a complex arrangement of the cdr   cdr   cdr  and cdr  loops that leads to the highly specific recognition of the photoreactive group the protocol can be applied systematically to a series of related sequences permitting the analysis at the structural level of the large tcr repertoire specific for a given peptide mhc complex
