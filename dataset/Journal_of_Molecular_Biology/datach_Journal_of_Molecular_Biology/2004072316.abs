identification of the protein acetyltransferase pat enzyme that acetylates acetyl coa synthetase in salmonella enterica
post translational modification of proteins is an efficient way cells use to control the activity of structural proteins gene expression regulatory proteins and enzymes in eukaryotes the sir dependent system of protein acetylation deacetylation controls a number of processes that affect cell longevity sir proteins have nad dependent protein deacetylase activity and are found in all forms of life although the identity of the acetyltransferases that partner with sir enzymes is known in eukaryotes the identity of the prokaryotic acetyltransferases is not we report the identification of the gene of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt encoding the major protein acetyltransferase pat enzyme that in concert with the cobb sirtuin of this bacterium regulates the activity of the central metabolic enzyme acetyl coenzyme a synthetase acs  the pat enzyme uses acetyl coa as substrate to modify residue lys  of acs the pat cobb system of s enterica should serve as the paradigm to further investigate the contributions of this system to the physiology of prokaryotes
