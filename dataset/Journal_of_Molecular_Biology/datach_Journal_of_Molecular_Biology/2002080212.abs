the membrane bound conformation of  lactalbumin studied by nmr monitored h exchange
the interaction of bovine  lactalbumin bla with negatively charged phospholipid bilayers was studied by nmr monitored h exchange to characterize the conformational transition that enables a water soluble protein to associate with and partially insert into a membrane bla was allowed to exchange in deuterated buffer in the absence reference and the presence membrane bound of acidic liposomes at ph   experimental conditions that allow efficient protein  membrane interaction after adjusting the ph to   to dissociate the protein from the membrane reference and membrane released samples of bla were analysed by f  band selective homonuclear decoupled total correlation spectroscopy in the  h  nh region the overall exchange behaviour of the membrane bound state is molten globule like suggesting an overall destabilization of the polypeptide nevertheless the backbone amide protons of residues r  l  c  k  k  v  and w  show significant protection against solvent exchange in the membrane bound protein we propose a mechanism for the association of bla with negatively charged membranes that includes initial protonation of acidic side chains at the membrane interface and formation of an interacting site with the membrane which involves helixes a and c in the next step these helices would slide away from each other adopting a parallel orientation to the membrane and would rotate to maximize the interaction between their hydrophobic residues and the lipid bilayer
