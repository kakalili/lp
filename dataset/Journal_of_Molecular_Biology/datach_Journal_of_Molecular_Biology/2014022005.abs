the glaucoma associated olfactomedin domain of myocilin forms polymorphic fibrils that are constrained by partial unfolding and peptide sequence
the glaucoma associated olfactomedin domain of myocilin myoc olf is a recent addition to the growing list of disease associated amyloidogenic proteins inherited disease causing myocilin variants aggregate intracellularly instead of being secreted to the trabecular meshwork which is a scenario toxic to trabecular meshwork cells and leads to early onset of ocular hypertension the major risk factor for glaucoma here we systematically structurally and biophysically dissected myoc olf to better understand its amyloidogenesis under mildly destabilizing conditions wild type myoc olf adopts non native structures that readily fibrillize when incubated at a temperature just below the transition for tertiary unfolding with buffers at physiological ph two main endpoint fibril morphologies are observed  a straight fibrils common to many amyloids and b unique micron length   nm or larger diameter species that lasso oligomers which also exhibit classical spectroscopic amyloid signatures three disease causing variants investigated herein exhibit non native tertiary structures under physiological conditions leading to a variety of growth rates and a fibril morphologies in particular the well documented d  a variant which lacks calcium forms large circular fibrils two amyloid forming peptide stretches have been identified one for each of the main fibril morphologies observed our study places myoc olf within the larger landscape of the amylome and provides insight into the diversity of myoc olf aggregation that plays a role in glaucoma pathogenesis
