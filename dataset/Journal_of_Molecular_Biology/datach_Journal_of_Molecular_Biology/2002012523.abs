the geometry of domain combination in proteins edited by j thornton
most proteins in genomes are the result of the recombination of two or more domains it has been found that if proteins are formed by a combination of domains from superfamilies a and b then the domains may occur in the sequential order ab or ba but only in about   of cases do they occur in both sequential orders the classical rossmann domains of known structure are combined with catalytic domains from seven different superfamilies in addition there are eight cases where structures with both ab and ba domain combinations are known for these two sets of structures we analysed  i the relative orientation of the domains  ii the type of domain connection  iii the structure of the interdomain links and iv domain function the results of this analysis indicate that in most cases domain order is conserved because recombination of the domains has only occurred once during the course of evolution functional reasons become important when the domain connections are short in seven out of the eight known cases where domains are combined in the ab and ba sequential orders they have different geometrical relationships that give them different functional properties
