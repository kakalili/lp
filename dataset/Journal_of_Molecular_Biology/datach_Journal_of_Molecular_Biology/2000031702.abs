structural studies of soluble oligomers of the alzheimer  amyloid peptide edited by p e wright
recent studies have suggested that non fibrillar soluble forms of a  peptides possess neurotoxic properties and may therefore play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of alzheimer  s disease we have identified solution conditions under which two types of soluble oligomers of a   could be trapped and stabilized for an extended period of time the first type of oligomers comprises a mixture of dimers tetramers which are stable at neutral ph and low micromolar concentration for a period of at least four weeks the second type of oligomer comprises a narrow distribution of particles that are spherical when examined by electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy the number average molecular mass of this distribution of particles is   mda and they are are stable at ph  for at least four weeks circular dichroism studies indicate that the dimers tetramers possess irregular secondary structure that is not  helix or  structure while the   mda particles contain  structure fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that a   moieties in amyloid fibrils or protofibrils are more similar in structure to those in the   mda particles than those in the dimers tetramers these findings indicate that soluble oligomeric forms of a  peptides can be trapped for extended periods of time enabling their study by high resolution techniques that would not otherwise be possible
