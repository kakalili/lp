importance of the  s rrna binding ribosomal proteins for cell viability and translation in escherichia coli
a specific complex of  s rrna and several ribosomal proteins is an integral part of ribosomes in all living organisms here we studied the importance of escherichia coli genes rple rplr and rply encoding  s rrna binding ribosomal proteins l  l  and l  respectively for cell growth viability and translation using recombineering to create gene replacements in the e coli chromosome it was shown that rple and rplr are essential for cell viability whereas cells deleted for rply are viable but grow noticeably slower than the parental strain the slow growth of these l  defective cells can be stimulated by a plasmid expressing the rply gene and also by a plasmid bearing the gene for homologous to l  general stress protein ctc from bacillus subtilis the rply mutant ribosomes are physically normal and contain all ribosomal proteins except l  the ribosomes from l  defective and parental cells translate in vitro at the same rate either poly u or natural mrna the difference observed was that the mutant ribosomes synthesized less natural polypeptide compared to wild type ribosomes both in vivo and in vitro we speculate that the defect is at the ribosome recycling step
