restoration  of glutathione transferase activity by single site mutation of the yeast prion protein ure
the yeast prion ure p is composed of an n terminal prion domain and a c terminal globular domain which shows similarity to glutathione transferases gsts in both sequence and structure ure p protects saccharomyces cerevisiae cells from heavy metal ion and oxidant toxicity ure p shows glutathione dependent peroxidase gpx activity which is often an adjunct activity of gsts but wild type ure p shows no detectable gst activity toward the standard substrate  chloro   dinitrobenzene cdnb  the structural basis for the substrate specificity of ure p enzymatic activity is an interesting problem that is fundamental to understanding the in vivo roles of ure p and its relationship to the gst structural family the critical catalytic residue in the other known gsts is ser tyr or cys here we demonstrate that residue n  is important for the gpx activity of ure p and a wild type level of activity is maintained in n  s but not in n  y c interestingly we found that the single site mutations a  c and n  a v but not n  s y c   restore  the gst activity of ure p toward cdnb while causing a substantial reduction in gpx activity the steady state kinetics for the gst activity of a  c appears to follow a ping pong mechanism in contrast the gst activity of   site mutants shows a sequential mechanism as is observed for the native gpx activity of ure p and typical gst enzymes these findings shed light on the evolutionary relationship of ure p with other gst family members and contribute to our understanding of catalytic promiscuity and divergent evolution
