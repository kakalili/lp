the molecular mechanism of sulfated carbohydrate recognition by the cysteine rich domain of mannose receptor edited by i a wilson
the mannose receptor mr binds foreign and host ligands through interactions with their carbohydrates two portions of mr have distinct carbohydrate recognition properties one is conferred by the amino terminal cysteine rich domain cys mr  which plays a critical role in binding sulfated glycoproteins including pituitary hormones the other is achieved by tandemly arranged c type lectin domains that facilitate carbohydrate dependent uptake of infectious microorganisms this dual carbohydrate binding specificity enables mr to bind ligands by interacting with both sulfated and non sulfated polysaccharide chains we previously determined crystal structures of cys mr complexed with  so n acetylglucosamine and with an unidentified ligand resembling hepes n  hydroxyethyl piperazine n    ethanesulfonic acid  in continued efforts to elucidate the mechanism of sulfated carbohydrate recognition by cys mr we characterized the binding affinities between cys mr and potential carbohydrate ligands using a fluorescence based assay we find that cys mr binds sulfated carbohydrates with relatively high affinities kd   mm to   mm compared to the affinities of other lectins cys mr also binds hepes with a kd value of   mm consistent with the suggestion that the ligand in the original cys mr crystal structure is hepes we also determined crystal structures of cys mr complexed with  so lewisx  so lewisa and  so n acetylglucosamine at         and    resolution respectively and the    structure of cys mr that had been treated to remove hepes the conformation of the cys mr binding site is virtually identical in all cys mr crystal structures suggesting that cys mr does not undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding the structures are used to rationalize the binding affinities derived from the biochemical studies and to elucidate the molecular mechanism of sulfated carbohydrate recognition by cys mr
