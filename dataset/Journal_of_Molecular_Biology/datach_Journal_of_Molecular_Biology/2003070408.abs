crystal structures of the atpase subunit of the glucose abc transporter from sulfolobus solfataricus nucleotide free and nucleotide bound conformations
the abc atpase glcv energizes a binding protein dependent abc transporter that mediates glucose uptake in sulfolobus solfataricus here we report high resolution crystal structures of glcv in different states along its catalytic cycle distinct monomeric nucleotide free states and monomeric complexes with adp mg  as a product bound state and with amppnp mg  as an atp like bound state the structure of glcv consists of a typical abc atpase domain comprising two subdomains connected by a linker region to a c terminal domain of unknown function comparisons of the nucleotide free and nucleotide bound structures of glcv reveal re orientations of the abc  subdomain and the c terminal domain relative to the abc   subdomain and switch like rearrangements in the p loop and q loop regions additionally large conformational differences are observed between the glcv structures and those of other abc atpases further emphasizing the inherent flexibility of these proteins notably a comparison of the monomeric amppnp mg  bound glcv structure with that of the dimeric atp na bound lold e  q mutant reveals a    rigid body re orientation of the abc  subdomain relative to the abc   subdomain accompanied by a local conformational difference in the q loop we propose that these differences represent conformational changes that may have a role in the mechanism of energy transduction and or allosteric control of the abc atpase activity in bacterial importers
