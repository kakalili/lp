gapdh is conformationally and functionally altered in association with oxidative stress in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
it is proposed that conformational changes induced in proteins by oxidation can lead to loss of activity or protein aggregation through exposure of hydrophobic residues and alteration in surface hydrophobicity because increased oxidative stress and protein aggregation are consistently observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  we used a    dianilino    binaphthyl    disulfonic acid bisans photolabeling approach to monitor changes in protein unfolding in vivo in skeletal muscle proteins in als mice we find two major proteins creatine kinase ck and glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh  conformationally affected in the als g a mouse model concordant with a   and   reduction in enzyme activity respectively this correlated with changes in conformation and activity that were detected in ck and gapdh with in vitro oxidation interestingly we found that gapdh but not ck is conformationally and functionally affected in a longer lived als model h r h q  exhibiting a   reduction in enzyme activity we proposed a reaction mechanism for bisans with nucleophilic amino acids such as lysine serine threonine and tyrosine and bisans was found to be primarily incorporated to lysine residues in gapdh we identified the specific bisans incorporation sites on gapdh in nontransgenic ntg  g a and h r h q mice using liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry analysis four bisans containing sites k  k   k   and k   were found in ntg gapdh while three out of four of these sites were lost in either g a or h r h q gapdh conversely eight new sites k  k  k  k   k   k   s   and k   were found on gapdh for g a including one common site k   for h r h q which is not found on gapdh from ntg mice these data show that gapdh is differentially affected structurally and functionally in vivo in accordance with the degree of oxidative stress associated with these two models of als
