structure of an essential type iv pilus biogenesis protein provides insights into pilus and type ii secretion systems
type iv pili t ps are long cell surface filaments essential for microcolony formation tissue adherence motility transformation and virulence by human pathogens the enteropathogenic escherichia coli bundle forming pilus is a prototypic t p assembled and powered by bfpd a conserved gspe secretion superfamily atpase held by inner membrane proteins bfpc and bfpe a gspf family membrane protein although the t p assembly machinery shares similarity with type ii secretion t s systems the structural biochemistry of the t p machine has been obscure here we report the crystal structure of the two domain bfpc cytoplasmic region n bfpc  responsible for binding to atpase bfpd and membrane protein bfpe the n bfpc structure reveals a prominent central cleft between two    domains despite negligible sequence similarity n bfpc resembles pilm a cytoplasmic t p biogenesis protein yet surprisingly n bfpc has far greater structural similarity to t s component epsl with which it also shares virtually no sequence identity the c terminus of the cytoplasmic domain which leads to the transmembrane segment not present in the crystal structure exits n bfpc at a positively charged surface that most likely interacts with the inner membrane positioning its central cleft for interactions with other bfp components point mutations in surface exposed n bfpc residues predicted to be critical for interactions among bfpc bfpe and bfpd disrupt pilus biogenesis without precluding interactions with bfpe and bfpd and without affecting bfpd atpase activity these results illuminate the relationships between t p biogenesis and t s systems imply that subtle changes in component residue interactions can have profound effects on function and pathogenesis and suggest that t p systems may be disrupted by inhibitors that do not preclude component assembly
