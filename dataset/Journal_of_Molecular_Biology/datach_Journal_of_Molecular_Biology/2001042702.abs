solution structure of a c terminal coiled coil domain from bovine if  the inhibitor protein of f atpase edited by m f summers
bovine if is a basic   amino acid residue protein that inhibits the hydrolytic action of the f f atp synthase in mitochondria under anaerobic conditions its oligomerization state is dependent on ph at a ph value below   it forms an active dimer at higher ph values two dimers associate to form an inactive tetramer here we present the solution structure of a c terminal fragment of if      containing all five of the histidine residues present in the sequence most unusually the molecule forms an anti parallel coiled coil in which three of the five histidine residues occupy key positions at the dimer interface
