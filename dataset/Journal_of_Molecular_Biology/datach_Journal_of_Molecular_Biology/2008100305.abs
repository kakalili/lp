structure of the myristylated human immunodeficiency virus type  matrix protein and the role of phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate in membrane targeting
during the late phase of retroviral replication newly synthesized gag proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane pm  where they assemble and bud to form immature virus particles membrane targeting by human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  gag is mediated by the pm marker molecule phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate pi   p  which is capable of binding to the matrix ma domain of gag in an extended lipid conformation and of triggering myristate exposure here we show that as observed previously for hiv  ma the myristyl group of hiv  ma is partially sequestered within a narrow hydrophobic tunnel formed by side chains of helices     and  however the myristate of hiv  ma is more tightly sequestered than that of the hiv  protein and does not exhibit concentration dependent exposure soluble pi   p analogs containing truncated acyl chains bind hiv  ma and induce minor long range structural changes but do not trigger myristate exposure despite these differences the site of hiv  assembly in vivo can be manipulated by enzymes that regulate pi   p localization our findings indicate that hiv  and hiv  are both targeted to the pm for assembly via a pi   p dependent mechanism despite differences in the sensitivity of the ma myristyl switch and suggest a potential mechanism that may contribute to the poor replication kinetics of hiv
