integrative modelling coupled with ion mobility mass spectrometry reveals structural features of the clamp loader in complex with single stranded dna binding protein
dna polymerase iii a decameric   kda assembly simultaneously replicates both strands of the chromosome in escherichia coli a subassembly of this holoenzyme the seven subunit clamp loader complex is responsible for loading the sliding clamp    onto dna here we use structural information derived from ion mobility mass spectrometry im ms to build three dimensional models of one form of the full clamp loader complex           kda  by probing the interaction between the clamp loader and a single stranded dna ssdna binding protein ssb  and by identifying two distinct conformational states with and without ssdna we assemble models of    ssb   kda and the clamp loader  ssb   kda consistent with im data a significant increase in measured collision cross section    of the clamp loader  ssb complex upon dna binding suggests large conformational rearrangements this dna bound conformation represents the active state and along with the presence of    stabilises the clamp loader  ssb complex overall this study of a large heteromeric complex analysed by im ms coupled with integrative modelling highlights the potential of such an approach to reveal structural features of previously unknown complexes of high biological importance
