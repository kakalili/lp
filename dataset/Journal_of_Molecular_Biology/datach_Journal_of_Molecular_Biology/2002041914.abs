a novel short peptide is a specific inhibitor of the human immunodeficiency virus type  integrase
the retroviral encoded protein integrase in is required for the insertion of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  proviral dna into the host genome in spite of the crucial role played by in in the retroviral life cycle which makes this enzyme an attractive target for the development of new anti aids agents very few inhibitors have been described and none seems to have a potential use in anti hiv therapy to obtain potent and specific in inhibitors we used the two hybrid system to isolate short peptides using hiv  in as a bait and a yeast genomic library as the source of inhibitory peptides prey  we isolated a  mer peptide i  that bound tightly to the enzyme i  inhibited both in vitro in activities i e    end processing and strand transfer further analysis led us to select a shorter peptide ebr  corresponding to the n terminal region of i  truncated variants showed that ebr  interacted with the catalytic domain of in interfering with the binding of the dna substrate alanine single substitution of each ebr  residue alanine scanning allowed the identification of essential amino acids involved in the inhibition the ebr  nmr structure shows that this peptide adopts an  helical conformation with amphipathic properties additionally ebr  showed a significant antiviral effect when assayed on hiv  infected human cells thus this potentially important short lead peptide may not only be helpful to design new anti hiv agents but also could prove very useful in further studies of the structural and functional characteristics of hiv  in
