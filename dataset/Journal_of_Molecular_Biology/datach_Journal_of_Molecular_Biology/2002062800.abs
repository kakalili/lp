the isomerization of the uvrb  dna preincision complex couples the uvrb and uvrc activities
in escherichia coli nucleotide excision repair the uvrb  dna preincision complex plays a key role linking adduct recognition to incision we previously showed that the efficiency of the incision is inversely related to the stability of the preincision complex we postulated that an isomerization reaction converts uvrb  dna  stable but incompetent for incision into the uvrb  dna   complex unstable and competent for incision here we identify two parameters negative supercoiling and presence of a nick at the fifth phosphodiester bond   to the lesion that accelerate the isomerization leading to an increasing incision efficiency we also show that the uvrb  dna complex is more resistant to a salt concentration increase than the uvrb  dna   complex finally we report that the uvrb  dna   is recognized by uvrc these data suggest that the isomerization reaction leads to an exposure of single stranded dna around the lesion this newly exposed single stranded dna serves as a binding site and substrate for the uvrc endonuclease we propose that the isomerization reaction is responsible for coupling uvrb and uvrc activities and that this reaction corresponds to the binding of atp
