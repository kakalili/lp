role of the propeptide in controlling conformation and assembly state of hepatitis b virus e antigen
hepatitis b virus  e antigen   hbeag is thought to be a soluble dimeric protein that is associated with chronic infection it shares   residues with the viral capsid protein  core antigen   hbcag  but has an additional  residue hydrophobic cysteine containing amino terminal propeptide whose presence correlates with physical serological and immunological differences between the two proteins in hbcag dimers the subunits pair by forming a four helix bundle stabilized by an intermolecular disulfide bond the structure of hbeag is probably similar but instead has two intramolecular disulfide bonds involving the propeptide to compare the proteins directly and thereby clarify the role of the propeptide we identified mutations and solution conditions that render both proteins as either soluble dimers or assembled capsids thermally induced unfolding monitored by circular dichroism and electrophoresis of oxidized and reduced dimers showed that the propeptide has a destabilizing effect and that the intramolecular disulfide bond forms preferentially and blocks the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond that otherwise stabilizes the dimer the hbeag capsids are less regular than the hbcag capsids nevertheless cryo electron microscopy reconstructions confirm that they are constructed of dimers resembling those of hbcag capsids in them a portion of the propeptide is visible near the dimer interface suggesting that it intercalates there consistent with the known formation of a disulfide bond between c    in the propeptide and c  in the dimer interface however this intercalation distorts the dimer into an assembly reluctant conformation
