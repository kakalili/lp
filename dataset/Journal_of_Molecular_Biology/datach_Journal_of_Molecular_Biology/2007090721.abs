structural analysis and dynamics of retinal chromophore in dark and meta i states of rhodopsin from h nmr of aligned membranes
rhodopsin is a prototype for g protein coupled receptors gpcrs that are implicated in many biological responses in humans a site directed h nmr approach was used for structural analysis of retinal within its binding cavity in the dark and pre activated meta i states retinal was labeled with h at the c  c  or c  methyl groups by total synthesis and was used to regenerate the opsin apoprotein solid state h nmr spectra were acquired for aligned membranes in the low temperature lipid gel phase versus the tilt angle to the magnetic field data reduction assumed a static uniaxial distribution and gave the retinylidene methyl bond orientations plus the alignment disorder mosaic spread  the dark state h nmr structure of  cis retinal shows torsional twisting of the polyene chain and the  ionone ring the ligand undergoes restricted motion as evinced by order parameters of    for the spinning c  c h groups with off axial fluctuations of     retinal is accommodated within the rhodopsin binding pocket with a negative pre twist about the c  c  double bond that explains its rapid photochemistry and the trajectory of  cis to trans isomerization in the cryo trapped meta i state the h nmr structure shows a reduction of the polyene strain while torsional twisting of the  ionone ring is maintained distortion of the retinal conformation is interpreted through substituent control of receptor activation steric hindrance between trans retinal and trp  can trigger formation of the subsequent activated meta ii state our results are pertinent to quantum and molecular mechanics simulations of ligands bound to gpcrs and illustrate how h nmr can be applied to study their biological mechanisms of action
