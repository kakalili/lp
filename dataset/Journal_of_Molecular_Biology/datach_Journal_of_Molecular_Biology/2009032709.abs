the structure of a   c terminal fragments probed by a combined experimental and theoretical study
the c terminus of amyloid  protein a    plays an important role in this protein s oligomerization and may therefore be a good therapeutic target for the treatment of alzheimer s disease certain c terminal fragments ctfs of a   have been shown to disrupt oligomerization and to strongly inhibit a   induced neurotoxicity here we study the structures of selected ctfs a  x    x       using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations and ion mobility mass spectrometry our simulations in explicit solvent reveal that the ctfs adopt a metastable  structure   hairpin for a  x    x     and extended  strand for a       the  hairpin of a      is converted into a turn coil conformation when the last two hydrophobic residues are removed suggesting that i  and a  are critical in stabilizing the  hairpin in a   derived ctfs the importance of solvent in determining the structure of the ctfs is further highlighted in ion mobility mass spectrometry experiments and solvent free replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations a comparison between structures with solvent and structures without solvent reveals that hydrophobic interactions are critical for the formation of  hairpin the possible role played by the ctfs in disrupting oligomerization is discussed
