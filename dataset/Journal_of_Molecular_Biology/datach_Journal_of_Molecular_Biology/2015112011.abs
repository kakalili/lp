diversification of  augmentation interactions between cdi toxin immunity proteins
contact dependent growth inhibition cdi is a widespread mechanism of inter bacterial competition mediated by the cdib cdia family of two partner secretion proteins cdia effectors carry diverse c terminal toxin domains cdia ct  which are delivered into neighboring target cells to inhibit growth cdi bacteria also produce cdii immunity proteins that bind specifically to cognate cdia ct toxins and protect the cell from auto inhibition here we compare the structures of homologous cdia ct cdii complexes from escherichia coli ec  and yersinia pseudotuberculosis ypiii to explore the evolution of cdi toxin immunity protein interactions both complexes share an unusual  augmentation interaction in which the toxin domain extends a  hairpin into the immunity protein to complete a six stranded anti parallel sheet however the specific contacts differ substantially between the two complexes the ec    hairpin interacts mainly through direct h bond and ion pair interactions whereas the ypiii  hairpin pocket contains more hydrophobic contacts and a network of bridging water molecules in accord with these differences we find that each cdii protein only protects target bacteria from its cognate cdia ct toxin the compact  hairpin binding pocket within the immunity protein represents a tractable system for the rationale design of small molecules to block cdia ct cdii complex formation we synthesized a macrocyclic peptide mimic of the  hairpin from ec  toxin and solved its structure in complex with cognate immunity protein these latter studies suggest that small molecules could potentially be used to disrupt cdi toxin immunity complexes
