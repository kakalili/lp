molecular dynamics reveal the essential role of linker motions in the function of cullin  ring e ligases
tagging proteins by polyubiquitin is a key step in protein degradation cullin  ring e ubiquitin ligases facilitate ubiquitin transfer from the e conjugating enzyme to the substrate yet crystallography indicates a large distance between the e and the substrate raising the question of how this distance is bridged in the ubiquitin transfer reaction here we demonstrate that the linker motions in the substrate binding proteins can allosterically shorten this distance to facilitate this crucial ubiquitin transfer step and increase this distance to allow polyubiquitination we performed molecular dynamics simulations for five substrate binding proteins skp  fbw   trcp  cdc  and pvhl in two forms bound to their substrates and bound to both substrate and adaptor the adaptor connects the substrate binding proteins to the cullin in the bound to both forms of all cases we observed rotations of the substrate binding domain shortening the gap between the tip of the substrate peptide and the e active site by      compared with the crystal structures overall together with our earlier simulations of the unbound forms and the bound to adaptor forms the emerging picture is that the maximum distance of       between the substrate binding domain and the e active site in the modeled unbound forms of these five proteins shrinks to a minimum of       in the bound to both forms this large distance range the result of allosterically controlled linker motions facilitates ubiquitin transfer and polyubiquitination and as such argues that the cullin  ring e ubiquitin ligase is under conformational control we further observed that substrate binding proteins with multiple substrate acceptor lysines have a larger distance range between the substrate and the e as compared with  trcp  with only one acceptor lysine
