long distance communication in the hdv ribozyme insights from molecular dynamics and experiments
the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme is a small self cleaving rna with a compact tertiary structure and buried active site that is important in the life cycle of the virus the ribozyme s function in nature is to cleave an internal phosphodiester bond and linearize concatemers during rolling circle replication crystal structures of the ribozyme have been solved in both pre cleaved and post cleaved product forms and reveal an intricate network of interactions that conspire to catalyze bond cleavage in addition extensive biochemical studies have been performed to work out a mechanism for bond cleavage in which c  and a magnesium ion catalyze the reaction by general acid  base chemistry one issue that has remained unclear in this ribozyme and in other ribozymes is the nature of long distance communication between peripheral regions of the rna and the buried active site we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme in the product form and assessed communication between a distal structural portion of the ribozyme  the protonated c  base triple  and the active site containing the critical c  we varied the ionization state of c  in both the wild type and a c  double mutant variant and determined the impact on the active site in all four cases effects at the active site observed in the simulations agree with experimental studies on ribozyme activity overall these studies indicate that small functional rnas have the potential to communicate interactions over long distances and that wild type rnas may have evolved ways to prevent such interactions from interfering with catalysis
