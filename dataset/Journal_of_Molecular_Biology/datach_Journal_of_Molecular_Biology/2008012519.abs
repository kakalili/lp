effect of phosphorylation on  b crystallin differences in stability subunit exchange and chaperone activity of homo and mixed oligomers of  b crystallin and its phosphorylation mimicking mutant
phosphorylation appears to be one of the modulators of chaperone functions of small heat shock proteins however the role of phosphorylation is not completely understood we have investigated the structural and functional consequences of a phosphorylation mimicking mutation in  b crystallin a small heat shock protein with chaperone activity we have used a phosphorylation mimicking mutant  d b crystallin in which all the three phosphorylatable serine residues are replaced with aspartic acid  d b crystallin showed enhanced chaperone like activity towards dtt induced aggregation of insulin heat induced aggregation of citrate synthase and sds induced amyloid fibril formation of  synuclein fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies showed that d b crystallin exhibits lower stability towards urea induced denaturation compared to  b crystallin subunit exchange studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that d b crystallin exhibits an observable increase in subunit exchange compared to  b crystallin since only part of  b crystallin is phosphorylated in vivo our subunit exchange studies indicate that formation of mixed oligomers between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated subunits are likely to play a role in vivo our study shows that mixed oligomer formation modulates the chaperone like activity we propose that the degree of phosphorylation of the  b crystallin oligomers and temperature are key modulators to achieve a wide range of chaperone capabilities of the small heat shock protein  b crystallin
