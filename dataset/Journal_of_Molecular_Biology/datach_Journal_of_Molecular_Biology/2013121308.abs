the tiers and dimensions of evasion of the type i interferon response by human cytomegalovirus
human cytomegalovirus hcmv is a member of the  herpesvirus family that invariably occupies hosts for life despite a consistent multi pronged antiviral immune response that targets the infection this persistence is enabled by the large viral genome that encodes factors conferring a wide assortment of sophisticated often redundant phenotypes that disable or otherwise manipulate impactful immune effector processes the type i interferon system represents a first line of host defense against infecting viruses the physiological reactions induced by secreted interferon act to effectively block replication of a broad spectrum of virus types including hcmv as such the virus must exhibit counteractive mechanisms to these responses that involve their inhibition tolerance or re purposing the goal of this review is to describe the impact of the type i interferon system on hcmv replication and to showcase the number and diversity of strategies employed by the virus that allow infection of hosts in the presence of interferon dependent activity
