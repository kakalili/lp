the crystal structure of a major dust mite allergen der p  and its biological implications
the crystal structure of the common house mite dermatophagoides sp  der p  allergen was solved at    resolution using the mad phasing technique and refined to an r factor of    the refined atomic model which reveals an immunoglobulin like tertiary fold differs in important ways from the previously described nmr structure because the two  sheets are significantly further apart and create an internal cavity which is occupied by a hydrophobic ligand this interaction is structurally reminiscent of the binding of a prenyl group by a regulatory protein the rho guanine nucleotide exchange inhibitor the crystal structure suggests that binding of non polar molecules may be essential to the physiological function of the der p  protein
