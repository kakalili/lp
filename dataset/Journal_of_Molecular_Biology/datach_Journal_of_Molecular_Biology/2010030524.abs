motif iii in superfamily   helicases  helps convert the binding energy of atp into a high affinity rna binding site in the yeast dead box protein ded
motif iii in the putative helicases of superfamily  is highly conserved in both its sequence and its structural context it typically consists of the sequence alcohol  alanine  alcohol s t a s t  historically it was thought to link atpase activity with a  helicase  strand displacement activity that disrupts rna or dna duplexes dead box proteins constitute the largest family of superfamily  they are rna dependent atpases and atp dependent rna binding proteins that in some cases are able to disrupt short rna duplexes we made mutations of motif iii s a t in the yeast dead box protein ded and analyzed in vivo phenotypes and in vitro properties moreover we made a tertiary model of ded based on the solved structure of vasa we used ded because it has relatively high atpase and rna binding activities it is able to displace moderately stable duplexes at a large excess of substrate we find that the alanine and the threonine in the second and third positions of motif iii are more important than the serine but that mutations of all three residues have strong phenotypes we purified the wild type and various mutants expressed in escherichia coli we found that motif iii mutations affect the rna dependent hydrolysis of atp kcat  but not the affinity for atp km  moreover mutations alter and reduce the affinity for single stranded rna and subsequently reduce the ability to disrupt duplexes we obtained intragenic suppressors of the s a c mutant that compensate for the mutation by enhancing the affinity for atp and rna we conclude that motif iii and the binding energy of  po of atp are used to coordinate motifs i ii and vi and the two reca like domains to create a high affinity single stranded rna binding site it also may help activate the    phosphoanhydride bond of atp
