molecular basis for immune complex recognition a comparison of fc receptor structures
once antigen is opsonised by igg it is removed from the circulation by fc  receptor expressing cells fc  receptors are type i transmembrane molecules that carry extracellular parts consisting of two or three immunoglobulin domains previously solved structures of fc receptors reveal that the n terminal two ig like domains are arranged in a steep angle forming a heart shaped structure the crystal structure of the fc riii higg fc fragment demonstrated that the fc fragment is recognised through loops of the c terminal receptor domain of the fc riii as the overall structure of the fcrs and their ig ligands are very similar we modelled the ig complexes with fc ri fc rii and fc ri  based on the fc riii higg fc fragment structure the obtained models are consistent with the observed biochemical data and may explain the observed specificity and affinities
