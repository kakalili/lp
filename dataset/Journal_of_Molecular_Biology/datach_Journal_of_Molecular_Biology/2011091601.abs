nmr analysis of a kinetically trapped intermediate of a disulfide deficient mutant of the starch binding domain of glucoamylase
a thermally unfolded disulfide deficient mutant of the starch binding domain of glucoamylase refolds into a kinetically trapped metastable intermediate when subjected to a rapid lowering of temperature we attempted to characterise this intermediate using multidimensional nmr spectroscopy the h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum after a rapid temperature decrease the spectrum of the intermediate showed good chemical shift dispersion but was significantly different from that of the native state suggesting that the intermediate adopts a nonnative but well structured conformation large chemical shift changes for the backbone amide protons between the native and the intermediate states were observed for residues in the  sheet consisting of strands       and  as well as in the c terminal region these residues were found to be in close proximity to aromatic residues suggesting that the chemical shift changes are mainly due to ring current shifts caused by the aromatic residues the two dimensional nuclear overhauser enhancement noe spectroscopy experiments showed that the intermediate contained substantial native like noe connectivities although there were fewer cross peaks in the spectrum of the intermediate compared with that of the native state it was also shown that there were native like interresidue noes for residues buried in the protein whereas many of the noe cross peaks were lost for the residues involved in a surface exposed aromatic cluster these results suggest that in the intermediate the aromatic cluster at the surface is structurally less organised whereas the interior of the protein has relatively rigid native like side chain packing
