cleavage specificity of enterococcus faecalis enpa ef    a peptidoglycan endopeptidase related to the lytm lysostaphin family of metallopeptidases
enterococcus faecalis enpa ef   is a   residue predicted protein encoded by prophage  that displays similarity to the staphylolytic glycyl  glycyl endopeptidases lysostaphin and lytm we purified a catalytically active fragment of the protein enpac comprising residues       and showed that the recombinant polypeptide efficiently cleaved cross linked muropeptides generated by muramidases but was poorly active in intact sacculi analysis of the products of digestion of purified dimers by mass spectrometry indicated that enpac cleaves the d ala l ala bond formed by the d d transpeptidase activity of penicillin binding proteins in the last cross linking step of peptidoglycan synthesis synthetic d was identified as the minimum substrate of enpac indicating that interaction of the enzyme with the donor peptide stem of cross linked dimers is sufficient for its activity peptidoglycan was purified from various bacterial species and digested with mutanolysin and enpac to assess enzyme specificity enpac did not cleave direct cross links but tolerated extensive variation in cross bridges with respect to both their length one to five residues and their amino acid sequence recognition of the donor stem of cross linked dimers could account for the substrate specificity of enpac which is significantly broader in comparison to endopeptidases belonging to the lysostaphin family
