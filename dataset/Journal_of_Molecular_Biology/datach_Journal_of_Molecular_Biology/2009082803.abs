insights into trna dependent amidotransferase evolution and catalysis from the structure of the aquifex aeolicus enzyme
many bacteria form gln trnagln and asn trnaasn by conversion of the misacylated glu trnagln and asp trnaasn species catalyzed by the gatcab amidotransferase in the presence of atp and an amide donor glutamine or asparagine  here we report the crystal structures of gatcab from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus complexed with glutamine asparagine aspartate adp or atp in contrast to the staphylococcus aureus gatcab the a aeolicus enzyme formed acyl enzyme intermediates with either glutamine or asparagine in line with the equally facile use by the amidotransferase of these amino acids as amide donors in the transamidation reaction a water filled ammonia channel is open throughout the length of the a aeolicus gatcab from the gata active site to the synthetase catalytic pocket in the b subunit a non catalytic zn  site in the a aeolicus gatb stabilizes subunit contacts and the ammonia channel judged from sequence conservation in the known gatcab sequences the zn  binding motif was likely present in the primordial gatb e but became lost in certain lineages e g  s aureus gatb  two divalent metal binding sites one permanent and the other transient are present in the catalytic pocket of the a aeolicus gatb the two sites enable gatcab to first phosphorylate the misacylated trna substrate and then amidate the activated intermediate to form the cognate products gln trnagln or asn trnaasn
