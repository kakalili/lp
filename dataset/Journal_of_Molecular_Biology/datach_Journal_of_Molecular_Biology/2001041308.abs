three dimensional cluster analysis identifies interfaces and functional residue clusters in proteins edited by j thornton
three dimensional cluster analysis offers a method for the prediction of functional residue clusters in proteins this method requires a representative structure and a multiple sequence alignment as input data individual residues are represented in terms of regional alignments that reflect both their structural environment and their evolutionary variation as defined by the alignment of homologous sequences from the overall global and the residue specific regional alignments we calculate the global and regional similarity matrices containing scores for all pairwise sequence comparisons in the respective alignments comparing the matrices yields two scores for each residue the regional conservation score cr x  defines the conservation of each residue x and its neighbors in d space relative to the protein as a whole the similarity deviation score s x  detects residue clusters with sequence similarities that deviate from the similarities suggested by the full length sequences we evaluated d cluster analysis on a set of  families of proteins with available cocrystal structures showing small ligand interfaces nucleic acid interfaces and two types of protein protein interfaces transient and stable  we present two examples in detail fructose   bisphosphate aldolase and the mitogen activated protein kinase erk  we found that the regional conservation score cr x  identifies functional residue clusters better than a scoring scheme that does not take d information into account cr x is particularly useful for the prediction of poorly conserved transient protein protein interfaces many of the proteins studied contained residue clusters with elevated similarity deviation scores these residue clusters correlate with specificity conferring regions  d cluster analysis therefore represents an easily applied method for the prediction of functionally relevant spatial clusters of residues in proteins
