a nuclear localization signal at the sam  sam domain interface of aida  suggests a requirement for domain uncoupling prior to nuclear import
the neuronal scaffolding protein aida  is believed to act as a convener of signals arising at postsynaptic densities among the readily identifiable domains in aida  two closely juxtaposed sterile alpha motif sam domains and a phosphotyrosine binding domain are located within the c terminus of the longest splice variant and exclusively in four shorter splice variants as a first step towards understanding the possible emergent properties arising from this assembly of ligand binding domains we have used nmr methods to solve the first structure of a sam domain tandem separated by a  aa linker the two sam domains are fused in a head to tail orientation that has been observed in other hetero and homotypic sam domain structures the basic nuclear import signal for aida  is buried at the interface between the two sam domains an observed disparity between the thermal stabilities of the two sam domains suggests a mechanism whereby the second sam domain decouples from the first sam domain to facilitate translocation of aida  to the nucleus
