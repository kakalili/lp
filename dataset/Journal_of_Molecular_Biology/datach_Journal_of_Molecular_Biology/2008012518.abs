structural studies on the second mycobacterium smegmatis dps invariant and variable features of structure assembly and function
a second dna binding protein from stationary phase cells of mycobacterium smegmatis msdps  has been identified from the bacterial genome it was cloned expressed and characterised and its crystal structure was determined the core dodecameric structure of msdps is the same as that of the dps from the organism described earlier msdps  however msdps possesses a long n terminal tail instead of the c terminal tail in msdps  this tail appears to be involved in dna binding it is also intimately involved in stabilizing the dodecamer partly on account of this factor msdps assembles straightway into the dodecamer while msdps does so on incubation after going through an intermediate trimeric stage the ferroxidation centre is similar in the two proteins while the pores leading to it exhibit some difference the mode of sequestration of dna in the crystalline array of molecules as evidenced by the crystal structures appears to be different in msdps and msdps  highlighting the variability in the mode of dps  dna complexation a sequence search led to the identification of   dps molecules in bacteria with known genome sequences fifty bacteria contain two or more types of dps molecules each while   contain only one type some bacteria notably some pathogenic ones do not contain dps a sequence signature for dps could also be derived from the analysis
