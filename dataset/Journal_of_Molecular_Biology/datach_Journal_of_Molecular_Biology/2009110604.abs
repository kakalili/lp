structural evidence for a sequential release mechanism for activation of heterotrimeric g proteins
heptahelical g protein heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein coupled receptors couple to heterotrimeric g proteins to relay extracellular signals to intracellular signaling networks but the molecular mechanism underlying guanosine   diphosphate gdp release by the g protein  subunit is not well understood amino acid substitutions in the conserved   helix of gi which extends from the c terminal region to the nucleotide binding pocket cause dramatic increases in basal receptor independent gdp release rates for example mutant g i t  a shows an  fold increase in basal gdp release rate and when expressed in culture it causes a significant decrease in forskolin stimulated camp accumulation the crystal structure of g i t  a gdp shows substantial conformational rearrangement of the switch i region and additional striking alterations of side chains lining the catalytic pocket that disrupt the mg  coordination sphere and dislodge bound mg  we propose a  sequential release  mechanism whereby a transient conformational change in the   helix alters switch i to induce gdp release interestingly this mechanistic model for heterotrimeric g protein activation is similar to that suggested for the activation of the plant small g protein rop by ropgef
