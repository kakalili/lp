the extracellular chaperone clusterin potently inhibits human lysozyme amyloid formation by interacting with prefibrillar species
we have studied the effects of the extracellular molecular chaperone clusterin on the in vitro aggregation of mutational variants of human lysozyme including one associated with familial amyloid disease the aggregation of the amyloidogenic variant i t is inhibited significantly at clusterin to lysozyme ratios as low as    i e one clusterin molecule per  lysozyme molecules  experiments indicate that under the conditions where inhibition of aggregation occurs clusterin does not bind detectably to the native or fibrillar states of lysozyme or to the monomeric transient intermediate known to be a key species in the aggregation reaction rather it seems to interact with oligomeric species that are present at low concentrations during the lag nucleation phase of the aggregation reaction this behavior suggests that clusterin and perhaps other extracellular chaperones could have a key role in curtailing the potentially pathogenic effects of the misfolding and aggregation of proteins that like lysozyme are secreted into the extracellular environment
