identification and characterization of the chaperone subunit complex binding domain from the type  pilus assembly platform fimd
the outer membrane protein fimd represents the assembly platform of adhesive type  pili from escherichia coli fimd forms ring shaped oligomers of   kda subunits that recognize complexes between the pilus chaperone fimc and individual pilus subunits in the periplasm and mediate subunit translocation through the outer membrane here we have identified a periplasmic domain of fimd fimdn comprising the n terminal   residues of fimd purified fimdn is a monomeric soluble protein that specifically recognizes complexes between fimc and individual type  pilus subunits but does not bind the isolated chaperone or isolated subunits in addition fimdn retains the ability of fimd to recognize different chaperone subunit complexes with different affinities and has the highest affinity towards the fimc  fimh complex overexpression of fimdn in the periplasm of wild type e coli cells diminished incorporation of fimh at the tip of type  pili while pilus assembly itself was not affected the identification of fimdn and its ternary complexes with fimc and individual pilus subunits opens the avenue to structural characterization of critical type  pilus assembly intermediates
