mutational analysis of archaeal histone dna interactions edited by j h miller
site specific mutagenesis of the hmfb gene cloned from the archaeon methanothermus fervidus followed by expression in escherichia coli has been used to generate    recombinant r variants of the archaeal histone hmfb the abilities of these variants to form stable archaeal nucleosome containing complexes with linear pbr  dna and with an  bp restriction fragment of this dna have been determined variants that failed to form such complexes based on negative gel shift assays had substitutions at the n terminus or within the   l and l regions of the rhmfb histone fold at sites predicted to be homologous to eucaryal histone fold residues that contact the dna in the eucaryal nucleosome variants that failed to give gel shifts were further assayed for their abilities to facilitate ligase catalyzed circularization of a linear  bp dna molecule and to reduce the ellipticity of a dna solution at   nm     consistent with cooperative but independent sites of dna binding a combination of three residue substitutions one each in   l and l  was required to generate a rhmfb variant with no detectable dna binding based on gel shift circularization and    reduction assays
