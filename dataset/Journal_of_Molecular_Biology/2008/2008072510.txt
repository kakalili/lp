Extensive effort is currently being expended on the innovative design and engineering of new molecular carrier systems for the organelle-targeted delivery of biological cargoes (e.g., peptide aptamers or biological proteins) as tools in cell biology and for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Although cell-permeable Tat peptides are useful carriers for delivering biological molecules into the cell, much internalized Tat-fused cargo is trapped within macropinosomes and thus not delivered into organelles. Here, we devised a novel intracellular targeting technique to deliver Tat-fused cargo into the nucleus using an endosome-disruptive peptide (hemagglutinin-2 subunit) and a nuclear localization signal peptide. We show for the first time that Tat-conjugated peptide aptamers can be selectively delivered to the nucleus by using combined hemagglutinin-2 subunit and nuclear localization signal peptides. This nuclear targeting technique resulted in marked enhancement of the cytostatic activity of a Tat-fused p53-derived peptide aptamer against human MDM2 (mouse double minute 2) that inhibits p53â€“MDM2 binding. Thus, our technique provides a unique methodology for the development of novel therapeutic approaches based on intracellular targeting.
