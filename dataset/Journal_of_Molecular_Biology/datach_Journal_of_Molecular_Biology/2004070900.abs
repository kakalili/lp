a captured folding intermediate involved in dimerization and domain swapping of gb
immunoglobulin binding domain b of streptococcal protein g gb  a small   residues  stable single domain protein is one of the most extensively used model systems in the area of protein folding and design the recently determined nmr structure of a quadruple mutant hs  f a l v f v y f a f revealed a domain swapped dimer that dissociated into a partially folded monomeric species at low micromolar protein concentrations here we have characterized this monomeric partially folded species by nmr and show that extensive conformational heterogeneity for a substantial portion of the polypeptide chain exists exchange between the conformers within the monomer ensemble on the microsecond to millisecond timescale renders the majority of backbone amide resonances broadened beyond detection despite these extensive temporal and spatial fluctuations the overall architecture of the monomeric mutant protein resembles that of wild type gb and not the monomer unit of the domain swapped dimer
