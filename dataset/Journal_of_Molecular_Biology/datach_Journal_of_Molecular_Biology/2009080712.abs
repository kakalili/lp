electrostatic interactions contribute to the folded back conformation of wild type human factor h
factor h fh  a major serum regulator of c b in the complement alternative pathway is composed of  short complement regulator scr domains earlier solution structures for fh showed that this has a folded back domain arrangement and exists as oligomers to clarify the molecular basis for this analytical ultracentrifugation and x ray scattering studies of native fh were performed as a function of nacl concentration and ph the sedimentation coefficient for the fh monomer decreased from   s to   s with increase in nacl concentration showing that weak electrostatic inter domain interactions affect its folded back structure fh became more elongated at ph   showing the involvement of histidine residue s in its folded back structure similar studies of partially deglycosylated fh suggested that oligosaccharides were not significant in determining the fh domain structure the formation of fh oligomers decreased with increased nacl concentration indicating that electrostatic interactions also affect this x ray scattering showed that the maximum length of fh increased from   nm in low salt to   nm in high salt constrained x ray scattering modelling was used to generate significantly improved fh molecular structures at medium resolution in   mm nacl the modelled structures showed that inter scr domain contacts are likely while these contacts are fewer in   mm nacl the results of this study show that the conformation of fh is affected by its local environment and this may be important for its interactions with c b and when bound to polyanionic cell surfaces
