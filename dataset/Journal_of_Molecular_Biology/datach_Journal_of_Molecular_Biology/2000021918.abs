dimerisation mutants of lac repressor ii a single amino acid substitution d  l changes the specificity of dimerisation edited by m yaniv
assembly of the lactose repressor tetramer involves two subunit interfaces the c terminal heptad repeats and the monomer monomer interface dimerisation between two monomers of lac repressor of escherichia coli lacking the two c terminal heptad repeats occurs through the interactions between three  helices of each monomer which form a highly hydrophobic interface residues possibly involved in specific dimer formation are known from x ray studies and from the phenotypes of more than   single amino acid substitutions during the examination of numerous mutants within the dimerisation interface of lac repressor we found that substitution of one amino acid d  to leucine is sufficient to change the specificity of dimerisation analysis of this single substitution indicates that d  l mutant lac repressor represses like wild type however it no longer forms heterodimers with wild type lac repressor
