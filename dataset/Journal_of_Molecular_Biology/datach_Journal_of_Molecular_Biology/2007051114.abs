the external alternative nad p h dehydrogenase nde is localized both in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm of neurospora crassa
the filamentous fungus neurospora crassa has a branched respiratory chain several alternative dehydrogenases aside from the canonical complex i enzyme are involved in the oxidation of nad p h substrates based on homology searches in the fungal genome we have tentatively identified one of these proteins the corresponding gene was inactivated by the generation of repeat induced point mutations and a null mutant strain was isolated this mutant is deficient in the oxidation of cytosolic nadh and to a lesser extent nadph thus a fourth mitochondrial alternative nad p h dehydrogenase named nde  was recognized in n crassa interestingly a combination of western blot analysis of cell fractions and the in vivo detection of the protein fused to the green fluorescent protein revealed that it is also located in the fungal cytoplasm in contrast to the other nad p h dehydrogenases expression of the nde  gene is up regulated in the late exponential growth phase of n crassa the absence of the protein results in an up regulation of the nde  transcript in this phase of growth suggesting that the proteins are important in specific stages of fungal development the identification of the proteins responsible for the entry point of electrons from nad p h into the respiratory chain of n crassa is likely completed
