structural and mechanistic characterization of leukocyte type core     n acetylglucosaminyltransferase a metal ion independent gt a glycosyltransferase
leukocyte type core     n acetylglucosaminyltransferase c gnt l is an inverting metal ion independent glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of mucin type core  o glycans c gnt l belongs to the gt a fold yet it lacks the metal ion binding dxd motif characteristic of other nucleoside disphosphate gt a fold glycosyltransferases to shed light on the basis for its metal ion independence we have solved the x ray crystal structure     resolution of a mutant form of c gnt l c  s in complex with the nucleotide sugar product udp and using site directed mutagenesis examined the roles of r  and k  in both substrate binding and catalysis the structure shows that c gnt l exists in an  open  conformation and a  closed  conformation and that in the latter r  and k  interact with the  phosphate moiety of the bound udp the two conformations are likely to be important in catalysis but the conformational changes that lead to their interconversion do not resemble the nucleotide sugar mediated loop ordering observed in other gt a glycosyltransferases r  and k  were found to be important in substrate binding and or catalysis an observation consistent with the suggestion that they serve the same role played by metal ion in all of the other gt a glycosyltransferases studied to date notably r  and k  appear to function in a manner similar to that of the arginine and lysine residues contained in the rx  k motif found in the retaining gt b glycosyltransferases
