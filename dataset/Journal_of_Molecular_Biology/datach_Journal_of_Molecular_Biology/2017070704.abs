rna g quadruplexes in biology principles and molecular mechanisms
g quadruplexes g s are extremely stable dna or rna secondary structures formed by sequences rich in guanine these structures are implicated in many essential cellular processes and the number of biological functions attributed to them continues to grow while dna g s are well understood on structural and to some extent functional levels rna g s and their functions have received less attention the presence of bona fide rna g s in cells has long been a matter of debate the development of g specific antibodies and ligands hinted on their presence in vivo but recent advances in rna sequencing coupled with chemical footprinting suggested the opposite in this review we will critically discuss the biology of rna g s focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying their proposed functions
