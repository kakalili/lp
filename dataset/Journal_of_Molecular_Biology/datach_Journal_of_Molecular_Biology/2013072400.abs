three dimensional model for the human cl  hco   exchanger ae  by homology to the e coli clc protein
ae mediates electroneutral   exchange of bicarbonate for chloride across the plasma membrane of erythrocytes and type a cells of the renal collecting duct no high resolution structure is available for the ae membrane domain which alone is required for its transport activity a recent electron microscopy structure of the ae membrane domain was proposed to have a similar protein fold to clc chloride channels we developed a three dimensional homology model of the ae membrane domain using the escherichia coli clc channel structure as a template this model agrees well with a long list of biochemically established spatial constraints for ae  to investigate the ae transport mechanism we created point mutations in regions corresponding to e coli clc transport mechanism residues when expressed in hek  cells several mutants had cl  hco   exchange rates significantly different from that of wild type ae  when further assessed in xenopus laevis oocytes there were significant changes in the transport activity of several ae point mutants as assessed by changes in ph none of the mutants however added an electrogenic component to ae transport activity this indicates that the ae point mutants altered the transport activity of ae  without changing its electrogenicity and stoichiometry the homology model successfully identified residues in ae that are critical to ae transport activity thus we conclude that ae has a similar protein fold to clc chloride channels
