nmr structure of the escherichia coli type  pilus subunit fimf and its interactions with other pilus subunits
type  pili from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains mediate bacterial attachment to target receptors on the host tissue they are composed of up to   copies of the subunit fima which form the stiff helical pilus rod and the subunits fimf fimg and fimh which form the linear tip fibrillum all subunits in the pilus interact via donor strand complementation in which the incomplete immunoglobulin like fold of each subunit is complemented by insertion of an n terminal extension from the following subunit we determined the nmr structure of a monomeric self complemented variant of fimf fimff which has a second fimf donor strand segment fused to its c terminus that enables intramolecular complementation of the fimf fold nmr studies on bimolecular complexes between fimff and donor strand depleted variants of fimf and fimg revealed that the relative orientations of neighboring domains in the tip fibrillum cover a wide range the data provide strong support for the intrinsic flexibility of the tip fibrillum they lend further support to the hypothesis that this flexibility would significantly increase the probability that the adhesin at the distal end of the fibrillum successfully targets host cell receptors
