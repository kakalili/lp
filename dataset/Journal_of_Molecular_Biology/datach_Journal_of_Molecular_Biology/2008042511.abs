the folding pathway of a single domain in a multidomain protein is not affected by its neighbouring domain
domains are the structural functional and evolutionary components of proteins most folding studies to date have concentrated on the folding of single domains but more than   of human proteins contain more than one domain and interdomain interactions can affect both the stability and the folding kinetics whether the folding pathway is altered by interdomain interactions is not yet known here we investigated the effect of a folded neighbouring domain on the folding pathway of spectrin r  the  th  helical repeat from chicken brain  spectrin by using the two domain construct r   the r  folds faster and unfolds more slowly in the presence of its folded neighbour r  the  th  helical repeat from chicken brain  spectrin  an extensive  value analysis of the r  domain in r   was completed to compare the transition state of the r  domain alone with that of the r  domain in a multidomain construct the results indicate that the folding pathways are the same this result validates the current approach of breaking up larger proteins into domains for the study of protein folding pathways
