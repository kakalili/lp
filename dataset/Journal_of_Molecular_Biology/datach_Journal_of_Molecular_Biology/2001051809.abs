kinetic and crystallographic studies on deacetoxycephalosporin c synthase daocs  edited by r huber
deacetoxycephalosporin c synthase daocs is an iron ii and  oxoglutarate dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of penicillin n to deacetoxycephalosporin c the committed step in the biosynthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics the crystal structure of daocs revealed that the c terminus of one molecule is inserted into the active site of its neighbor in a cyclical fashion within a trimeric unit this arrangement has hindered the generation of crystalline enzyme substrate complexes therefore we constructed a series of daocs mutants with modified c termini oxidation of  oxoglutarate was significantly uncoupled from oxidation of the penicillin substrate in certain truncated mutants the extent of uncoupling varied with the number of residues deleted and the penicillin substrate used crystal structures were determined for the  r  mutant complexed with iron ii and  oxoglutarate to     and the  r  a mutant complexed with iron ii  succinate and unhydrated carbon dioxide to      the latter may mimic a product complex and supports proposals for a metal bound co intermediate during catalysis
