β-barrel membrane proteins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Although sequence motifs have been studied in α-helical membrane proteins and have been shown to play important roles in their assembly, it is not clear whether over-represented motifs and under-represented anti-motifs exist in β-barrel membrane proteins. We have developed probabilistic models to identify sequence motifs of residue pairs on the same strand separated by an arbitrary number of residues. A rigorous statistical model is essential for this study because of the difficulty associated with the short length of the strands and the small amount of structural data. By comparing to the null model of exhaustive permutation of residues within the same β-strand, propensity values of sequence patterns of two residues and p-values measuring statistical significance are calculated exactly by several analytical formulae we have developed or by enumeration. We find that there are characteristic sequence motifs and antimotifs in transmembrane (TM) β-strands. The amino acid Tyr plays an important role in several such motifs. We find a general dichotomy consisting of favorable Aliphatic-Tyr sequence motifs and unfavorable Tyr-Aliphatic antimotifs. Tyr is also part of a terminal motif, YxF, which is likely to be important for chaperone binding. Our results also suggest several experiments that can help to elucidate the mechanisms of in vitro and in vivo folding of β-barrel membrane proteins.
