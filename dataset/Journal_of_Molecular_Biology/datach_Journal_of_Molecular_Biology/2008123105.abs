the interrelationship of helicase and nuclease domains during dna translocation by the molecular motor ecor  i
the type i restriction  modification enzyme ecor  i comprises three subunits with the stoichiometry hsdr hsdm hsds  the hsdr subunits are archetypical examples of the fusion between nuclease and helicase domains into a single polypeptide a linkage that is found in a great many other dna processing enzymes to explore the interrelationship between these physically linked domains we examined the dna translocation properties of ecor  i complexes in which the hsdr subunits had been mutated in the recb like nuclease motif ii or iii we found that nuclease mutations can have multiple effects on dna translocation despite being distinct from the helicase domain in addition to reductions in dna cleavage activity we also observed decreased translocation and atpase rates different enzyme populations with different characteristic translocation rates a tendency to stall during initiation and altered hsdr turnover dynamics the significance of these observations to our understanding of domain interactions in molecular machines is discussed
