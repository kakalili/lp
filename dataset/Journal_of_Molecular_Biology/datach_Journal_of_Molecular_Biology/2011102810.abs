binding and selectivity of the marine toxin neodysiherbaine a and its synthetic analogues to gluk and gluk kainate receptors
dysiherbaine dh and neodysiherbaine a ndh selectively bind and activate two kainate type ionotropic glutamate receptors gluk and gluk  the ligand binding domains of human gluk and gluk were crystallized as bound forms with a series of dh analogues including dh ndh  deoxy ndh  deoxy ndh and   dideoxy ndh msviii   isolated from natural sources or prepared by total synthesis since the dh analogues exhibit a wide range of binding affinities and agonist efficacies it follows that the detailed analysis of crystal structure would provide us with a significant opportunity to elucidate structural factors responsible for selective binding and some aspects of gating efficacy we found that differences in three amino acids thr   ser  and ser  in gluk and ala   asn  and thr  in gluk  in the ligand binding pocket generate differences in the binding modes of ndh to gluk and gluk  furthermore deletion of the c hydroxy group in ndh alters the ligand conformation such that it is no longer suited for binding to the gluk ligand binding pocket in gluk  ndh pushes and rotates the side chain of asn   substituted for ser  in gluk  and disrupts an interdomain hydrogen bond with glu   the present data support the idea that receptor selectivities of dh analogues resulted from the differences in the binding modes of the ligands in gluk gluk and the steric repulsion of asn  in gluk  all ligands regardless of agonist efficacy induced full domain closure consequently ligand efficacy and domain closure did not directly coincide with dh analogues and the kainate receptors
