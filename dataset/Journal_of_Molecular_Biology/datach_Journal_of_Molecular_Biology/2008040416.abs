the   ends of mature transcripts are generated by a processosome complex in fission yeast mitochondria
in this article we report on the genetic analysis of the schizosaccharomyces pombe open reading frames spcc    and spac    respectively which encode proteins that are similar to the exoribonuclease dss p and the rna helicase suv p respectively forming the mitochondrial degradosome of saccharomyces cerevisiae while the helicase suv p is exchangeable between s cerevisiae and s pombe the functions of dss p and the putative fission yeast rnase protein are specific for each species unlike s cerevisiae mutants lacking a functional degradosome the major defect of fission yeast knock out strains is their inability to perform downstream processing of transcripts in addition the lack of pah results in instability of mitochondrial rna ends overexpression of par and pah has no significant effect on the steady state levels of mitochondrial rnas the pet  p stimulated rna degradation activity is independent of par p pah p in fission yeast mitochondria the results presented herein indicate that both fission yeast proteins play only a minor role if at all in mitochondrial rna degradation we assume that the rna degrading function was taken over by other enzymes in fission yeast mitochondria while the former degradosome proteins were recruited to new cellular pathways for example rna processing in fission yeast as discussed in this article or mitochondrial dna replication apoptosis or chromatin maintenance in eukaryotes during evolution
