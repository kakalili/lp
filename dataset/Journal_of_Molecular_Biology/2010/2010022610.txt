The calcium-triggered neurotransmitter release requires three SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins: synaptobrevin 2 (or vesicle-associated membrane protein 2) on the synaptic vesicle and syntaxin 1 and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa) at the presynaptic plasma membrane. This minimal fusion machinery is believed to drive fusion of the vesicle to the presynaptic membrane. Complexin, also known as synaphin, is a neuronal cytosolic protein that acts as a major regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Stimulatory and inhibitory effects of complexin have both been reported, suggesting the duality of its function. To shed light on the molecular basis of the complexin's dual function, we have performed an EPR investigation of the complexin–SNARE quaternary complex. We found that the accessory α-helix (amino acids 27–48) by itself has the capacity to replace the C-terminus of the SNARE motif of vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 in the four-helix bundle and makes the SNARE complex weaker when the N-terminal region of complexin I (amino acids 1–26) is removed. However, the accessory α-helix remains detached from the SNARE core when the N-terminal region of complexin I is present. Thus, our data show the possibility that the balance between the activities of the accessory α-helix and the N-terminal domain might determine the final outcome of the complexin function, either stimulatory or inhibitory.
