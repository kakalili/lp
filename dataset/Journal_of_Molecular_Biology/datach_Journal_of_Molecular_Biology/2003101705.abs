s adenosyl methionine prevents promiscuous dna cleavage by the ecop i type iii restriction enzyme
dna cleavage by the type iii restriction endonuclease ecop i was analysed on circular and catenane dna in a variety of buffers with different salts in the presence of the cofactor s adenosyl methionine adomet  and irrespective of buffer only substrates with two ecop i sites in inverted repeat were susceptible to cleavage maximal activity was achieved at a res mod to site ratio of    yet resulted in cleavage at only one of the two sites in contrast the outcome of reactions in the absence of adomet was dependent upon the identity of the monovalent buffer components in particular the identity of the cation with na  cleavage was observed only on substrates with two sites in inverted repeat at elevated enzyme to site ratios  gt    however with k every substrate tested was susceptible to cleavage above an enzyme to site ratio of     including a dna molecule with two directly repeated sites and even a dna molecule with a single site above an enzyme to site ratio of   substrates with two sites in inverted repeat were cleaved at both cognate sites the rates of cleavage suggested two separate events a fast primary reaction for the first cleavage of a pair of inverted sites and an order of magnitude slower secondary reaction for the second cleavage of the pair or for the first cleavage of all other site combinations ecop i enzymes mutated in either the atpase or nuclease motifs did not produce the secondary cleavage reactions thus adomet appears to play a dual role in type iii endonuclease reactions firstly as an allosteric activator promoting dna association and secondly as a  specificity factor   ensuring that cleavage occurs only when two endonucleases bind two recognition sites in a designated orientation however given the right conditions adomet is not strictly required for dna cleavage by a type iii enzyme
