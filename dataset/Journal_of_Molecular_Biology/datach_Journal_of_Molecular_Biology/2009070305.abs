decreased sensitivity to changes in the concentration of metal ions as the basis for the hyperactivity of dtxr e  k
the metal ion activated diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr is responsible for the regulation of virulence and other genes in corynebacterium diphtheriae a single point mutation in dtxr dtxr e  k  causes this mutant repressor to have a hyperactive phenotype mice infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis transformed with plasmids carrying this mutant gene show reduced signs of the tuberculosis infection corynebacterial dtxr is able to complement mycobacterial ider and vice versa to date an explanation for the hyperactivity of dtxr e  k has remained elusive in an attempt to address this issue we have solved the first crystal structure of dtxr e  k and characterized this mutant using circular dichroism isothermal titration calorimetry and other biochemical techniques the results show that although dtxr e  k and the wild type have similar secondary structures dtxr e  k gains additional thermostability upon activation with metal ions which may lead to this mutant requiring a lower concentration of metal ions to reach the same levels of thermostability as the wild type protein the e  k mutation causes binding site  to retain metal ion bound at all times which can only be removed by incubation with an ion chelator the crystal structure of dtxr e  k shows an empty binding site  without evidence of oxidation of cys   the association constant for this low affinity binding site of dtxr e  k obtained from calorimetric titration with ni ii is ka        which is very similar to the reported value for the wild type repressor ka      both the wild type and dtxr e  k require the same amount of metal ion to produce a shift in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay but unlike the wild type dtxr e  k binding to its cognate dna tox promoter  operator toxpo  does not require metal ion supplementation in the running buffer in the timescale of these experiments the mn ii dtxr e  k  toxpo complex is insensitive to changes in the environmental cation concentrations in addition to mn ii  ni ii  co ii  cd ii  and zn ii are able to sustain the hyperactive phenotype these results demonstrate a prominent role of binding site  in the activation of dtxr and support the hypothesis that dtxr e  k attenuates the expression of virulence due to the decreased ability of the me ii dtxr e  k  toxpo complex to dissociate at low concentrations of metal ions
