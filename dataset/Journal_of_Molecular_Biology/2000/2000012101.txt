Synthetic polyamides composed of three types of aromatic amino acids, N-methylimidazole (Im), N-methylpyrrole (Py) and N-methyl-3-hydroxypyrrole (Hp) bind specific DNA sequences as antiparallel dimers in the minor groove. The side-by-side pairings of aromatic rings in the dimer afford a general recognition code that allows all four base-pairs to be distinguished. To examine the structural consequences of changing the DNA sequence context on T·A recognition by Hp/Py pairs in the minor groove, crystal structures of polyamide dimers (ImPyHpPy)2 and the pyrrole counterpart (ImPyPyPy)2 bound to the six base-pair target site 5′-AGATCT-3′ in a ten base-pair oligonucleotide have been determined to a resolution of 2.27 and 2.15 Å, respectively. The structures demonstrate that the principles of Hp/Py recognition of T·A are consistent between different sequence contexts. However, a general structural explanation for the non-additive reduction in binding affinity due to introduction of the hydroxyl group is less clear. Comparison with other polyamide-DNA cocrystal structures reveals structural themes and differences that may relate to sequence preference.
