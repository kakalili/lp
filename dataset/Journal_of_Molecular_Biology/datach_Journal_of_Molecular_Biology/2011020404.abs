nmr insights into the core of ged assembly by h d exchange coupled with dmso dissociation and analysis of the denatured state
gtpase effector domain ged of dynamin forms megadalton sized assembly in vitro rendering its structural characterization highly challenging to probe the core of the ged assembly we performed h d exchange in native state and analyzed the residual amides following dissociation by dimethyl sulfoxide dmso  the data indicated a hierarchy in solvent exposure ser  glu  glu   phe  asp   gln  val   met  and lys   asp  followed by the remaining segments this reflects the chain packing in the core of the assembly the segment leu   pro  in the c terminal half is largely in the interior of the core while the n terminal segment asp   asp  traverses into and out of the core next we characterized the structural and motional behavior of the dmso denatured state the stretches gly  lys  asp   arg  lys   met  and ser   thr  were seen to display alternate conformations in slow exchange in the major population both  and  propensities were seen along the polypeptide chain spectral density analysis of  n r  r  and h  n nuclear overhauser effect collected at   and   mhz suggested the presence of four domains of slow motions namely a leu   tyr   a   leu   ile   b asn   gln   b   tyr   leu   two of which flank the region arg   met   for which no peaks are seen in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum these domains would identify folding and association initiation sites of ged interestingly they also coincide with the helical domain in the native state suggesting that helix formation leads to self association of ged
