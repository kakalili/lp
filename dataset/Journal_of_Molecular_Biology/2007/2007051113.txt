iASPP is an inhibitory member of ASPP (apoptosis stimulating protein of p53, or Ankyrin repeats, SH3 domain and proline-rich region contain Protein) family. As reported previously, it at least includes two isoforms, one is iASPP/RAI (351 amino acids, aa) and the other is iASPP (828 aa).Here, we identified a novel open reading frame of human iASPP, which encodes a 407 aa protein and highly matches with the C terminus of iASPP (828 aa, CAI60219). Hereafter, iASPP (407 aa) will be referred to as iASPP-SV (iASPP splice variant). In further study, we found that iASPP-SV is a nuclear protein, and is capable of binding to p53 in vivo. Moreover, overexpression of iASPP-SV can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53 on the promoters of both Bax and p21.
