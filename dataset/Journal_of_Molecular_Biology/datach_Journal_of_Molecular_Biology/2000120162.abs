search for intermediate structures in transthyretin fibrillogenesis soluble tetrameric tyr phe ttr expresses a specific epitope present only in amyloid fibrils edited by r huber
familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap is caused by the assembly of ttr into an insoluble  sheet the ttr tetramer is thought to dissociate into monomeric intermediates and subsequently polymerise into the pathogenic amyloid form the biochemical mechanism behind this transformation is unknown we characterised intermediate ttr structures in the in vitro amyloidogenesis pathway by destabilising the ab loop through substitution of residue   changes at this residue should destabilise the ttr tetrameric fold based on the known crystallographic structure of a leu pro transthyretin variant we generated a soluble tetrameric form of ttr that is recognised by a monoclonal antibody previously reported to react only with highly amyloidogenic mutant proteins lacking the tetrameric native fold and with amyloid fibrils biacore system analysis showed that tyr phe had similar binding properties as synthetic fibrils the affinity of this interaction was   m   we suggest that the tetrameric structure of tyr phe is altered due to the loosening of the ab loops of the tetramer leading to a structure that might represent an early intermediate in the fibrillogenesis pathway
