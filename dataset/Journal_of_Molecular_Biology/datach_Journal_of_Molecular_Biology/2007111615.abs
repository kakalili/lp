allosteric communication in dihydrofolate reductase signaling network and pathways for closed to occluded transition and back
escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase dhfr catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate during the catalytic cycle dhfr undergoes conformational transitions between the closed cs and occluded os states that respectively describe whether the active site is closed or occluded by the met  loop the cs  os and the reverse transition may be viewed as allosteric transitions using a sequence based approach we identify a network of residues that represents the allostery wiring diagram many of the residues in the allostery wiring diagram which are dispersed throughout the adenosine binding domain as well as the loop domain are not conserved several of the residues in the network have been previously shown by nmr experiments mutational studies and molecular dynamics simulations to be linked to equilibration conformational fluctuations of dhfr to further probe the nature of events that occur during conformational fluctuations we use a self organized polymer model to monitor the kinetics of the cs  os and the reverse transitions during the cs  os transition coordinated changes in a number of residues in the loop domain enable the met  loop to slide along the  helix in the adenosine binding domain sliding is triggered by pulling of the met  loop by the  g   h loop and the pushing action of the  g   h loop the residues that facilitate the met  loop motion are part of the network of residues that transmit allosteric signals during the cs  os transition replacement of m  and g   whose c  atoms are about     in the cs by a disulfide cross link impedes that cs  os transition the order of events in the os  cs transition is not the reverse of the forward transition the contact glu  ser  in the os persists until the sliding of the met  loop is nearly complete the ensemble of structures in the transition state in both the allosteric transitions is heterogeneous the most probable transition state structure resembles the os cs in the cs  os os  cs transition which is in accord with the hammond postulate structures resembling the os cs are present as minor       components in equilibrated cs os structures
