The calcium-dependent homophilic cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin typically connects epithelial cells. The extracellular portion of the mature transmembrane protein consists of five homologous domains. The four sequences linking these domains contain the structural amino acid motif DXXD that is thought to be involved in direct calcium binding. In gastric cancer patients mutations affecting this motif between the second and third domain are frequently seen. In order to determine the functional significance of similar sequence alterations with regard to their location, we analyzed single amino acid substitutions changing the DXXD motif to DXXA in each linker region according to a mutation found in gastric cancer (D370A). The cDNA sequences coding for DQND, DVLD and DVND were changed (D257A, D479A, D590A, respectively) and stably expressed in E-cadherin negative MDA-MB-435S mammary carcinoma cells. We found that the D257A and D370A mutations result in abnormal protein localization, changes in the actin cytoskeleton, markedly reduced homophilic cell adhesion, and altered cell morphology. Unexpectetly, the tumor-associated D370A mutation but not the D257A mutation induced increased cell motility. The D479A mutation only had slight functional consequences whereas cells expressing the D590A mutant did not differ from cells expressing the wild-type molecule. Although the putative calcium binding motif DXXD is located at repetitive positions in the extracellular portion of E-cadherin, our results indicate that it has different functions depending on the location. Remarkably, tumor cells select for mutations in the most critical domains resulting both in loss of function (decreased cell adhesion) and in gain of function (increased cell motility). Since multiple DXXD motifs are typically seen in other cadherins, our structure-function study is relevant for this gene family in general.
