structure of staphylococcus aureus esxa suggests a contribution to virulence by action as a transport chaperone and or adaptor protein
staphylococcus aureus pathogenesis depends on a specialized protein secretion system esx  that delivers a range of virulence factors to assist infectivity we report the characterization of two such factors esxa and esxb small acidic dimeric proteins carrying a distinctive wxg motif esxa crystallized in triclinic and monoclinic forms and high resolution structures were determined the asymmetric unit of each crystal form is a dimer the esxa subunit forms an elongated cylindrical structure created from side by side  helices linked with a hairpin bend formed by the wxg motif approximately   of the solvent accessible surface area of each subunit is involved in interactions predominantly hydrophobic with the partner subunit secondary structure predictions suggest that esxb displays a similar structure the wxg motif helps to create a shallow cleft at each end of the dimer forming a short  sheet like feature with an n terminal segment of the partner subunit structural and sequence comparisons exploiting biological data on related proteins found in mycobacterium tuberculosis suggest that this family of proteins may contribute to pathogenesis by transporting protein cargo through the esx  system exploiting a c terminal secretion signal and or are capable of acting as adaptor proteins to facilitate interactions with host receptor proteins
