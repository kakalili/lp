dna binding and in vivo function of c elegans peb  require a conserved flywch motif
caenorhabditis elegans peb  is a novel protein containing a dna binding domain in its n terminus which includes a cys his rich flywch motif also found in drosophila mod mdg  proteins and a large c terminal domain of unknown function peb  is expressed in most pharyngeal cell types but its molecular function remains unclear here we describe comparative and functional analyses of peb  characterization of the peb  sequence from c briggsae indicates highest conservation in the dna binding domain including the flywch motif and the c terminus suggesting two functional domains the peb  flywch motif is essential for dna binding and in vivo function however it does not bind detectable metal likewise the peb  c terminus is necessary for full activity in vivo although the dna binding domain alone is sufficient for partial function both the flywch motif and the c terminal domain are required for efficient nuclear localization suggesting peb  must bind dna and other components to remain in the nucleus analysis of binding sites revealed a ydtgccrw peb  consensus binding site and matches to this consensus are widespread in the c elegans genome
