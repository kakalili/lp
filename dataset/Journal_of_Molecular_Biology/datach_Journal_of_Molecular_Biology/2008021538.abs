molecular model of an  helical prion protein dimer and its monomeric subunits as derived from chemical cross linking and molecular modeling calculations
prions are the agents of a series of lethal neurodegenerative diseases they are composed largely if not entirely of the host encoded prion protein prp  which can exist in the cellular isoform prpc and the pathological isoform prpsc the conformational change of the  helical prpc into  sheet rich prpsc is the fundamental event of prion disease the transition of recombinant prp from a prpc like into a prpsc like conformation can be induced in vitro by submicellar concentrations of sds an  helical dimer was identified that might represent either the native state of prpc or the first step from the monomeric prpc to highly aggregated prpsc in the present study the molecular structure of these dimers was analyzed by introducing covalent cross links using  ethyl   dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide inter and intramolecular bonds between directly neighboured amino groups and carboxy groups were generated the bonds formed in prp dimers of recombinant prp      were identified by tryptic digestion and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis intra and intermolecular cross links between n terminal glycine and three acidic amino acid side chains in the globular part of prp were identified showing the n terminal amino acids      are not as flexible as known from nmr analysis when the cross linked sites were used as structural constraint molecular modeling calculations yielded a structural model for prp dimer and its monomeric subunit including the folding of amino acids     in addition to the known structure molecular dynamics of the structure after release of the constraint indicated an intrinsic stability of the domain of amino acids
