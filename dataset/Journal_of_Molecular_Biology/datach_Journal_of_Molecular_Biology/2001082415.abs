probing subtle differences in the hydrogen exchange behavior of variants of the human  lactalbumin molten globule using mass spectrometry edited by p e wright
the hydrogen exchange behavior of the low ph molten globule of human  lactalbumin containing all four disulfides has been examined and compared with that of a single disulfide variant       lactalbumin and of a series of proline variants of      lactalbumin the small differences in hydrogen exchange protection exhibited by these partially folded species were compared by mixing two or more proteins and monitoring their exchange simultaneously using mass spectrometry the effect of single proline mutations within each  domain helix on hydrogen exchange protection has been investigated using six proline variants of      lactalbumin l p l p m p i p k  p and q  p the results show that proline mutations in the a b c and d  helices lead to a loss of hydrogen exchange protection for residues in the local helix without perturbing hydrogen exchange protection in other regions of the protein thus local unfolding of the a b c and d helices does not significantly alter the packing and solvent accessibility of other regions of the molten globule by contrast introduction of a proline residue in the c terminal   helix produces a larger and more widespread loss of hydrogen exchange protection demonstrating that longer range perturbations of the molten globule have occurred thus residues in this c terminal region must be involved in contacts that are critical for the stabilisation of the compact molten globule structure
