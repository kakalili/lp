multiplexing rmce versatile extensions of the flp recombinase mediated cassette exchange technology
there are strong indications but as yet no proof that extended   bp flp recombinase targets frts represent unique targets in all eukaryotic genomes investigated and that recombinase mediated cassette exchange is not hampered by the occurrence of genomic pseudo sites this encouraged the present study in which we explore the feasibility of exchanging in a given cell two distinct genomically anchored cassettes each flanked by a unique set of two heterospecific frt sites mutant frts have to meet two major prerequisites for successful recombinase mediated cassette exchange  i a self recognition capacity comparable to a pair of frt wild type sites frt frt  and ii a negligible cross interaction if part of a set of heterospecific sites f   f  we apply a two step strategy to explore various newly created frt spacer mutants for these properties as a result of our screening steps we identify combinations of sites that are successfully applied to parallel flp mediated genomic targeting   multiplexing   reactions i e  the simultaneous exchange of two separate target cassettes in a given cell
