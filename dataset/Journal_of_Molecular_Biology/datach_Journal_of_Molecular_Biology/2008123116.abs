denaturant induced expansion and compaction of a multi domain protein igg
it is generally believed that unfolded or denatured proteins show random coil statistics and hence their radius of gyration simply scales with solvent quality or concentration of denaturant  indeed nearly all proteins studied thus far have been shown to undergo a gradual and continuous expansion with increasing concentration of denaturant here we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs to show that while protein a a multi domain and predominantly helical protein expands gradually and continuously with increasing concentration of guanidine hydrochloride gdnhcl  the f ab   fragment of goat anti rabbit antibody igg a multi subunit all  sheet protein does not show such continuous expansion behavior instead it first expands and then contracts with increasing concentration of gdnhcl even more striking is the fact that the hydrodynamic radius of the most expanded f ab   ensemble observed at    m gdnhcl is    times that of the native protein further fcs measurements involving urea and nacl show that the unusually expanded f ab   conformations might be due to electrostatic repulsions taken together these results suggest that specific interactions need to be considered while assessing the conformational and statistical properties of unfolded proteins particularly under conditions of low solvent quality
