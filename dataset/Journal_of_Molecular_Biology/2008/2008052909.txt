Archaea,2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase,FAH superfamily
The archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus converts d-arabinose to 2-oxoglutarate by an enzyme set consisting of two dehydrogenases and two dehydratases. The third step of the pathway is catalyzed by a novel 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabinonate dehydratase (KdaD). In this study, the crystal structure of the enzyme has been solved to 2.1 Å resolution. The enzyme forms an oval-shaped ring of four subunits, each consisting of an N-terminal domain with a four-stranded β-sheet flanked by two α-helices, and a C-terminal catalytic domain with a fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) fold. Crystal structures of complexes of the enzyme with magnesium or calcium ions and either a substrate analog 2-oxobutyrate, or the aldehyde enzyme product 2,5-dioxopentanoate revealed that the divalent metal ion in the active site is coordinated octahedrally by three conserved carboxylate residues, a water molecule, and both the carboxylate and the oxo groups of the substrate molecule. An enzymatic mechanism for base-catalyzed dehydration is proposed on the basis of the binding mode of the substrate to the metal ion, which suggests that the enzyme enhances the acidity of the protons α to the carbonyl group, facilitating their abstraction by glutamate 114. A comprehensive structural comparison of members of the FAH superfamily is presented and their evolution is discussed, providing a basis for functional investigations of this largely unexplored protein superfamily.
