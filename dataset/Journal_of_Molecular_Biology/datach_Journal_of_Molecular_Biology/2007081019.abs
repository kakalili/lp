crystallographic structure of the human leukocyte antigen dra drb    models of a directional alloimmune response and autoimmunity
we describe structural studies of the human leukocyte antigen dr a hla dra drb    in complex with an n terminal human platelet integrin  iib iii glycoprotein peptide which contains a leu pro dimorphism the  leu dimorphism is the epitope for the t cell directed response in neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and post transfusion purpura in individuals with the  iib iii  pro allele and defines the unidirectional alloimmune response this condition is always associated with dr a the crystallographic structure has been refined to      there are two   heterodimers to the asymmetric unit in space group p    the molecule is characterized by two prominent hydrophobic pockets at either end of the peptide binding cleft and a deep narrower and highly charged p opening underneath the beta  chain further the peptide in the second molecule displays a sharp upward turn after pocket p  the structure reveals the role of pockets and the distinctive basic p pocket shared by dr a and dr  in selecting their respective binding peptide repertoire we observe an interesting switch in a residue from the canonically assigned pocket  seen in prior class ii structures to pocket  this occludes the p pocket helping to explain the distinctive         peptide binding motif a   asp  val substitution abrogates the salt bridge to   arg and along with a hydrophobic   is important in shaping the p pocket drb    and drb    belong to an ancestral haplotype and are associated with many autoimmune diseases linked to antigen presentation but whereas dr is susceptible to type  diabetes dr a is not this dichotomy is explored for clues to the disease
