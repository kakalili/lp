parp  expression in the mouse is controlled by an autoregulatory loop parp  binding to an upstream s mar element and to a novel recognition motif in its promoter suppresses transcription
this work identifies central components of a feedback mechanism for the expression of mouse poly adp ribose polymerase  parp   using the stress induced duplex destabilization algorithm multiple base unpairing regions burs could be localized in the   region of the mouse parp  gene muparp   some of these could be identified as scaffold matrix attachment regions s mars  suggesting an s mar mediated transcriptional regulation parp  binding to the most proximal element s mar  and to three consensus motifs aggcc in its own promoter basepairs    to    could be traced by electrophoretic mobility shift assay the aggcc complementary ggcct motif was detected by cis diammine dichloro platinum cross linking and functionally characterized by the effects of site directed mutagenesis on its performance in wild type parp    and parp  knockout cells parp    mutation of the central aggcc tract at basepairs    to    prevented parp  promoter interactions whereby muparp  expression became up regulated transfection of a series of reporter gene constructs with or without s mar  basepairs     to     and the more distant s mar  basepairs     to      into parp   as well as parp   cells revealed an additional major level of muparp  promoter down regulation triggered by parp  binding to s mar  we conclude that s mar  represents an upstream control element that acts in conjunction with the muparp  promoter these interactions are part of a negative autoregulatory loop
