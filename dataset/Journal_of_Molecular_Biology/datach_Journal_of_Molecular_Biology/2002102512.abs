conserved positions for ribose recognition importance of water bridging interactions among atp adp and fad protein complexes
analysis of the spatial arrangement of protein and water atoms that form polar interactions with ribose has been performed for a structurally non redundant dataset of atp adp and fad protein complexes the  ligand  protein structures were separated into two groups corresponding to the most populated furanose ring conformations n and s domains  four conserved positions were found for s domain protein  ligand complexes and five for n domain complexes multiple protein folds and secondary structural elements were represented at a single conserved position the following novel points were revealed  i two complementary positions sometimes combine to describe a putative atomic spatial location for a specific conserved binding spot  ii more than one third of the interactions scored were water mediated thus conserved spatial positions rich in water atoms are a significant feature of ribose  protein complexes
