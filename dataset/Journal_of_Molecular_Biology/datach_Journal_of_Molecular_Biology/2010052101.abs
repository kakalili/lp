extensive and modular intrinsically disordered segments in c elegans ttn  and implications in filament binding elasticity and oblique striation
ttn  a titin like protein in caenorhabditis elegans is encoded by a single gene and consists of multiple ig and fibronectin  domains a protein kinase domain and several regions containing tandem short repeat sequences we have characterized ttn  s sarcomere distribution protein interaction with key myofibrillar proteins as well as the conformation malleability of representative motifs of five classes of short repeats we report that two antibodies developed to portions of ttn  detect an   mda polypeptide on western blots in addition by immunofluorescence staining both of these antibodies localize to the i band and may extend into the outer edge of the a band in the obliquely striated muscle of the nematode six different   residue segments of ttn  were shown to variously interact with actin and or myosin in vitro conformations of synthetic peptides of representative copies of each of the five classes of repeats   mer pevt   mer ceeei   mer aaple   mer blue and  mer disprep  were investigated by circular dichroism at different temperatures ionic strengths and solvent polarities the pevt ceeei disprep and aaple peptides display a combination of a polyproline ii helix and an unordered structure in aqueous solution and convert in trifluoroethanol to  helix pevt ceeei disprep and  turn aaple structures respectively the octads in blue motifs form unstable  helix like structures coils in aqueous solution and negligible heptad based   helical coiled coils the  helical structure as modeled by threading and molecular dynamics simulations tends to form helical bundles and crosses based on its     hydrophobic helical patterns and charge arrays on its surface our finding indicates that apple pevt ceeei and disprep regions are all intrinsically disordered and highly reminiscent of the conformational malleability and elasticity of vertebrate titin pevk segments the proposed presence of long modular and unstable  helical oligomerization domains in the blue region of ttn  could bundle ttn  and stabilize oblique striation of the sarcomere
