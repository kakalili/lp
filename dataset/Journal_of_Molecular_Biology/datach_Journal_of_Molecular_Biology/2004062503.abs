molecular and biophysical characterization of assembly starter units of human vimentin
we have developed an assembly protocol for the intermediate filament if protein vimentin based on a phosphate buffer system which enables the dynamic formation of authentic ifs the advantage of this physiological buffer is that analysis of the subunit interactions by chemical cross linking of internal lysine residues becomes feasible by this system we have analyzed the potential interactions of the coiled coil rod domains with one another which are assumed to make a crucial contribution to if formation and stability we show that headless vimentin which dimerizes under low salt conditions associates into tetramers of the a  type configuration under assembly conditions indicating that one of the effects of increasing the ionic strength is to favor coil   coil  interactions furthermore in order to obtain insight into the molecular interactions that occur during the first phase of assembly of full length vimentin we employed a temperature sensitive variant of human vimentin which is arrested at the  unit length filament   ulf state at room temperature but starts to elongate upon raising the temperature to   c most importantly we demonstrate by cross linking analysis that ulf formation predominantly involves a  type dimer  dimer interactions the presence of a  and a  cross linking products in mature ifs however indicates that major rearrangements do occur during the longitudinal annealing and radial compaction steps of if assembly
