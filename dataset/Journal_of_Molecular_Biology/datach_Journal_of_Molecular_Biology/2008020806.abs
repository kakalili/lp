folding and assembly of proteorhodopsin
proteorhodopsins prs  the recently discovered light driven proton pumps play a major role in supplying energy for microbial organisms of oceans in contrast to pr rhodopsins found in archaea and eukarya are structurally well characterized using single molecule microscopy and spectroscopy we observed the oligomeric assembly of native pr molecules and detected their folding in the membrane pr showed unfolding patterns identical with those of bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin indicating that pr folds similarly to archaeal rhodopsins surprisingly pr predominantly assembles into hexameric oligomers with a smaller fraction assembling into pentamers within these oligomers pr arranged into radial assemblies we suggest that this structural assembly of pr may have functional implications
