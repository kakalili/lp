global stabilization of rrna structure by ribosomal proteins s  s  and s
ribosomal proteins stabilize the folded structure of the ribosomal rna and enable the recruitment of further proteins to the complex quantitative hydroxyl radical footprinting was used to measure the extent to which three different primary assembly proteins s  s  and s  stabilize the three dimensional structure of the escherichia coli  s   domain the stability of the complexes was perturbed by varying the concentration of mgcl  each protein influences the stability of the ribosomal rna tertiary interactions beyond its immediate binding site s and s  stabilize the entire   domain while s  has a more local effect multistage folding of individual helices within the   domain shows that each protein stabilizes a different ensemble of structural intermediates that include nonnative interactions at low mg  concentration we propose that the combined interactions of s  s  and s  with different helical junctions bias the free energy landscape toward a few rna conformations that are competent to add the secondary assembly protein s  in the next step of assembly
