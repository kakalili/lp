cooperation of tom and tim  complexes during translocation of proteins into mitochondria
translocation of the majority of mitochondrial proteins from the cytosol into mitochondria requires the cooperation of tom and tim  complexes in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes the molecular mechanisms underlying this cooperation remain largely unknown here we present biochemical and genetic evidence that at least two contacts from the side of the tim  complex play an important role in tom  tim  cooperation in vivo tim  likely through its very c terminal segment interacts with tom  this interaction is stimulated by translocating proteins and is independent of any other tom  tim  contact known so far furthermore the exposure of tim  on the mitochondrial surface depends not only on its interaction with tim  but also on the dynamics of the tom complex destabilization of the individual contacts reduces the efficiency of import of proteins into mitochondria and destabilization of both contacts simultaneously is not tolerated by yeast cells we conclude that an intricate and coordinated network of protein  protein interactions involving primarily tim  and also tim  is required for efficient translocation of proteins across both mitochondrial membranes
