investigating terephthalate biodegradation structural characterization of a putative decarboxylating cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenase
as a highly coveted precursor molecule terephthalate tph continues to be used extensively for the production of polyethylene tph bottles polyester films and textile fibers worldwide based on its detrimental physiological effects tph is now recognized as a serious environmental pollutant while amenable to biodegradation and in fact traditionally neutralized by aerobic microbiological processes our current lack of understanding of the enzymatic degradation of tph at the molecular level presents a major impediment in the development of robust bioremediation strategies the biodegradation of tph proceeds through a single metabolic intermediate a cis dihydrodiol  which is subsequently converted to the end product protocatechuate by a decarboxylating cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenase tphb  using iodide single  wavelength anomalous dispersion we report the first structural characterization of tphb to    resolution contrary to prior speculations a fluorescent scan unambiguously shows that tphb coordinates zn  and not fe  the molecular architecture of tphb provides a rationale to the primary  level divergence observed between tphb and other cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenases while explaining its intriguingly close evolutionary clustering with non dihydrodiol dehydrogenases belonging to the isocitrate isopropylmalate family of enzymes sequence and structural analyses reveal a putative substrate binding pocket proximal to the bound zn  in silico substrate modeling in this putative binding pocket suggests a mechanistic sequence relying on h   k   and zn  as core mediators of catalytic turnover overall this study reveals novel structural and mechanistic insights into a decarboxylating cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenase that mediates one of the two catalytic steps in the biodegradation of the environmental pollutant tph
