flexible stoichiometry and asymmetry of the piddosome core complex by heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and mass spectrometry
homotypic death domain dd  dd interactions are important in the assembly of oligomeric signaling complexes such as the piddosome that acts as a platform for activation of caspase  dependent apoptotic signaling the structure of the piddosome core complex exhibits an asymmetric three layered arrangement containing five pidd dds in one layer five raidd dds in a second layer and an additional two raidd dds we addressed complex formation between pidd dd and raidd dd in solution using heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy nanoflow electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography with multi angle light scattering the dds assemble into complexes displaying molecular masses in the range     kda and raidd dd pidd dd stoichiometries of     and   these data suggest that the crystal structure is representative of only the heaviest species in solution and that two raidd dds are loosely attached to the   core two dimensional h  n nmr experiments exhibited signal loss upon complexation consistent with the formation of high molecular weight species  c methyl transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy measurements of the piddosome core exhibit signs of differential line broadening cross peak splitting and chemical shift heterogeneity that reflect the presence of non equivalent sites at interfaces within an asymmetric complex experiments using a mutant raidd dd that forms a monodisperse   complex with pidd dd show that the spectroscopic signature derives from the quasi but non exact equivalent environments of each dd since this characteristic was previously demonstrated for the complex between the dds of cd  and fadd the nmr data for this system are consistent with the formation of a structure homologous to the piddosome core
