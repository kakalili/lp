selective excision of  carboxylcytosine by a thymine dna glycosylase mutant
the mammalian thymine dna glycosylase tdg excises the mismatched base uracil thymine or  hydroxymethyluracil  hmu  as well as removes  formylcytosine  fc and  carboxylcytosine  cac when paired with a guanine in the previously solved structure of tdg in complex with dna containing cac the side chain of asparagine   n   contacts the  carboxyl moiety of cac via a weak hydrogen bond we examined the role of n  in recognition of cac by mutagenesis the asparagine to alanine n  a mutant has no detectable base excision activity for a g t mismatch and its excision activity is reduced for other substrates including g cac unexpectedly the asparagine to aspartate n  d mutant has a comparable base excision rate for g cac substrate to that of wild type but it only has residual activity for g u and no detectable activity for other substrates we further show that the n  d mutant has higher activity for cac at a lower ph    suggesting that increased protonation of the carboxylate of cac and the aspartate facilitates base excision the n  d mutant remains highly specific for cac even in the presence of large excess of genomic dna a property that can potentially be used for mapping the very low amount of cac in genomes
