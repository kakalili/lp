a     fibril polymorphism implies diverse interaction patterns in amyloid fibrils
amyloid fibrils characterize a diverse group of human diseases that includes alzheimer s disease creutzfeldt jakob and type ii diabetes alzheimer s amyloid fibrils consist of amyloid   a  peptide and occur in a range of structurally different fibril morphologies the structural characteristics of  single a     amyloid fibrils all formed under the same solution conditions were determined by electron cryo microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction the majority of analyzed fibrils form a range of morphologies that show almost continuously altering structural properties the observed fibril polymorphism implies that amyloid formation can lead for the same polypeptide sequence to many different patterns of inter or intra residue interactions this property differs significantly from native monomeric protein folding reactions that produce for one protein sequence only one ordered conformation and only one set of inter residue interactions
