cysteine dioxygenase structures from ph to  consistent cys persulfenate formation at intermediate ph and a cys bound enzyme at higher ph
mammalian cysteine dioxygenase cdo is a mononuclear non heme iron protein that catalyzes the conversion of cysteine cys to cysteine sulfinic acid by an unclarified mechanism one structural study revealed that a cys persulfenate or cys persulfenic acid formed in the active site but quantum mechanical calculations have been used to support arguments that it is not an energetically feasible reaction intermediate here we report a series of high resolution structures of cdo soaked with cys at ph values from  to  cys binding is minimal at ph   and persulfenate formation is consistently seen at ph values between   and  also a structure determined using laboratory based x ray diffraction shows that the persulfenate with an apparent average o  o separation distance of     is not an artifact of synchrotron radiation at ph   the active site iron shifts from  to  coordinate and cys soaks reveal a complex with cys but no dioxygen bound this  cys only  complex differs in detail from a previously published  cys only  complex which we reevaluate and conclude is not reliable the high resolution structures presented here do not resolve the cdo mechanism but do imply that an iron bound persulfenate or persulfenic acid is energetically accessible in the cdo active site and that cdo active site chemistry in the crystals is influenced by protonation deprotonation events with effective pka values near   and   that influence cys binding and oxygen binding reactivity respectively furthermore this work provides reliable ligand bound models for guiding future mechanistic considerations
