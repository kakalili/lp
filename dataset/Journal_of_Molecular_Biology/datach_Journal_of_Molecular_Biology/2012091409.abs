filaments from ignicoccus hospitalis show diversity of packing in proteins containing n terminal type iv pilin helices
bacterial motility is driven by the rotation of flagellar filaments that supercoil the supercoiling involves the switching of coiled coil protofilaments between two different states in archaea the flagellar filaments responsible for motility are formed by proteins with distinct homology in their n terminal portion to bacterial type iv pilins the bacterial pilins have a single n terminal hydrophobic  helix not the coiled coil found in flagellin we have used electron cryo microscopy to study the adhesion filaments from the archaeon ignicoccus hospitalis while i hospitalis is non motile these filaments make transitions between rigid stretches and curved regions and appear morphologically similar to true archaeal flagellar filaments a resolution of    allows us to unambiguously build a model for the packing of these n terminal  helices and this packing is different from several bacterial type iv pili whose structure has been analyzed by electron microscopy and modeling our results show that the mechanism responsible for the supercoiling of bacterial flagellar filaments cannot apply to archaeal filaments
