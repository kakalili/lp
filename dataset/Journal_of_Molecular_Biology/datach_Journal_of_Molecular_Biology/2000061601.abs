core structure of the outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli at    resolution edited by d rees
the outer membrane lipoprotein of the escherichia coli cell envelope has characteristic lipid modifications at an amino terminal cysteine and can exist in a form bound covalently to the peptidoglycan through a carboxyl terminal lysine the  residue polypeptide moiety of the lipoprotein designated lpp   folds into a stable trimeric helical structure in aqueous solution the    resolution crystal structure of lpp  comprises a parallel three stranded coiled coil including a novel alanine zipper unit and two helix capping motifs the amino terminal motif forms a hydrogen bonding network anchoring an umbrella shaped fold the carboxyl terminal motif uses puckering of the tyrosine side chains as a unique docking arrangement in helix termination the structure provides an explanation for assembly and insertion of the lipoprotein molecules into the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and suggests a molecular target for antibacterial drug discovery
