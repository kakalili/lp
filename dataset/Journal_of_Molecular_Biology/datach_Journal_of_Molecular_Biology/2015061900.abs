simc is a novel nad p h dependent ketoreductase essential for the antibiotic activity of the dna gyrase inhibitor simocyclinone
simocyclinone d  sd  is a potent dna gyrase inhibitor produced by streptomyces antibioticus t    the simocyclinone sim biosynthetic gene cluster has been sequenced and a hypothetical biosynthetic pathway has been proposed the tetraene linker in sd was suggested to be the product of a modular type i polyketide synthase working in trans with two monofunctional enzymes one of these monofunctional enzymes simc  was proposed to supply a dehydratase activity missing from two modules of the polyketide synthase in this study we report the function of simc  we isolated the entire   kb sim cluster on a single phage artificial chromosome clone and produced simocyclinone heterologously in a streptomyces coelicolor strain engineered for improved antibiotic production deletion of simc resulted in the production of a novel simocyclinone  oxo sd  which unexpectedly carried a normal tetraene linker but was altered in the angucyclinone moiety we demonstrate that simc is an nad p h dependent ketoreductase that catalyzes the conversion of  oxo sd into sd   oxo sd was essentially inactive as a dna gyrase inhibitor and the reduction of the keto group by simc was shown to be crucial for high affinity binding to the enzyme thus simc is an angucyclinone ketoreductase that is essential for the biological activity of simocyclinone
