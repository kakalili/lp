mechanistic analysis of activation of the innate immune sensor pkr by bacterial rna
the protein kinase pkr protein kinase r is a sensor in innate immunity pkr autophosphorylates in the presence of double stranded rna enabling it to phosphorylate its substrate eif   eukaryotic initiation factor    halting cellular translation classical activators of pkr are long viral double stranded rnas but recently pkr has been found to be activated by bacterial rna however the features of bacterial rna that activate pkr are unknown we studied the bacillus subtilis trp   utr untranslated region  which is an indirect riboswitch with secondary and tertiary rna structures that regulate gene function additionally the trp   utr binds a protein trap tryptophan rna binding attenuation protein  which recognizes l tryptophan we present the first evidence that multiple structural features in this rna which are typical of bacterial rnas activate pkr in trap free and trap l trp bound forms segments from the   utr including the terminator   stem  loop and shine  dalgarno blocking hairpins demonstrated   triphosphate and flanking rna tail dependence on pkr activation disruption of long distance tertiary interactions in the   utr led to partial loss in activation consistent with highly base paired regions in bacterial rna activating pkr one physiological change a bacterial rna would face in a human cell is a decrease in the concentration of free magnesium upon lowering the magnesium concentration to human physiological conditions of  mm the trp   utr continued to activate pkr potently moreover total rna from escherichia coli depleted of rrna also activated pkr under these ionic conditions this study demonstrates that pkr can signal the presence of bacterial rnas under physiological ionic conditions and offers a potential explanation for the apparent absence of riboswitches in the human genome
