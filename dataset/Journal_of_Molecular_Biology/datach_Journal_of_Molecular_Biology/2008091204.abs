new insights into multiple coagulation factor deficiency from the solution structure of human mcfd
human mcfd  multiple coagulation factor deficiency  is a  kda protein known to participate in transport of the glycosylated human coagulation factors v and viii along the secretory pathway mutations in mcfd or in its binding partner the membrane bound transporter ergic endoplasmic reticulum  golgi intermediate compartment   cause a mild form of inherited hemophilia known as combined deficiency of factors v and viii f f d  while ergic  is known to be a lectin type mannose binding protein the role of mcfd in the secretory pathway is comparatively unclear mcfd has been shown to bind both ergic  and the blood coagulation factors but little is known about the binding sites or the true function of the protein in order to facilitate understanding of the function of mcfd and the mechanism by which mutations in the protein cause f f d we have determined the structure of human mcfd in solution by nmr our results show the folding of mcfd to be dependent on availability of calcium ions the protein which is disordered in the apo state folds upon binding of ca  to the two ef hand motifs of its c terminus while retaining some localized disorder in the n terminus nmr studies on two disease causing mutant variants of mcfd show both to be predominantly disordered even in the presence of calcium ions these results provide an explanation for the previously observed calcium dependence of the mcfd  ergic  interaction and furthermore clarify the means by which mutations in this protein result in inefficient secretion of blood coagulation factors v and viii
