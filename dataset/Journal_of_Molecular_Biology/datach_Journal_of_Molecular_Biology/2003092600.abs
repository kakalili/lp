rearrangement of charge  charge interactions in variant ubiquitins as detected by double mutant cycles and nmr
previous studies of ubiquitin disclosed numerous charge  charge interactions on the protein s surface to investigate how neighboring residues influence the strength of these interactions double mutant cycles are combined with pka determinations by d nmr more specifically the environment around the asp   lys  ion pair has been altered through mutations at position   which is an asparagine in mammalian ubiquitin and a positively charged residue in many other ubiquitin like proteins the pka value of asp  decreases by   to   ph unit when asn  is substituted with a positively charged residue suggesting a new and favorable ion pair interaction between positions  and   however analysis of double mutants reveals that the favorable interaction between asp  and lys  is weakened when position  is a positively charged residue interestingly while the pka value of his  in the n h variant agrees with model compound values additional mutants reveal that this agreement is fortuitous resulting from a balance of favorable and unfavorable interactions similar results were observed previously for glu  in ubiquitin and his in staphylococcal nuclease ionizable groups may thus have pka values similar to model compound values and yet still be involved in significant interactions with other protein groups one surprising result of introducing positively charged residues at position  is a new interaction between lys  and glu  an interaction not present in wild type ubiquitin this unanticipated result illustrates a key advantage of using nmr to determine pka values for many residues simultaneously in the variant proteins overall the strength of an interaction between two residues at the surface of ubiquitin is sensitive to the identity of neighboring residues the results also demonstrate that relatively conservative and common point mutations such as substitutions of polar with charged residues and vice versa can have effects on interactions beyond the site of mutation per se
