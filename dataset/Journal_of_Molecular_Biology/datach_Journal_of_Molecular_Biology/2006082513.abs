structural determinants of natriuretic peptide receptor specificity and degeneracy
cardiovascular homeostasis and blood pressure regulation are reliant in part on interactions between natriuretic peptide np hormones and natriuretic peptide receptors npr  the c type npr npr c is responsible for clearance of np hormones from the circulation and displays a cross reactivity for all np hormones anp bnp and cnp  in contrast to other nprs which are more restricted in their specificity in order to elucidate the structural determinants for the binding specificity and cross reactivity of npr c with np hormones we have determined the crystal structures of the complexes of npr c with atrial natriuretic peptide anp  and with brain natriuretic peptide bnp  a structural comparison of these complexes with the previous structure of the npr c cnp complex reveals that npr c uses a conformationally inflexible surface to bind three different highly flexible np ligands the complex structures support a mechanism of rigid promiscuity rather than conformational plasticity by the receptor while anp and bnp appear to adopt similar receptor bound conformations the cnp structure diverges yet shares sets of common receptor contacts with the other ligands the degenerate versus selective hormone recognition properties of different nprs appears to derive largely from two cavities on the receptor surfaces pocket i and pocket ii that serve as anchoring sites for hormone side chains and modulate receptor selectivity
