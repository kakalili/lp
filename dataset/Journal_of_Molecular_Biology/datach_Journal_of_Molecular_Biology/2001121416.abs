daf  dependent and independent expression targets of daf  insulin receptor like pathway in caenorhabditis elegans include fkbps edited by s reed
the daf  insulin like receptor pathway regulates development and life span in caenorhabditis elegans reduced daf  signaling leads to changes in downstream targets via the daf  gene a fork head transcription factor which is regulated by daf  and results in extended life span here we describe the first identification of genes whose expression is controlled by the daf  signaling cascade dao  dao  dao  dao  dao  and dao  are down regulated in daf  mutant adults compared to wild type adults whereas dao  dao  and dao  are up regulated the latter genes are negatively regulated by daf  signaling and positively regulated by daf   positive regulation by daf  on dao  dao  and dao  was mediated by daf   whereas daf  mediates only part of daf  signaling for dao  and dao  regulation by daf  is most likely daf  independent for dao  and hsp   rna levels of dao  and dao  showed elevated expression in daf  adults as well as being strongly expressed in dauer larvae in contrast hsp  transcript levels are low in daf  mutant adults though they are enriched in dauer larvae indicating overlapping but not identical mechanisms of efficient life maintenance in stress resistant dauer larvae and long lived daf  mutant adults dao  dao  and dao  are homologs of the fk  binding proteins that interact with the mammalian insulin pathway dao  encodes a putative methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase dao  shows   identity with human nucleolar phosphoprotein p   dao  is similar to the mammalian zfp  protein distinct regulatory patterns of dao genes implicate their diverse positions within the signaling network of daf  pathway and suggest they have unique contributions to development metabolism and longevity
