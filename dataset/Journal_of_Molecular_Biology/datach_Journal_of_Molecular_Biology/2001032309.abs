structures of bovine glutamate dehydrogenase complexes elucidate the mechanism of purine regulation edited by i a wilson
glutamate dehydrogenase is found in all organisms and catalyses the oxidative deamination of l glutamate to  oxoglutarate however only animal gdh utilizes both nad h or nadp h with comparable efficacy and exhibits a complex pattern of allosteric inhibition by a wide variety of small molecules the major allosteric inhibitors are gtp and nadh and the two main allosteric activators are adp and nad  the structures presented here have refined and modified the previous structural model of allosteric regulation inferred from the original bogdh nadh glu gtp complex the bogdh nad   kg complex structure clearly demonstrates that the second coenzyme binding site lies directly under the  pivot helix  of the nad binding domain in this complex phosphates are observed to occupy the inhibitory gtp site and may be responsible for the previously observed structural stabilization by polyanions the bogdh nadph glu gtp complex shows the location of the additional phosphate on the active site coenzyme molecule and the gtp molecule bound to the gtp inhibitory site as expected since nadph does not bind well to the second coenzyme site no evidence of a bound molecule is observed at the second coenzyme site under the pivot helix therefore these results suggest that the inhibitory gtp site is as previously identified however adp nad  and nadh all bind under the pivot helix but a second gtp molecule does not kinetic analysis of a hyperinsulinism hyperammonemia mutant strongly suggests that atp can inhibit the reaction by binding to the gtp site finally the fact that nadh nad  and adp all bind to the same site requires a re analysis of the previous models for nadh inhibition
