structural and thermodynamic studies on mutant rna motifs that impair the specificity between a viral replicase and its promoter edited by d draper
the   end region of the genomic rna of brome mosaic virus forms a trna like structure that is critical for its replication previous studies have shown that in this region a stem loop structure called slc is necessary and sufficient for the binding of the rna replicase and for rna replication recently we determined the high resolution nmr structure of slc which demonstrated that a   aua   triloop region is an important structural element for the enzymatic recognition we proposed that the   adenine of the triloop which is rigidly fixed   clamped   to the stem is a key recognition element for the replicase to elucidate the role of this  clamped base motif  for the enzymatic recognition we have now investigated the solution conformations of several stem loop molecules with mutant triloops    uua      gua      cua   and   uuu    that destroy the enzymatic recognition for the gua and uua mutants we have obtained high resolution solution structures using d nmr all four mutants have very similar thermodynamic stabilities and all have the same secondary structures a triloop with a five base paired stem helix in addition they have quite similar sugar puckering patterns in the triloop region the nmr structures of the gua and uua show that the   nucleotide of the triloop g in gua or u in uua lacks the strong interactions that hold its base in a fixed position in particular the u of uua is found in two different conformations neither of these two mutants has the clamped base motif that was observed in the wild type while uua also shows global change in the overall triloop conformation gua shows a very similar triloop conformation to the wild type except for the lack of this motif the absence of the clamped base motif is the only common structural difference between these two mutants and the wild type these results clearly indicate that the loss of function of the uua and gua mutants comes mainly from the destruction of a small key recognition motif rather than from global changes in their triloop conformations based on this study we conclude that the key structural motif in the triloop recognized by the replicase is a solution exposed    adenine base in the triloop that is clamped to the stem helix which is called a clamped adenine motif
