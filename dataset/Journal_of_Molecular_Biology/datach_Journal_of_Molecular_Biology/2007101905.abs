a secondary xylan binding site enhances the catalytic activity of a single domain family  glycoside hydrolase
bacillus circulans xylanase bcx is a single domain family  glycoside hydrolase using nmr monitored titrations we discovered that an inactive variant of this enzyme e q bcx bound xylooligosaccharides not only within its pronounced active site as cleft but also at a distal surface region chemical shift perturbation mapping and affinity electrophoresis combined with mutational studies identified the xylan specific secondary binding site sbs as a shallow groove lined by asn ser and thr residues and with a trp at one end the as and sbs bound short xylooligosaccharides with similar dissociation constants in the millimolar range however the on and off rates to the sbs were at least tenfold faster than those of kon     m   s   and koff    s   measured for xylotetraose to the as of e q bcx consistent with their structural differences this suggests that a conformational change in the enzyme and or the substrate is required for association to and dissociation from the deep as but not the shallow sbs in contrast to the independent binding of small xylooligosaccharides high affinity binding of soluble and insoluble xylan as well as xylododecaose occurred cooperatively to the two sites this was evidenced by an    fold increase in relative kd values for these ligands upon mutation of the sbs the sbs also enhances the activity of bcx towards soluble and insoluble xylan through a significant reduction in the michaelis km values for these polymeric substrates this study provides an unexpected example of how a single domain family  xylanase overcomes the lack of a carbohydrate binding module through the use of a secondary binding site to enhance substrate specificity and affinity
