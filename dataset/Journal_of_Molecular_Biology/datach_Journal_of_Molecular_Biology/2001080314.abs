solution structure of the third immunoglobulin domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule n cam can solution studies define the mechanism of homophilic binding  edited by m f summers
homophilic binding of the neural cell adhesion molecule n cam mediates the calcium independent cell cell adhesion that is involved in neuronal development two hypotheses have been advanced for the mechanism of homophilic binding cell based experiments have implicated each of the five extracellular immunoglobulin ig domains of n cam in the homophilic adhesion interaction and have predicted that the third domain ig iii self associates the alternative hypothesis is based on solution observations which implicate a specific antiparallel interaction between the first two ig domains ig i and ig ii  in order to test these hypotheses we have determined a high resolution solution structure of recombinant ig iii sequence derived from chicken n cam and examined the aggregation behavior of isolated ig domains in solution the structure shows that ig iii adopts a canonical ig fold in which the  strands abed and a  gfcc  form two  sheets that are linked by a disulfide bond in contrast to the demonstrated aggregation of ig iii on solid supports we were unable to demonstrate self association of ig iii under any of a variety of solution conditions the structure shows that the surface of ig iii is dominated by two large acidic patches which may explain our failure to observe self association in solution to evaluate the involvement of the ig i ig ii interaction in cell cell adhesion we designed a point mutation in ig i f s that proved sufficient to abrogate the ig i ig ii interaction seen in solution however the introduction of this mutation into full length n cam expressed in cos  cells failed to affect n cam mediated cell cell adhesion the inability to observe ig iii self association in solution combined with the failure of the f s mutation to affect n cam mediated cell cell adhesion suggests that although solution studies can give important insights into the structures of individual domains the interactions observed in solution between the domains may not be representative of the interactions that occur on the cell surface
