the human homologue of the yeast splicing factor prp p contains multiple tpr elements and is stably associated with the u snrnp via protein protein interactions edited by m yaniv
an essential step of pre mrna spliceosome assembly is the interaction between the snrnps u u and u  to form the u u u  tri snrnp while the tri snrnp protein prp p appears to play an important role for tri snrnp formation in yeast little is known about the interactions that connect the two snrnp particles in human tri snrnps here we describe the molecular characterisation of a  kd protein form hela tri snrnps the  kd protein exhibits a significant degree of overall homology with the yeast prp p including the conservation of multiple tetratrico peptide repeats tpr  making this the likely functional homologue of prp p however while the yeast prp p is considered to be a u u specific protein the human  kd protein was found to be tightly associated with purified  s u snrnps this association appears to be primarily due to protein protein interactions interestingly antibodies directed against the c terminal tpr elements of the  kd protein specifically and exclusively immunoprecipitate free u snrnps but not u u u  tri snrnps from hela nuclear extract suggesting that the c terminal region of the  kd protein is covered by u u or tri snrnp specific proteins since proteins containing tpr elements are typically involved in multiple protein protein interactions we suggest that the  kd protein interacts within the tri snrnp with both the u and u u snrnps thus bridging the two particles consistent with this idea we show that in vitro translated u   kd protein binds to purified  s u u snrnps which contain in addition to the sm proteins all known u u specific proteins
