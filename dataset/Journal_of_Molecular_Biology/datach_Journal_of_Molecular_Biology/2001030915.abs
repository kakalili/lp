monomer dimer ratios of replication protein modulate the dna strand opening in a replication origin edited by m gottesman
dna opening is an essential step in the initiation of replication via the cairns mode of replication the opening reaction was investigated in a  ori system by using hyperactive variants of plasmid r k encoded initiator protein   reactivity to kmno  indicative of opening within  ori dna occurred in both strands of a superhelical template upon the combined addition of wt   dnaa and integration host factor ihf  each protein known to specifically bind  ori ihf examined singly enhanced reactivity to kmno  the ihf dependent reactive residues however are distinct from those dependent on   wt and hyperactive variants  remarkably the dna helix opening does not require ihf and or dnaa when hyperactive variants of  were used instead of wt protein we present three lines of evidence consistent with the hypothesis that dna strand separation is facilitated by  monomers despite the fact that both monomers and dimers of the protein can bind to iterons   binding sites  taken together our data suggest that  elicits its ability to modulate plasmid copy number at the dna helix opening step
