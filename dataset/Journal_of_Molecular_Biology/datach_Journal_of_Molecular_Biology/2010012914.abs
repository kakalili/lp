molecular evolution of multisubunit rna polymerases sequence analysis
transcription in all cellular organisms is performed by multisubunit dna dependent rna polymerases that synthesize rna from dna templates previous sequence and structural studies have elucidated the importance of shared regions common to all multisubunit rna polymerases in addition rna polymerases contain multiple lineage specific domain insertions involved in protein  protein and protein  nucleic acid interactions we have created comprehensive multiple sequence alignments using all available sequence data for the multisubunit rna polymerase large subunits including the bacterial  and    subunits and their homologs from archaebacterial rna polymerases the eukaryotic rna polymerases i ii and iii the nuclear  cytoplasmic large double stranded dna virus rna polymerases and plant plastid rna polymerases to overcome technical difficulties inherent to the large subunit sequences including large sequence length small and large lineage specific insertions split subunits and fused proteins we created an automated and customizable sequence retrieval and processing system in addition we used our alignments to create a more expansive set of shared sequence regions and bacterial lineage specific domain insertions we also analyzed the intergenic gap between the bacterial  and    genes
