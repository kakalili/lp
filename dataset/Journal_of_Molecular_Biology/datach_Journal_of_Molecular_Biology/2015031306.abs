seca drives transmembrane insertion of rodz an unusual single span membrane protein
the transmembrane tm helices of most type ii single span membrane proteins s smps of escherichia coli occur near the n terminus where the cell s targeting mechanisms can readily identify it as it emerges from the ribosome however the tm helices of a few s smps such as rodz occur a hundred or more residues downstream from the n terminus which raises fundamental questions about targeting and assembly because of rodz s novelty and potential usefulness for understanding tm helix insertion in vivo we examined its membrane targeting and assembly we used rodz constructs containing immunotags before the tm domain to assess membrane insertion using proteinase k digestion we confirmed the nin cout type ii topology of rodz and established the absence of a targeting signal other than the tm domain rodz was not inserted into the membrane under seca depletion conditions or in the presence of sodium azide which is known to inhibit seca insertion failed when the tm proton gradient was abolished with carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenyl hydrazone insertion also failed when rodz was expressed in sece depleted e coli indicating that the secyeg translocon is required for rodz assembly protease accessibility assays of rodz in other e coli depletion strains revealed that insertion is independent of secb yidc and secd f insertion was found to be only weakly dependent on the signal recognition particle pathway insertion was weakly dependent on the ffh but independent of ftsy we conclude that membrane insertion of rodz requires only the secyeg translocon the seca atpase motor and the tm proton motive force
