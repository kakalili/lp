small heat shock protein structures reveal a continuum from symmetric to variable assemblies edited by w baumeister
the small heat shock proteins shsps form a diverse family of proteins that are produced in all organisms they function as chaperone like proteins in that they bind unfolded polypeptides and prevent uncontrolled protein aggregation here we present parallel cryo electron microscopy studies of five different shsp assemblies methanococcus jannaschii hsp   human  b crystallin human hsp  bovine native  crystallin and the complex of  b crystallin and unfolded  lactalbumin gel filtration chromatography indicated that hsp   is the most monodisperse while hsp  and the  crystallin assemblies are more polydisperse particle images revealed a similar trend showing mostly regular and symmetric assemblies for hsp   particles and the most irregular assemblies with a wide range of diameters for hsp  a symmetry test on the particle images indicated stronger octahedral symmetry for hsp   than for hsp  or the  crystallin assemblies a single particle reconstruction of hsp   based on   particle images with imposed octahedral symmetry resulted in a structure that closely matched the crystal structure in addition the cryo em reconstruction revealed internal density presumably corresponding to the flexible  n terminal residues that were not observed in the crystal structure the n termini were found to partially fill the central cavity making it unlikely that hsp   sequesters denatured proteins in the cavity a reconstruction calculated without imposed symmetry confirmed the presence of at least loose octahedral symmetry for hsp   in contrast to the other shsps examined which displayed no clear overall symmetry asymmetric reconstructions for the  crystallin assemblies with an additional mass selection step during image processing resulted in lower resolution structures we interpret the  crystallin reconstructions to be average representations of variable assemblies and suggest that the resolutions achieved indicate the degree of variability quaternary structural information derived from cryo electron microscopy is related to recent epr studies of the  crystallin domain fold and dimer interface of  a crystallin
