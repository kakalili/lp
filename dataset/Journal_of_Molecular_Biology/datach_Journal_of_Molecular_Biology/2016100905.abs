the xp  bacteriophage protein p inhibits transcription by the major and major variant forms of the host rna polymerase via a common mechanism
the  factor is a functionally obligatory subunit of the bacterial transcription machinery the rna polymerase bacteriophage encoded small proteins that either modulate or inhibit the bacterial rnap to allow the temporal regulation of bacteriophage gene expression often target the activity of the major bacterial  factor    previously we showed that during xanthomonas oryzae phage xp  infection the phage protein p inhibits the host rnap by preventing the productive engagement with the promoter and simultaneously displaces the   factor from the rnap in this study we demonstrate that p also inhibits the productive engagement of the bacterial rnap containing the major variant bacterial  factor    with its cognate promoter the results suggest for the first time that the major variant form of the host rnap can also be targeted by bacteriophage encoded transcription regulatory proteins since the major and major variant  factor interacting surfaces in the rnap substantially overlap but different regions of   and   are used for binding to the rnap our results further underscore the importance of the   rnap interface in bacterial rnap function and regulation and potentially for intervention by antibacterials
