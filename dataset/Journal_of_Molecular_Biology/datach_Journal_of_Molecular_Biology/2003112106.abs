crystal structure of the n terminal dimerisation domain of vich the h ns like protein of vibrio cholerae
the histone like nucleoid structuring h ns protein is a global modulator of gene expression in gram negative bacteria vich the h ns protein of vibrio cholerae regulates the expression of certain major virulence determinants implicated in the pathogenesis of cholera we present here the    crystal structure of the n terminal oligomerisation domain of vich vich nt  vich nt adopts the same fold and dimeric assembly as the nmr structure of escherichia coli h ns nt thus validating this fold against conflicting data the structural similarity of v cholerae vich nt and e coli h ns nt despite differences in origin system of expression experimental conditions and techniques used indicates that the fold determined in our studies is robust to experimental conditions structural analysis and homology modelling were carried out to further elucidate the molecular basis of the functional polyvalence of the n terminal domain our analysis of members of the h ns superfamily supports the suggestion that the oligomerisation function of h ns nt is conserved even in more distantly related proteins
