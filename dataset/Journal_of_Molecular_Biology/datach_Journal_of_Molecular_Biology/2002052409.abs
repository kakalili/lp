the order of strand exchanges in cre loxp recombination and its basis suggested by the crystal structure of a cre loxp holliday junction complex
cre recombinase uses two pairs of sequential cleavage and religation reactions to exchange homologous dna strands between  base pair bp loxp recognition sequences in the oligomeric recombination complex a switch between  cleaving  and  non cleaving  subunit conformations regulates the number order and regio specificity of the strand exchanges however the particular sequence of events has been in question from analysis of strand composition of the holliday junction hj intermediate we determined that cre initiates recombination of loxp by cleaving the upper strand on the left arm cre preferred to react with the left arm of a loxp suicide substrate but at a similar rate to the right arm indicating that the first strand to be exchanged is selected prior to cleavage we propose that during complex assembly the cleaving subunit preferentially associates with the loxp left arm directing the first strand exchange to that side in addition this biased assembly would enforce productive orientation of loxp sites in the recombination synapses a novel cre hj complex structure in which loxp was oriented with the left arm bound by the cleaving cre subunit suggested a physical basis for the strand exchange order lys  and lys  interact with the left arm scissile adenine base differently than in structures that have a scissile guanine these interactions are associated with positioning the      loop a structural component of the conformational switch in a configuration that is specific to the cleaving conformation our results suggest that strand exchange order and site alignment are regulated by an  induced fit  mechanism in which the cleaving conformation is selectively stabilized through protein  dna interactions with the scissile base on the strand that is cleaved first
