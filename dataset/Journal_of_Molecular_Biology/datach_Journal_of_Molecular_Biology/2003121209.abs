naturally occurring modification restricts the anticodon domain conformational space of trnaphe
post transcriptional modifications contribute chemistry and structure to rnas modifications of trna at nucleoside     adjacent to the anticodon are particularly interesting because they facilitate codon recognition and negate translational frame shifting to assess if the functional contribution of a position  modified nucleoside defines a specific structure or restricts conformational flexibility structures of the yeast trnaphe anticodon stem and loop aslphe with naturally occurring modified nucleosides differing only at position   aslphe cm  gm  m c   and aslphe cm  gm  m g  m c   were determined by nmr spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics the asl structures had similarly resolved stems rmsd     of five canonical base pairs in standard a form rna the  noe walk  was evident on the   and   sides of the stems of both rnas and extended to the adjacent loop nucleosides the noesy cross peaks involving u  h   and characteristic of trna s anticodon domain u turn were present but weak whereas those involving the u  h   proton were absent from the spectra of both asls however aslphe cm  gm  m g  m c  exhibited the downfield shifted  p resonance of u pgm  indicative of u turns aslphe cm  gm  m c  did not an unusual  backwards  noe between gm  and a  gm  h to a  h   was observed in both molecules the rnas exhibited a protonated a  resulting in the final structures having c  a  intra loop base pairs with that of aslphe cm  gm  m g  m c  being especially well defined a single family of low energy structures of aslphe cm  gm  m g  m c   loop rmsd     exhibited a significantly restricted conformational space for the anticodon loop in comparison to that of aslphe cm  gm  m c   loop rmsd     in addition the aslphe cm  gm  m g  m c  average structure had a greater degree of similarity to that of the yeast trnaphe crystal structure a comparison of the resulting structures indicates that modification of position  affects the accuracy of decoding and the maintenance of the mrna reading frame by restricting anticodon loop conformational space
