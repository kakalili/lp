the bacteriophage lambda gpnu scaffolding protein is an intrinsically disordered and biologically functional procapsid assembly catalyst
procapsid assembly is a process whereby hundreds of copies of a major capsid protein assemble into an icosahedral protein shell into which the viral genome is packaged the essential features of procapsid assembly are conserved in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic complex double stranded dna viruses typically a portal protein nucleates the co polymerization of an internal scaffolding protein and the major capsid protein into an icosahedral capsid shell the scaffolding proteins are essential to procapsid assembly here we describe the solution based biophysical and functional characterization of the bacteriophage lambda   scaffolding protein gpnu  the purified protein possesses significant  helical structure and appears to be partially disordered thermally induced denaturation studies indicate that secondary structures are lost in a cooperative apparent two state transition tm       c and that unfolding is at least in part reversible analysis of the purified protein by size exclusion chromatography suggests that gpnu is highly asymmetric which contributes to an abnormally large stokes radius the size exclusion chromatography data further indicate that the protein self associates in a concentration dependent manner this was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation studies which reveal a monomer  dimer equilibrium kd app    m and an asymmetric protein structure at biologically relevant concentrations purified gpnu promotes the polymerization of gpe the  major capsid protein into virus like particles that possess a native like procapsid morphology the relevance of this work with respect to procapsid assembly in the complex double stranded dna viruses is discussed
