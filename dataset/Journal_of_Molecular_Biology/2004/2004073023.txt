SecA, a 202 kDa dimeric protein, is the ATPase for the Sec-dependent translocase of precursor proteins in vivo. SecA must undergo conformational changes, which may involve dissociation into a monomer, as it translocates the precursor protein across the inner membrane. To better understand the dynamics of SecA in vivo, protein folding studies to probe the native, intermediate, and unfolded species of SecA in vitro have been done. SecA folds through a stable dimeric intermediate and dimerizes in the dead-time of a manual-mixing kinetic experiment (∼5–7 seconds). Here, stopped-flow fluorescence and CD, as well as ultra-rapid continuous flow fluorescence techniques, were used to further probe the rapid folding kinetics of SecA. In the absence of urea, rapid, near diffusion-limited (∼109M−1s−1) SecA dimerization occurs following a rate-limiting unimolecular rearrangement of a rapidly formed intermediate. Multiple kinetic folding and unfolding phases were observed and SecA was shown to have multiple native and unfolded states. Using sequential-mixing stopped-flow experiments, SecA was determined to fold via parallel channels with sequential intermediates. These results confirm that SecA is a highly dynamic protein, consistent with the rapid, major conformational changes it must undergo in vivo.
