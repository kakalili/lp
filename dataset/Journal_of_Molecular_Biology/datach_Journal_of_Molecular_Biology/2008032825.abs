paramutation like effects at the mouse scapinin phactr  locus
paramutation like phenomena have been extensively studied in plants and so far described for a very few engineered loci in the mouse here we report an allele specific expression analysis of the phactr  phosphatase and actin regulator  locus by identifying the first internal mouse transcripts with a paramutation like effect not associated with transgenic or knockout mice in our previous work we showed that the phactr gene was mainly transcribed in the brain exhibiting a complex genomic organisation with four alternatively spliced leader exons due to the location of the phactr gene in the distal imprinting region on mouse chromosome  we generated a mouse model to investigate the possible parental influence on the allelic expression pattern by reciprocally mating nmri mice and mus musculus castaneus we were able to identify a single nucleotide polymorphism in leader exon c representing restriction fragment length polymorphism after reverse transcription pcr nmri and m musculus castaneus showed a homozygous restriction pattern according to their genotype unlike this reverse transcription pcr products of the f hybrids of both crosses were transcribed from the nmri allele only therefore the phactr exon c splice variant is potentially strain specific regulated leading to the expression of only one allele of the reciprocal crosses so far this has not yet been described for an internal mouse gene these results potentially provide new insight into non mendelian inheritance in mammals and may serve also as a model for investigating the regulation of allele specific expression
