autoinhibition of etv dna binding is established by the stability of its inhibitory helix
the ets transcriptional repressor etv  or tel is autoinhibited by an  helix that sterically blocks its dna binding ets domain the inhibitory helix is marginally stable and unfolds when etv binds to either specific or non specific dna using nmr spectroscopy we show that folding of the inhibitory helix requires a buried charge  dipole interaction with helix h of the ets domain this interaction also contributes directly to autoinhibition by precluding a highly conserved dipole enhanced hydrogen bond between the phosphodiester backbone of bound dna and the n terminus of helix h  to probe further the thermodynamic basis of autoinhibition etv variants were generated with amino acid substitutions introduced along the solvent exposed surface of the inhibitory helix these changes were designed to increase the intrinsic helical propensity of the inhibitory helix without perturbing its packing interactions with the ets domain nmr monitored amide hydrogen exchange measurements confirmed that the stability of the folded inhibitory helix increases progressively with added helix promoting substitutions this also results in progressively reinforced autoinhibition and decreased dna binding affinity surprisingly locking the inhibitory helix onto the ets domain by a disulfide bridge severely impairs but does not abolish dna binding weak interactions still occur via an interface displaced from the canonical ets domain dna binding surface collectively these studies establish a direct thermodynamic linkage between inhibitory helix stability and etv autoinhibition and demonstrate that helix unfolding does not strictly precede dna binding modulating inhibitory helix stability provides a potential route for the in vivo regulation of etv activity
