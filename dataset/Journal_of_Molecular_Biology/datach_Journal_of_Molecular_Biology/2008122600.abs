anti oligomeric a  single chain variable domain antibody blocks a  induced toxicity against human neuroblastoma cells
the amyloid   a  peptide is a major component of the amyloid plaques associated with alzheimer s disease ad  recent studies suggest that the most toxic forms of a  are small soluble oligomeric aggregates here we report the isolation and characterization of a single chain variable domain scfv antibody isolated against oligomeric a  using a protocol developed in our laboratory that combines phage display technology and atomic force microscopy afm  starting with a randomized single framework phage display library after three rounds of selection against oligomeric a  we identified an scfv that bound oligomeric a  specifically but not monomeric or fibrillar forms the anti oligomeric scfv inhibits a  aggregation and toxicity and reduces the toxicity of preformed oligomeric a  towards human neuroblastoma cells when used to probe samples of human brain tissue the scfv reacted with ad tissue but not a healthy control or parkinson s disease brain samples the anti oligomeric a  scfv therefore has potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in specifically targeting or identifying the toxic morphologies of a  in ad brains
