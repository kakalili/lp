analysis of the antigen combining site correlations between length and sequence composition of the hypervariable loops and the nature of the antigen
it has long been suggested that the overall shape of the antigen combining site acs of antibodies is correlated with the nature of the antigen for example deep pockets are characteristic of antibodies that bind haptens grooves indicate peptide binders while antibodies that bind to proteins have relatively flat combining sites in    maccallum martin and thornton used a fractal shape descriptor and showed a strong correlation of the shape of the binding region with the general nature of the antigen however the shape of the acs is determined primarily by the lengths of the six complementarity determining regions cdrs  here we make a direct correlation between the lengths of the cdrs and the nature of the antigen in addition we show significant differences in the residue composition of the cdrs of antibodies that bind to different antigen classes as well as helping us to understand the process of antigen recognition autoimmune disease and cross reactivity these results are of direct application in the design of antibody phage libraries and modification of affinity
