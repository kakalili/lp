Localization of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) to neuromuscular synapses is mediated, in part, through selective transcription of AChR genes in myofiber synaptic nuclei. Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) and its receptors, ErbBs, are concentrated at synaptic sites, and NRG-1 activates AChR synthesis in cultured muscle cells, suggesting that NRG-1-ErbB signaling functions to activate synapse-specific transcription. Previous studies have demonstrated that NRG-1-induced transcription is conferred by cis-acting elements located within 100 bp of 5′ flanking DNA from the AChR epsilon subunit gene, and that it requires a GABP binding site within this region. To determine whether additional regulatory elements have a role in NRG-1 responsiveness, we used transcriptional reporter assays in a muscle cell line, and we identified an element that is required for NRG-1-induced transcription (neuregulin response element, NRE). Proteins from myotube extracts bind the NRE and NRG-1 treatment of the cells stimulates this binding. The ability of NRG-1 to stimulate formation of a protein–DNA complex with the NRE requires induction of protein expression. The complex contains early growth response-1 (Egr-1), a member of the Egr family of transcription factors, because proteins in the complex bind specifically to an Egr consensus site, and formation of the complex is inhibited by antibodies to Egr-1. NRG-1 induces expression of Egr-1 in myotubes, which presumably is responsible for the ability of NRG-1 to stimulate protein binding to the NRE. These results suggest that NRG-1 signaling in myotubes involves induction of Egr-1 expression, which in turn serves to activate transcription of the AChR epsilon subunit gene.
