d ribose  phosphate isomerase b from escherichia coli is also a functional d allose  phosphate isomerase while the mycobacterium tuberculosis enzyme is not
interconversion of d ribose  phosphate r p and d ribulose  phosphate is an important step in the pentose phosphate pathway two unrelated enzymes with r p isomerase activity were first identified in escherichia coli rpia and rpib in this organism the essential  carbon sugars were thought to be processed by rpia while the primary role of rpib was suggested to instead be interconversion of the rare  carbon sugars d allose  phosphate all p and d allulose  phosphate in mycobacterium tuberculosis where only an rpib is found the  carbon sugars are believed to be the enzyme s primary substrates here we present kinetic studies examining the all p isomerase activity of the rpibs from these two organisms and show that only the e coli enzyme can catalyze the reaction efficiently all p instead acts as an inhibitor of the m tuberculosis enzyme in its action on r p x ray studies of the m tuberculosis enzyme co crystallized with all p and  deoxy  phospho d ribonohydroxamate an inhibitor designed to mimic the  carbon sugar and comparison with the e coli enzyme s structure allowed us to identify differences in the active sites that explain the kinetic results two other structures that of a mutant e coli rpib in which histidine  was changed to asparagine and that of wild type m tuberculosis enzyme both co crystallized with the substrate ribose  phosphate shed additional light on the reaction mechanism of rpibs generally
