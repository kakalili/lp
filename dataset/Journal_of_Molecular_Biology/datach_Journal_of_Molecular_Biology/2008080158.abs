the structural basis of chain length control in rv
in mycobacterium tuberculosis two related z prenyl diphosphate synthases e z farnesyl diphosphate synthase rv   and decaprenyl diphosphate synthase rv  c  work in series to synthesize decaprenyl phosphate c  from isopentenyl diphosphate and e geranyl diphosphate decaprenyl phosphate plays a central role in the biosynthesis of essential mycobacterial cell wall components such as the mycolyl  arabinogalactan  peptidoglycan complex and lipoarabinomannan thus its synthesis has attracted considerable interest as a potential therapeutic target rv   is a unique prenyl diphosphate synthase in that it adds only one isoprene unit to geranyl diphosphate generating the  carbon product e z farnesyl diphosphate  rv  c then adds a further seven isoprene units to e z farnesyl diphosphate in a processive manner to generate the  carbon prenyl diphosphate which is then dephosphorylated to generate a carrier for activated sugars the molecular basis for chain length discrimination by rv   during synthesis is unknown we also report the structure of apo rv   with citronellyl diphosphate bound and with the product mimic e e farnesyl diphosphate bound we report the structures of rv  c in the apo form with isopentenyl diphosphate bound and with a substrate analogue citronellyl diphosphate the structures confirm the enzymes are very closely related detailed comparison reveals structural differences that account for chain length control in rv   we have tested this hypothesis and have identified a double mutant of rv   that makes a range of longer lipid chains
