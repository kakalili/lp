development of motavizumab an ultra potent antibody for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus infection in the upper and lower respiratory tract
respiratory syncytial virus rsv is the leading cause of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children currently palivizumab is the only approved monoclonal antibody mab for prophylaxis of rsv however a small percentage of patients are not protected by palivizumab in addition palivizumab does not inhibit rsv replication effectively in the upper respiratory tract we report here the development and characterization of motavizumab an ultra potent affinity matured humanized mab derived from palivizumab several palivizumab variants that enhanced the neutralization of rsv in vitro by up to  fold were generated however in vivo prophylaxis of cotton rats with these antibodies conferred only about a twofold improvement in potency over palivizumab this unexpected small increase of in vivo potency was caused by poor serum pharmacokinetics and lung bio availability that resulted from unexpectedly broad tissue binding subsequent analyses revealed that changes at three amino acids arising from the affinity maturation markedly increased the non specific binding to various tissues our results suggested that kon driven mutations are more likely to initiate non specific binding events than koff driven mutations reversion of these three residues to the original sequences greatly diminished the tissue binding the resulting mab motavizumab binds to rsv f protein  fold better than palivizumab and exhibits about a  fold improvement in neutralization of rsv in vitro in cotton rats at equivalent concentrations motavizumab reduced pulmonary rsv titers to up to   fold lower levels than did palivizumab and unlike palivizumab motavizumab very potently inhibited viral replication in the upper respiratory tract this affinity enhanced mab is being investigated in pivotal clinical trials importantly our engineering process offers precious insights into the improvement of other therapeutic mabs
