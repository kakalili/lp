a structural basis for s  protein specificity derived from comparative analysis of apo and ca  calcyclin edited by m f summers
calcyclin is a homodimeric protein belonging to the s  subfamily of ef hand ca  binding proteins which function in ca  signal transduction processes a refined high resolution solution structure of ca  bound rabbit calcyclin has been determined by heteronuclear solution nmr in order to understand the ca  induced structural changes in s  proteins in depth comparative structural analyses were used to compare the apo and ca  bound states of calcyclin the closely related s  b and the prototypical ca  sensor protein calmodulin upon ca  binding the position and orientation of helix iii in the second ef hand is altered whereas the rest of the protein including the dimer interface remains virtually unchanged this ca  induced structural change is much less drastic than the  opening  of the globular ef hand domains that occurs in classical ca  sensors such as calmodulin using homology models of calcyclin based on s  b a binding site in calcyclin has been proposed for the n terminal domain of annexin xi and the c terminal domain of the neuronal calcyclin binding protein the structural basis for the specificity of s  proteins is discussed in terms of the variation in sequence of critical contact residues in the common s  target binding site
