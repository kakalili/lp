Solid-state NMR measurements performed on intact whole cells of Staphylococcus aureus labeled selectively in vivo have established that des-N-methylleucyl oritavancin (which has antimicrobial activity) binds to the cell-wall peptidoglycan, even though removal of the terminal N-methylleucyl residue destroys the d-Ala-d-Ala binding pocket. By contrast, the des-N-methylleucyl form of vancomycin (which has no antimicrobial activity) does not bind to the cell wall. Solid-state NMR has also determined that oritavancin and vancomycin are comparable inhibitors of transglycosylation, but that oritavancin is a more potent inhibitor of transpeptidation. This combination of effects on cell-wall binding and biosynthesis is interpreted in terms of a recent proposal that oritavancin-like glycopeptides have two cell-wall binding sites: the well-known peptidoglycan d-Ala-d-Ala pentapeptide stem terminus and the pentaglycyl bridging segment. The resulting dual mode of action provides a structural framework for coordinated cell-wall assembly that accounts for the enhanced potency of oritavancin and oritavancin-like analogues against vancomycin-resistant organisms.
