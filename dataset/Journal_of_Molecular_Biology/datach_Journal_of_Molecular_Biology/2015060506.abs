sortcery  a high  throughput method to affinity rank peptide ligands
uncovering the relationships between peptide and protein sequences and binding properties is critical for successfully predicting re designing and inhibiting protein  protein interactions systematically collected data that link protein sequence to binding are valuable for elucidating determinants of protein interaction but are rare in the literature because such data are experimentally difficult to generate here we describe sortcery a high throughput method that we have used to rank hundreds of yeast displayed peptides according to their affinities for a target interaction partner the procedure involves fluorescence activated cell sorting of a library deep sequencing of sorted pools and downstream computational analysis we have developed theoretical models and statistical tools that assist in planning these stages we demonstrate sortcery s utility by ranking   bh  bcl  homology  peptides with respect to their affinities for the anti apoptotic protein bcl xl our results are in striking agreement with measured affinities for  individual peptides with dissociation constants ranging from   to  nm high resolution ranking can be used to improve our understanding of sequence  function relationships and to support the development of computational models for predicting and designing novel interactions
