dna pk is involved in repairing a transient surge of dna breaks induced by deceleration of dna replication
cells that suffer substantial inhibition of dna replication halt their cell cycle via a checkpoint response mediated by the pi kinases atm and atr it is unclear how cells cope with milder replication insults which are under the threshold for atm and atr activation a third pi kinase dna dependent protein kinase dna  pk  is also activated following replication inhibition but the role dna  pk might play in response to perturbed replication is unclear since this kinase does not activate the signaling cascades involved in the s phase checkpoint here we report that mild transient drug induced perturbation of dna replication rapidly induced dna breaks that promptly disappeared in cells that contained a functional dna  pk whereas such breaks persisted in cells that were deficient in dna  pk activity after the initial transient burst of dna breaks cells with a functional dna  pk did not halt replication and continued to synthesize dna at a slow pace in the presence of replication inhibitors in contrast dna  pk deficient cells subject to low levels of replication inhibition halted cell cycle progression via an atr mediated s phase checkpoint the atm kinase was dispensable for the induction of the initial dna breaks these observations suggest that dna pk is involved in setting a high threshold for the atr chk mediated s phase checkpoint by promptly repairing dna breaks that appear immediately following inhibition of dna replication
