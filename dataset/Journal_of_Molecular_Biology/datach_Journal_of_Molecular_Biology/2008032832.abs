control of ion selectivity in leut two na binding sites with two different mechanisms
the x ray structure of leut a bacterial homologue of na cl  dependent neurotransmitter transporters provides a great opportunity to better understand the molecular basis of monovalent cation selectivity in ion coupled transporters leut possesses two ion binding sites na and na  which are highly selective for na  extensive all atom free energy molecular dynamics simulations of leut embedded in an explicit membrane are performed at different temperatures and various occupancy states of the binding sites to dissect the molecular mechanism of ion selectivity the results show that the two binding sites display robust selectivity for na over k or li  the competing ions of most similar radii of particular interest the mechanism primarily responsible for selectivity for each of the two binding sites appears to be different in na  selectivity for na over k arises predominantly from the strong electrostatic field arising from the negatively charged carboxylate group of the leucine substrate coordinating the ion directly in na  which comprises only neutral ligands selectivity for na is enforced by the local structural restraints arising from the hydrogen bonding network and the covalent connectivity of the polypeptide chain surrounding the ion according to a  snug fit  mechanism
