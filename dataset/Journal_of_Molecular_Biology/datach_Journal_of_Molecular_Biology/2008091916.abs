force based analysis of multidimensional energy landscapes application of dynamic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulations to an antibody fragment  peptide complex
multidimensional energy landscapes are an intrinsic property of proteins and define their dynamic behavior as well as their response to external stimuli in order to explore the energy landscape and its implications on the dynamic function of proteins dynamic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics smd simulations have proved to be important tools in this study these techniques have been employed to analyze the influence of the direction of the probing forces on the complex of an antibody fragment with its peptide antigen using an atomic force microscope experiments were performed where the attachment points of the  amino acid long peptide antigen were varied these measurements yielded clearly distinguishable basal dissociation rates and potential widths proving that the direction of the applied force determines the unbinding pathway complementary atomistic smd simulations were performed which also show that the unbinding pathways of the system are dependent on the pulling direction however the main barrier to be crossed was independent of the pulling direction and is represented by a backbone hydrogen bond between glyh h  of the antibody fragment and gluo  peptide of the peptide for each pulling direction the observed barriers can be correlated with the rupture of specific interactions which stabilize the bound complex furthermore although the smd simulations were performed at loading rates exceeding the experimental rates by orders of magnitude due to computational limitations a detailed comparison of the barriers that were overcome in the smd simulations with the data obtained from the atomic force microscope unbinding experiments show excellent agreement
