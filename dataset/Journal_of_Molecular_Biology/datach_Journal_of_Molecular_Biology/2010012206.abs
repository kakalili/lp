f actin structure destabilization and dnase i binding loop fluctuations mutational cross linking and electron microscopy analysis of loop states and effects on f actin
the conformational dynamics of filamentous actin f actin is essential for the regulation and functions of cellular actin networks the main contribution to f actin dynamics and its multiple conformational states arises from the mobility and flexibility of the dnase i binding loop d loop residues     on subdomain  therefore we explored the structural constraints on d loop plasticity at the f actin interprotomer space by probing its dynamic interactions with the hydrophobic loop h loop  the c terminus and the w loop via mutational disulfide cross linking to this end residues of the d loop were mutated to cysteines on yeast actin with a c  a background these mutants showed no major changes in their polymerization and nucleotide exchange properties compared to wild type actin copper catalyzed disulfide cross linking was investigated in equimolar copolymers of cysteine mutants from the d loop with either wild type c   actin or mutant s  c c  a on the h loop or mutant f  c c  a on the w loop  remarkably all tested residues of the d loop could be cross linked to residues      and   by disulfide bonds demonstrating the plasticity of the interprotomer region however each cross link resulted in different effects on the filament structure as detected by electron microscopy and light scattering measurements disulfide cross linking in the longitudinal orientation produced mostly no visible changes in filament morphology whereas the cross linking of d loop residues gt  to the h loop in the lateral direction resulted in filament disruption and the presence of amorphous aggregates on electron microscopy images a similar aggregation was also observed upon cross linking the residues of the d loop  gt   to residue   the effects of disulfide cross links on f actin stability were only partially accounted for by the simulations of current f actin models thus our results present evidence for the high level of conformational plasticity in the interprotomer space and document the link between d loop interactions and f actin stability
