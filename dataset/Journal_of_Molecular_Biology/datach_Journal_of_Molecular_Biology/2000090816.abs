stabilization of rna tertiary structure by monovalent cations edited by i tinoco
the effects of monovalent cations li  na  k  rb  cs  and nh  on the thermal stability of rna tertiary structure were investigated by uv melting we show that with the rna used here nucleotides      of escherichia coli  s rrna with four base substitutions  monovalent cations and mg  compete in stabilizing the rna tertiary structure and that the competition takes place between two boundaries one where mg  concentration is zero and the other where it is maximally stabilizing   saturating   the pattern of competition is the same for all monovalent cations and depends on the cation  s ability to displace mg  from the rna its ability to stabilize tertiary structure in the absence of mg  and its ability to stabilize tertiary structure at saturating mg  concentrations the stabilizing ability of a monovalent cation depends on its unhydrated ionic radius and at a low monovalent cation concentration and saturating mg  there is a calculated net release of a single monovalent cation rna molecule when tertiary structure is denatured the implications are that under these conditions there is at least one binding site for monovalent cations on the rna the site is specifically associated with formation of stable tertiary structure k is the most effective of the tested cations and mg  appears ineffective at this site at high ionic strength and in the absence of mg  stabilization of tertiary structure is still monovalent cation specific and ionic radius dependent but a larger number of cations   eight are released upon rna tertiary structure denaturation and nh  appears to be the most effective cation in stabilizing tertiary structure under these conditions in the majority of the experiments methanol was added as a cosolvent to the buffer its use allowed the examination of the behavior of monovalent ions under conditions where their effects would otherwise have been too weak to be observed methanol stabilizes tertiary but not secondary structure of the rna there was no evidence that it either causes qualitative changes in cation binding properties of the rna or a change in the pattern of monovalent cation mg  competition
