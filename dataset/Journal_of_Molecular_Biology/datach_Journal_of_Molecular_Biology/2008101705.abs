crystal structure of the rrm domain of poly a specific ribonuclease reveals a novel m g cap binding mode
poly a specific ribonuclease parn is a processive   exoribonuclease involved in the decay of eukaryotic mrnas interestingly parn interacts not only with the   end of the mrna but also with its   end as parn contains an rrm domain that specifically binds both the poly a tail and the  methylguanosine m g cap the interaction of parn with the   cap of mrnas stimulates the deadenylation activity and enhances the processivity of this reaction we have determined the crystal structure of the parn rrm domain with a bound m g triphosphate nucleotide revealing a novel binding mode for the m g cap the structure of the m g binding pocket is located outside of the canonical rna binding surface of the rrm domain and differs significantly from that of other m g cap binding proteins the crystal structure also shows a remarkable conformational flexibility of the rrm domain leading to a perfect exchange of two  helices with an adjacent protein molecule in the crystal lattice
