Human MRP14 (hMRP14) is a Ca2+-binding protein from the S100 family of proteins. This protein is co-expressed with human MRP8 (hMRP8), a homologue protein in myeloid cells, and plays an indispensable role in Ca2+-dependent functions during inflammation. This role includes the activation of Mac-1, the β2 integrin which is involved in neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. The crystal structure of the holo form of hMRP14 was analyzed at 2.1 Å resolution. hMRP14 is distinguished from other S100 member proteins by its long C-terminal region, and its structure shows that the region is extensively flexible. In this crystal structure of hMRP14, Chaps molecules bind to the hinge region that connects two EF-hand motifs, which suggests that this region is a target-binding site of this protein. Based on a structural comparison of hMRP14 with hMRP8 and human S100A12 (hS100A12) that is another homologue protein, the character of MRP8/14 hetero-complex and the functional significance of the flexibility of the C-terminal region of hMRP14 are discussed.
