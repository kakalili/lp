a novel two step mechanism for removal of a mitochondrial signal sequence involves the maaa complex and the putative rhomboid protease pcp
the yeast protein cytochrome c peroxidase ccp  is nuclearly encoded and imported into the mitochondrial intermembrane space where it is involved in degradation of reactive oxygen species it is known that ccp is synthesised as a precursor with a n terminal pre sequence that is proteolytically removed during transport of the protein here we present evidence for a new processing pathway involving novel signal peptidase activities the maaa protease subunits yta  afg  and yta  rca  were identified both to be essential for the first processing step in addition the pcp  ygr  w gene product was found to be required for the second processing step yielding the mature ccp protein the newly identified pcp protein belongs to the rhomboid glpg superfamily of putative intramembrane peptidases inactivation of the protease motifs in maaa and pcp blocks the respective steps of proteolysis a model of coupled ccp transport and n terminal processing by the maaa complex and pcp is discussed similar processing mechanisms may exist because the maaa subunits and the newly identified pcp protein belong to ubiquitous protein families
