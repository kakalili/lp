aa ag helix ends a a and a g base pairs at the ends of  s and  s rrna helices edited by j doudna
this study reveals that aa and ag oppositions occur frequently at the ends of helices in rna crystal and nmr structures in the pdb database and in the  s and  s rrna comparative structure models with the g usually   to the helix for the ag oppositions in addition these oppositions are frequently base paired and usually in the sheared conformation although other conformations are present in nmr and crystal structures these a a and a g base pairs are present in a variety of structural environments including gnra tetraloops e and e like loops interfaced between two helices that are coaxially stacked tandem g a base pairs u turns and adenosine platforms finally given structural studies that reveal conformational rearrangements occurring in regions of the rna with aa and ag oppositions at the ends of helices we suggest that these conformationally unique helix extensions might be associated with functionally important structural rearrangements
