redesign of the pak autoinhibitory domain for enhanced stability and affinity in biosensor applications
the inhibitory switch is domain of p  activated kinase  pak  stabilizes full length pak in an inactive conformation by binding to the pak kinase domain competitive binding of small guanosine triphosphatases to the is domain disrupts the autoinhibitory interactions and exposes the is domain binding site on the surface of the kinase domain to build an affinity reagent that selectively binds the activated state of pak  we used molecular modeling to reengineer the isolated is domain so that it was soluble and stable did not bind to guanosine triphosphatases and bound more tightly to the pak kinase domain three design strategies were tested in the first and second cases extension and redesign of the n terminus were used to expand the hydrophobic core of the domain and in the third case the termini were redesigned to be adjacent in space so that the domain could be stabilized by insertion into a loop in a host cyan fluorescent protein cfp  the best performing design called cfp packer was based on the third strategy and bound the kinase domain of pak with an affinity of   nm cfp packer binds more tightly to a full length variant of pak that is stabilized in the  open  state kd    m than to full length pak in the  closed  state undetectable affinity  and binding can be monitored with fluorescence by placing an environmentally sensitive fluorescence dye on cfp packer adjacent to the binding site
