Although a majority of HIV-1 infections in Brazil are caused by the subtype B virus (also prevalent in the United States and Western Europe), viral subtypes F and C are also found very frequently. Genomic differences between the subtypes give rise to sequence variations in the encoded proteins, including the HIV-1 protease. The current anti-HIV drugs have been developed primarily against subtype B and the effects arising from the combination of drug-resistance mutations with the naturally existing polymorphisms in non-B HIV-1 subtypes are only beginning to be elucidated. To gain more insights into the structure and function of different variants of HIV proteases, we have determined a 2.1 Å structure of the native subtype F HIV-1 protease (PR) in complex with the protease inhibitor TL-3. We have also solved crystal structures of two multi-drug resistant mutant HIV PRs in complex with TL-3, from subtype B (Bmut) carrying the primary mutations V82A and L90M, and from subtype F (Fmut) carrying the primary mutation V82A plus the secondary mutation M36I, at 1.75 Å and 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The proteases Bmut, Fwt and Fmut exhibit sevenfold, threefold, and 54-fold resistance to TL-3, respectively. In addition, the structure of subtype B wild type HIV-PR in complex with TL-3 has been redetermined in space group P61, consistent with the other three structures. Our results show that the primary mutation V82A causes the known effect of collapsing the S1/S1′ pockets that ultimately lead to the reduced inhibitory effect of TL-3. Our results further indicate that two naturally occurring polymorphic substitutions in subtype F and other non-B HIV proteases, M36I and L89M, may lead to early development of drug resistance in patients infected with non-B HIV subtypes.
