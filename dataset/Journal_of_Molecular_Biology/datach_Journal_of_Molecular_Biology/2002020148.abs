binding of prion protein to lipid membranes and implications for prion conversion edited by f cohen
the binding of the syrian hamster prion protein shaprp      to model lipid membranes was investigated by tryptophan fluorescence membranes composed of negatively charged or zwitterionic lipids and raft like membranes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine   dipalmitoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dppc  cholesterol and sphingomyelin were investigated it was found that shaprp      binds to negatively charged lipid membranes and raft like membranes binding of prp to negatively charged lipid membranes involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic lipid protein interactions and results in partial insertion of prp into the lipid bilayer this membrane inserted conformation of prp is richer in  sheet structure and has a disruptive effect on the integrity of the lipid bilayer leading to total release of vesicle contents in contrast the binding of prp to raft like membranes is driven by hydrophobic lipid protein interactions and induces the formation of  helical structure this conformation of prp with a high content of  helix is formed only at ph  and does not destabilize the lipid bilayer our findings support the view that an interaction of prp with lipid membranes could play a role in prp conversion
