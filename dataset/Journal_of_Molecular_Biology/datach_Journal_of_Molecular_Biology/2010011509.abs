the crystal structure of the novobiocin biosynthetic enzyme novp the first representative structure for the tylf o methyltransferase superfamily
novp is an s adenosyl l methionine dependent o methyltransferase that catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin specifically it methylates at  oh of the noviose moiety and the resultant methoxy group is important for the potency of the mature antibiotic previous crystallographic studies have shown that this group interacts directly with the target enzyme dna gyrase which is a validated drug target we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of novp from streptomyces spheroides as a binary complex with its desmethylated cosubstrate s adenosyl l homocysteine the structure displays a typical class i methyltransferase fold in addition to motifs that are consistent with a divalent metal dependent mechanism this is the first representative structure of a methyltransferase from the tylf superfamily which includes a number of enzymes implicated in the biosynthesis of antibiotics and other therapeutics the novp structure reveals a number of distinctive structural features that based on sequence conservation are likely to be characteristic of the superfamily these include a helical  lid  region that gates access to the cosubstrate binding pocket and an active center that contains a  asp putative metal binding site a further conserved asp likely acts as the general base that initiates the reaction by deprotonating the  oh group of the noviose unit using in silico docking we have generated models of the enzyme  substrate complex that are consistent with the proposed mechanism furthermore these models suggest that novp is unlikely to tolerate significant modifications at the noviose moiety but could show increasing substrate promiscuity as a function of the distance of the modification from the methylation site these observations could inform future attempts to utilize novp for methylating a range of glycosylated compounds
