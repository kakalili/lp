the conserved active site proline determines the reducing power of staphylococcus aureus thioredoxin
nature uses thioredoxin like folds in several disulfide bond oxidoreductases each of them has a typical active site cys x x cys sequence motif the hallmark of thioredoxin being trp cys gly pro cys the intriguing role of the highly conserved proline in the ubiquitous reducing agent thioredoxin was studied by site specific mutagenesis of staphylococcus aureus thioredoxin sa trx  we present x ray structures redox potential pka steady state kinetic parameters and thermodynamic stabilities by replacing the central proline to a threonine serine no extra hydrogen bonds with the sulphur of the nucleophilic cysteine are introduced the only structural difference is that the immediate chemical surrounding of the nucleophilic cysteine becomes more hydrophilic the pka value of the nucleophilic cysteine decreases with approximately one ph unit and its redox potential increases with   mv thioredoxin becomes more oxidizing and the efficiency to catalyse substrate reduction kcat km decreases sevenfold relative to wild type sa trx the oxidized form of wild type sa trx is far more stable than the reduced form over the whole temperature range the driving force to reduce substrate proteins is the relative stability of the oxidized versus the reduced form  t  ox red this driving force is decreased in the sa trx p t mutant   t  ox red drops from     c wild type to    c p t mutant  in conclusion the active site proline in thioredoxin determines the driving potential for substrate reduction
