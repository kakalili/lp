allosteric switching of agonist antagonist activity by a single point mutation in the interluekin  receptor antagonist il ra
the pleiotropic pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin il   has co evolved with a competitive inhibitor il  receptor antagonist il ra  il   initiates cell signaling by binding the il  receptor il r whereas il ra acts as an antagonist blocking receptor signaling the current paradigm for agonist antagonist functions for these two proteins is based on the receptor  ligand interaction observed in the crystal structures of the receptor  ligand complexes while il ra and il   are structurally homologous il ra engages only two of the three extracellular domains of the receptor whereas il   engages all three we find that an allosteric functional switch exists within a highly conserved pocket of residues residues      this region is maintained across all il  family members and serves as a hydrophobic mini core for il   folding a key difference across species is a conserved aromatic residue at position   in il   versus a conserved cysteine in il ra at the analogous position    we find that the replacement of c  with a phenylalanine switches the protein from an antagonist to an agonist despite the distant location of c  relative to receptor interaction sites these results suggest new ways to develop designer cytokine activity into the  trefoil fold and may be of general use in regulation of this large family of signaling proteins
