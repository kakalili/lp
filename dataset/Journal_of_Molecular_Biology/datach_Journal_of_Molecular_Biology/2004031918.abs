enhanced cpt sensitivity of yeast cells and selective relaxation of gal motif containing dna by novel gal  topoisomerase i fusion proteins
human topoisomerase i b top  efficiently relaxes dna supercoils during basic cellular processes and can be transformed into a dna damaging agent by antitumour drugs enzyme mutations and dna lesions here we describe gal  top chimeric proteins galtop with an n terminal truncation of top  and mutations of the gal zn cluster and or top domains that impair their respective dna binding activities expression levels of chimeras were similar in yeast cells however galtop conferred an increased cpt sensitivity to rad   yeast cells as compared to a galtop with mutations of the gal domain showing that a functional gal domain can alter in vivo functions of top  in vitro enzyme activity was tested with a dna relaxation assay using negatively supercoiled plasmids with  to  gal consensus motifs only galtop with a functional gal domain could direct dna relaxation activity of top specifically to dna molecules containing gal motifs by using a substrate competition assay we could demonstrate that the gal anchored top remains functional and efficiently relax dna substrates in cis the enhanced cpt sensitivity of galtop in yeast cells may then be due to alterations of the chromatin binding activity of top  the galtop chimeras may indeed mimic a normal mechanism by which top is recruited to chromatin sites in living cells such hybrid top s may be helpful in further dissecting enzyme functions and constitute a prototype of a site specific dna cutter endowed with high cell lethality
