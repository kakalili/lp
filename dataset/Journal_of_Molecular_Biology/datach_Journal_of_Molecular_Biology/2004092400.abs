inhibition of the expression of the human rnase p protein subunits rpp  rpp  rpp  by external guide sequences egss and sirna
external guide sequences egss and sirnas were targeted individually to the mrna of three of the protein subunits of human rnase p rpp  rpp  and rpp  the production of each of the three targets was inhibited in every specific case in addition some of the remaining protein subunits were also inhibited by these specific egss and the sirnas these data in general confirm previous results on the inhibition of a sub group of all the protein subunits with an egs against rpp  the effect of egss is apparent in  hours after transfection but the effect of sirnas which is comparable to the egs data in amounts of inhibition takes at least  to  hours to become evident no general understanding of the mechanism of action of the sirnas in terms of which portion of a target mrna they bind to for function was apparent from the design of those used here
