rapid incorporation of functional rhodopsin into nanoscale apolipoprotein bound bilayer nabb particles
human apolipoprotein a i apo a i and its engineered constructs form discoidal lipid bilayers upon interaction with lipids in vitro we now report the cloning expression and purification of apo a i derived from zebrafish danio rerio  which combines with phospholipids to form similar discoidal bilayers and may prove to be superior to human apo a i constructs for rapid reconstitution of seven transmembrane helix receptors into nanoscale apolipoprotein bound bilayers nabbs  we characterized nabbs by gel filtration chromatography native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis uv visible photobleaching difference spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy we used electron microscopy to determine the stoichiometry and orientation of rhodopsin rho containing nabbs prepared under various conditions and correlated stability and signaling efficiency of rho in nabbs with either one or two receptors we discovered that the specific activity of g protein coupling for single rhos sequestered in individual nabbs was nearly identical with that of two rhos per nabb under conditions where stoichiometry and orientation could be inferred by electron microscopy imaging thermal stability of rho in nabbs was superior to that of rho in various commonly used detergents we conclude that the nabb system using engineered zebrafish apo a i is a native like membrane mimetic system for g protein coupled receptors and discuss strategies for rapid incorporation of expressed membrane proteins into nabbs
