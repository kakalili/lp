differences between the interaction of  catenin with non phosphorylated and single mimicked phosphorylated  amino acid residue repeats of the apc protein
the tumour suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli apc regulates the level and the intracellular localisation of the proto oncoprotein  catenin there are indications that a region comprising seven homologous  amino acid residue repeats within the apc protein is responsible for the interaction with  catenin and that the phosphorylation of conserved serine residues within these repeats increases the affinity for  catenin we used biophysical methods to analyse the  catenin binding of single repeats or repeat combinations as non phosphorylated or phosphorylated recombinant proteins the non phosphorylated repeats showed similar affinities no matter whether they were tested as single recombinant repeats or in combination with neighbouring repeats this result makes a cooperative influence between the repetitive motifs unlikely the phosphorylation of the apc protein was mimicked by specific serine aspartate mutations which align to serine residues in the cytoplasmic  catenin binding domain of e cadherin remarkably the mimicked phosphorylation of a serine which is not involved in  catenin interaction in the e cadherin  catenin complex led to a significant increase in the apc affinity for  catenin these results indicate structural differences between the e cadherin  catenin and the apc  catenin complexes and provide quantitative evidence for the importance of the apc phosphorylation for its interaction with  catenin
