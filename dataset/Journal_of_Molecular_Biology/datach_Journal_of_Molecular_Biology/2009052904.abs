conformational changes in a plant ketol acid reductoisomerase upon mg  and nadph binding as revealed by two crystal structures
ketol acid reductoisomerase kari ec      is an enzyme in the branched chain amino acid biosynthesis pathway where it catalyzes the conversion of  acetolactate into  r   dihydroxy  isovalerate or the conversion of  aceto  hydroxybutyrate into  r r   dihydroxy  methylvalerate kari catalyzes two reactions  alkyl migration and reduction  and requires mg  and nadph for activity to date the only reported structures for a plant kari are those of the spinach enzyme  mn   phospho adp ribose   r r   dihydroxy  methylvalerate complex and the spinach kari  mg   nadph  n hydroxy n isopropyloxamate complex where n hydroxy n isopropyloxamate is a predicted transition state analog these studies demonstrated that the enzyme consists of two domains n domain and c domain with the active site at the interface of these domains here we have determined the structures of the rice kari  mg  and rice kari  mg   nadph complexes to     and     resolutions respectively in comparing the structures of all the complexes several differences are observed firstly the n domain is rotated up to   relative to the c domain expanding the active site by up to    secondly an  helix in the c domain that includes residues v  t  and forms part of the active site moves by      upon binding of nadph thirdly the  c terminal amino acid residues in the rice kari  mg  complex are disordered in the rice kari  mg   nadph complex and the spinach kari structures many of the  residues bind to nadph and the n domain and cover the active site fourthly the location of the metal ions within the active site can vary by up to     the new structures allow us to propose that an induced fit mechanism operates to i allow substrate to enter the active site  ii close over the active site during catalysis and iii open the active site to facilitate product release
