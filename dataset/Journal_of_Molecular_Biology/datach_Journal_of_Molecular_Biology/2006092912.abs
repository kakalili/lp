binding site structure of one lrp  rap complex implications for a common ligand  receptor binding motif
the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein lrp interacts with more than  ligands of different sizes and structures that can all be replaced by the receptor associated protein rap  the double module of complement type repeats cr  of lrp binds many ligands including all three domains of rap and   macroglobulin which promotes the catabolism of the a  peptide implicated in alzheimer s disease to understand the receptor  ligand cross talk the nmr structure of cr  has been solved and ligand binding experiments with rap domain  rapd  have been performed from chemical shift perturbations of both binding partners upon complex formation a haddock model of the complex between cr  and rapd has been obtained the binding residues are similar to a common binding motif suggested from   macroglobulin binding studies and provide evidence for an understanding of their mutual cross competition pattern the present structural results convey a simultaneous description of both binding partners of an lrp  ligand complex and open a route to a broader understanding of the binding specificity of the lrp receptor which may involve a general four residue receptor  ligand recognition motif common to all lrp ligands the present result may be beneficial in the design of antagonists of ligand binding to the ldl receptor family and especially of drugs for treatment of alzheimer s disease
