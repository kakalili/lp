the analysis of the transcriptional activator prna reveals a tripartite nuclear localisation sequence  edited by m yaniv
nuclear localisation signals nlss have been classified as either mono or bipartite genetic analysis and gfp fusions show that the nls of a zn binuclear cluster transcriptional activator of aspergillus nidulans prna is tripartite this nls comprises two amino terminal basic sequences and the first basic sequence of the zn cluster neither the two amino terminal basic sequences nor the paradigmatic nucleoplasmin bipartite nls drive our construction to the nucleus cryosensitive mutations in the second basic sequence are suppressed by mutations that restore the basicity of the domain the integrity of the zn cluster is not necessary for nuclear localisation a tandem repetition of the two basic amino terminal sequences results in a strong nls complete nuclear localisation is observed when the whole dna binding domain including the putative dimerisation element is included in the construction at variance with what is seen with tandem nlss all fluorescence here is intra nuclear this suggests that retention and nuclear entry are functionally different with the whole prna protein we observe localisation retention and also a striking sub localisation within the nucleus nuclear localisation and sub localisation are constitutive not dependent on proline induction  in contrast with what has been observed by others in a nidulans none of our constructions are delocalised during mitosis this is the first analysis of the nls of a zn binuclear cluster protein and the first characterisation of a tripartite nls
