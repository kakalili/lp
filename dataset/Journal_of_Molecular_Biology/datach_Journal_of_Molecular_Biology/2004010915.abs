the d solution structure of the c terminal region of ku  ku ctr
in eukaryotes the non homologous end joining repair of double strand breaks in dna is executed by a series of proteins that bring about the synapsis preparation and ligation of the broken dna ends the mechanism of this process appears to be initiated by the obligate heterodimer ku  ku  protein complex ku that has affinity for dna ends ku then recruits the dna dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit dna pkcs  the three dimensional structures of the major part of the ku heterodimer representing the dna binding core both free and bound to dna are known from x ray crystallography however these structures lack a region of ca   residues from the c terminal region ctr of the ku  subunit also known as lupus ku autoantigen p  ku  or xrcc  that includes the extreme c terminal tail that is reported to be sufficient for dna pkcs binding we have examined the structural characteristics of the ku ctr protein expressed in bacteria by deletion mutagenesis and heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy we localised a globular domain consisting of residues      constructs comprising additional residues either to the n terminal side residues       or the c terminal side residues       which includes the putative dna pkcs binding motif yielded nmr spectra consistent with these extra regions lacking ordered structure the three dimensional solution structure of the core globular domain of the c terminal region of ku  ku ctr      has been determined using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and dynamical simulated annealing using structural restraints from nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy and scalar and residual dipolar couplings the polypeptide fold comprises six regions of  helical secondary structure that has an overall superhelical topology remotely homologous to the mif g homology domain of the human nuclear cap binding protein  kda subunit and the vhs domain of the drosophila protein hrs though strict analysis of the structures suggests that these domains are not functionally related two prominent hydrophobic pockets in the gap between helices   and   suggest a potential ligand binding characteristic for this globular domain
