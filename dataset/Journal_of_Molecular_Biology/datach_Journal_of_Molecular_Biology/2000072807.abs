hydration dynamics of the collagen triple helix by nmr edited by p e wright
the hydration of the collagen like ac gly pro hyp  nh triple helical peptide in solution was investigated using an integrated set of high resolution nmr hydration experiments including different recently developed exchange network editing methods this approach was designed to explore the hydration dynamics in the proximity of labile groups such as the hydroxyproline hydroxyl group and revealed that the first shell of hydration in collagen like triple helices is kinetically labile with upper limits for water molecule residence times in the nanosecond to sub nanosecond range this result is consistent with a  hopping  hydration model in which solvent molecules are exchanged in and out of solvation sites at a rate that is not directly correlated to the degree of site localization the hopping model thus reconciles the dynamic view of hydration revealed by nmr with the previously suggested partially ordered semi clathrate like cylinder of hydration in addition the nanosecond to sub nanosecond upper limits for water molecule residence times imply that hydration dehydration events are not likely to be the rate limiting step for triple helix self recognition complementing previous investigations on water dynamics in collagen fibers this study has also revealed labile proton features expected to facilitate the characterization of the structure and folding of triple helices in collagen peptides
