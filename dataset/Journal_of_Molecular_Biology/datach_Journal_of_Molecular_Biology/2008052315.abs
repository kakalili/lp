the hsp  inhibitor radicicol interacts with the atp binding pocket of bacterial sensor kinase phoq
sensor kinases in the bacterial two component system share a unique atp binding bergerat fold with the ghl gyrase hsp  and mutl family of proteins we demonstrated that selected ghl inhibitors bind to the catalytic domain of sensor kinase phoq phoqcat using nmr chemical shift perturbation experiments using crystallographic approaches we show that radicicol an hsp  inhibitor binds and interacts specifically with residues in the atp binding pocket of phoq the interaction between radicicol and phoqcat demonstrates significant similarities as well as differences compared to amppnp a non hydrolyzable atp analog bound to phoqcat and radicicol bound to hsp  our results suggest that ghl inhibitors may be useful lead compounds for developing sensor kinase inhibitors
