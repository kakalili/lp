exonization of alu generated splice variants in the survivin gene of human and non human primates
survivin is a member of the inhibitor apoptosis family that is overexpressed in many malignancies it has five known alternative splice forms some of which differ in their antiapoptotic properties and expression levels in human cancers here we describe a novel donor splice site dss  b  dss which is used in conjunction with survivin alternative exon b resulting in the inclusion of  additional nucleotides from intron  at the   end of this exon sequence analysis showed that both the classical exon b dss and b  are provided by an alu sequence which is inserted in intron  downstream of a functional acceptor splice site leading to the exonization of part of the repetitive element minor transcripts including the b  alternative exon or retaining the whole intronic region comprised between exons b and  were detected in several human cell lines and in some human tissues survivin b  containing variants acquire a premature stop codon ptc and may therefore be degraded by the nonsense mediated decay pathway the implication of these novel isoforms as well as other ptc survivin variants in the overall regulation of survivin expression is discussed sequence analysis of intron  which contains the alu y element was performed on different primate species in order to trace its insertion and exonization during primate evolution
