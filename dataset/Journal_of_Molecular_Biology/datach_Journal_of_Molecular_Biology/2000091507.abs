the slow folding reaction of barstar the core tryptophan region attains tight packing before substantial secondary and tertiary structure formation and final compaction of the polypeptide chain edited by c r matthews
the slow folding of a single tryptophan containing mutant of barstar has been studied in the presence of  m urea at   c using steady state and time resolved fluorescence methods and far and near uv cd measurements the protein folds in two major phases a fast phase which is lost in the dead time of measurement during which the polypeptide collapses to a compact form is followed by a slow observable phase during the fast phase the rotational correlation time of trp  increases from   ns to   ns and its mean fluorescence lifetime increases from   ns to   ns the fractional changes in steady state fluorescence far uv cd and near uv cd signals which are associated with the fast phase are respectively       and    the product of the fast phase can bind the hydrophobic dye ans these observations together suggest that the folding intermediate accumulated at the end of the fast phase has  a about   of the native state secondary structure  b marginally formed or disordered tertiary structure  c a water intruded and mobile protein interior and d solvent accessible patches of hydrophobic groups measurements of the anisotropy decay of trp  suggest that it undergoes two types of rotational motion in the intermediate  i fast  r   ns local motion of its indole side chain and ii a slower  r    ns motion corresponding to global tumbling of the entire protein molecule the ability of the trp  side chain to undergo fast local motion in the intermediate but not in the fully folded protein where it is completely buried in the hydrophobic core suggests that the core of the intermediate is still poorly packed the global tumbling time of the fully folded protein is faster at   ns suggesting that the volume of the intermediate is   more than that of the fully folded protein the rate of folding of this intermediate to the native state measured by steady state fluorescence far uv cd and near uv cd is       min   this rate compares to a rate of folding of        min   determined by double jump experiments which monitor directly formation of native protein and to a rate of folding of   min   when determined from time resolved anisotropy measurements of the long rotational correlation time which relaxes from an initial value of   ns to a final value of   ns as the protein folds on the other hand the amplitude of the short correlation time decreases rapidly with a rate of       min   these results suggest that tight packing of residues in the hydrophobic core occurs relatively early during the observable slow folding reaction before substantial secondary and tertiary structure formation and before final compaction of the protein
