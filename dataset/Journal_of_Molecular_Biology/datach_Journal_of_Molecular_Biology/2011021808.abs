structural studies of rok fructokinase ydhr from bacillus subtilis insights into substrate binding and fructose specificity
the main pathway of bacterial sugar phosphorylation utilizes specific phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system pts enzymes in addition to the classic pts system a pts independent secondary system has been described in which nucleotide dependent sugar kinases are used for monosaccharide phosphorylation fructokinase fk  which phosphorylates d fructose with atp as a cofactor has been shown to be a member of this secondary system bioinformatic analysis has shown that fk is a member of the  rok   bacterial repressors uncharacterized open reading frames and sugar kinases sequence family in this study we report the crystal structures of rok fk from bacillus subtilis ydhr  a apo and in the presence of b adp and c adp d fructose all structures show that ydhr is a homodimer with a monomer composed of two similar    domains forming a large cleft between domains that bind adp and d fructose enzymatic activity assays support ydhr function as an atp dependent fructose kinase
