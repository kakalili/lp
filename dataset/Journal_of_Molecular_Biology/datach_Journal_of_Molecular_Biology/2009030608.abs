thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of a germ line human   light chain protein the relation between unfolding and fibrillogenesis
proteins encoded by the gene segment a of the  variable light chain repertoire are strongly associated with amyloid deposition  ajl is a model protein constructed with the predicted sequences encoded by the a and jl germ line genes in this work we characterized the urea and temperature induced unfolding of ajl  in the short time scale spectroscopic hydrodynamic and calorimetric experiments were compatible with a two state transition furthermore  g m and the midpoint urea concentration obtained from equilibrium experiments were compatible with those obtained from kinetic experiments since fibril formation is a slow process samples were also incubated for longer times after incubation for several hours at    c spectroscopic hydrodynamic and calorimetric experiments revealed the presence of a partially unfolded off pathway intermediate around the midpoint urea concentration       m urea  in vitro fibrillogenesis assays show that the maximum growth rate for fibril formation and the minimum lag time were obtained at urea concentrations where the partially unfolded state was populated    m urea at    c  this indicates that this partially unfolded state is critical for in vitro fibril formation concentration dependent kinetics and hydrodynamic properties of the intermediate were consistent with a soluble oligomeric state the intermediate is formed around the midpoint urea concentration where the native and unfolded states are equally populated and their rate of interconversion is the slowest this situation may promote the slow accumulation of an intermediate state that is prone to aggregate
