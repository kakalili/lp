o glcnacylation in cancer biology linking metabolism and signaling
the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway hbp is highly dependent on multiple metabolic nutrients including glucose glutamine and acetyl coa increased flux through hbp leads to elevated post translational addition of  d n acetylglucosamine sugars to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins increased total o glcnacylation is emerging as a general characteristic of cancer cells and recent studies suggest that o glcnacylation is a central communicator of nutritional status to control key signaling and metabolic pathways that regulate multiple cancer cell phenotypes this review summarizes our current understanding of changes of o glcnac cycling enzymes in cancer the role of o glcnacylation in tumorigenesis and the current challenges in targeting this pathway therapeutically
