the crystal structure of the human titin obscurin complex reveals a conserved yet specific muscle m band zipper module
m  is the most c terminal immunoglobulin ig domain of the giant protein titin and a frequent target of disease linked mutations currently it is the only known muscle ig domain able to interact with two alternative ligands  obscurin and obscurin like  obsl   in different sarcomeric subregions obscurin and obsl use their homologous n terminal ig domain o in obscurin and ol in obsl  to bind m  in a mutually exclusive manner we present here the x ray structure of the human titin obscurin m  o complex extending our previous work on the m  ol interaction similar to m  ol  the m  o complex displays a chevron shaped antiparallel ig  ig architecture held together by a conserved molecular interface which we validated by isothermal titration calorimetry and sorting experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes o  although structurally related to ol and m  both members of the intermediate set i set ig family presents an intriguing switch of its  a  strand this leads to structural differences between the complexes particularly for the  open side  of the chevron shaped assembly a bioinformatics analysis reveals that the  a  switch observed for o is rare and that it is involved in mediating protein  protein interactions molecular dynamics simulations also suggest that this topological alteration substantially increases local flexibility compared to the conventional i set ig domains the o ol ig domains are candidate discriminatory structural modules potentially directing the binding of specific additional partners at the m band cellular sorting experiments in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes are consistent with the view that the titin obscurin obsl complexes might be a platform for higher order interactions
