Retroviruses harbour a diploid genome of two plus-strand RNAs linked non-covalently at the dimer linkage structure. Co-packaging of two parental RNAs is a prerequisite for recombination in retroviruses, but formation of heterodimers has not been demonstrated directly in vivo. Here, we explore elements in Harvey sarcoma virus (HaSV) RNA involved in homodimerization and heterodimerization with RNA of Moloney (Mo) and Akv murine leukemia viruses (MLV).By an in vitro assay, we found that HaSV dimerization specificity could be modulated by mutations in a decanucleotide palindrome (Pal) probably folded into a kissing-loop. Autocomplementary and non-autocomplementary sequences introduced into the putative loop directed the specificity towards formation of homodimers and heterodimers, respectively. Two stem-loop (SL) structures, both exposing a GACG tetraloop, enhanced the formation of stable HaSV dimers.A similar decanucleotide palindrome has been implicated in homodimerization of MLVs. Heterodimers between HaSV RNA and Mo- or Akv MLV were unstable, but could be stabilized by introduction of two point mutations in the putative HaSV kissing-loop, creating exact complementarity with Mo/Akv MLV palindromes. Moreover, such changes increased the HaSV RNA affinity for the two MLV RNAs. Similar to HaSV RNA homodimers, formation of heterodimers with Mo- or Akv MLV RNAs was induced by the presence of GACG loops.On the basis of these results, we propose that palindromic sequences act as variable determinants of specificity and GACG tetraloops as conserved determinants in the formation of homodimers and heterodimers of Î³-retrovirus retroviral RNAs in vivo. The complementarity of loop sequences in the packaging signal upstream of the GACG tetraloops might therefore determine homo- and heterodimerization specificity and recombination activity of these viruses.
