maximizing detergent stability and functional expression of a gpcr by exhaustive recombination and evolution
to identify structural features in a g  protein  coupled receptor gpcr crucial for biosynthesis stability in the membrane and stability in detergent micelles we developed an evolutionary approach using expression in the inner membrane of escherichia coli from the analysis of     sequences of the rat neurotensin receptor  in which every amino acid had been varied to all  codons we uncovered several  shift  positions where the selected population focuses on a residue different from wild type here we employed in vitro dna recombination and a comprehensive synthetic binary library made by the slonomics  technology allowing us to uncover additive and synergistic effects in the structure that maximize both detergent stability and functional expression we identified variants with gt    functional molecules per e coli cell a  fold increase over wild type and observed strong coevolution of detergent stability we arrived at receptor variants highly stable in short chain detergents much more so than those found by alanine scanning on the same receptor these evolved gpcrs continue to be able to signal through the g  protein we discuss the structural reasons for these improvements achieved through directed evolution
