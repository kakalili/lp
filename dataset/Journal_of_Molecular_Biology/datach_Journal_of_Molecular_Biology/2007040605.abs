interactions responsible for secondary structure formation during folding of equine  lactoglobulin
equine  lactoglobulin forms a compact intermediate at an acidic ph a state  it also forms an expanded and helical conformation at low temperatures c state  the structure of a single disulfide mutant c a c  a is similar to the a state in the presence of salts while it is similar to the c state at low anion concentrations we have investigated the temperature dependent change in the secondary structure using circular dichroism and proline scanning mutagenesis at low anion concentrations the helical content increased linearly as temperature decreased in the presence of salts the a state was cooperatively transformed into the c state at low temperatures this suggests the importance of hydrophobic interactions for stabilizing the a state peptides encompassing native like and non native  helices were synthesized to investigate the interactions responsible for helix formation in the a and c states these did not form stable helices indicating that not only the helices in the a state but also the helices in the c state are stabilized by long range interactions a longer fragment chibl which encompasses the structured region in the a and c states showed a helical structure proline substituted mutants of chibl showed cd spectral changes similar to the corresponding mutants of the full length protein in the c state therefore chibl has a structure similar to the corresponding region of the full length protein in the c state this result indicates that interactions responsible for helix formation in the c state reside in the sequence of chibl and that the sequences outside chibl are essential for secondary structure formation in the a state
