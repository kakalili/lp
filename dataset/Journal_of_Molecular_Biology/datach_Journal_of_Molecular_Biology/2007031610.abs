structural basis of the transition state stabilization in antibody catalyzed hydrolysis
the catalytic antibody d  which was raised against a transition state analogue tsa  catalyzes the hydrolysis of a non bioactive chloramphenicol monoester to generate chloramphenicol it has been shown that d utilizes the binding affinity in the catalysis the differential affinity of the tsa relative to the substrate is equal to the rate enhancement to reveal the recognition mechanism of d for the tsa and the substrate we performed nmr analysis of the fv fragment of d  d fv  together with site directed mutagenesis and stopped flow kinetic analyses among six d fv mutants y  h a and w  i h a displayed significant reductions in their affinities to the tsa while their substrate binding affinities were identical with that of the wild type d fv the stopped flow kinetic studies revealed that the tsa binding to d fv occurred by an induced fit mechanism in contrast no induced fit type of tsa binding mechanism was observed for y  h a and w  i h a from nmr experiments we identified the residues with chemical shifts that were perturbed by the ligand binding the residues affected by the tsa binding were located on the tsa binding site determined by the x ray study and on the regions far from the binding site on the other hand the residues affected by the substrate binding were localized on the tsa binding site as for w  i h a no residue other than those in the binding site was affected by the ligand binding on the basis of these results and the crystal structure we concluded that the tsa binding induced a conformational change involving the formation of aromatic  aromatic interactions and a hydrogen bond these interactions can account for the differential affinity for the tsa relative to the substrate w  i h probably plays an important role in inducing the conformational changes the present nmr studies have enabled us to visualize the concept of transition state stabilization in enzymatic catalysis in which the transition state contacts are better than those of the substrate
