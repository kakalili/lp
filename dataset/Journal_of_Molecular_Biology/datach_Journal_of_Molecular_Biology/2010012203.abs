semi rigid solution structures of heparin by constrained x ray scattering modelling new insight into heparin  protein complexes
the anionic polysaccharides heparin and heparan sulphate play essential roles in the regulation of many physiological processes heparin is often used as an analogue for heparan sulphate despite knowledge of an nmr solution structure and  crystal structures of heparin  protein complexes for short heparin fragments no structures for larger heparin fragments have been reported up to now here we show that solution structures for six purified heparin fragments dp  dp  where dp stands for degree of polymerisation can be determined by a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation synchrotron x ray scattering and constrained modelling analytical ultracentrifugation velocity data for dp  dp  showed sedimentation coefficients that increased linearly from    s to    s with size x ray scattering of dp  dp  gave radii of gyration rg that ranged from    nm to    nm and maximum lengths that ranged from   nm to    nm the higher resolution of x ray scattering revealed an increased bending of heparin with increased size constrained molecular modelling of   randomised heparin conformers resulted in    best fit structures for each of dp  dp  dp  and dp  that indicated flexibility and the presence of short linear segments in mildly bent structures comparisons of these solution structures with crystal structures of heparin  protein complexes revealed similar ranges of phi   and psi   angles between iduronate and glucosamine rings we conclude that heparin in solution has a semi rigid and extended conformation that is preformed for its optimal binding to protein targets without major conformational changes
