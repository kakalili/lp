three dimensional structure of a monomeric form of a retroviral protease
the assembly of mason pfizer monkey virus gag polyproteins into immature capsids and their cleavage by the encoded protease are temporally and spatially separated processes making the virus a particularly useful model for investigation of protease activation here we present a high resolution nmr structure of a fully folded monomer of a  kda m pmv protease wt  pr and of a cys ala asp asn cys  ala mutant   prd n c a c  a  the overall structures of both wt  pr and  prd n c a c  a follow the conservative structural motif of other retroviral proteases the most prominent difference from the canonical fold of retroviral proteases is the absence of the interfacial  sheet which leads to the loss of the principal force stabilizing the dimer of m pmv pr the monomer  dimer equilibrium can be shifted in favor of the dimer by adding a substrate or an inhibitor partially compensating for the missing role of the  sheet we also show that cysteines c and c  play a crucial role in stabilizing the dimer and consequently increasing the proteolytic activity of m pmv pr this is consistent with the role of reversible oxidative modification of the cysteine residues in the regulation of the maturation of assembled m pmv capsids in the cytoplasm
