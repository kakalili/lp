parallel channels and rate limiting steps in complex protein folding reactions prolyl isomerization and the alpha subunit of trp synthase a tim barrel protein
a kinetic folding mechanism for the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts from escherichia coli involving four parallel channels with multiple native intermediate and unfolded forms has recently been proposed the hypothesis that cis trans isomerization of several xaa pro peptide bonds is the source of the multiple folding channels was tested by measuring the sensitivity of the three rate limiting phases         to catalysis by cyclophilin a peptidyl prolyl isomerase although the absence of catalysis for the   fast phase leaves its assignment ambiguous our previous mutational analysis demonstrated its connection to the unique cis peptide bond preceding proline   the acceleration of the   medium and   slow refolding phases by cyclophilin demonstrated that cis trans prolyl isomerization is also the source of these phases a collection of proline mutants which covered all of the remaining  trans proline residues of  ts was constructed to obtain specific assignments for these phases almost all of the mutant proteins retained the complex equilibrium and kinetic folding properties of wild type  ts only the p  a p  g and p  a mutations caused significant changes in the equilibrium free energy surface both the p a and p a mutations selectively eliminated the   folding phase while the p  m and p  a mutations eliminated the   and   folding phases respectively the redundant assignment of the   phase to pro  pro  and pro  may reflect their mutual interactions in non random structure in the unfolded state the non native cis isomers for pro  and pro  may destabilize an autonomous c terminal folding unit thereby giving rise to kinetically distinct unfolded forms the nature of the preceding amino acid the solvent exposure or the participation in specific elements of secondary structure in the native state in general are not determinative of the proline residues whose isomerization reactions can limit folding
