interaction of calmodulin with l selectin at the membrane interface implication on the regulation of l selectin shedding
the calmodulin cam hypothesis of ectodomain shedding stipulates that cam an intracellular ca  dependent regulatory protein associates with the cytoplasmic domain of l selectin to regulate ectodomain shedding of l selectin on the other side of the plasma membrane to understand the underlying molecular mechanism we have characterized the interactions of cam with two peptides derived from human l selectin the peptide arr  corresponds to the entire cytoplasmic domain of l selectin residues ala   tyr  in the mature protein  and cls corresponds to residues lys   tyr   which contains the entire transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of l selectin monitoring the interaction by fluorescence spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques we found that cam can bind to arr  in aqueous solutions or the l selectin cytoplasmic domain of cls reconstituted in the phosphatidylcholine bilayer both with an affinity of approximately   m the association is calcium independent and dynamic and involves both lobes of cam in a phospholipid bilayer the positively charged l selectin cytoplasmic domain of cls is associated with anionic phosphatidylserine ps lipids at the membrane interface through electrostatic interactions under conditions where the ps content mimics that in the inner leaflet of the cell plasma membrane the interaction between cam and cls becomes undetectable these results suggest that the association of cam with l selectin in the cell can be influenced by the membrane bilayer and that anionic lipids may modulate ectodomain shedding of transmembrane receptors
