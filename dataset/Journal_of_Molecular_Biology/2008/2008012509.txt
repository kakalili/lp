Archaea, constituting a third domain of life between Eubacteria and Eukarya, characteristically inhabit extreme environments. They swim by rotating flagellar filaments that are phenomenologically and functionally similar to those of eubacteria. However, biochemical, genetic and structural evidence has pointed to significant differences but even greater similarity to eubacterial type IV pili. Here we determined the three-dimensional symmetry and structure of the flagellar filament of the acidothermophilic archaeabacterium Sulfolobus shibatae B12 using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Processing of the cryo-negatively stained filaments included analysis of their helical symmetry and subsequent single particle reconstruction. Two filament subunit packing arrangements were identified: one has helical symmetry, similar to that of the extreme halophile Halobacterium salinarum, with ten subunits per 5.3Â nm repeat and the other has helically arranged stacked disks with C3 symmetry and 12 subunits per repeat. The two structures are related by a slight twist. The S. shibatae filament has a larger diameter compared to that of H. salinarum, at the opposite end of the archaeabacterial phylogenetic spectrum, but the basic three-start symmetry and the size and arrangement of the core domain are conserved and the filament lacks a central channel. This similarity suggests a unique and common underlying symmetry for archaeabacterial flagellar filaments.
