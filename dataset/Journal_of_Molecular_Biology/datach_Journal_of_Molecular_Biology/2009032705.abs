the conformational properties of the glc man unit suggest conformational biasing within the chaperone assisted glycoprotein folding pathway
a major puzzle is are all glycoproteins routed through the er calnexin pathway irrespective of whether this is required for their correct folding calnexin recognizes the terminal glc    man  linkage formed by trimming of the glc    glc    glc    man  glc man unit in glc man glcnac  different conformations of this unit have been reported we have addressed this problem by studying the conformation of a series of n glycans i e glc manome glc man   glcnac and glc man glcnac using d nmr noesy roesy t roesy and residual dipolar coupling experiments in a range of solvents along with solution molecular dynamics simulations of glc manome our results show a single conformation for the glc    glc  and glc    glc  linkages and a major    and a minor    conformer for the glc    man  linkage modeling of the binding of glc man glcnac to calnexin suggests that it is the minor conformer that is recognized by calnexin this may be one of the mechanisms for controlling the rate of recruitment of proteins into the calnexin calreticulin chaperone system and enabling proteins that do not require such assistance for folding to bypass the system this is the first time evidence has been presented on glycoprotein folding that suggests the process may be optimized to balance the chaperone assisted and chaperone independent pathways
