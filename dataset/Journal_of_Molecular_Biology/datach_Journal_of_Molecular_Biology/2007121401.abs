pias proteins as repressors of oct function
the pou domain transcription factor oct plays essential functions in the maintenance of pluripotent embryonic and germ cells of mammals molecular mechanisms of oct action remain poorly understood to isolate modulators of oct activity we performed a yeast two hybrid screen with the oct pou domain as a bait and isolated piasy as an oct interacting protein oct and piasy interact in vivo via their pou domain and sap domain containing n terminus respectively piasy does not enhance oct sumoylation but acts as a potent inhibitor of oct mediated transcriptional activation sequestering oct protein from the vicinity of cajal bodies and splicing speckles to the nuclear periphery these modes of piasy action are uncoupled from its sumoylation activity other pias family members pias and pias  can also interact with oct in vivo and target oct to the nuclear periphery depending on cellular context we propose that oct inhibition mediated by this new class of transcriptional partners might be instrumental during mammalian development
