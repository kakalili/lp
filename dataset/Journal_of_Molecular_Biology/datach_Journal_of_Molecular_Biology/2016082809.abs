avoidance and subversion of eukaryotic homeostatic autophagy mechanisms by bacterial pathogens
autophagy is a conserved lysosomal recycling process which maintains cellular homeostasis during stress and starvation conditions by degrading and recycling proteins lipids and carbohydrates ultimately increasing nutrient availability in eukaryotes an additional function of autophagy termed xenophagy is to detect capture and destroy invading microorganisms such as viruses bacteria and protozoa providing autophagy with a role in innate immunity many intracellular pathogens have however developed mechanisms to avoid xenophagy and have evolved strategies to take advantage of select autophagic processes to undergo their intracellular life cycle this review article will discuss the molecular mechanisms used by the intracellular bacterial pathogens francisella spp and brucella spp to manipulate components of the autophagic pathway promoting cytosolic growth in the case of francisella spp and facilitating cellular egress and cell to cell spread in the case of brucella spp these examples highlight how successful highly infectious bacterial pathogens avoid or subvert host autophagy mechanisms normally employed to maintain eukaryotic homeostasis
