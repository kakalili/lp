structural transitions and thermodynamics of a glycine dependent riboswitch from vibrio cholerae
riboswitches are complex folded rna domains found in noncoding regions of mrna that regulate gene expression upon small molecule binding recently breaker and coworkers reported a tandem aptamer riboswitch vci ii that binds glycine cooperatively here we use hydroxyl radical footprinting and small angle x ray scattering saxs to study the conformations of this tandem aptamer as a function of mg  and glycine concentration we fit a simple three state thermodynamic model that describes the energetic coupling between magnesium induced folding and glycine binding furthermore we characterize the structural conformations of each of the three states in low salt with no magnesium present the vci ii construct has an extended overall conformation presumably representing unfolded structures addition of millimolar concentrations of mg  in the absence of glycine leads to a significant compaction and partial folding as judged by hydroxyl radical protections in the presence of millimolar mg  concentrations the tandem aptamer binds glycine cooperatively the glycine binding transition involves a further compaction additional tertiary packing interactions and further uptake of magnesium ions relative to the state in high mg  but no glycine employing density reconstruction algorithms we obtain low resolution  d structures for all three states from the saxs measurements these data provide a first glimpse into the structural conformations of the vci ii aptamer establish rigorous constraints for further modeling and provide a framework for future mechanistic studies
