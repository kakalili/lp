how do substrates enter and products exit the buried active site of cytochrome p  cam   random expulsion molecular dynamics investigation of ligand access channels and mechanisms edited by j thornton
cytochrome p  s form a ubiquitous protein family with functions including the synthesis and degradation of many physiologically important compounds and the degradation of xenobiotics cytochrome p  cam from pseudomonas putida has provided a paradigm for the structural understanding of cytochrome p  s however the mechanism by which camphor the natural substrate of cytochrome p  cam accesses the buried active site is a long standing puzzle while there is recent crystallographic and simulation evidence for opening of a substrate access channel in cytochrome p  bm  for cytochrome p  cam no such conformational changes have been observed either in different crystal structures or by standard molecular dynamics simulations here a novel simulation method random expulsion molecular dynamics is presented in which substrate exit channels from the buried active site are found by imposing an artificial randomly oriented force on the substrate in addition to the standard molecular dynamics force field the random expulsion molecular dynamics method was tested in simulations of the substrate bound structure of cytochrome p  bm  and then applied to complexes of cytochrome p  cam with different substrates and with product three pathways were identified one of which corresponds to a channel proposed earlier on the basis of crystallographic and site directed mutagenesis data exit via the water filled channel which was previously suggested to be a product exit channel was not observed the pathways obtained by the random expulsion molecular dynamics method match well with thermal motion pathways obtained by an analysis of crystallographic b factors in contrast to large backbone motions up to    observed in cytochrome p  bm  for the exit of palmitoleic acid passage of camphor through cytochrome p  cam only requires small backbone motions less than     in conjunction with side chain rotations concomitantly in almost all the exit trajectories salt links that have been proposed to act as ionic tethers between secondary structure elements of the protein are perturbed
