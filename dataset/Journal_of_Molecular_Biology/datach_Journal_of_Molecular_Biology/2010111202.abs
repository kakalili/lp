tail mediated collapse of hmgb is dynamic and occurs via differential binding of the acidic tail to the a and b domains
the architectural dna binding protein hmgb consists of two tandem hmg box domains joined by a basic linker to a c terminal acidic tail which negatively regulates hmgb  dna interactions by binding intramolecularly to the dna binding faces of both basic hmg boxes here we demonstrate using nmr chemical shift mapping at different salt concentrations that the tail has a higher affinity for the b box and that a box  tail interactions are preferentially disrupted previously we proposed a model in which the boxes are brought together in a collapsed tail mediated assembly which is in dynamic equilibrium with a more extended form small angle x ray scattering data are consistent with such a dynamic equilibrium between collapsed and extended structures and are best represented by an ensemble the ensembles contain a significantly higher proportion of collapsed structures when the tail is present  n nmr relaxation measurements show that full length hmgb has a significantly lower rate of rotational diffusion than the tail less protein consistent with the loss of independent domain motions in an assembled complex mapping studies using the paramagnetic spin label mtsl   oxyl     tetramethyl  pyrrolidin  yl methyl methanethiosulfonate placed at three locations in the tail confirm our previous findings that the tail binds to both boxes with some degree of specificity the end of the tail lies further from the body of the protein and is therefore potentially free to interact with other proteins mtsl labelling at a single site in the a domain c  causes detectable relaxation enhancements of b domain residues suggesting the existence of a  sandwich  like collapsed structure in which the tail enables the close approach of the basic domains these intramolecular interactions are presumably important for the dynamic association of hmgb with chromatin and provide a mechanism by which protein  protein interactions or posttranslational modifications might regulate the function of the protein at particular sites or at particular stages in the cell cycle
