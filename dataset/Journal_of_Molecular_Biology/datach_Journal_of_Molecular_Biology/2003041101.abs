classification of  families of secondary transport proteins into a single structural class using hydropathy profile analysis
a classification scheme for membrane proteins is proposed that clusters families of proteins into structural classes based on hydropathy profile analysis the averaged hydropathy profiles of protein families are taken as fingerprints of the d structure of the proteins and therefore are able to detect more distant evolutionary relationships than amino acid sequences a procedure was developed in which hydropathy profile analysis is used initially as a filter in a blast search of the ncbi protein database the strength of the procedure is demonstrated by the classification of  families of secondary transporters into a single structural class termed st   an exhaustive search of the database revealed that the  families contain   unique sequences the proteins are predominantly from prokaryotic origin and most of the characterized transporters in st  transport organic and inorganic anions and a smaller number are na h antiporters all modes of energy coupling symport antiport uniport are found in structural class st   the relevance of the classification for structure function prediction of uncharacterised transporters in the class is discussed
