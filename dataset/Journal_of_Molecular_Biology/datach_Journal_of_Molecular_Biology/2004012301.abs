mapping of unit boundaries of a protein exhaustive search for permissive sites for duplication by complementation analysis of random fragment libraries of tryptophan synthase  subunit
to identify peptide units that make up a single domain protein we searched for possible combinations of n and c fragments that exhibit functional complementation and attempted an exhaustive evaluation of peptide unit boundaries the tryptophan synthase  subunit was used as a model enzyme which has a single tim      barrel domain libraries comprising randomly digested n and c fragments were constructed and clones expressing enzymatic activity were selected by the ability to confer growth of the escherichia coli trpa mutant on a medium lacking tryptophan more than  clones were obtained and two cleavable positions were found on the loops after extra helix   and helix  half of the clones harbored n and c fragments having an overlap between two fragments the remaining clones harbored one fragment made by the fusion of n and c fragments with insertional sequence duplication mapping the frequency of occurrence of fragment overlap and insertional duplication showed significant peaks at two loops which coincide with the cleavable sites these results suggest that the boundaries of unit fragments are located at these positions and that bisection fragment overlap and insertion are all possible at the unit boundaries
