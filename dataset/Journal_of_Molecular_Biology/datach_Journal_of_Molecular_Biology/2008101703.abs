the affinity of ets  for dna is modulated by phosphorylation through transient interactions of an unstructured region
binding of the transcription factor ets  to dna is allosterically regulated by a serine rich region srr that modulates the dynamic character of the adjacent structured dna binding ets domain and its flanking autoinhibitory elements multi site phosphorylation of the flexible srr in response to ca  signaling mediates variable regulation of ets  dna binding affinity in this study we further investigated the mechanism of this regulation first thermal and urea denaturation experiments demonstrated that phosphorylation of the predominantly unstructured srr imparts enhanced thermodynamic stability on the well folded ets domain and its inhibitory module we next identified a minimal fragment residues      that exhibits both enhanced autoinhibition of ets  dna binding and allosteric reinforcement by phosphorylation to test for intramolecular interactions between the srr and the rest of the fragment that were not detectable by h h noe measurements paramagnetic relaxation enhancements were performed using cu  bound to the n terminal atcun motif increased relaxation detected for specific amide and methyl groups revealed a preferential interaction surface for the flexible srr extending from the inhibitory module to the dna binding interface phosphorylation enhanced the localization of the srr to this surface we therefore hypothesize that the positioning of the srr at the dna binding interface and its role in shifting ets  to an inhibited conformation are linked in particular transient interactions dampen the conformational flexibility of the ets domain and inhibitory module required for high affinity binding as well as possibly occlude the dna interaction site surprisingly the phosphorylation dependent effects were relatively insensitive to changes in ionic strength suggesting that electrostatic forces are not the dominant mechanism for mediating these interactions the results of this study highlight the role of flexibility and transient binding in the variable regulation of ets  activity
