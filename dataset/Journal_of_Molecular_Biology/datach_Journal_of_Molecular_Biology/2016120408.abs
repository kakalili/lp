a structural investigation into oct regulation by orphan nuclear receptors germ cell nuclear factor gcnf  and liver receptor homolog  lrh
oct is a transcription factor required for maintaining pluripotency and self renewal in stem cells prior to differentiation oct must be silenced to allow for the development of the three germ layers in the developing embryo this fine tuning is controlled by the nuclear receptors nrs  liver receptor homolog  lrh  and germ cell nuclear factor gcnf  liver receptor homolog  is responsible for driving the expression of oct where gcnf represses its expression upon differentiation both receptors bind to a dr motif located within the oct promoter here we present the first structure of mouse gcnf dna binding domain in complex with the oct dr  the overall structure revealed two molecules bound in a head to tail fashion on opposite sides of the dna additionally we solved the structure of the human lrh  dna binding domain bound to the same element we explore the structural elements that govern oct recognition by these two nrs
