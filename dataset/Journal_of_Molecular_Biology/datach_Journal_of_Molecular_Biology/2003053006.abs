can f rster resonance energy transfer measurements uniquely position troponin residues on the actin filament a case study in multiple acceptor fret
straightforward interpretation of f rster resonance energy transfer fret data in terms of the distance from donor labeled troponon tropomyosin tntm to acceptor labeled actin is complicated by the potential for energy transfer to acceptors on neighboring actin monomers cross transfer  calculations indicate that cross transfer can account for a substantial percentage of the total transfer efficiency in some cases this renders isolated fret data uninterpretable to overcome these limitations we have developed an analysis method that incorporates cross transfer and can in principle define the most probable in the  least squares  sense position of a tntm residue on the actin filament the technique analyzes data from four or more fret experiments using acceptors attached to different residues on actin we have used this method to specify the coordinates of skeletal troponin i stni residue   relative to the actin filament under mg  and ca  saturating conditions ca  activation causes the c terminus of the regulatory domain of tni to move away from the actin surface by    laterally along the actin surface toward actin subdomain  by     and azimuthally toward the actin inner domain by     this information is used to construct a low resolution structural model of thin filament activation
