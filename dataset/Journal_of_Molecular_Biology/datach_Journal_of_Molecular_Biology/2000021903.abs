bacteriophage t gene  helicase assembly protein binds replication fork dna the     resolution crystal structure reveals a novel  helical two domain fold edited by p e wright
the bacteriophage t gene  helicase assembly protein is required for recombination dependent dna replication which is the predominant mode of dna replication in the late stage of t infection t gene  helicase assembly protein accelerates the loading of the t gene  helicase during dna synthesis by the t replication system in vitro t gene  helicase assembly protein binds to both t gene  helicase and t gene  single stranded dna binding protein and to single and double stranded dna we show here that t gene  helicase assembly protein binds most tightly to fork dna substrates with either single or almost entirely double stranded arms our studies suggest that the helicase assembly protein is responsible for loading t gene  helicase specifically at replication forks and that its binding sites for each arm must hold more than six but not more than  nucleotides the     resolution crystal structure of the full length   residue monomeric t gene  helicase assembly protein reveals a novel  helical bundle fold with two domains of similar size surface residues are predominantly basic pi    with clusters of acidic residues but exposed hydrophobic residues suggest sites for potential contact with dna and with other protein molecules the n terminal domain has structural similarity to the double stranded dna binding domain of rat hmg a we propose a speculative model of how the t gene  helicase assembly protein might bind to fork dna based on the similarity to hmg  the location of the basic and hydrophobic regions and the site size of the fork arms needed for tight fork dna binding the fork binding model suggests putative binding sites for the t gene  single stranded dna binding protein and for the hexameric t gene  helicase assembly
