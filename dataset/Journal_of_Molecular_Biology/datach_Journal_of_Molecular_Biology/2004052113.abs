conformational properties of the iso  cytochrome c denatured state dependence on guanidine hydrochloride concentration
production of seven single surface histidine variants of yeast iso  cytochrome c allowed measurement of the apparent pka pka obs  for histidine heme loop formation for loops of nine to  amino acid residues under varying denaturing conditions  m to  m guanidine hydrochloride gdnhcl  a linear correlation between pka obs and the log of the loop size is expected for a random coil pka obs  klog n  where k is a scaling factor and n is the number of monomers in the loop for small loops of nine   and  monomers no dependence of pka obs on loop size was observed at any denaturant concentration indicating effects from chain stiffness for larger loops of       and  monomers the dependence of pka obs on log n was linear and the slope of that dependence decreased with increasing concentration of denaturant the scaling factor obtained at  m and  m gdnhcl for the larger loop sizes was      close to the value of    expected for a random coil with excluded volume however scaling factors obtained under less harsh denaturing conditions  m to   m gdnhcl deviated strongly from that expected for a random coil being in the range   to    the gdnhcl dependence of pka obs at each loop size was also evaluated to obtain denaturant m values short loops where chain stiffness dominates had similar m values of    kcal molm for larger loops m values decrease with increasing loop size indicating that less hydrophobic area is sequestered when larger loops form it is known that the earliest events in protein folding involve the formation of simple loops the data from these studies provide direct insight into the relative probability with which loops of different sizes will form as well as the factors which affect loop formation
