pH-induced conformational switching is essential for functioning of diphtheria toxin, which undergoes a membrane insertion/translocation transition triggered by endosomal acidification as a key step of cellular entry. In order to establish the sequence of molecular rearrangements and side-chain protonation accompanying the formation of the membrane-competent state of the toxin's translocation (T) domain, we have developed and applied an integrated approach that combines multiple techniques of computational chemistry [e.g., long-microsecond-range, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations; continuum electrostatics calculations; and thermodynamic integration (TI)] with several experimental techniques of fluorescence spectroscopy. TI calculations indicate that protonation of H257 causes the greatest destabilization of the native structure (6.9kcal/mol), which is consistent with our early mutagenesis results. Extensive equilibrium MD simulations with a combined length of over 8Î¼s demonstrate that histidine protonation, while not accompanied by the loss of structural compactness of the T-domain, nevertheless results in substantial molecular rearrangements characterized by the partial loss of secondary structure due to unfolding of helices TH1 and TH2 and the loss of close contact between the C- and N-terminal segments. The structural changes accompanying the formation of the membrane-competent state ensure an easier exposure of the internal hydrophobic hairpin formed by helices TH8 and TH9, in preparation for its subsequent transmembrane insertion.
