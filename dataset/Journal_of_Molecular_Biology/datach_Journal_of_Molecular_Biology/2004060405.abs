catalysis of proline directed protein phosphorylation by peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases
proline directed protein phosphorylation was shown to depend on the capacity of the targeted ser thr pro bond to exhibit conformational polymorphism the cis trans isomer specificity underlying erk catalyzed phosphate transfer leads to a complete discrimination of the cis ser thr pro conformer of oligopeptide substrates we investigated in vitro the erk catalyzed phosphorylation of aspergillus oryzae rnase t containing two ser pro bonds both of which share high stabilization energy in their respective native state conformation the cis ser  pro and the trans ser  pro moiety despite trans isomer specificity of erk  a doubly phosphorylated rnase t was found as the final reaction product similarly the rnase t s g p n and rnase t p v variants which retain the prolyl bond conformations of the rnase t wt were both monophosphorylated with a catalytic efficiency kcat km of   m  s   and   m  s   respectively however initial phosphorylation rates did not depend linearly on the erk concentration the phosphorylation rate of the resulting plateau region at high erk concentrations can be increased up to threefold for the rnase t p v variant in the presence of the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase cyclophilin   indicating a conformational interconversion as the rate limiting step in the catalyzed phosphate group transfer using peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases with different substrate specificity we identified a native state conformational equilibrium of the ser  pro bond with the minor trans ser  pro bond as the phosphorylation sensitive moiety this technique can therefore be used for a determination of the ratio and the interconversion rates of prolyl bond isomers in the native state of proteins
