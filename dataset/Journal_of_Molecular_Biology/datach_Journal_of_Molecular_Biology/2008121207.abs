structure of a   regulated nonflagellar virulence protein from campylobacter jejuni
campylobacter jejuni a gram negative motile bacterium is a leading cause of human gastrointestinal infections although the mechanism of c jejuni mediated enteritis appears to be multifactorial flagella play complex roles in the virulence of this human pathogen cj   is a recently identified virulence factor in c jejuni and is expressed by a   promoter that controls late genes in the flagellar regulon a cj   mutant strain is fully motile but significantly reduced in the invasion of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro here we report the crystal structure of the major structural domain of cj   which reveals a homodimeric  hot dog  fold architecture of note the characteristic hot dog fold has been found in various coenzyme a coa compound binding proteins with numerous oligomeric states structural comparison with other known hot dog fold proteins locates a putative binding site for an acyl coa compound in the cj   protein structure based site directed mutagenesis followed by invasion assays indicates that key residues in the putative binding site are indeed essential for the cj   virulence function suggesting a possible function of cj   as an acyl coa binding regulatory protein
