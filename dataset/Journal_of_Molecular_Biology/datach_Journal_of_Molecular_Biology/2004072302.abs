crystal structures of the adp and atp bound forms of the bacillus anti  factor spoiiab in complex with the anti anti  spoiiaa
cell type specific transcription during bacillus sporulation is established by  f the activity of which is controlled by a regulatory circuit involving the anti  factor and serine kinase spoiiab and the anti anti  spoiiaa when atp is present in the nucleotide binding site of spoiiab spoiiaa is phosphorylated followed by dissociation the nucleotide binding site of spoiiab is left bound to adp spoiiab adp can bind an unphosphorylated molecule of spoiiaa as a stable binding partner thus in this circuit spoiiaa plays a dual role as a substrate of the spoiiab kinase activity as well as a tight binding inhibitor crystal structures of both the pre phosphorylation complex and the inhibitory complex spoiiab atp and spoiiab adp bound to spoiiaa respectively have been determined the structural differences between the two forms are subtle and confined to interactions with the phosphoryl groups of the nucleotides the structures reveal details of the spoiiaa spoiiab interactions and how phosphorylated spoiiaa dissociates from spoiiab adp  finally the results confirm and expand upon the docking model for spoiiaa function as an anti anti  in releasing  f from spoiiab
