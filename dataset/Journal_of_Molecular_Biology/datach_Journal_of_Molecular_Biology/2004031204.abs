expansion of protein interaction maps by phage peptide display using mdm as a prototypical conformationally flexible target protein
expanding on the possible protein interaction partners in a biochemical pathway is one key molecular goal in the post genomic era phage peptide display is a versatile in vitro tool for mapping novel protein  protein interfaces and the advantage of this technique in expanding protein interaction maps is that in vitro manipulation of the bait protein conformational integrity can be controlled carefully phage peptide display was used to expand on the possible types of binding proteins for the conformationally responsive protein mdm  peptides enriched differ depending upon whether mdm is ligand free zinc bound or rna bound suggesting that mdm conformational changes alter the type of peptide ligands enriched classes of putative established mdm binding proteins identified by this technique included ubiquitin modifying enzymes f box proteins ub ligases ubc e  and apoptotic modifiers hsp  gas  apaf  p   of the many putative mdm proteins that could be examined the impact of hsp  on mdm activity was studied since hsp  has been linked with p  protein unfolding in human cancers zinc ions were required to reconstitute a stable mdm  hsp  protein complex zinc binding converted mdm from a monomer to an oligomer and activated mdm binding to its internal ring finger domain providing evidence for a conformational change in mdm protein when it binds zinc reconstitution of an hsp   mdm protein complex in vitro stimulated the unfolding of the p  tetramer a p  dna binding inhibitor purified from human cells that is capable of unfolding p  at ambient temperature in vitro contains co purifying pools of hsp  and mdm  these data highlight the utility of phage peptide display as a powerful in vitro method to identify regulatory proteins that bind to a conformationally flexible protein like mdm
