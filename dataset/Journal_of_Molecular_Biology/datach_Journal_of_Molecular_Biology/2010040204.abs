ribosomes lacking protein s  are defective in mrna binding and subunit association
the functional significance of ribosomal proteins is still relatively unclear here we examined the role of small subunit protein s  in translation using both in vivo and in vitro techniques by means of lambda red recombineering the rpst gene encoding s  was removed from the chromosome of salmonella enterica var typhimurium lt to produce a  s  strain that grew markedly slower than the wild type while maintaining a wild type rate of peptide elongation removal of s  conferred a significant reduction in growth rate that was eliminated upon expression of the rpst gene on a high copy number plasmid the in vitro phenotype of mutant ribosomes was investigated using a translation system composed of highly active purified components from escherichia coli deletion of s  conferred two types of initiation defects to the  s subunit  i a significant reduction in the rate of mrna binding and ii a drastic decrease in the yield of  s complexes caused by an impairment in association with the  s subunit both of these impairments were partially relieved by an extended incubation time with mrna fmet trnafmet and initiation factors indicating that absence of s  disturbs the structural integrity of  s subunits considering the topographical location of s  in complete  s subunits the molecular mechanism by which it affects mrna binding and subunit docking is not entirely obvious we speculate that its interaction with helix  of the  s ribosomal rna is crucial for optimal ribosome function
