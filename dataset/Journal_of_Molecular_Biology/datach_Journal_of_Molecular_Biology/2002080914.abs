a novel scoring function for predicting the conformations of tightly packed pairs of transmembrane  helices
pairs of helices in transmembrane tm proteins are often tightly packed we present a scoring function and a computational methodology for predicting the tertiary fold of a pair of  helices such that its chances of being tightly packed are maximized since the number of tm protein structures solved to date is small it seems unlikely that a reliable scoring function derived statistically from the known set of tm protein structures will be available in the near future we therefore constructed a scoring function based on the qualitative insights gained in the past two decades from the solved structures of tm and soluble proteins in brief we reward the formation of contacts between small amino acid residues such as gly cys and ser that are known to promote dimerization of helices and penalize the burial of large amino acid residues such as arg and trp as a case study we show that our method predicts the native structure of the tm homodimer glycophorin a gpa to be in essence at the global score optimum in addition by correlating our results with empirical point mutations on this homodimer we demonstrate that our method can be a helpful adjunct to mutation analysis we present a data set of canonical  helices from the solved structures of tm proteins and provide a set of programs for analyzing it http  ashtoret tau ac il sarel  from this data set we derived  helix pairs and conducted searches around their native states as a further test of our method approximately   of our predictions showed a reasonable fit rms deviation lt   with the native structures compared to the success rate of  expected by chance the search method we employ is less effective for helix pairs that are connected via short loops  lt  amino acid residues  indicating that short loops may play an important role in determining the conformation of  helices in tm proteins
