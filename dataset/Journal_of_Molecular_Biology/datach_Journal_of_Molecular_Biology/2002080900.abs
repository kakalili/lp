crystal structure of human renal dipeptidase involved in  lactam hydrolysis
human renal dipeptidase is a membrane bound glycoprotein hydrolyzing dipeptides and is involved in hydrolytic metabolism of penem and carbapenem  lactam antibiotics the crystal structures of the saccharide trimmed enzyme are determined as unliganded and inhibitor liganded forms they are informative for designing new antibiotics that are not hydrolyzed by this enzyme the active site in each of the     barrel subunits of the homodimeric molecule is composed of binuclear zinc ions bridged by the glu  side chain located at the bottom of the barrel and it faces toward the microvillar membrane of a kidney tubule a dipeptidyl moiety of the therapeutically used cilastatin inhibitor is fully accommodated in the active site pocket which is small enough for precise recognition of dipeptide substrates the barrel and active site architectures utilizing catalytic metal ions exhibit unexpected similarities to those of the murine adenosine deaminase and the catalytic domain of the bacterial urease
