ssa overexpression and pin  variants cure psi  by dilution of aggregates
several cellular chaperones have been shown to affect the propagation of the yeast prions psi   pin  and ure  ssa and ssa are hsp  family chaperones that generally cause pro psi  effects since dominant negative mutants of ssa or ssa cure psi  and overexpression of ssa enhances de novo psi  appearance and prevents curing by excess hsp   in contrast ssa was shown to have anti ure  effects since overexpression of ssa cures ure  here we show that excess ssa or ssa can also cure psi  this curing is enhanced in the presence of pin  during curing sup   gfp fluorescent aggregates get bigger and fewer in number which leads to their being diluted out during cell division a phenotype that was also observed during the curing of psi  by certain variants of pin  the sizes of the detergent resistant psi  prion oligomers increase during psi  curing by excess ssa  excess ssa likewise leads to an increase in oligomer sizes of low medium and very high pin  variants while these phenotypes are also caused by inhibition of hsp  or sis  the overexpression of ssa did not cause any change in hsp  or sis levels
