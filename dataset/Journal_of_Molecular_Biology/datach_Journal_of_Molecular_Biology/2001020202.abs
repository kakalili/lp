solution structure and dynamics of the single chain hepatitis c virus ns protease ns a cofactor complex edited by m f summers
the backbone assignments secondary structure topology and dynamics of the single chain hepatitis c virus ns protease ns a cofactor complex have been determined by nmr spectroscopy residues i  to s  of ns and the central three residues of the ns a cofactor were assigned and the secondary structure was verified for these residues in several x ray structures of ns a bound ns protease residues  to  are stabilized by crystal packing which allows for the formation of the a strand and   helix in solution these n terminal residues are largely unassigned and no evidence of a well structured a strand or   helix was detected noes between residues in the e f loop containing d  and the   helix containing h  together with the detection of a d  h  hydrogen bond indicate that in solution the catalytic triad d  h  s   of the protease is better ordered in the presence of the ns a cofactor this is consistent with the earlier crystallographic results and may explain the observed increase in catalytic activity of the enzyme due to ns a binding a model free analysis of our relaxation data indicates substantial exchange rates for residues v  d  which comprise the upper part of the n terminal  barrel a comparison of chemical shift differences between ns protease and the ns protease ns a complex shows extensive chemical shift changes for residues v  d  indicating that non local structural changes occur upon ns a binding to the ns protease that are propagated well beyond the protease cofactor interaction site this is consistent with crystallographic data that reveal large structural rearrangements of the strand and loop regions formed by residues v  d  as a result of ns a binding the coincidence of large exchange rates for the ns protease ns a complex with chemical shift differences due to ns a binding suggests that residues v  d  of the ns protease ns a complex are in slow exchange with a ns a free conformation of ns protease
