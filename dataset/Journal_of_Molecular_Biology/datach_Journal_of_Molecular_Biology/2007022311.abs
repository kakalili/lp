crystallographic study of the tetrabutylammonium block to the kcsa k channel
k channels play essential roles in regulating membrane excitability of many diverse cell types by selectively conducting k ions through their pores many diverse molecules can plug the pore and modulate the k current quaternary ammonium qa ions are a class of pore blockers that have been used for decades by biophysicists to probe the pore leading to important insights into the structure  function relation of k channels however many key aspects of the qa blocking mechanisms remain unclear to date and understanding these questions requires high resolution structural information here we address the question of whether intracellular qa blockade causes conformational changes of the k channel selectivity filter we have solved the structures of the kcsa k channel in complex with tetrabutylammonium tba and tetrabutylantimony tbsb under various ionic conditions our results demonstrate that binding of tba or tbsb causes no significant change in the kcsa structure at high concentrations of permeant ions we did observe the expected conformational change of the filter at low concentration of k  but this change appears to be independent of tba or tbsb blockade
