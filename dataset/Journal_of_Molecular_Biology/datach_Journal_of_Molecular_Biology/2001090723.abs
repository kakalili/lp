comparison of the denaturant induced unfolding of the bovine and human  lactalbumin molten globules edited by c r matthews
residue specific information on the urea induced unfolding of the molten globule state of bovine  lactalbumin bla has been obtained using nmr spectroscopy in agreement with previous studies on human  lactalbumin hla the unfolding process for bla has been found to be non cooperative both the  and  domains of the protein are substantially collapsed in the absence of denaturant but in both proteins the majority of the structure in the  domain unfolds prior to that in the  domain however in bla the protein unfolds completely in  m urea at   c whilst in hla a stable core region persists even under these extreme conditions previous studies on hla have identified eight residues that are crucial for the stability of the molten globule of these residues only three are conserved in the sequence of bla by taking into consideration the differences in inter residue contacts between the four  helices arising from these substitutions and the relative hydrophobicity of the helices in the two proteins we show that it is possible to rationalise the observed differences in the behaviour of the molten globule states of the two proteins taken together these results suggest that there may be a number of ways of stabilising a given protein fold and the specific manner that this is achieved for a particular protein is determined by details of its sequence
