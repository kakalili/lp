structures of human ccl  ccl  and ccl reveal molecular determinants for quaternary structures and sensitivity to insulin degrading enzyme
cc chemokine ligands ccls are  to  kda signaling proteins involved in diverse immune functions while ccls share similar tertiary structures oligomerization produces highly diverse quaternary structures that protect chemokines from proteolytic degradation and modulate their functions ccl  is closely related to ccl and ccl with respect to both protein sequence and genomic location yet ccl  has distinct biochemical and biophysical properties here we report a crystal structure of human ccl  and its oligomerization states in solution based on crystallographic and small angle x ray scattering analyses our data show that ccl  adopts an  helical conformation at its n terminus that weakens its dimerization explaining ccl  s preference for the monomeric state multiple contacts between monomers allow ccl  to reversibly form a unique open ended oligomer different from those of ccl  ccl  and ccl  furthermore these differences hinge on proline  which is conserved in ccl and ccl but is replaced by lysine in human ccl  our structural analyses suggest that a mutation of proline  to alanine stabilizes a type   turn at the n terminus of ccl to prevent dimerization but prevents dimers from making key contacts with each other in ccl  thus the p a mutation induces depolymerization of ccl and ccl by distinct mechanisms finally we used structural biochemical and functional analyses to unravel why insulin degrading enzyme degrades ccl and ccl but not ccl  our results elucidate the molecular basis for the oligomerization of three closely related cc chemokines and suggest how oligomerization shapes ccl chemokine function
