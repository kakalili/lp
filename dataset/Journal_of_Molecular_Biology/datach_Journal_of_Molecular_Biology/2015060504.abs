bimolecular fluorescence complementation bifc analysis advances and recent applications for genome wide interaction studies
complex protein networks are involved in nearly all cellular processes to uncover these vast networks of protein interactions various high throughput screening technologies have been developed over the last decade bimolecular fluorescence complementation bifc assay has been widely used to detect protein  protein interactions ppis in living cells this technique is based on the reconstitution of a fluorescent protein in vivo easy quantification of the bifc signals allows effective cell based high throughput screenings for protein binding partners and drugs that modulate ppis recently with the development of large screening libraries bifc has been effectively applied for genome wide ppi studies and has uncovered novel protein interactions providing new insight into protein functions in this review we describe the development of reagents and methods used for bifc based screens in yeast plants and mammalian cells we also discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these methods and highlight the application of bifc in large scale studies
