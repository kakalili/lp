a large domain swap in the virb  atpase of brucella suis leaves the hexameric assembly intact
virb  atpases are hexameric assemblies that power type iv secretion systems in bacteria the hexamer of brucella suis virb  bsb   like that of the helicobacter pylori virb  hp    consists of a double ring structure formed by the n terminal and c terminal domains of each monomer however the monomer differs dramatically from that of hp   by a large domain swap that leaves the hexameric assembly intact but profoundly alters the nucleotide binding site and the interface between subunits
