identification of substrate orienting and phosphorylation sites within tryptophan hydroxylase using homology based molecular modeling edited by f cohen
tryptophan hydroxylase tph is the initial and rate limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of serotonin the inherent instability of tph has prevented a crystallographic structure from being resolved for this reason multiple sequence alignment based molecular modeling was utilized to generate a full length model of human tph previously determined crystal coordinates of two highly homologous proteins phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase were used as templates analysis of the model aided rational mutagenesis studies to further dissect the regulation and catalysis of tph using rational site directed mutagenesis it was determined that tyr   y   within the active site of tph appears to be involved as a tryptophan substrate orienting residue the mutants y  a and y  l displayed reduced specific activity compared to wild type tph     residual activity  the km of tryptophan for the y  a    m and y  l    m mutant was significantly increased compared to wild type tph    m  in addition kinetic analyses were performed on wild type tph and a deletion construct that lacks the amino terminal autoregulatory sequence tph n    this sequence in phenylalanine hydroxylase residues  to   has previously been proposed to act as a steric regulator of substrate accessibility to the active site changes in the steady state kinetics for tetrahydrobiopterin bh  and tryptophan for tph n   were not observed finally it was demonstrated that both ser  and ser  are substrates for ca  calmodulin dependent protein kinase ii additional analysis of this model will aid in deciphering the regulation and substrate specificity of tph as well as providing a basis to understand as yet to be identified polymorphisms
