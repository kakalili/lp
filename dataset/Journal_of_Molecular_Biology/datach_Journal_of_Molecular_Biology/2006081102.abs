rna recognition and cleavage by the sars coronavirus endoribonuclease
the emerging disease sars is caused by a novel coronavirus that encodes several unusual rna processing enzymes including non structural protein   nsp   a hexameric endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves at uridine residues    how nsp  recognizes and cleaves rna is not well understood and is the subject of this study based on the analysis of rna products separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis nsp  has been reported to cleave both   and   of the uridine   we used several rnas including some with nucleotide analogs and mass spectrometry to determine that nsp  cleaves only   of the recognition uridylate with some cleavage   of cytidylate a highly conserved rna structure in the   non translated region of the sars virus was cleaved preferentially at one of the unpaired uridylate bases demonstrating that both rna structure and base pairing can affect cleavage by nsp  several modified rnas that are not cleaved by nsp  can bind nsp  as competitive inhibitors the rna binding affinity of nsp  increased with the content of uridylate in substrate rna and the co factor mn  the hexameric form of nsp  was found to bind rna in solution a two dimensional crystal of nsp  in complex with rna showed that at least two rna molecules could be bound per hexamer furthermore an     structure of nsp  was developed using cyroelectron microscopy allowing us to generate a model of the nsp  rna complex
