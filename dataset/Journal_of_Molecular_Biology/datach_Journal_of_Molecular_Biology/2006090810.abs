gain of function in an erv alr sulfhydryl oxidase by molecular engineering of the shuttle disulfide
the erv alr sulfhydryl oxidase domain is a versatile module adapted for catalysis of disulfide bond formation in various organelles and biological settings its four helix bundle structure juxtaposes a cys x x cys dithiol disulfide motif with a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide fad cofactor enabling transfer of electrons from thiol substrates to non thiol electron acceptors erv alr family members contain an additional di cysteine motif outside the four helix bundle core although the location and context of this  shuttle  disulfide differs among family members it is proposed to perform the same basic function of mediating electron transfer from substrate to the enzyme active site we have determined by x ray crystallography the structure of aterv  an erv alr enzyme that contains a cys x cys shuttle disulfide and oxidizes thioredoxin in vitro and compared it to scerv  which has a cys x cys shuttle and does not oxidize thioredoxin at an appreciable rate the aterv shuttle disulfide is in a region of the structure that is disordered and thus apparently mobile and exposed this feature may facilitate access of protein substrates to the shuttle disulfide to test whether the shuttle disulfide region is modular and can confer on other enzymes oxidase activity toward new substrates we generated chimeric enzyme variants combining shuttle disulfide and core elements from aterv and scerv and monitored oxidation of thioredoxin by the chimeras we found that the aterv shuttle disulfide region could indeed confer thioredoxin oxidase activity on the scerv core remarkably various chimeras containing the scerv cys x cys shuttle disulfide were found to function efficiently as well since neither the scerv core nor the cys x cys motif is therefore incapable of participating in oxidation of thioredoxin we conclude that wild type scerv has evolved to repress activity on substrates of this type perhaps in favor of a different as yet unknown substrate
