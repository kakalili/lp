binding of the epstein barr virus major envelope glycoprotein gp  results in the upregulation of the tnf  gene expression in monocytic cells via nf  b involving pkc pi k and tyrosine kinases edited by j karn
epstein barr virus ebv is a human herpesvirus that interacts with various immunocompetent cells that carry the ebv receptor cd  cr  ebv binds to cr through its major envelope glycoprotein   gp   previously we had demonstrated that ebv and other human herpesviruses are capable of modulating cytokine synthesis through the deregulated expression of cytokine genes interleukin  il   interleukin  il   tumor necrosis factor   tnf   and interleukin  il   here we show that in contrast to infectious ebv purified recombinant gp  upregulates tnf  gene expression in human monocyte macrophages m m as well as in a monocytoid cell line u   our results also demonstrate that this increased expression is due to both enhanced transcription and stability of tnf  mrna in gp  treated cells the specificity of this effect is evidenced by the fact that pre incubation of cells with anti cr monoclonal antibody okb  which blocks binding of gp  to cr  inhibits the above mentioned effects of gp   furthermore we demonstrate that activation of tnf  by gp  is mediated by nf  b through signal transduction pathways involving pkc pi k and tyrosine kinases to our knowledge this is the first report describing the modulation of tnf  gene expression by the ebv gp  molecule following its interaction with the viral receptor cr on cells of the monocytic lineage
