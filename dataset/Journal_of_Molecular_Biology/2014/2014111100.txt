Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (cas) genes constitute the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea. Although the CRISPR-Cas systems have been hypothesized to encode potential toxins, no experimental data supporting the hypothesis are available in the literature. In this work, we provide the first experimental evidence for the presence of a toxin gene in the type I-A CRISPR system of hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus. csa5, under the control of its native promoter in a shuttle vector, could not be transformed into CRISPR-deficient mutant Sulfolobus solfataricus Sens1, demonstrating a strong toxicity in the cells. A single-amino-acid mutation destroying the intersubunit bridge of Csa5 attenuated the toxicity, indicative of the importance of Csa5 oligomerization for its toxicity. In line with the absence of Csa5 toxicity in S. solfataricus InF1 containing functional CRISPR systems, the expression of csa5 is repressed in InF1 cells. Induced from the arabinose promoter in Sens1 cells, Csa5 oligomers resistant to 1% SDS co-occur with chromosome degradation and cell death, reinforcing the connection between Csa5 oligomerization and its toxicity. Importantly, a rudivirus was shown to induce Csa5 expression and the formation of SDS-resistant Csa5 oligomers in Sulfolobus cells. This demonstrates that the derepression of csa5 and the subsequent Csa5 oligomerization take place in native virus-host systems. Thus, csa5 is likely to act as a suicide gene under certain circumstances to inhibit virus spreading.
