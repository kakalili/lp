the folding of an immunoglobulin like greek key protein is defined by a common core nucleus and regions constrained by topology edited by j karn
tnfn  the third fibronectin type iii domain of human tenascin is an immunoglobulin like protein that is a good model for experimental and theoretical analyses of greek key folding the third fibronectin type iii domain of human tenascin folds and unfolds in a two state fashion over a range of temperature and ph values and in the presence of stabilising salts here we present a high resolution protein engineering analysis of the single rate determining transition state the  mutations report on the contribution of side chains at  sites in the core and loop regions three areas in the protein exhibit high  values indicating that they are partially structured in the transition state first a common core ring of four positions in the central strands b c e and f that are in close contact form a nucleus of tertiary interactions the two other regions that appear well formed are the c  region and the e f loop the  values gradually decrease away from these regions such that the very ends of the two terminal strands a and g have  values of zero we propose a model for the folding of immunoglobulin like proteins in which the common core  ring  forms the nucleus for folding whilst the c  and e f regions are constrained by topology to pack early folding characteristics of a group of structurally related proteins appear to support this model
