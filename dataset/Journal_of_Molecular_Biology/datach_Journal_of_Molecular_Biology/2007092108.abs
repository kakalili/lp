residual structure backbone dynamics and interactions within the synuclein family
the human synuclein protein family includes  synuclein which has been linked to both familial and sporadic parkinson s disease and the highly homologous  and  synuclein mutations in  synuclein cause autosomal dominant early onset parkinson s and the protein is found deposited in a fibrillar form in hereditary and idiopathic forms of the disease no genetic link between  and  synuclein and any neurodegenerative disease has been established and it is generally considered that these proteins are not highly pathogenic in addition   and  synuclein are reported to aggregate less readily than  synuclein in vitro indeed   synuclein has been reported to protect against  synuclein aggregation in vitro as well as  synuclein mediated toxicity in vivo earlier we compared the structural properties of the highly helical states adopted by all three synucleins in association with detergent micelles in an attempt to delineate the basis for functional differences between the three proteins here we report a comparison of the structural and dynamic properties of the free states of all three proteins in order to shed light on differences that may help to explain their different propensities to aggregate which in turn may underlie their differing contributions to the etiology of parkinson s disease we find that  synuclein closely resembles  synuclein in its free state residual secondary structure consistent with the more similar propensities of the two proteins to aggregate in vitro   synuclein however differs significantly from  synuclein exhibiting a lower predisposition towards helical structure in the second half of its lipid binding domain and a higher preference for extended structures in its c terminal tail both  and  synuclein show less extensive transient long range structure than that observed in  synuclein these results raise questions regarding the role of secondary structure propensities and transient long range contacts in directing synuclein aggregation reactions
