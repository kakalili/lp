structure of h aca rnp protein nhp p reveals cis trans isomerization of a conserved proline at the rna and nop  binding interface
h aca small nucleolar and cajal body ribonucleoproteins rnps function in site specific pseudouridylation of eukaryotic rrna and snrna rrna processing and vertebrate telomerase biogenesis nhp  one of four essential protein components of eukaryotic h aca rnps forms a core trimer with the pseudouridylase cbf and nop  that binds to h aca rnas specifically crystal structures of archaeal h aca rnps have revealed how the protein components interact with each other and with the h aca rna however in place of nhp p archaeal h aca rnps contain l ae which binds specifically to an rna k loop motif absent from eukaryotic h aca rnps while nhp binds a broader range of rna structures we report solution nmr studies of saccharomyces cerevisiae nhp  nhp p  which reveal that nhp p exhibits two major conformations in solution due to cis trans isomerization of the evolutionarily conserved pro  the equivalent proline is in the cis conformation in all reported structures of l ae and other homologous proteins nhp p has the expected     fold but the solution structures of the major conformation of nhp p with trans pro  and of nhp p s w with cis pro  reveal that pro  cis trans isomerization affects the positions of numerous residues at the nop  and rna binding interface an s w substitution which stabilizes the cis conformation also stabilizes the association of nhp p with h aca snornps expressed in vivo we propose that pro  plays a key role in the assembly of the eukaryotic h aca rnp with the cis conformation locking in a stable cbf  nop   nhp ternary complex and positioning the protein backbone to interact with the h aca rna
