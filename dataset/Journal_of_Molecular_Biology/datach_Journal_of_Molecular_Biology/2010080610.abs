crystal structure of the dog lipocalin allergen can f  implications for cross reactivity to the cat allergen fel d
the dog lipocalin allergen can f  is an important cause of allergic sensitization in humans worldwide here the first crystal structure of recombinant rcan f  at     resolution displays a classical lipocalin fold with a conserved gly xaa trp motif in which trp  stabilizes the overall topology of the monomeric rcan f  phe  and tyr  localized on the l and l loops respectively control access to the highly hydrophobic calyx although the rcan f  calyx is nearly identical with the aero allergens mup  equ c  and a u from mouse horse and rat respectively no ige cross reactivity was found using sera from five mono sensitized subjects however clear ige cross reactivity was demonstrated between can f  and the cat allergen fel d  although they share less than   sequence identity this suggests a role for these allergens in co sensitization between cat and dog allergic patients
