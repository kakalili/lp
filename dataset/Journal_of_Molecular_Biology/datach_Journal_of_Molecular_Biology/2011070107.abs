expansion of type ii caax proteases reveals evolutionary origin of  secretase subunit aph
intramembrane proteases are responsible for a number of regulated proteolysis events occurring within or near the plasma and intracellular membranes members of one large and diverse family of putative intramembrane metalloproteases are widely distributed in all domains of life including the type ii caax prenyl proteases and their prokaryotic homologs with putative bacteriocin related functions we used sensitive sequence similarity searches to expand this large cpbp caax proteases and bacteriocin processing enzymes family to include more than   members and infer its homologous relationships to several other protein families including the prsw proteases the duf   duf domain of unknown function family and the  secretase subunit aph  proteins they share four predicted core transmembrane segments and possess similar yet distinct sets of sequence motifs remote similarity between aph  and membrane proteases sheds light on aph  s evolutionary origin and raises the possibility that aph  may possess proteolytic activity in the current or ancestral form of  secretase research highlights  the cpbp intramembrane proteases are widely distributed in all domains of life   cpbp prsw duf   and  secretase subunit aph  are distantly related   aph  may possess proteolytic activity in the extant or ancestral form of  secretase
