a fibrin specific monoclonal antibody from a designed phage display library inhibits clot formation and localizes to tumors in vivo
fibrin formation from fibrinogen is a rare process in the healthy organism but is a pathological feature of thrombotic events cancer and a wide range of inflammatory conditions we have designed and constructed an antibody phage display library containing  billion clones for the selective recognition of the n terminal peptide of fibrin alpha chain the key structural feature for selective fibrin binding was a k e mutation in the vh domain from this library an antibody was isolated termed ap  which recognizes the five n terminal amino acids of fibrin with high affinity kd  nm  but does not bind to fibrinogen the ap antibody could be expressed in various formats scfv small immune protein and igg and inhibited fibrin clot formation in a concentration dependent manner moreover the ap antibody stained the fibrin rich provisional stroma in solid tumors but did not exhibit any detectable staining toward normal tissues using a radioiodinated antibody preparation and quantitative biodistribution studies in tumor bearing mice ap was shown to selectively localize to fibrin rich f murine teratocarcinomas but not to skrc  human kidney cancer xenografts collectively the experiments indicate that the ap antibody recognizes fibrin in vitro and in vivo the antibody may facilitate the development of fibrin specific therapeutic agents
