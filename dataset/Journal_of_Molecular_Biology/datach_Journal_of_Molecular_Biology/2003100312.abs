solution structure of the bhrf protein from epstein barr virus a homolog of human bcl
the three dimensional structure of bhrf  the bcl  homolog from epstein barr virus ebv  has been determined by nmr spectroscopy although the overall structure is similar to other bcl  family members there are important structural differences unlike some of the other bcl  family members bhrf does not contain the prominent hydrophobic groove that mediates binding to pro apoptotic family members in addition in contrast to the anti apoptotic bcl  proteins bhrf does not bind tightly to peptides derived from the pro apoptotic proteins bak bax bik and bad the lack of an exposed pre formed binding groove in bhrf and the lack of significant binding to peptides derived from pro apoptotic family members that bind to other anti apoptotic family members suggest that the mechanism of the bhrf anti apoptotic activity does not parallel that of cellular bcl xl or bcl
