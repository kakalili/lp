formation of a stable oligomer of   microglobulin requires only transient encounter with cu ii
microglobulin   m is a small globular protein with high solubility under conditions comparable to human serum a complication of hemodialysis in renal failure patients is the deposition of unmodified  m as amyloid fibers in vitro exposure of  m to equimolar cu  under near physiological conditions can result in self association leading to amyloid fiber formation previously we have shown that the early steps in this process involve a catalyzed structural rearrangement followed by formation of discrete oligomers these oligomers however have a continued requirement for cu  while mature fibers are resistant to addition of metal chelate here we report that the transition from cu  dependent to chelate resistant states occurs in the context of small oligomers dimeric to hexameric in size these species require cu  to form but once generated do not need metal cation for stability importantly this transition occurs gradually over several days and the resulting oligomers are isolatable and kinetically stable on timescales exceeding weeks in addition formation is enhanced by levels of urea similar to those found in hemodialysis patients our results are consistent with our hypothesis that transient encounter of full length wild type  m with transition metal cation at the dialysis membrane interface is causal to dialysis related amyloidosis
