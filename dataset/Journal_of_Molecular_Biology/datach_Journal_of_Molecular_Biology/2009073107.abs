mechanism for attenuation of dna binding by marr family transcriptional regulators by small molecule ligands
members of the multiple antibiotic resistance regulator marr family control gene expression in a variety of metabolic processes in bacteria and archaea hypothetical uricase regulator hucr  which belongs to the ligand responsive branch of the marr family regulates uricase expression in deinococcus radiodurans by binding a shared promoter region between uricase and hucr genes we show here that hucr responds only to urate and to a lesser extent to xanthine by attenuated dna binding compared to other intermediates of purine degradation using molecular dynamics guided mutational analysis we identified the ligand binding site in hucr electrophoretic mobility shift assays and intrinsic trp fluorescence have identified w  from the n terminal helix and r  from helix  which serves as a scaffold for the dna recognition helix as being essential for ligand binding using structural data combined with in silico and in vitro analyses we propose a mechanism for the attenuation of dna binding in which a conformational change initiated by charge repulsion due to a bound ligand propagates to dna recognition helices this mechanism may apply generally to marr homologs that bind anionic phenolic ligands
