modulation of the antigenic peptide transporter tap by recombinant antibodies binding to the last five residues of tap
the transporter associated with antigen processing tap plays a pivotal role in the major histocompatibility complex mhc class i mediated immune response against infected or malignantly transformed cells it belongs to the atp binding cassette abc superfamily and consists of tap  abcb  and tap  abcb  each of which possesses a transmembrane and a nucleotide binding domain nbd  here we describe the generation of recombinant fv and fab antibody fragments to human tap from a hybridoma cell line expressing the tap specific monoclonal antibody mab    the epitope of the antibody was mapped to the very last five c terminal amino acid residues of tap on solid supported peptide arrays the recombinant antibody fragments were heterologously expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity from periplasmic extracts by affinity chromatography the monoclonal and recombinant antibodies bind with nanomolar affinity to the last five c terminal amino acid residues of tap as demonstrated by elisa and surface plasmon resonance strikingly the recombinant antibody fragments confer thermal stability to the heterodimeric tap complex at the same time tap is arrested in a peptide transport incompetent conformation although atp and peptide binding to tap are not affected based on our results we suggest that the c terminus of tap modulates tap function presumably as part of the dimer interface of the nbds
