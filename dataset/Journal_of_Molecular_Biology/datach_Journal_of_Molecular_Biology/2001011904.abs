pro sequence assisted folding and disulfide bond formation of human nerve growth factor   dedicated to rita levi montalcini  edited by r huber
nerve growth factor ngf is a member of the neurotrophin family these growth factors support neuronal survival and differentiation neurotrophins are synthesized as pre pro proteins whereas the pre sequences mediate secretion the function of the pro peptides is largely unknown to test the role of the pro sequence as a folding enhancer recombinant human pro ngf rh pro ngf was produced in escherichia coli the oxidative refolding of rh pro ngf and rh ngf was studied using electrospray mass spectrometry esims time course analysis this analysis permitted both the identification and quantification of intermediates present during the process the disulfide bonds formed at different times of the refolding processes were characterized by proteolytic digestion followed by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry maldims analysis folding yields and kinetics of rh pro ngf were significantly enhanced when compared to the in vitro refolding of mature rh ngf these results suggest that the pro sequence of ngf promotes folding of the mature part
