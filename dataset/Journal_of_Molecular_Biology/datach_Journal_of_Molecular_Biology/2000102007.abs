formation of nnos psd  pdz dimer requires a preformed  finger structure from the nnos pdz domain edited by m f summers
pdz domains are modular protein units that play important roles in organizing signal transduction complexes pdz domains mediate interactions with both c terminal peptide ligands and other pdz domains here we used pdz domains from neuronal nitric oxide synthase nnos and postsynaptic density protein   psd   to explore the mechanism for pdz dimer formation the nnos pdz domain terminates with a    residue amino acid  finger peptide that is shown to be required for nnos psd  pdz dimer formation in addition formation of the pdz dimer requires this  finger peptide to be physically anchored to the main body of the canonical nnos pdz domain a buried salt bridge between the  finger and the pdz domain induces and stabilizes the  hairpin structure of the nnos pdz domain in apo nnos the  finger peptide is partially flexible and adopts a transient  strand like structure that is stabilized upon pdz dimer formation the flexibility of the nos pdz  finger is likely to play a critical role in supporting the formation of nnos psd  complex the experimental data also suggest that nnos pdz and the second pdz domain of psd  form a  head to tail  dimer similar to the nnos syntrophin complex characterized by x ray crystallography
