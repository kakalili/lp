folding pathways of the tetrahymena ribozyme
like many structured rnas the tetrahymena group i intron ribozyme folds through multiple pathways and intermediates under standard conditions in vitro a small fraction reaches the native state n with kobs   min   while the remainder forms a long lived misfolded conformation m thought to differ in topology these alternative outcomes reflect a pathway that branches late in folding after disruption of a trapped intermediate itrap  here we use catalytic activity to probe the folding transitions from itrap to the native and misfolded states we show that mutations predicted to weaken the core helix p do not increase the rate of folding from itrap but they increase the fraction that reaches the native state rather than forming the misfolded state thus p is disrupted during folding to the native state but not to the misfolded state and p disruption occurs after the rate limiting step interestingly p strengthening mutants also increase native folding additional experiments show that these mutants are rapidly committed to folding to the native state although they reach the native state with approximately the same rate constant as the wild type ribozyme  min    thus the p strengthening mutants populate a distinct pathway that includes at least one intermediate but avoids the m state most likely because p and the correct topology are formed early our results highlight multiple pathways in rna folding and illustrate how kinetic competitions between rapid events can have long lasting effects because the  choice  is enforced by energy barriers that grow larger as folding progresses
