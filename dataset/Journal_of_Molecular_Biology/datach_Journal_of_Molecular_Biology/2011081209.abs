a eukaryotic like interaction of soluble cyanobacterial sensory rhodopsin transducer with dna
anabaena sensory rhodopsin is a recently discovered membrane photosensor with a unique signal transduction cascade it interacts with a soluble tetrameric transducer anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer asrt  that can bind to promoter regions of several genes related to the utilization of light energy even though the x ray crystal structure of asrt is available the mechanism of its interaction with dna is still unknown we used solution nmr to understand the mechanism of the dna binding both x ray crystal structures and solution nmr data reveal seven  strands forming a rigid scaffold   face and a flexible partially disordered  face comprised by the c termini and loops we found that the conformation of the  face in solution is very different from that in the crystals while the c termini of crystalline asrt are solvent exposed and either  helical or disordered about half of asrt monomers in solution feature buried c terminal  strand with another half of c tails being random coils titration of asrt with a   bp fragment of the pec operon promoter showed that only monomers with  structured c tails bind the dna nmr signals suggest that specific arg and asn gln residues are involved in the interaction with dna the dna binding occurs with micromolar affinity and a   stoichiometry dna asrt tetramer and results in a significant ordering of the  face involving the extension of the c terminal  strand and reorganization of the first loop such induced fit type of interaction which mainly utilizes loops between  strands and results in the increase in their order is typical for eukaryotic transcription factors of the immunoglobulin like fold
