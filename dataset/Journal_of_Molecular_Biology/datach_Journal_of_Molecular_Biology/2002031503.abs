the genome of bacteriophage  kz of pseudomonas aeruginosa edited by m gottesman
bacteriophage  kz is a giant virus that efficiently infects pseudomonas aeruginosa strains pathogenic to human and therefore it is attractive for phage therapy we present here the complete  kz genome sequence and a preliminary analysis of its genome structure the     bp genome is a linear circularly permutated and terminally redundant a t rich double stranded dna molecule the  kz dna has no detectable sequence homology to other viruses and microorganisms and it does not contain noti psti saci smai xhoi and xmaiii endonuclease restriction sites the genome has   open reading frames orfs varying in size from  to   amino acid residues according to the orientation of transcription orfs are apparently organized into clusters and most have a clockwise direction the  kz genome also encodes six trnas specific for met aug  asn aac  asp gac  leu tta  thr aca  and pro cca  a putative promoter sequence containing a tatattac block was identified most potential stem loop transcription terminators contain the tetranucleotide uucg loops some genes may be assigned as phage encoded rna polymerase subunits only   kz gene products exhibit similarity to proteins of known function from a diversity of organisms most of these conserved gene products such as dihydrofolate reductase ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase thymidylate synthase thymidylate kinase and deoxycytidine triphosphate deaminase are involved in nucleotide metabolism however no virus encoded dna polymerase dna replication associated proteins or single stranded dna binding protein were found based on amino acid homology and they may therefore be strongly divergent from known homologous proteins fifteen  kz gene products show homology to proteins of pathogenic organisms including mycobacterium tuberculosis haemophilus influenzae listeria sp rickettsia prowazakeri andvibrio choleraethat must be considered before using this phage as a therapeutic agent the  kz coat contains at least  polypeptides and several proteins are cleaved during virus assembly in a way similar to phage t  eleven  kz encoded polypeptides are related to proteins of other bacteriphages that infect a variety of hosts among these are four gene products that contain a putative intron encoded endonuclease harboring the h n h motif common to many double stranded dna phages these observations provide evidence that phages infecting diverse hosts have had access to a common genetic pool however limited homology on the dna and protein levels indicates that bacteriophage  kz represents an evolutionary distinctive branch of the myoviridaefamily
