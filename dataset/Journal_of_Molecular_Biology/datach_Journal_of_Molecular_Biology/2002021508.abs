multiple site specific infrared dichroism of cd   a transmembrane helix bundle edited by w baumeister
the structure of the transmembrane domain of cd   a component of the t cell receptor involved in signal transduction has been studied in its native state a lipid bilayer by multiple site specific infrared dichroism for the first time the transmembrane domain has been labelled at multiple positions along the sequence representing a total of  samples each labelled at a different residue with an isotopically modified carbonyl group  c   o a strategy is outlined that based on the above data can yield the rotational orientation and the local helix tilt for each labelled residue giving a detailed description of helix geometry the results obtained indicate that the transmembrane segment is in an  helical conformation throughout with an average helix tilt of    the n terminal side of the helix is more tilted than the c terminal in an accompanying paper we describe the implementation of the infrared data in a model building study of the cd   transmembrane complex the model obtained is entirely consistent with results based on evolutionary conservation data taken together this study represents the first step towards elucidation of the backbone structure of a transmembrane  helical bundle by infrared spectroscopy
