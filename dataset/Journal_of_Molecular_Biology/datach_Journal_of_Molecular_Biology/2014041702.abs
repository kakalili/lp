dimer  dimer interaction of the bacterial selenocysteine synthase sela promotes functional active site formation and catalytic specificity
the  st amino acid selenocysteine sec  is incorporated translationally into proteins and is synthesized on its specific trna trnasec  in bacteria the selenocysteine synthase sela converts ser trnasec formed by seryl trna synthetase to sec trnasec sela a member of the fold type i pyridoxal   phosphate dependent enzyme superfamily has an exceptional homodecameric quaternary structure with a molecular mass of about  kda our previously determined crystal structures of aquifex aeolicus sela complexed with trnasec revealed that the ring shaped decamer is composed of pentamerized sela dimers with two sela dimers arranged to collaboratively interact with one ser trnasec the sela catalytic site is close to the dimer  dimer interface but the significance of the dimer pentamerization in the catalytic site formation remained elusive in the present study we examined the quaternary interactions and demonstrated their importance for sela activity by systematic mutagenesis furthermore we determined the crystal structures of  depentamerized  sela variants with mutations at the dimer  dimer interface that prevent pentamerization these dimeric sela variants formed a distorted and inactivated catalytic site and confirmed that the pentamer interactions are essential for productive catalytic site formation intriguingly the conformation of the non functional active site of dimeric sela shares structural features with other fold type i pyridoxal   phosphate dependent enzymes with native dimer or tetramer dimer of dimers quaternary structures
