structure of the small outer capsid protein soc a clamp for stabilizing capsids of t like phages
many viruses need to stabilize their capsid structure against dna pressure and for survival in hostile environments the  kda outer capsid protein soc of bacteriophage t  which stabilizes the virus attaches to the capsid during the final stage of maturation there are   soc molecules that act as a  glue  between neighboring hexameric capsomers forming a  cage  that stabilizes the t capsid against extremes of ph and temperature here we report a     resolution crystal structure of soc from the bacteriophage rb  a close relative of t  the rb  crystal structure and a homology model of t soc were fitted into the cryoelectron microscopy reconstruction of the t capsid this established the region of soc that interacts with the major capsid protein and suggested a mechanism verified by extensive mutational and biochemical studies for stabilization of the capsid in which the soc trimers act as clamps between neighboring capsomers the results demonstrate the factors involved in stabilizing not only the capsids of t like bacteriophages but also many other virus capsids
