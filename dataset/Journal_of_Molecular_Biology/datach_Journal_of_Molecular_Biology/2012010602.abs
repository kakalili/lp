yhiq is rsmj the methyltransferase responsible for methylation of g   in  s rrna of e coli
ten methyltransferases and one pseudouridine synthase are required for complete modification of the small ribosomal subunit in escherichia coli nine methyltransferases as well as the pseudouridine synthase are already known here we identify rsmj the last unknown methyltransferase required for methylation of m g   in  s ribosomal rna rrna  as the protein encoded by yhiq reverse transcription primer extension analysis reveals that rrna extracted from a yhiq deletion strain is not methylated at g   moreover methylation is restored upon gene complementation also purified recombinant yhiq specifically methylates  s subunits extracted from the deletion strain the absence of the yhiq gene leads to a cold sensitive phenotype based on these data we propose that the yhiq gene be renamed rsmj
