determination of a high precision structure of a novel protein linum usitatissimum trypsin inhibitor luti  using computer aided assignment of noesy cross peaks edited by r huben
the solution structure of a novel  residue proteinase inhibitor linum usitatissimum trypsin inhibitor luti  was determined using a method based on computer aided assignment of nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy noesy data the approach applied uses the program noah dyana for automatic assignment of noesy cross peaks calculations were carried out using two unassigned noesy peak lists and a set of determined dihedral angle restraints in addition hydrogen bonds involving amide protons were identified during calculations using geometrical criteria and values of hn temperature coefficients stereospecific assignment of  methylene protons was carried out using a standard procedure based on nuclear overhauser enhancement intensities and j  coupling constants further stereospecific assignment of methylene protons and diastereotopic methyl groups were established upon structure based method available in the program glomsa and chemical shift calculations the applied algorithm allowed us to assign   out of   peaks    derived from noesy spectra recorded in h o and h o the final experimental data input consisted of   interproton distance restraints   restraints for  hydrogen bonds   torsion angle restraints and  stereospecifically assigned methylene proton pairs and methyl groups the algorithm allowed the calculation of a high precision protein structure without the laborious manual assignment of noesy cross peaks for the  best conformers selected out of  refined ones in the program cns the calculated average pairwise rmsd values for residues  to  were     backbone atoms and     all heavy atoms  the three dimensional luti structure consists of a mixed parallel and antiparallel  sheet a single  helix and shows the fold of the potato  family of proteinase inhibitors compared to known structures of the family luti contains arg and trp residues at positions p   and p   respectively instead of two arg residues involved in the proteinase binding loop stabilization a consequence of the arg  trp substitution at p   is a slightly more compact conformation of the loop relative to the protein core
