partially unfolded forms and non two state folding of a  sandwich fha domain from arabidopsis receptor kinase associated protein phosphatase
fha domains adopt a  sandwich fold with  strands the first evidence of partially unfolded forms of a  sandwich is derived from native state hydrogen exchange nhx of the forkhead associated fha domain from kinase associated protein phosphatase from arabidopsis the folding kinetics of this fha domain indicate that ex behavior prevails at ph   in the chevron plot rollover in the folding arm and bends in the unfolding arm suggest folding intermediates nhx of this fha domain suggests a core of six most stable  strands and two loops characterized by rare global unfolding events flanking this stable core are  strands and recognition loops with less stability termed subglobal motifs these suggest partially unfolded forms near native intermediates with two levels of stability the spatial separation of the subglobal motifs on the flanks suggests possible parallelism in their folding as additional  strands align with the stable core of six strands intermediates may contribute to differences in stabilities and m values suggested by nhx or kinetics relative to chemical denaturation residual structure in the unfolded regime is suggested by superprotection of  strand  and by gdmcl dependence of adjustments in amide nmr spectra and residual optical signal the global folding stability depends strongly on ph with at least  kcal mol more stability at ph   than at ph   this fha domain is hypothesized to fold progressively with initial hydrophobic collapse of its stable six stranded core followed by addition of less stable flanking  strands and ordering of recognition loops
