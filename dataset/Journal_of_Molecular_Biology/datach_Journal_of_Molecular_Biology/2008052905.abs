crystal structure of the macpf domain of human complement protein c  in complex with the c  subunit
human c is one of five complement components c b c  c  c  and c  that assemble on bacterial membranes to form a porelike structure referred to as the  membrane attack complex   mac  c contains three genetically distinct subunits c   c   c   arranged as a disulfide linked c     dimer that is noncovalently associated with c   c  c c   c   and c are homologous all contain n and c terminal modules and an intervening  kda segment referred to as the membrane attack complex perforin macpf domain the c  subunit is unrelated and belongs to the lipocalin family of proteins that display a  barrel fold and generally bind small hydrophobic ligands several hundred proteins with macpf domains have been identified based on sequence similarity however the structure and function of most are unknown crystal structures of the secreted bacterial protein plu macpf and the human c  macpf domain were recently reported and both display a fold similar to those of the bacterial pore forming cholesterol dependent cytolysins cdcs  in the present study we determined the crystal structure of the human c  macpf domain disulfide linked to c    macpf   at     resolution the  macpf portion has the predicted cdc like fold and shows two regions of interaction with c   one is in a previously characterized  residue insertion indel in c  and fills the entrance to the putative c  ligand binding site the second is a hydrophobic pocket that makes contact with residues on the side of the c    barrel the latter interaction induces conformational changes in  macpf that are likely important for c function also observed is structural conservation of the macpf signature motif y w g t s h f y x g g in  macpf and plu macpf and conservation of several key glycine residues known to be important for refolding and pore formation by cdcs
