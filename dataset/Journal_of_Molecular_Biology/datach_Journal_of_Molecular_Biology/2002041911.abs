a   peptide assembly on lipid bilayers
one of the major pathological features of alzheimer s disease ad is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques that are composed predominantly of the amyloid  peptide a   diffuse plaques associated with ad are composed predominantly of a   whereas senile plaques contain both a   and a   recently it has been suggested that diffuse plaque formation is initiated as a plasma membrane bound a  species and that a   is the critical component in order to investigate this hypothesis we have examined a    membrane interactions using in situ atomic force microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy our studies demonstrate the association of a   with planar bilayers composed of total brain lipids which results initially in peptide aggregation and then fibre formation modulation of the cholesterol content is correlated with the extent of a   assembly on the bilayer surface although a   was not visualized directly on cholesterol depleted bilayers fluorescence anisotropy and fluorimetry demonstrate a   induced membrane changes our results demonstrate that the composition of the lipid bilayer governs the outcome of a  interactions
