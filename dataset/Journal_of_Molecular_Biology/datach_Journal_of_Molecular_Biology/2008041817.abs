b crystallin is a cytoplasmic interaction partner of the kidney specific cadherin
the ca  dependent membrane spanning classical cadherins bind directly to cytosolic catenins this cadherin  catenin interaction is known to be critical for the fundamental role of cadherins in cell  cell adhesion the small subfamily of the d cadherins however cannot interact with catenins due to their highly truncated cytoplasmic tail thus far no cytoplasmic interaction partner for the d cadherins has been described with the use of the cytoplasmic domain of the ksp kidney specific cadherin which belongs to the family of d cadherins as bait in affinity chromatography with human kidney lysates the small heat shock protein  b crystallin was identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization  time of flight analysis as a cytosolic binding partner of ksp cadherin this interaction was verified by co immunoprecipitation analysis with the use of overlapping peptides representing the entire  b crystallin molecule the n terminal part of  b crystallin which does not possess chaperone activity was identified as responsible for the binding to ksp cadherin this interaction was found to be specific since only the cytoplasmic domain of ksp cadherin but not li liver  intestine cadherin another member of the d cadherin family  interacted with  b crystallin in the human kidney both  b crystallin and ksp cadherin co localize to cells of the collecting duct they also co localize with the actin cytoskeleton and co precipitate with the latter these findings suggest that the interaction of ksp cadherin with  b crystallin is important for the connection of ksp cadherin to the cytoskeleton and thus for maintaining tissue integrity in the kidney
