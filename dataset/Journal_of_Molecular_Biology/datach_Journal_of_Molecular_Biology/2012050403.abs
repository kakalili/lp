solution structure of tt  a novel complement therapeutic agent provides insight into its joint binding to complement c b and c d
a novel therapeutic reagent tt  was designed to be effective in diseases of the alternative pathway of complement such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and other diseases tt  is constructed from the first four short complement regulator scr domains of complement receptor type  cr  that bind to complement c d followed by the first five scr domains of complement factor h that bind to complement c b in order to assess how tt  binds to c d and c b we determined the tt  solution structure by a combination of analytical ultracentrifugation x ray scattering and constrained modeling the sedimentation coefficients and radius of gyration of tt  were unaffected by citrate or phosphate buffered saline buffers and indicate an elongated monomeric structure with a sedimentation coefficient of   s and a radius of gyration rg of   nm molecular modeling starting from   randomized tt  conformations showed that high quality x ray curve fits were obtained with extended scr arrangements showing that tt  has a limited degree of inter scr flexibility in its solution structure the best fit tt  structural models are readily merged with the crystal structure of c b to show that the four cr domains extend freely into solution when the five complement factor h domains are bound within c b we reevaluated the solution structure of the cr  c d complex that confirmed its recent crystal structure this recent cr  c d crystal structure showed that tt  is able to interact readily with c d ligands in many orientations when tt  is bound to c b
