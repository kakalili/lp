structure of the antiviral assembly inhibitor cap  complex with the hiv  ca protein
the ca domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  gag polyprotein plays critical roles in both the early and late phases of viral replication and is therefore an attractive antiviral target compounds with antiviral activity were recently identified that bind to the n terminal domain of ca can and inhibit capsid assembly during viral maturation we have determined the structure of the complex between can and the antiviral assembly inhibitor n  chloro  methylphenyl n       dimethylamino methyl  furyl methyl sulfanyl ethyl urea  cap  using a combination of nmr spectroscopy and x ray crystallography the protein undergoes a remarkable conformational change upon cap  binding in which phe  is displaced from its buried position in the protein core to open a deep hydrophobic cavity that serves as the ligand binding site the aromatic ring of cap  inserts into the cavity with the urea nh groups forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of val  and the dimethylamonium group interacting with the side chains of glu  and glu  elements that could be exploited to improve binding affinity are apparent in the structure the displacement of phe  by cap  appears to be facilitated by a strained main chain conformation which suggests a potential role for a phe  conformational switch during normal capsid assembly
