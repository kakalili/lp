two functions of the c terminal domain of escherichia coli rob mediating  sequestration  dispersal  as a novel off  on switch for regulating rob  s activity as a transcription activator and preventing degradation of rob by lon protease
in escherichia coli rob activates transcription of the soxrs mara rob regulon previous work revealed that rob resides in three to four immunostainable foci that dipyridyl and bile salts are inducers of its activity and that inducers bind to rob s c terminal domain ctd  we propose that sequestration inactivates rob by blocking its access to the transcriptional machinery and that inducers activate rob by mediating its dispersal allowing interaction with rna polymerase to test  sequestration  dispersal  as a new mechanism for regulating the activity of transcriptional activators we fused rob s ctd to soxs and used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to determine the effect of inducers on soxs  rob s cellular localization unlike native soxs which is uniformly distributed throughout the cell soxs  rob is sequestered without an inducer but is rapidly dispersed when cells are treated with an inducer in this manner rob s ctd serves as an anti sigma factor in regulating the co sigma factor like activity of soxs when fused to it rob s ctd also protects its n terminus from lon protease since lon s normally rapid degradation of soxs is blocked in the chimera accordingly rob s ctd has novel regulatory properties that can be bestowed on another e coli protein
