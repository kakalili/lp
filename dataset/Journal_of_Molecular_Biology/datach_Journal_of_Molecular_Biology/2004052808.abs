sensor domain of the mycobacterium tuberculosis receptor ser thr protein kinase pknd forms a highly symmetric  propeller
diverse pathogenic bacteria produce transmembrane receptor ser thr protein kinases stpks  but little is known about the signals mediated by these  eukaryotic like  proteins to explore the basis for signaling in the bacterial stpk receptor family we determined the structure of the sensor domain of mycobacterium tuberculosis pknd in two crystal forms the pknd sensor domain forms a rigid six bladed  propeller with a flexible tether to the transmembrane domain the pknd sensor domain is the most symmetric  propeller structure described all residues that vary most among the blade subdomains cluster in the large  cup  motif analogous to the ligand binding surface in many  propeller proteins these results suggest that pknd binds a multivalent ligand that signals by changing the quaternary structure of the intracellular kinase domain
