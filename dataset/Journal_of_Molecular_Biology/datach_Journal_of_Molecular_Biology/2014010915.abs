the n terminal sequence of tyrosine hydroxylase is a conformationally versatile motif that binds    proteins and membranes
tyrosine hydroxylase th catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters and a reduction in th activity is associated with several neurological diseases human th is regulated among other mechanisms by ser  phosphorylation dependent interaction with    proteins the n terminal sequence residues     which corresponds to an extension to the th regulatory domain also interacts with negatively charged membranes by using x ray crystallography together with molecular dynamics simulations and structural bioinformatics analysis we have probed the conformations of the ser  phosphorylated n terminal peptide thp     bound to      free in solution and bound to a phospholipid bilayer and of the unphosphorylated peptide th    both free and bilayer bound as seen in the crystal structure of thp    complexed with      the region surrounding pser  adopts an extended conformation in the bound state whereas thp    adopts a bent conformation when free in solution with higher content of secondary structure and higher number of internal hydrogen bonds th    in solution presents the highest mobility and least defined structure of all forms studied and it shows an energetically more favorable interaction with membranes relative to thp     cationic residues notably arg  and arg  which are the recognition sites of the kinases phosphorylating at ser  are also contributing to the interaction with the membrane our results reveal the structural flexibility of this region of th in accordance with the functional versatility and conformational adaptation to different partners furthermore this structural information has potential relevance for the development of therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders through modulation of th  partner interactions
