comparison of fungal   s ribosomes by cryo em reveals diversity in structure and conformation of rrna expansion segments
compared to the prokaryotic   s ribosome the eukaryotic   s ribosome contains additional ribosomal proteins and extra segments of rrna referred to as rrna expansion segments es  these eukaryotic specific rrna es are mainly on the periphery of the   s ribosome as revealed by cryo electron microscopy cryo em studies but their precise function is not known to address the question of whether the rrna es are structurally conserved among   s ribosomes of different fungi we performed cryo electron microscopy on   s ribosomes from the thermophilic fungus thermomyces lanuginosus and compared it to the saccharomyces cerevisiae   s ribosome our analysis reveals general structural conservation of the rrna expansion segments but also changes in es  and es   as well as the absence of a tertiary interaction between es and es in t lanuginosus the differences provide a hint on the role of rrna es in regulating translation furthermore we show that the stalk region and interactions with elongation factor  eef  are different in t lanuginosus exhibiting a more extensive contact with domain i of eef
