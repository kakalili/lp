nmr model of prgi  sipd interaction and its implications in the needle tip assembly of the salmonella type iii secretion system
salmonella and other pathogenic bacteria use the type iii secretion system t ss to inject virulence proteins into human cells to initiate infections the structural component of the t ss contains a needle and a needle tip the needle is assembled from prgi needle protomers and the needle tip is capped with several copies of the sipd tip protein how a tip protein docks on the needle is unclear a crystal structure of a prgi  sipd fusion protein docked on the prgi needle results in steric clash of sipd at the needle tip when modeled on the recent atomic structure of the needle thus there is currently no good model of how sipd is docked on the prgi needle tip previously we showed by nmr paramagnetic relaxation enhancement pre methods that a specific region in the sipd coiled coil is the binding site for prgi others have hypothesized that a domain of the tip protein  the n terminal  helical hairpin  has to swing away during the assembly of the needle apparatus here we show by pre methods that a truncated form of sipd lacking the  helical hairpin domain binds more tightly to prgi further pre based structure calculations revealed multiple prgi binding sites on the sipd coiled coil our pre results together with the recent nmr derived atomic structure of the salmonella needle suggest a possible model of how sipd might dock at the prgi needle tip sipd and prgi are conserved in other bacterial t sss thus our results have wider implication in understanding other needle tip complexes
