the recognition domain of the bpuji restriction endonuclease in complex with cognate dna at    resolution
type iis restriction endonucleases recognize asymmetric dna sequences and cleave both dna strands at fixed positions downstream of the recognition site the restriction endonuclease bpuji recognizes the asymmetric sequence   cccgt however it cuts at multiple sites in the vicinity of the target sequence bpuji consists of two physically separate domains with catalytic and dimerization functions in the c terminal domain and dna recognition functions in the n terminal domain here we report the crystal structure of the bpuji recognition domain bound to cognate dna at    resolution this region folds into two winged helix subdomains d and d  interspaced by the dl subdomain the d and d subdomains of bpuji share structural similarity with the similar subdomains of the foki dna binding domain however their orientations in protein  dna complexes are different recognition of the   cccgt target sequence is achieved by bpuji through the major groove contacts of amino acid residues located on both the helix  turn  helix motifs and the n terminal arm the role of these interactions in dna recognition is also corroborated by mutational analysis
