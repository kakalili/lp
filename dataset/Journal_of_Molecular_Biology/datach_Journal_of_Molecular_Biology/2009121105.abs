bicarbonate mediated stimulation of rega the global virulence regulator from citrobacter rodentium
the global virulence regulatory protein rega an arac like regulator controls the expression of more than  genes in the mouse enteric pathogen citrobacter rodentium in the presence of bicarbonate rega activates the transcription of a number of virulence determinants and inhibits the expression of a series of housekeeping genes to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which bicarbonate stimulates rega activity we carried out biophysical and mutational analyses our data indicate that rega exists as a dimer in solution regardless of bicarbonate concentration a leucine zipper located in the region downstream of the n terminal domain is responsible for dimerisation the n terminal arm itself is involved in modulating the response to bicarbonate which appears to bind to a region comprising a series of  sheets within the n terminal domain the presence of bicarbonate relieves the autoinhibition of rega activity by its n terminal arm rega is the first example of a bacterial virulence regulator that utilises the light switch mechanism previously described for the escherichia coli arac protein to respond to a gut associated effector that controls its activity
