structure and regulatory mechanism of aquifex aeolicus ntrc  variability and evolution in bacterial transcriptional regulation
genetic changes lead gradually to altered protein function making deduction of the molecular basis for activity from a sequence difficult comparative studies provide insights into the functional consequences of specific changes here we present structural and biochemical studies of ntrc  a sigma  activator from aquifex aeolicus and compare it with ntrc  a paralog and ntrc a homolog from salmonella enterica to provide insight into how a substantial change in regulatory mechanism may have occurred activity assays show that assembly of ntrc s active oligomer is repressed by the n terminal receiver domain and that bef   addition mimicking phosphorylation removes this repression observation of assembly without activation for ntrc indicates that it is much less strongly repressed than ntrc  the crystal structure of the unactivated receiver  atpase domain combination shows a partially disrupted interface nmr structures of the regulatory domain show that its activation mechanism is very similar to that of ntrc  the crystal structure of the ntrc dna binding domain shows that it is dimeric and more similar in structure to ntrc than ntrc  electron microscope images of the atpase  dna binding domain combination show formation of oligomeric rings sequence alignments provide insights into the distribution of activation mechanisms in this family of proteins
