crystal structure of algq  a macromolecule alginate binding protein of sphingomonas sp a at    resolution edited by r huber
sphingomonas sp a possesses a high molecular mass average    da alginate uptake system mediated by a novel pit dependent abc transporter the x ray crystallographic structure of algq     da  an alginate binding protein in the system was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and refined at    resolution with a final r factor of    for  to    resolution data the refined structure of algq was comprised of   amino acid residues   water molecules and one calcium ion algq was composed of two globular domains with a deep cleft between them which is expected to be the alginate binding site the overall structure is basically similar to that of maltose maltodextrin binding protein except for the presence of an n subdomain the entire calcium ion binding site is similar to the site in the ef hand motif but comprises a ten residue loop this calcium ion binding site is about    away from the alginate binding site
