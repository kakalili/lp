computational design of selective peptides to discriminate between similar pdz domains in an oncogenic pathway
reagents that target protein  protein interactions to rewire signaling are of great relevance in biological research computational protein design may offer a means of creating such reagents on demand but methods for encoding targeting selectivity are sorely needed this is especially challenging when targeting interactions with ubiquitous recognition modules  for example pdz domains which bind c terminal sequences of partner proteins here we consider the problem of designing selective pdz inhibitor peptides in the context of an oncogenic signaling pathway in which two pdz domains nherf  pdz  n p and magi  pdz  m p  compete for a receptor c terminus to differentially modulate oncogenic activities because n p has been shown to increase tumorigenicity and m p to decreases it we sought to design peptides that inhibit n p without affecting m p  we developed a structure based computational design framework that models peptide flexibility in binding yet is efficient enough to rapidly analyze tradeoffs between affinity and selectivity designed peptides showed low micromolar inhibition constants for n p and no detectable m p binding peptides designed for reverse discrimination bound m p tighter than n p  further testing our technology experimental and computational analysis of selectivity determinants revealed significant indirect energetic coupling in the binding site successful discrimination between n p and m p  despite their overlapping binding preferences is highly encouraging for computational approaches to selective pdz targeting especially because design relied on a homology model of m p  still we demonstrate specific deficiencies of structural modeling that must be addressed to enable truly robust design the presented framework is general and can be applied in many scenarios to engineer selective targeting
