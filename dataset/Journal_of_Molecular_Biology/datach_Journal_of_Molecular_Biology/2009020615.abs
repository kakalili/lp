somatostatin a novel substrate and a modulator of insulin degrading enzyme activity
insulin degrading enzyme ide is an interesting pharmacological target for alzheimer s disease ad  since it hydrolyzes  amyloid producing non neurotoxic fragments it has also been shown that the somatostatin level reduction is a pathological feature of ad and that it regulates the neprilysin activity toward  amyloid in this work we report for the first time that ide is able to hydrolyze somatostatin kcat s           km m            at the phe  phe amino acid bond on the other hand somatostatin modulates ide activity enhancing the enzymatic cleavage of a novel fluorogenic  amyloid through a decrease of the km toward this substrate which corresponds to the     amino acid sequence of the a      circular dichroism spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance imaging experiments show that somatostatin binding to ide brings about a concentration dependent structural change of the secondary and tertiary structure s of the enzyme revealing two possible binding sites the higher affinity binding site disappears upon inactivation of ide by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid which chelates the catalytic zn  ion as a whole these features suggest that the modulatory effect is due to an allosteric mechanism somatostatin binding to the active site of one ide subunit where somatostatin is cleaved induces an enhancement of ide proteolytic activity toward fluorogenic  amyloid by another subunit therefore this investigation on ide  somatostatin interaction contributes to a more exhaustive knowledge about the functional and structural aspects of ide and its pathophysiological implications in the amyloid deposition and somatostatin homeostasis in the brain
