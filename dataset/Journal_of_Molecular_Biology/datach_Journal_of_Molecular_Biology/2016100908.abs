structure and function of the ring domains of rnf  and rnf  dimeric e ligases that monoubiquitylate histone h b
monoubiquitylation of histone h b is a post translational mark that plays key roles in regulation of transcription and genome stability in humans attachment of ubiquitin to lysine   of histone h b depends on the activity of the e ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ube b and the really interesting new gene ring e ligases ring finger protein rnf   and rnf  to better understand the molecular basis of this modification we have solved the crystal structure of the rnf  ring domain and show that it is a homodimer that specifically interacts with the ube b ub conjugate by mutating residues at the e  e and e  ubiquitin interfaces we identify key contacts required for interaction of the rnf  ring domain with the ube b ub conjugate these mutants were used to generate a structure based model of the rnf   ube b ub complex that reveals differences from other ring e ub complexes and suggests how the rnf   ube b ub complex might interact with its nucleosomal substrate additionally we show that the ring domains of rnf  and rnf  can form a stable heterodimer that is active together our studies provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate rnf  mediated ubiquitin transfer from ube b
