the major hiv  packaging signal is an extended bulged stem loop whose structure is altered on interaction with the gag polyprotein edited by i tinoco
the major packaging signal of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rna has been localised to the region   to the major splice donor within the leader sequence secondary structural studies for this region of the hiv  genome have shown the existence of a stem loop structure capped by a purine rich tetraloop extensive mapping data presented here lead to the complete characterisation of the structure of the stem loop including a new purine rich internal loop in the lower part of the structure and the previously established ggag tetraloop at its tip biochemical analysis reveals that both internal loop and tetraloop are primary sites for interaction with gag polyprotein and that binding of gag protein leads to a conformational change which alters the rna structure nmr spectroscopy has been used to determine the three dimensional structure of this complete stem loop structure the structural analysis reveals a significant difference between the apical part of the stem loop structure which adopts a well defined conformation and the purine rich internal loop which is instead very flexible in contrast to what is generally observed for internal loop structures in rna this region of the encapsidation signal adopts a structure lacking stable interstrand interactions capable of stabilising a unique conformation we suggest that the stem loop structure represents a nucleation site for gag protein binding and that the protein exploits the flexibility of the internal loop to initiate the unwinding of the structure with successive addition of gag molecules interacting with the rna and each other through conserved i interaction domains
