homodimeric structure and double stranded rna cleavage activity of the c terminal rnase iii domain of human dicer
human dicer contains two rnase iii domains rnase iiia and rnase iiib that are responsible for the production of short interfering rnas and micrornas these small rnas induce gene silencing known as rna interference here we report the crystal structure of the c terminal rnase iii domain rnase iiib of human dicer at     resolution the structure revealed that the rnase iiib domain can form a tightly associated homodimer which is similar to the dimers of the bacterial rnase iii domains and the two rnase iii domains of giardia dicer biochemical analysis showed that the rnase iiib homodimer can cleave double stranded rnas dsrnas  and generate short dsrnas with  nt   overhang which is characteristic of rnase iii products the rnase iiib domain contained two magnesium ions per monomer around the active site the distance between two mg  ions is approximately      almost identical with those observed in bacterial rnase iii enzymes and giardia dicer while the locations of two mg  ions were not conserved at all we presume that mg  ions act as catalysts for dsrna cleavage while mg  ions are involved in rna binding
