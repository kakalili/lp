computational de novo design and characterization of an a b diiron protein
diiron proteins are found throughout nature and have a diverse range of functions proteins in this class include methane monooxygenase ribonucleotide reductase   acyl carrier protein desaturase rubrerythrin hemerythrin and the ferritins although each of these proteins has a very different overall fold in every case the diiron active site is situated within a four helix bundle additionally nearly all of these proteins have a conserved glu xxx xxx his motif on two of the four helices with the glu and his residues ligating the iron atoms intriguingly subtle differences in the active site can result in a wide variety of functions to probe the structural basis for this diversity we designed an a b heterotetrameric four helix bundle with an active site similar to those found in the naturally occurring diiron proteins a novel computational approach was developed for the design which considers the energy of not only the desired fold but also alternatively folded structures circular dichroism spectroscopy analytical ultracentrifugation and thermal unfolding studies indicate that the a and b peptides specifically associate to form an a b heterotetramer further the protein binds zn ii and co ii in the expected manner and shows ferroxidase activity under single turnover conditions
