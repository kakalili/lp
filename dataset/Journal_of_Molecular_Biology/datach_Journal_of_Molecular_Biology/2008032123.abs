structure of the extracellular glutathione s transferase ovgst from the human pathogenic parasite onchocerca volvulus
onchocerciasis or river blindness caused by the filarial worm onchocerca volvulus is the world  s second leading infectious cause of blindness in order to chronically infect the host o volvulus has evolved molecular strategies that influence and direct immune responses away from the modes most damaging to it the o volvulus gst  ovgst  is a unique glutathione s transferase gst in that it is a glycoprotein and possesses a signal peptide that is cleaved off in the process of maturation the mature protein starts with a  amino acid extension not present in other gsts in all life stages of the filarial worm it is located directly at the parasite  host interface here the ovgst functions as a highly specific glutathione dependent prostaglandin d synthase pgds  the enzyme therefore has the potential to participate in the modulation of immune responses by contributing to the production of parasite derived prostanoids and restraining the host  s effector responses making it a tempting target for chemotherapy and vaccine development here we report the crystal structure of the ovgst bound to its cofactor glutathione at    resolution the structure reveals an overall structural homology to the haematopoietic pgds from vertebrates but surprisingly also a large conformational change in the prostaglandin binding pocket the observed differences reveal a different vicinity of the prostaglandin h binding pocket that demands another prostaglandin h binding mode to that proposed for the vertebrate pgds finally a putative substrate binding mode for prostaglandin h is postulated based on the observed structural insights
