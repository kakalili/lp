determination of the individual roles of the linker residues in the interdomain motions of calmodulin using nmr chemical shifts
many protein molecules are formed by two or more domains whose structures and dynamics are closely related to their biological functions it is thus important to develop methods to determine the structural properties of these multidomain proteins here we characterize the interdomain motions in the calcium bound state of calmodulin ca  cam using nmr chemical shifts as replica averaged structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations we find that the conformational fluctuations of the interdomain linker which are largely responsible for the overall interdomain motions of cam can be well described by exploiting the information provided by chemical shifts we thus identify  residues in the interdomain linker region that change their conformations upon substrate binding five of these residues met  lys  thr  asp  and ser  are highly flexible and cover the range of conformations observed in the substrate bound state while the remaining five arg  lys  asp  glu  and glu  are much more rigid and do not populate conformations typical of the substrate bound form the ensemble of conformations representing the ca  cam state obtained in this study is in good agreement with residual dipolar coupling paramagnetic resonance enhancement small angle x ray scattering and fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements which were not used as restraints in the calculations these results provide initial evidence that chemical shifts can be used to characterize the conformational fluctuations of multidomain proteins
