the crystal structure of trichomonas vaginalis ferredoxin provides insight into metronidazole activation
crystallographic studies revealing the three dimensional structure of the oxidized form of the  fe  s ferredoxin from trichomonas vaginalis tvfd are presented tvfd a member of the hydrogenosomal class of ferredoxins possesses a unique combination of redox and spectroscopic properties and is believed to be the biological molecule that activates the drug metronidazole reductively in the treatment of trichomoniasis it is the first hydrogenosomal ferredoxin to have its structure determined the structure of tvfd reveals a monomeric   residue protein with a fold similar to that of other known  fe  s ferredoxins it contains nine hydrogen bonds to the sulfur atoms of the cluster which is more than the number predicted on the basis of the spectroscopic data the tvfd structure contains a large dipole moment like adrenodoxin and appears to have a similar interaction domain our analysis demonstrates that tvfd has a unique cavity near the iron  sulfur cluster that exposes one of the inorganic sulfur atoms of the cluster to solvent this cavity is not seen in any other  fe  s ferredoxin with known structure and is hypothesized to be responsible for the high rate of metronidazole reduction by tvfd
