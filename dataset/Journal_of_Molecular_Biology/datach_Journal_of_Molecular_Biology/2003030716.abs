nmr structure of the human doppel protein
the nmr structure of the recombinant human doppel protein hdpl      contains a flexibly disordered  tail  comprising residues     and a globular domain extending from residues  to   for which a detailed structure was obtained the globular domain contains four  helices comprising residues               a         b  and         and a short two stranded anti parallel  sheet comprising residues        and        the fold of the hdpl globular domain thus coincides nearly identically with the structure of the murine dpl protein there are close similarities with the human prion protein hprp but similar to the situation with the corresponding murine proteins hdpl shows marked local differences when compared to hprp the  sheet is flipped by    with respect to the molecular scaffold formed by the four helices and the   strand is shifted by two residues toward the c terminus a large solvent accessible hydrophobic cleft is formed on the protein surface between   and   which has no counterpart in hprp the helix   of hprp is replaced by two shorter helices   a and  b the helix   is shortened by more than two turns when compared with   of hprp which is enforced by the positioning of the second disulfide bond in hdpl the c terminal peptide segment      folds back onto the loop connecting   and   all but four of the  conserved residues in the globular domains of hprp and hdpl appear to have a structural role in maintaining a prp type fold the conservation of r  e  n  and r  in hdpl corresponding to r   e   n  and r  in hprp suggests that these amino acid residues might have essential roles in the so far unknown functions of prp and dpl in healthy organisms
