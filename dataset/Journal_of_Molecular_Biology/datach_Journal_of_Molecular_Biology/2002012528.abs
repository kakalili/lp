deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to the thymidine kinase  tk  like group vary significantly in substrate specificity kinetics and feed back regulation edited by j karn
in eukaryotic cells deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to three phylogenetic sub families have been found  i thymidine kinase  tk  like enzymes which are strictly pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside specific kinases  ii tk like enzymes which include pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside kinases and a single multisubstrate kinase from drosophila melanogaster dm dnk  and iii deoxycytidine deoxyguanosine kinase dck dgk like enzymes which are deoxycytidine and or purine deoxyribonucleoside specific kinases we cloned and characterized two new deoxyribonucleoside kinases belonging to the tk like group from the insect bombyx mori and the amphibian xenopus laevis the deoxyribonucleoside kinase from b mori bm dnk turned out to be a multisubstrate kinase like dm dnk but uniquely for a deoxyribonucleoside kinase bm dnk displayed positive cooperativity with all four natural deoxyribonucleoside substrates the deoxyribonucleoside kinase from x laevis xen pyk resembled closely the human and mouse tk enzymes displaying their characteristic michaelis menten kinetic with deoxycytidine and negative cooperativity with its second natural substrate thymidine bm dnk dm dnk and xen pyk were shown to be homodimers significant differences in the feedback inhibition by deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates between these three enzymes were found the insect multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinases bm dnk and dm dnk were only inhibited by thymidine triphosphate while xen pyk was inhibited by thymidine and deoxycytidine triphosphate in a complex pattern depending on the deoxyribonucleoside substrate the broad substrate specificity and different feedback regulation of the multisubstrate insect deoxyribonucleoside kinases may indicate that these enzymes have a different functional role than the other members of the tk like group
