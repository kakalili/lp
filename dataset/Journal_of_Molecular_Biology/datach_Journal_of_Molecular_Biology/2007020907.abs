bacillus subtilis rna polymerase recruits the transcription factor spo a  p to stabilize a closed complex during transcription initiation
the bacillus subtilis response regulator spo a  p activates transcription from the spoiig promoter by stimulating a rate limiting transition between the initial interaction of rna polymerase with the promoter and initiation of rna synthesis previous work showed that spo a exerts its effect on rna polymerase prior to the formation of an open complex in which the dna strands at the initiation site have been separated to isolate the effect of spo a  p on events prior to dna strand separation at spoiig we studied rna polymerase binding to dna fragments that were truncated to contain only promoter sequences   to the    element by electrophoretic mobility shift assays rna polymerase bound to these fragments readily though highly reversibly and polymerase  promoter complexes recruited spo a  p sequence independent interactions between the rna polymerase and the dna upstream of the core promoter were important for rna polymerase binding and essential for spo a  p recruitment while sequence specific spo a  p  dna interactions positioned and stabilized rna polymerase binding to the dna spo a  p decreased the dissociation rate of the complexes formed with truncated promoter templates which could contribute to the means by which spo a  p stimulates spoiig expression
