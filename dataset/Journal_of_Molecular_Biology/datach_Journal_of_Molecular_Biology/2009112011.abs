regulated expression of the  isoform of the human thromboxane a receptor during megakaryocyte differentiation a coordinated role for wt  egr  and sp
thromboxane plays an essential role in hemostasis regulating platelet aggregation and vessel tone in humans it signals through the tp  and tp  isoforms that are transcriptionally regulated by distinct promoters prm and prm  respectively herein the consequence of megakaryocytic differentiation on prm directed tp  expression was investigated phorbol  myristate  acetate pma treatment substantially increased tp  mrna and prm directed gene expression in human erythroleukemia and k  cells deletional analyses localized the major responsive element s to the upstream     to     region while mutation of four wt egr sp cis elements therein established that each contributes to the induction moreover pma increased egr  but not wt or sp  expression while the ngfi a binding protein  co repressor impaired pma induction of egr  and prm directed gene expression chromatin immunoprecipitations established that wt is predominantly bound in vivo to the   prm region in non differentiated human erythroleukemia cells in response to pma there was initial induction in egr and associated reduction in wt binding to prm in vivo which was displaced by sp following sustained treatment collectively data establish that regulated wt followed by sequential egr and sp binding to elements within prm mediate repression and subsequent induction of tp  during differentiation into the megakaryocytic phenotype shedding significant insights into factors regulating tp  expression therein
