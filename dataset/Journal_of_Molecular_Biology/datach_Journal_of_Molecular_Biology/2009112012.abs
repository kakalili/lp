crystal structures of a acidocaldarius endoglucanase cel a in complex with cello oligosaccharides strong   and   subsites mimic cellobiohydrolase activity
alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius endoglucanase cel a aacel a is an inverting glycoside hydrolase with    glucanase activity on soluble polymeric substrates here we report three x ray structures of aacel a a ligand free structure at     resolution and two complexes at   and     resolution respectively with cellobiose obtained by co crystallization and with cellotetraose obtained by the soaking method aacel a forms an     barrel like other glycoside hydrolase family  enzymes when cellobiose is used as a ligand three glucosyl binding subsites are occupied including two on the glycone side while with cellotetraose as a ligand five subsites including four on the glycone side are occupied a structural comparison showed no conformational rearrangement of aacel a upon ligand binding the structural analysis demonstrates that of the four minus subsites identified subsites   and   show the strongest interaction with bound glucose in conjunction with the open active site cleft of aacel a this is able to reconcile the previously observed cleavage of short chain oligosaccharides with cellobiose as main product with the endo mode of action on larger polysaccharides
