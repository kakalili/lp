differential activities of cellular and viral macro domain proteins in binding of adp ribose metabolites
macro domain is a highly conserved protein domain found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes macro domains are also encoded by a set of positive strand rna viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of animal cells including coronaviruses and alphaviruses the functions of the macro domain are poorly understood but it has been suggested to be an adp ribose binding module we have here characterized three novel human macro domain proteins that were found to reside either in the cytoplasm and nucleus macro domain protein  mdo  and ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein  or in mitochondria macro domain protein  mdo   and compared them with viral macro domains from semliki forest virus hepatitis e virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and with a yeast macro protein poa p mdo specifically bound monomeric adp ribose with a high affinity kd     m  but did not bind poly adp ribose efficiently mdo also hydrolyzed adp ribose   phosphate resembling poa p in all these properties ganglioside induced differentiation associated protein  did not show affinity for adp ribose or its derivatives but instead bound poly a  mdo was generally active in these reactions including poly a binding individual point mutations in mdo abolished monomeric adp ribose binding but not poly adp ribose binding in poly adp ribose binding assays the monomer did not compete against polymer binding the viral macro proteins bound poly adp ribose and poly a  but had a low affinity for monomeric adp ribose thus the viral proteins do not closely resemble any of the human proteins in their biochemical functions the differential activity profiles of the human proteins implicate them in different cellular pathways some of which may involve rna rather than adp ribose derivatives
