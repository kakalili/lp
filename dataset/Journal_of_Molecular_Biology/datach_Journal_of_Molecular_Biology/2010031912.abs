human positive coactivator  controls heterochromatinization and silencing of neural gene expression by interacting with rest nrsf and corest
the highly abundant multifunctional transcriptional positive coactivator  pc  plays important roles in transcription replication and dna repair our recent work showed that pc is a bona fide non histone component of chromatin here we report that knockdown of pc dramatically alters heterochromatin organization of the genome accompanied by increased h k  histone h at lysine residue    acetylation h k trimethylation and reduction in the level of h k dimethylation these posttranslational modifications of histone h result in overexpression of normally silenced genes e g  neural genes located in heterochromatin the results of chip chromatin immunoprecipitation and re chip assays showed that overexpression of a neuronal specific gene is accompanied by histone hyperacetylation we further show that pc interacts with heterochromatin protein   rest nrsf re silencing transcription factor neuron restrictive silencer factor and corest to establish the repressed state of neural genes in nonneuronal cells thus pc plays a crucial role in maintaining a dynamic chromatin state and heterochromatin gene silencing
