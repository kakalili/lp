crystal structure of a c terminal deletion mutant of human protein kinase ck catalytic subunit
protein kinase ck  formerly called casein kinase  is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two separate catalytic chains ck   and a stable dimer of two non catalytic subunits ck   ck  is a highly conserved member of the superfamily of eukaryotic protein kinases the crystal structure of a c terminal deletion mutant of human ck  was solved and refined to    resolution in the crystal the ck  mutant exists as a monomer in agreement with the organization of the subunits in the ck holoenzyme the refined structure shows the helix  c and the activation segment two main regions of conformational plasticity and regulatory importance in eukaryotic protein kinases in active conformations stabilized by extensive contacts to the n terminal segment this arrangement is in accordance with the constitutive activity of the enzyme by structural superimposition of human ck  in isolated form and embedded in the human ck holoenzyme the loop connecting the strands   and   and the atp binding loop were identified as elements of structural variability this structural comparison suggests that the atp binding loop may be the key region by which the non catalytic ck  dimer modulates the activity of ck   the     loop was found in a closed conformation in contrast to the open conformation observed for the ck  subunits of the ck holoenzyme ck  monomers with this closed     loop conformation are unable to bind ck  dimers in the common way for sterical reasons suggesting a mechanism to protect ck  from integration into ck holoenzyme complexes this observation is consistent with the growing evidence that ck  monomers and ck  dimers can exist in vivo independently from the ck holoenzyme and may possess physiological roles of their own
