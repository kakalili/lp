crystal structures of clinically relevant lys  asn tyr  cys double mutant hiv  reverse transcriptase in complexes with atp and non nucleoside inhibitor hby
lys  asn and tyr  cys are the two mutations frequently observed in patients exposed to various non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drugs nnrtis  human immunodeficiency virus hiv strains containing both reverse transcriptase rt mutations are resistant to all of the approved nnrti drugs we have determined crystal structures of lys  asn tyr  cys mutant hiv  rt with and without a bound non nucleoside inhibitor hby    s  isopropoxycarbonyl  methoxy  methylthio methyl   dihydroquinoxalin  h thione at     and     resolution respectively the structure of the double mutant rt hby   complex shows a rearrangement of the isopropoxycarbonyl group of hby   compared to its binding with wild type rt hby   makes a hydrogen bond with the thiol group of cys  that helps the drug retain potency against the tyr  cys mutation the structure of the unliganded double mutant hiv  rt showed that lys  asn mutation facilitates coordination of a sodium ion with lys  o asn  n and o   tyr  o  and two water molecules the formation of the binding pocket requires the removal of the sodium ion although the rt alone and the rt hby   complex were crystallized in the presence of atp only the rt has an atp coordinated with two mn  at the polymerase active site the metal coordination mimics a reaction intermediate state in which complete octahedral coordination was observed for both metal ions asp  coordinates at an axial position whereas the carboxylates of asp  and asp  are in the planes of coordination of both metal ions the structures provide evidence that nnrtis restrict the flexibility of the ymdd loop and prevent the catalytic aspartate residues from adopting their metal binding conformations
