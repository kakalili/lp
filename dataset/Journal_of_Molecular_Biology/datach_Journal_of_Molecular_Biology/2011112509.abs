stepwise expansion of the bacteriophage   procapsid possible packaging intermediates
the initial assembly product of bacteriophage   the procapsid undergoes major structural transformation during the sequential packaging of its three segments of single stranded rna the procapsid a compact icosahedrally symmetric particle with deeply recessed vertices expands to the spherical mature capsid increasing the volume available to accommodate the genome by   fold it has been proposed that expansion and packaging are linked with each stage in expansion presenting a binding site for a particular rna segment to investigate procapsid transformability we induced expansion by acidification heating and elevated salt concentration cryo electron microscopy reconstructions after all three treatments yielded the same partially expanded particle analysis by cryo electron tomography showed that all vertices of a given capsid were either in a compact or an expanded state indicating a highly cooperative transition to benchmark the mature capsid we analyzed filled in vivo packaged capsids when these particles were induced to release their rna they reverted to the same intermediate state as expanded procapsids intermediate  or to a second further expanded state intermediate   this partial reversibility of expansion suggests that the mature spherical capsid conformation is obtained only when sufficient outward pressure is exerted by packaged rna the observation of two intermediates is consistent with the proposed three step packaging process the model is further supported by the observation that a mutant capable of packaging the second rna segment without previously packaging the first segment has enhanced susceptibility for switching spontaneously from the procapsid to the first intermediate state
