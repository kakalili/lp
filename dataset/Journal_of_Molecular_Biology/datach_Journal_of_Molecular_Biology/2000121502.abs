modeling the camp induced allosteric transition using the crystal structure of cap camp at    resolution
after an allosteric transition produced by the binding of cyclic amp camp  the escherichia coli catabolite gene activator protein cap binds dna specifically and activates transcription the three dimensional crystal structure of the cap camp complex has been refined at    resolution thus enabling a better evaluation of the structural basis for cap phenotypes the interactions of camp with cap and the roles played by water structure a review of mutational analysis of cap together with the additional structural information presented here suggests a possible mechanism for the camp induced allostery required for dna binding and transcriptional activation we hypothesize that camp binding may reorient the coiled coil c helices which provide most of the dimer interface thereby altering the relative positions of the dna binding domains of the cap dimer additionally camp binding may cause a further rearrangement of the dna binding and camp binding domains of cap via a flap consisting of  strands  and  which lies over the camp
