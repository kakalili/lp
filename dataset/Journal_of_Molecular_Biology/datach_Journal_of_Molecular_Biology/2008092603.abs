the exon  encoded domain of il  r  contributes to il  high affinity binding and is crucial for the il  antagonistic effect of soluble il  r
we previously showed that a natural soluble form of interleukin   il   r  corresponding to the full length ectodomain of il  r  behaved as a potent antagonist of il  action through il  r     whereas a recombinant soluble il  r  sushi domain did not but instead acted as an agonist of il  action through il  r    in order to determine precisely the molecular basis governing these antagonistic versus agonistic actions we compared the binding properties and biological effects of recombinant soluble il  r  sil  r  species containing the sushi domain and different remaining parts of the ectodomain we first demonstrate that the exon  encoded domain and more particularly its n terminal  amino acid aa peptide are important in addition to the adjacent exon  encoded sushi domain for the stabilization of the high affinity il   il  r  complex by slowing down its dissociation rate and by contributing to about     of the free energy of interaction we next show that all sushi containing sil  r  are agonists on il  r    coordinately increasing il  binding and il  induced proliferation their agonistic potencies are proportional to their respective affinities for il   we then show that the antagonistic effect of sil  r  in the context of il  r     is due to the  aa peptide that creates a sterical constraint impeding the binding of the sil  r  il  complex to the membrane anchored il  r     in the frame of the soluble il  r  sushi domain  il  fusion protein that contains the  aa peptide this constraint is alleviated as a result of a conformational effect due to the covalent linking of the  aa peptide to the n terminus of il   the soluble il  r  sushi domain  il  fusion protein is therefore able to bind and activate both the il  r   and the il  r     receptors
