ratiometric detection of zn ii using chelating fluorescent protein chimeras
fluorescent indicators for the real time imaging of small molecules or metal ions in living cells are invaluable tools for understanding their physiological function genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret between fluorescent protein domains have important advantages over synthetic probes but often suffer from a small ratiometric change here we present a new design approach to obtain sensors with a large difference in emission ratio between the bound and unbound states de novo zn ii binding sites were introduced directly at the surface of both fluorescent domains of a chimera of enhanced cyan and yellow fluorescent protein connected by a flexible peptide linker the resulting sensor zinch displayed an almost fourfold change in fluorescence emission ratio upon binding of zn ii  besides a high affinity for zn ii  the sensor was shown to be selective over other physiologically relevant metal ions its unique biphasic zn ii binding behavior could be attributed to the presence of two distinct zn ii binding sites and allowed ratiometric fluorescent detection of zn ii over a concentration range from   nm to  mm size exclusion chromatography and fluorescence anisotropy were used to provide a detailed picture of the conformational changes associated with each zn ii binding step the high affinity for zn ii was mainly due to a high effective concentration of the fluorescent proteins and could be understood quantitatively by modeling the peptide linker between the fluorescent proteins as a random coil the strategy of using chelating fluorescent protein chimeras to develop fret sensor proteins with a high ratiometric change is expected to be more generally applicable in particular for other metal ions and small molecules
