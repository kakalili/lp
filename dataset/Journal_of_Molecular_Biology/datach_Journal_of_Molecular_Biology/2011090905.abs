autophosphorylation in the leucine rich repeat kinase  lrrk  gtpase domain modifies kinase and gtp binding activities
the leucine rich repeat kinase  lrrk  protein has both guanosine triphosphatase gtpase and kinase activities and mutation in either enzymatic domain can cause late onset parkinson disease nucleotide binding in the gtpase domain may be required for kinase activity and residues in the gtpase domain are potential sites for autophosphorylation suggesting a complex mechanism of intrinsic regulation to further define the effects of lrrk autophosphorylation we applied a technique optimal for detection of protein phosphorylation electron transfer dissociation and identified autophosphorylation events exclusively nearby the nucleotide binding pocket in the gtpase domain parkinson disease linked mutations alter kinase activity but did not alter autophosphorylation site specificity or sites of phosphorylation in a robust in vitro substrate myelin basic protein amino acid substitutions in the gtpase domain have large effects on kinase activity as insertion of the gtpase associated r  c pathogenic mutation together with the g  s kinase domain mutation resulted in a multiplicative increase    fold in activity removal of a conserved autophosphorylation site t   by mutation to an alanine residue resulted in greatly decreased gtp binding and kinase activities while autophosphorylation likely serves to potentiate kinase activity we find that oligomerization and loss of the active dimer species occur in an atp and autophosphorylation independent manner lrrk autophosphorylation sites are overall robustly protected from dephosphorylation in vitro suggesting tight control over activity in vivo we developed highly specific antibodies targeting pt   but failed to detect endogenous autophosphorylation in protein derived from transgenic mice and cell lines lrrk activity in vivo is unlikely to be constitutive but rather refined to specific responses
