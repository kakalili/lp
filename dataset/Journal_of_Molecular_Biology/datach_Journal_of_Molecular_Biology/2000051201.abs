altering molecular recognition of rna aptamers by allosteric selection edited by d e draper
in a continuing effort to explore structural and functional dynamics in rna catalysis we have created a series of allosteric hammerhead ribozymes that are activated by theophylline representative ribozymes exhibit greater than   fold activation upon effector binding and cleave with maximum rate constants that are equivalent to the unmodified hammerhead ribozyme in addition we have evolved a variant allosteric ribozyme that exhibits an effector specificity change from theophylline to  methylxanthine molecular discrimination between the two effectors appears to be mediated by subtle conformational differences that originate from displacement of the phosphodiester backbone near the effector binding pocket these findings reveal the importance of abstruse aspects of molecular recognition by nucleic acids that are likely to be unapproachable by current methods of rational design
