nmr structure of the sars cov nonstructural protein  in solution at ph
the nmr structure of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nonstructural protein nsp  in aqueous solution at ph   was determined and compared with the results of previous structure determinations of nsp in solution at ph   and in the crystals of a hexadecameric nsp nsp complex obtained from a solution at ph    all three structures contain four helices as the only regular secondary structures but there are differences in the lengths and sequence locations of the four helices as well as between the tertiary folds the present study includes data on conformational equilibria and intramolecular rate processes in nsp in solution at ph    which provide further insights into the polymorphisms implicated by a comparison of the three presently available nsp structures
