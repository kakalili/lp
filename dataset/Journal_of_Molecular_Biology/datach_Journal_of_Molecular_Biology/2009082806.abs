relation of intracellular signal levels and promoter activities in the gal regulon of escherichia coli
transcription of many genes is regulated by combinations of multiple signals in escherichia coli combinatorial control is typical in the case of operons related to utilization of different sugars in the absence of glucose to understand regulation of the transport and metabolic pathways in the galactose system we measured activities of the six gal regulon promoters simultaneously using an in vitro transcription system containing purified components input functions were computed on the basis of the experimental measurements we observed four different shapes of input functions from the results we can conclude that the structure of the regulatory network is insufficient for the determination of signal integration it is the actual structure of the promoter and regulatory region the mechanism of transcription regulation and the interplay between transcription factors that shape the input function to be suitable for adaptation
