structure of the cytosolic portion of the motor protein prestin and functional role of the stas domain in slc  sulp anion transporters
prestin is the motor protein responsible for the somatic electromotility of cochlear outer hair cells and is essential for normal hearing sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammals prestin is a member of mammalian solute linked carrier   slc  anion exchangers a family of membrane proteins capable of transporting a wide variety of monovalent and divalent anions slc  transporters play important roles in normal human physiology in different tissues and many of them are involved in genetic diseases slc  and related sulp transporters carry a hydrophobic membrane core and a c terminal cytosolic portion that is essential in plasma membrane targeting and protein function this c terminal portion is mainly composed of a stas sulfate transporters and anti sigma factor antagonist domain whose name is due to a remote but significant sequence similarity with bacterial asa anti sigma factor antagonist proteins here we present the crystal structure at     resolution of the cytosolic portion of prestin the first structure of a sulp transporter stas domain and its characterization in solution by heteronuclear multidimensional nmr spectroscopy prestin stas significantly deviates from the related bacterial asa proteins especially in the n terminal region which  although previously considered merely as a generic linker between the domain and the last transmembrane helix  is indeed fully part of the domain hence unexpectedly our data reveal that the stas domain starts immediately after the last transmembrane segment and lies beneath the lipid bilayer a structure  function analysis suggests that this model can be a general template for most slc  and sulp anion transporters and supports the notion that stas domains are involved in functionally important intramolecular and intermolecular interactions mapping of disease associated or functionally harmful mutations on stas structure indicates that they can be divided into two categories those causing significant misfolding of the domain and those altering its interaction properties
