the novel microtubule destabilizing drug bal   binds to the colchicine site of tubulin with distinct effects on microtubule organization
microtubule targeting agents are widely used for the treatment of cancer and as tool compounds to study the microtubule cytoskeleton bal   is a novel microtubule destabilizing drug that is currently undergoing phase i clinical evaluation as the prodrug bal    the drug is a potent inhibitor of tumor cell growth and shows a promising activity profile in a panel of human cancer models resistant to clinically relevant microtubule targeting agents here we evaluated the molecular mechanism of the tubulin  bal   interaction using a combination of cell biology biochemistry and structural biology methods tubulin binding assays revealed that bal   potently inhibited tubulin assembly at   c with an ic  of   m and bound to unassembled tubulin with a stoichiometry of mol mol tubulin and a dissociation constant of    nm bal   bound to tubulin independently of vinblastine without the formation of tubulin oligomers the kinetics of bal   binding to tubulin were distinct from those of colchicine with evidence of competition between bal   and colchicine for binding determination of the tubulin  bal   structure by x ray crystallography demonstrated that bal   binds to the same site as colchicine at the intradimer interface comparison of crystal structures of tubulin  bal   and tubulin  colchicine complexes shows that the binding mode of bal   to tubulin is similar to that of colchicine however comparative analyses of the effects of bal   and colchicine on the microtubule mitotic spindle and in tubulin protease protection experiments suggest different outcomes of tubulin binding taken together our data define bal   as a potent colchicine site binding microtubule destabilizing agent with distinct effects on microtubule organization
