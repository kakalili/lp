structural characterization of the stem  stem dimerization interface between prolactin receptor chains complexed with the natural hormone
the most promising approach to targeting the tumor growth promoting actions of prolactin prl mediated by its autocrine paracrine pathway has been the development of specific prl receptor prlr antagonists however the optimization of such antagonists requires a thorough understanding of the activation mechanism of prlr we have thus conducted a systematic x ray crystallographic study in order to visualize the successive steps of prlr activation by prl we report here the structure at     resolution of the   complex between natural prl and two prlr chains prlr and prlr  corresponding to the final activated state of prlr further than our previously published structure involving an affinity matured prl variant this structure allowed to visualize for the first time the loop l spanning prlr residues thr  phe   revealing its central implication for the three intermolecular interfaces of the complex we equally succeeded in obtaining a comprehensive picture of the prlr  prlr dimerization interface also called stem  stem interface site directed mutagenesis was conducted to probe the energetic importance of stem  stem contacts highlighted by the structure surprisingly in spite of significant structural differences between the prl prlr complex and the   growth hormone growth hormone receptor complex our mutational data suggest that hot spot residues that stabilize the receptor dimerization interface are equivalent in the two complexes this study provides a new overall picture of the structural features of prlr involved in stabilizing its complex with prl
