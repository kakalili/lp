structure of a sumo binding motif mimic bound to smt p  ubc p conservation of a non covalent ubiquitin like protein  e complex as a platform for selective interactions within a sumo pathway
the sumo ubiquitin like proteins play regulatory roles in cell division transcription dna repair and protein subcellular localization paralleling other ubiquitin like proteins sumo proteins are proteolytically processed to maturity conjugated to targets by e e e cascades and subsequently recognized by specific downstream effectors containing a sumo binding motif sbm  sumo and its e from the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae smt p and ubc p are encoded by essential genes here we describe the     resolution crystal structure of a non covalent smt p  ubc p complex unexpectedly a heterologous portion of the crystallized complex derived from the expression construct mimics an sbm and binds smt p in a manner resembling sbm binding to human sumo family members in the complex smt p binds a surface distal from ubc s catalytic cysteine the structure implies that a single molecule of smt p cannot bind concurrently to both the non covalent binding site and the catalytic cysteine of a single ubc p molecule however formation of higher order complexes can occur where a single smt p covalently linked to one ubc p s catalytic cysteine also binds non covalently to another molecule of ubc p comparison with other structures from the sumo pathway suggests that formation of the non covalent smt p  ubc p complex occurs mutually exclusively with many other smt p and ubc p interactions in the conjugation cascade by contrast high resolution insights into how smt p  ubc p can also interact with downstream recognition machineries come from contacts with the sbm mimic interestingly the overall architecture of the smt p  ubc p complex is strikingly similar to recent structures from the ubiquitin pathway the results imply that non covalent ubiquitin like protein  e complexes are conserved platforms which function as parts of larger assemblies involved in many protein post translational regulatory pathways
