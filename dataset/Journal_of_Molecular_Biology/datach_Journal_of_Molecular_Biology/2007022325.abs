lysozyme amyloidogenesis is accelerated by specific nicking and fragmentation but decelerated by intact protein binding and conversion
we have revisited the well studied heat and acidic amyloid fibril formation pathway ph      c of hen egg white lysozyme hewl to map the barriers of the misfolding and amyloidogenesis pathways a comprehensive kinetic mechanism is presented where all steps involving protein hydrolysis fragmentation assembly and conversion into amyloid fibrils are accounted for amyloid fibril formation of lysozyme has multiple kinetic barriers first hewl unfolds within minutes followed by irreversible steps of partial acid hydrolysis affording a large amount of nicked hewl the     amyloidogenic fragment and a variety of other species over     h fragmentation forming the     fragment is a requirement for efficient amyloid fibril formation indicating that it forms the rate determining nucleus nicked full length hewl is recruited efficiently into amyloid fibrils in the fibril growth phase or using mature fibrils as seeds which abolished the lag phase completely mature amyloid fibrils of hewl are composed mainly of nicked hewl in the early equilibrium phase but go through a  fibril shaving  process affording fibrils composed of the     fragment and     fragment during more extensive maturation incubation for longer than ten days  seeding of the amyloid fibril formation process using sonicated mature amyloid fibrils accelerates the fibril formation process efficiently however addition of intact full length lysozyme at the end of the lag phase slows the rate of amyloidogenesis the intact full length protein in contrast to nicked lysozyme slows fibril formation due to its slow conversion into the amyloid fold probably due to inclusion of the non amyloidogenic         portion of hewl in the fibrils which can function as a  molecular bumper  stalling further growth
