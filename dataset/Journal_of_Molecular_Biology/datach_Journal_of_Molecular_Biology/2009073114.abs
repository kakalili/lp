different members of a simple three helix bundle protein family have very different folding rate constants and fold by different mechanisms
the  th  th and  th repeats of chicken brain  spectrin r  r  and r  respectively are very similar in terms of structure and stability however r  folds and unfolds  orders of magnitude faster than r  and r  this is unexpected the rate limiting transition state for r  folding is investigated using protein engineering methods   value analysis and compared with previously completed analyses of r  and r  characterisation of many mutants suggests that all three proteins have similar complexity in the folding landscape the early rate limiting transition states of the three domains are similar in terms of overall structure but there are significant differences in the patterns of  values r  apparently folds via a nucleation  condensation mechanism which involves concomitant folding and packing of the a and c helices establishing the correct topology r  and r  fold via a more framework like mechanism which may impede the search to find the correct packing of the helices providing a possible explanation for the fast folding of r
