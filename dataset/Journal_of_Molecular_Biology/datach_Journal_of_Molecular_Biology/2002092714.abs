centrosomal anchoring of the protein kinase ck  mediated by attachment to the large coiled coil scaffolding protein cg nap akap
protein kinase ck  formerly termed casein kinase i is ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and comprises a family of as many as  isoforms including splice variants in mammalian cells mammalian ck  and ck   which are highly related to each other are enriched at the centrosomes in interphase cells and at the spindle during mitosis in the present study we have isolated using the yeast two hybrid system a   amino acid residue fragment of the centrosomal and golgi n kinase anchoring protein cg nap also known as akap   which specifically interacts with ck  and ck   but not with other ck isoforms the   amino acid residue cg nap fragment or full length cg nap co immunoprecipitates with ck  and ck  from mammalian cells consistent with this association endogenous cg nap akap  and ck  co localize in cells moreover when expressed in the presence of ck  the   amino acid residue cg nap fragment adopts the same sub cellular localization as ck   strikingly attachment of the cg nap fragment to the plasma membrane is sufficient to re localize a significant level of ck  to the membrane these findings support a model in which sub cellular localization of ck    molecules at the centrosome is mediated at least in part through the action of cg nap akap  and provide a potential mechanism by which the contribution to cell cycle progression by ck    may be regulated
