the uaa gan internal loop motif a new rna structural element that forms a cross strand aaa stack and long range tertiary interactions
analysis of aligned rna sequences and high resolution crystal structures has revealed a new rna structural element termed the uaa gan motif found in internal loops of the   s rrna as well as in rnase p rna and group i and ii introns this six nucleotide motif adopts a distinctive local structure that includes two base pairs with non canonical conformations and three conserved adenine bases which form a cross strand aaa stack in the minor groove most importantly the motif invariably forms long range tertiary contacts as the aaa stack typically forms a minor interactions and the flipped out n nucleotide forms additional contacts that are specific to the structural context of each loop the widespread presence of this motif and its propensity to form long range contacts suggest that it plays a critical role in defining the architectures of structured rnas
