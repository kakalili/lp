consequences of domain insertion on the stability and folding mechanism of a protein
slyd the sensitive to lysis protein from escherichia coli consists of two domains they are not arranged successively along the protein chain but one domain the  insert in flap   if domain is inserted internally as a guest into a surface loop of the host domain which is a prolyl isomerase of the fk  binding protein fkbp type we used slyd as a model to elucidate how such a domain insertion affects the stability and folding mechanism of the host and the guest domain for these studies the two domain protein was compared with a single domain variant slyd if slyd without the chaperone domain residues    and      in which the if domain was removed and replaced by a short loop as present in human fkbp  equilibrium unfolding and folding kinetics followed an apparent two state mechanism in the absence and in the presence of the if domain the inserted domain decreased however the stability of the host domain in the transition region and decelerated its refolding reaction by about  fold this originates from the interruption of the chain connectivity by the if domain and its inherent instability to monitor folding processes in this domain selectively a trp residue was introduced as fluorescent probe kinetic double mixing experiments revealed that in intact slyd the if domain folds and unfolds about   fold more rapidly than the fkbp domain and that it is strongly stabilized when linked with the folded fkbp domain the unfolding limbs of the kinetic chevrons of slyd show a strong downward curvature this deviation from linearity is not caused by a transition state movement as often assumed but by the accumulation of a silent unfolding intermediate at high denaturant concentrations in this kinetic intermediate the fkbp domain is still folded whereas the if domain is already unfolded
