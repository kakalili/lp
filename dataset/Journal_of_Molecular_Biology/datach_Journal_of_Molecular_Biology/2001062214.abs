folded back solution structure of monomeric factor h of human complement by synchrotron x ray and neutron scattering analytical ultracentrifugation and constrained molecular modelling edited by r huber
factor h fh is a regulatory cofactor for the protease factor i in the breakdown of c b in the complement system of immune defence and binds to heparin and other polyanionic substrates fh is composed of  short consensus complement repeat scr domains for which the overall arrangement in solution is unknown as previous studies had shown that fh can form monomeric or dimeric structures x ray and neutron scattering was accordingly performed with fh in the concentration range between   and  mg ml   the radius of gyration of fh was determined to be      nm by both methods and the radii of gyration of the cross section were   nm and   nm the distance distribution function p r showed that the overall length of fh was  nm the neutron data showed that fh was monomeric with a molecular mass of          da analytical ultracentrifugation data confirmed this where sedimentation equilibrium curve fits gave a mean molecular mass of         da sedimentation velocity experiments using the g  s derivative method showed that fh was monodisperse and had a sedimentation coefficient of      s in order to construct a full model of fh for scattering curve and sedimentation coefficient fits homology models were constructed for  of the  scr domains using knowledge of the nmr structures for fh scr  scr  and scr   and vaccinia coat protein scr  and scr  molecular dynamics simulations were used to generate a large conformational library for each of the  scr scr linker peptides peptides from these libraries were combined with the  scr structures in order to generate stereochemically complete models for the fh structure using an automated constrained fit procedure the analysis of    possible fh models showed that only those models in which the  scr domains were bent back upon themselves were able to account for the scattering and sedimentation data the best fit models showed that fh had an overall length of  nm and is flexible this length is significantly less than a predicted length of  nm if the  scr structures had been arranged in an extended arrangement this outcome is attributed to several long linker sequences these bent back domain structures may correspond to conformational flexibility in fh and enable the multiple fh binding sites for c and heparin to come into close proximity
