structure guided mutational analysis of a yeast dead box protein involved in mitochondrial rna splicing
dead box proteins are rna dependent atpase enzymes that have been implicated in nearly all aspects of rna metabolism since many of these enzymes have been shown to possess common biochemical properties in vitro including the ability to bind and hydrolyze atp to bind nucleic acid and to promote helix unwinding dead box proteins are generally thought to modulate rna structure in vivo however the extent to which these enzymatic properties are important for the in vivo functions of dead box proteins remains unclear to evaluate how these properties influence dead box protein native function we probed the importance of several highly conserved residues in the yeast dead box protein mss  p which is required for the splicing of all mitochondrial catalytic introns in saccharomyces cerevisiae using an mss  deletion strain we have expressed plasmid borne variants of mss  containing substitutions in residues predicted to be important for extensive networks of interactions required for atp hydrolysis and helix unwinding we have analyzed the importance of these residues to the splicing functions of mss  p in vivo and compared these results with the biochemical properties of recombinant proteins determined here and in previously published work we observed that the efficiency by which an mss  p variant catalyzes atp hydrolysis correlates with facilitating mitochondrial splicing while efficient helix unwinding appears to be insufficient for splicing in addition we show that each splicing defective variant affects the splicing of structurally diverse introns to the same degree together these observations suggest that the efficiency by which mss  p catalyzes the hydrolysis of atp is critical for all of its splicing functions in vivo given that atp hydrolysis stimulates the recycling of dead box proteins these observations support a model in which enzyme turnover is a crucial factor in mss  p splicing function these results are discussed in the context of current models of mss  p facilitated splicing
