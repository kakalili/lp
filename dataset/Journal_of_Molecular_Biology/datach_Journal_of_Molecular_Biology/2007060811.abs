structural basis for a high affinity inhibitor bound to protein kinase mk
the ser thr protein kinase mapkap kinase  mk  plays a crucial role in inflammation we determined the structure of the kinase domain of mk in complex with a low molecular mass inhibitor in two different crystal forms obtained from soaking and co crystallization to our knowledge these are the first structures of mk showing the binding mode of an inhibitor with high binding affinity ic    nm  the two crystal forms revealed conformational flexibility in the binding site and extend the experimental basis for rational drug design crystal form  contained one mk molecule per asymmetric unit form  contained  molecules which arrange into two different types of mk trimers one of them may serve as a model for an intermediate state during substrate phosphorylation as each mk monomer places its activation segment into the substrate peptide binding groove of the trimer neighbor
