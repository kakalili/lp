crystal structure of an archaeal intein encoded homing endonuclease pi pfui
inteins possess two different enzymatic activities self catalyzed protein splicing and site specific dna cleavage these endonucleases which are classified as part of the homing endonuclease family initiate the mobility of their genetic elements into homologous alleles they recognize long asymmetric nucleotide sequences and cleave both dna strands in a monomer form we present here the    crystal structure of the archaeal pi pfui intein from pyroccocus furiosus the structure reveals a unique domain designated here as the stirrup domain which is inserted between the hint domain and an endonuclease domain the horseshoe shaped hint domain contains a catalytic center for protein splicing which involves both n and c terminal residues the endonuclease domain which is inserted into the hint domain consists of two copies of substructure related by an internal pseudo  fold axis in contrast with the i crei homing endonuclease pi pfui possibly has two asymmetric catalytic sites at the center of a putative dna binding cleft formed by a pair of four stranded  sheets dnase i footprinting experiments showed that pi pfui covers more than  bp of the substrate asymmetrically across the cleavage site a docking model of the dna enzyme complex suggests that the endonuclease domain covers the  bp dna duplex encompassing the cleavage site whereas the stirrup domain could make an additional contact with another upstream  bp region for the double strand break the two strands in the dna duplex were cleaved by pi pfui with different efficiencies we suggest that the cleavage of each strand is catalyzed by each of the two non equivalent active sites
