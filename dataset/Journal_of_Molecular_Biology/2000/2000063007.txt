Recent structural data imply differences in allosteric behavior of the group I chaperonins, typified by GroEL from Escherichia coli, and the group II chaperonins, which comprise archaeal thermosome and eukaryotic TRiC/CCT. Therefore, this study addresses the mechanism of interaction of adenine nucleotides with recombinant α-only and native αβ-thermosomes from Thermoplasma acidophilum, which also enables us to analyze the role of the heterooligomeric composition of the natural thermosome. Although all subunits of the α-only thermosome seem to bind nucleotides tightly and independently, the native chaperonin has two different classes of ATP-binding sites. Furthermore, for the α-only thermosome, the steady-state ATPase rate is determined by the cleavage reaction itself, whereas, for the αβ-thermosome, the rate-limiting step is associated with a post-hydrolysis isomerisation into a non-covalent ADP∗Pi species prior to the release of the γ-phosphate group. After half-saturation with ATP, a negative cooperativity in hydrolysis is observed for both thermosomes. The effect of Mg2+ and K+ nucleotide cycling is documented. We conclude that archaeal chaperonins have unique allosteric properties and discuss them in the light of the mechanism established for the group I chaperonins.
