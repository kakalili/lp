myosin binding surface on actin probed by hydroxyl radical footprinting and site directed labels
actin and myosin are the two main proteins required for cell motility and muscle contraction the structure of their strongly bound complex  rigor state  is a key for delineating the functional mechanism of actomyosin motor current knowledge of that complex is based on models obtained from the docking of known atomic structures of actin and myosin subfragment  s  the head and neck region of myosin into low resolution electron microscopy electron density maps which precludes atomic or side chain level information here we use radiolytic protein footprinting for global mapping of sites across the actin molecules that are impacted directly or allosterically by myosin binding to actin filaments fluorescence and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies and cysteine actin mutants are used for independent residue specific probing of s effects on two structural elements of actin we identify actin residue candidates involved in s binding and provide experimental evidence to discriminate between the regions of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions focusing on the role of the dnase i binding loop d loop and the w loop residues of actin in their interactions with s  we found that the emission properties of acrylodan and the mobility of electron paramagnetic resonance spin labels attached to cysteine mutants of these residues change strongly and in a residue specific manner upon s binding consistent with the recently proposed direct contacts of these loops with s  as documented in this study the direct and indirect changes on actin induced by myosin are more extensive than known until now and attest to the importance of actin dynamics to actomyosin function
