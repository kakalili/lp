EcoDam is an adenine-N6 DNA methyltransferase that methylates the GATC sites in the Escherichia coli genome. We have changed the target specificity of EcoDam from GATC to GATT by directed evolution, combining different random mutagenesis methods with restriction protection at GATT sites for selection and screening. By co-evolution of an enzyme library and a substrate library, we identified GATT as the best non-GATC site and discover a double mutation, R124S/P134S, as the first step to increase enzyme activity at GATT sites. After four generations of mutagenesis and selection, we obtained enzyme variants with new specificity for GATT. While the wild-type EcoDam shows no detectable activity at GATT sites in E. coli cells, some variants prefer methylation at GATT over GATC sites by about 10-fold in cells. In vitro DNA methylation kinetics carried out under single-turnover conditions using a hemimethylated GATC and a GATT oligonucleotide substrate confirmed that the evolved proteins prefer methylation of GATT sites to a similar degree. They show up to 1600-fold change in specificity in vitro and methylate the new GATT target site with 20% of the rate of GATC methylation by the wild-type enzyme, indicating good activity. We conclude that the new methyltransferases are fully functional in vivo and in vitro but show a new target-site specificity.
