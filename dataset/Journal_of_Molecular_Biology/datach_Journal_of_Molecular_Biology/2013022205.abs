substrate recognition of plc  via a specific docking surface on itk
itk interleukin  inducible t cell kinase is a non receptor protein tyrosine kinase expressed primarily in t cells itk catalyzes phosphorylation on tyrosine residues within a number of its natural substrates including the well characterized y  of plc   however the molecular mechanisms itk exploits to recognize its substrates are not completely understood we have previously identified a specific docking interaction between the kinase domain of itk and the c terminal src homology  sh c domain of plc  that promotes substrate specificity for this enzyme substrate pair in the current study we identify and map the interaction surface on the itk kinase domain as an acidic patch centered on the g helix mutation of the residues on and adjacent to the g helix within the itk kinase domain impairs the catalytic efficacy of plc  substrate phosphorylation by specifically altering the protein  protein interaction interface and not the inherent catalytic activity of itk nmr titration experiments using a btk bruton s tyrosine kinase kinase domain as a surrogate for the itk kinase domain provide further support for an itk plc  sh c interaction surrounding the g helix of the kinase domain the work presented here provides structural insight into how the itk kinase uses the g helix to single out y  of plc  for specific phosphorylation comparing these results to other well characterized kinase substrate systems suggests that the g helix is a general structural feature used by kinases for substrate recognition during signaling
