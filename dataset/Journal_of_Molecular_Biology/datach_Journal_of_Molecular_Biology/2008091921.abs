the crystal structure of the heparin binding reelin n domain of f spondin
the extracellular matrix protein f spondin mediates axon guidance during neuronal development its n terminal domain termed the reelin n domain is conserved in f spondins reelins and other extracellular matrix proteins in this study a recombinant human reelin n domain has been expressed purified and shown to bind heparin the crystal structure of the reelin n domain resolved to     reveals a variant immunoglobulin like fold and potential heparin binding sites substantial conformational variations even in secondary structure are observed between the two chemically identical reelin n domains in one crystallographic asymmetric unit the variations may result from extensive highly specific interactions across the interface of the two reelin n domains the calculated values of buried surface area and the interface s shape complementarity are consistent with the formation of a weak dimer the homophilic asymmetric dimer can potentially offer advantages in binding to ligands such as glycosaminoglycans which may in turn bridge the two reelin n domains and stabilize the dimer
