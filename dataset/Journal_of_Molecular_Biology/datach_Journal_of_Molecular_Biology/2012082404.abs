structural properties of egcg induced nontoxic alzheimer s disease a  oligomers
the green tea compound epigallocatechin  gallate egcg inhibits alzheimer s disease  amyloid peptide a  neurotoxicity solution state nmr allows probing initial egcg  a  interactions we show that egcg induced a  oligomers adopt a well defined structure and are amenable for magic angle spinning solid state nmr investigations we find that egcg interferes with the aromatic hydrophobic core of a  the c terminal part of the a  peptide residues     adopts a  sheet conformation whereas the n terminus residues     is unstructured the characteristic salt bridge involving residues d  and k  is present in the structure of these oligomeric a  aggregates as well the structural analysis of small molecule induced amyloid aggregates will open new perspectives for alzheimer s disease drug development
