insights into positive and negative requirements for protein  protein interactions by crystallographic analysis of the  lactamase inhibitory proteins blip blip i and blp
lactamase inhibitory protein blip binds a variety of  lactamase enzymes with wide ranging specificity its binding mechanism and interface interactions are a well established model system for the characterization of protein  protein interactions published studies have examined the binding of blip to diverse target  lactamases e g  tem  sme  and shv   however apart from point mutations of amino acid residues variability on the inhibitor side of this enzyme  inhibitor interface has remained unexplored thus we present crystal structures of two likely blip relatives   blip i solved alone and in complex with tem   which has  lactamase inhibitory activity very similar to that of blip and    lactamase inhibitory protein like protein blp  in two apo forms including an ultra high resolution structure  which is unable to inhibit any tested  lactamase despite categorical differences in species of origin and function blip i and blp share nearly identical backbone conformations even at loop regions differing in blip we describe interacting residues and provide a comparative structural analysis of the interactions formed at the interface of blip i tem  versus those formed at the interface of blip tem  along with initial attempts to functionally characterize blp we examine its amino acid residues that structurally correspond to blip blip i binding hotspots to explain its inability to bind and inhibit tem  we conclude that the blip family fold is a robust and flexible scaffold that permits the formation of high affinity protein  protein interactions while remaining highly selective comparison of the two naturally occurring distinct binding interfaces built upon this scaffold blip and blip i shows that there is substantial variation possible in the subnanomolar binding interaction with tem  the corresponding non tem  binding blp surface shows that numerous favorable backbone  backbone backbone  side chain interactions with a protein partner can be negated by the presence of a few strongly unfavorable interactions especially electrostatic repulsions
