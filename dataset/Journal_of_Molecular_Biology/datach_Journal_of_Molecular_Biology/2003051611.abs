transforming growth factor beta tgf   binding to the extracellular domain of the type ii tgf  receptor receptor capture on a biosensor surface using a new coiled coil capture system demonstrates that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity binding
mature tgf  isoforms which are covalent dimers signal by binding to three types of cell surface receptors the type i ii and iii tgf  receptors a complex composed of the tgf  ligand and the type i and ii receptors is required for signaling the type ii receptor is responsible for recruiting tgf  into the heteromeric ligand type i receptor type ii receptor complex the purpose of this study was to test for the extent that avidity contributes to receptor affinity using a surface plasmon resonance spr based biosensor the biacore  we captured the extracellular domain of the type ii receptor t riied at the biosensor surface in an oriented and stable manner by using a de novo designed coiled coil e k coil heterodimerizing system we characterized the kinetics of binding of three tgf  isoforms to this immobilized t riied the results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of tgf  binding to t riied was one dimeric ligand to two receptors all three tgf  isoforms had rapid and similar association rates but different dissociation rates which resulted in the equilibrium dissociation constants being approximately pm for the tgf   and   isoforms and nm for the tgf   isoform since these apparent affinities are at least four orders of magnitude higher than those determined when tgf  was immobilized and are close to those determined for t rii at the cell surface we suggest that avidity contributes significantly to high affinity receptor binding both at the biosensor and cell surfaces finally we demonstrated that the coiled coil immobilization approach does not require the purification of the captured protein making it an attractive tool for the rapid study of any protein  protein interaction
