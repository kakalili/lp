promiscuous binding of ligands by  lactoglobulin involves hydrophobic interactions and plasticity
bovine  lactoglobulin  lg binds a variety of hydrophobic ligands though precisely how is not clear to understand the structural basis of this promiscuous binding we studied the interaction of  lg with palmitic acid pa using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy the titration was monitored using tryptophan fluorescence and a hsqc spectrum confirmed a   stoichiometry for the pa  lg complex upon the binding of pa signal disappearances and large changes in chemical shifts were observed for the residues located at the entrance and bottom of the cavity respectively this observation indicates that the lower region makes a rigid connection with pa whereas the entrance is more flexible the result is in contrast to the binding of pa to intestinal fatty acid binding protein another member of the calycin superfamily in which structural consolidation occurs upon ligand binding on the other hand the ability of  lg to accommodate various hydrophobic ligands resembles that of groel in which a large hydrophobic cavity and flexible binding site confer the ability to bind various hydrophobic substrates considering these observations it is suggested that in addition to the presence of the hydrophobic cavity the plasticity of the entrance region makes possible the binding of hydrophobic ligands of various shapes thus in contrast to the specific binding seen for many enzymes  lg provides an example of binding with low specificity but high affinity which may play an important role in protein  ligand and protein  protein networks
