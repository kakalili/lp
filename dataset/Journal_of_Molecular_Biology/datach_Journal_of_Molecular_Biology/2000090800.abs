structure based functional classification of hypothetical protein mth  from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum edited by p wright
the structure of mth   a previously uncharacterized hypothetical protein from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum has been determined by nmr spectroscopy mth  is one of numerous structural genomics targets selected in a genome wide survey of uncharacterized sequences from this organism mth  is a so called singleton a sequence not closely related to any other known sequences the structure of mth  closely resembles the known structures of receiver domains from two component response regulator systems such as chey and is similar to the structures of flavodoxins and gtp binding proteins tests on mth  for characteristic activities of chey and flavodoxin were negative mth  did not become phosphorylated in the presence of acetyl phosphate and mg  although it appeared to bind mg  mth  also did not bind flavin mononucleotide fmn or coenzyme f   nevertheless sequence and structure parallels between mth  chey and two families of atpase phosphatase proteins suggest that mth  may have a role in a phosphorylation independent two component response regulator system
