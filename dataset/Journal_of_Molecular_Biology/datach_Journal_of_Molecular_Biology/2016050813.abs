structural basis of lipid targeting and destruction by the type v secretion system of pseudomonas aeruginosa
the type v secretion system is a macromolecular machine employed by a number of bacteria to secrete virulence factors into the environment the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa employs the newly described type vd secretion system to secrete a soluble variant of plpd a lipase of the patatin like family synthesized as a single macromolecule that also carries a polypeptide transport associated domain and a  stranded  barrel here we report the crystal structure of the secreted form of plpd in its biologically active state plpd displays a classical lipase    hydrolase fold with a catalytic site located within a highly hydrophobic channel that entraps a lipidic molecule the active site is covered by a flexible lid as in other lipases indicating that this region in plpd must modify its conformation in order for catalysis at the water  lipid interface to occur plpd displays phospholipase a activity and is able to recognize a number of phosphatidylinositols and other phosphatidyl analogs plpd is the first example of an active phospholipase secreted through the type v secretion system for which there are more than   homologs revealing details of the lipid destruction arsenal expressed by p aeruginosa in order to establish infection
