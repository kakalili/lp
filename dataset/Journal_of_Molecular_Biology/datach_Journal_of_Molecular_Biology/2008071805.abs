folding of the kix domain characterization of the equilibrium analog of a folding intermediate using  n  c relaxation dispersion and fast h h amide exchange nmr spectroscopy
the kix domain of the transcription co activator cbp is a three helix bundle protein that folds via rapid accumulation of an intermediate state followed by a slower folding phase recent nmr relaxation dispersion studies revealed the presence of a low populated excited state of kix that exists in equilibrium with the natively folded form under non denaturing conditions and likely represents the equilibrium analog of the folding intermediate here we combine amide hydrogen deuterium exchange measurements using rapid nmr data acquisition techniques with backbone  n and  c relaxation dispersion experiments to further investigate the equilibrium folding of the kix domain residual structure within the folding intermediate is detected by both methods and their combination enables reliable quantification of the amount of persistent residual structure three well defined folding subunits are found which display variable stability and correspond closely to the individual helices in the native state while two of the three helices   and   are partially formed in the folding intermediate to    and     respectively at    c  the third helix is disordered the observed helical content within the excited state exceeds the helical propensities predicted for the corresponding peptide regions suggesting that the two helices are weakly mutually stabilized while methyl  c relaxation dispersion data indicate that a defined packing arrangement is unlikely temperature dependent experiments reveal that the largest enthalpy and entropy changes along the folding reaction occur during the final transition from the intermediate to the native state our experimental data are consistent with a folding mechanism where helices   and   form rapidly although to different extents while helix   consolidates only as folding proceeds to complete the native state structure
