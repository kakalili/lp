The leech protein Saratin from Hirudo medicinalis prevents thrombocyte aggregation by interfering with the first binding step of the thrombocytes to collagen by binding to collagen. We solved the three-dimensional structure of the leech protein Saratin in solution and identified its collagen binding site by NMR titration experiments. The NMR structure of Saratin consists of one α-helix and a five-stranded β-sheet arranged in the topology ββαβββ. The C-terminal region, of about 20 amino acids in length, adopts no regular structure. NMR titration experiments with collagen peptides show that the collagen interaction of Saratin takes place in a kind of notch that is formed by the end of the α-helix and the β-sheet. NMR data-driven docking experiments to collagen model peptides were used to elucidate the putative binding mode of Saratin and collagen. Mainly, parts of the first and the end of the fifth β-strand, the loop connecting the α-helix and the third β-strand, and a short part of the loop connecting the fourth and fifth β-strand participate in binding.
