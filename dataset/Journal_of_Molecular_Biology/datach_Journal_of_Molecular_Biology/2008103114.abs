conserved central domains control the quaternary structure of type i and type ii hsp  molecular chaperones
heat shock protein hsp  s play an essential role in protein metabolism by regulating the polypeptide binding and release cycle of hsp  the hsp  family is large and specialized family members direct hsp  to perform highly specific tasks type i and type ii hsp s such as yeast ydj and sis  are homodimers that dictate functions of cytosolic hsp  but how they do so is unclear type i hsp s contain a conserved centrally located cysteine rich domain that is replaced by a glycine and methionine rich region in type ii hsp s but the mechanism by which these unique domains influence hsp  structure and function is unknown this is the case because high resolution structures of full length forms of these hsp s have not been solved to fill this void we built low resolution models of the quaternary structure of ydj and sis with information obtained from biophysical measurements of protein shape small angle x ray scattering and ab initio protein modeling low resolution models were also calculated for the chimeric hsp s ysy and sys in which the central domains of ydj and sis were exchanged similar to their human homologs ydj and sis each has a unique shape with major structural differences apparently being the orientation of the j domains relative to the long axis of the dimers central domain swapping in ysy and sys correlates with the switched ability of ysy and sys to perform unique functions of sis and ydj  respectively models for the mechanism by which the conserved cysteine rich domain and glycine and methionine rich region confer structural and functional specificity to type i and type ii hsp s are discussed
