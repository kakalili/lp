ph induced conformational change of the  barrel forming protein ompg reconstituted into native e coli lipids
a gating mechanism of the  barrel forming outer membrane protein g ompg from escherichia coli was recently presented the mechanism was based on x ray structures revealed from crystals grown from solubilized ompg at both neutral ph and acidic ph to investigate whether these conformations represent the naturally occurring gating mechanism we reconstituted ompg in native e coli lipids and applied high resolution atomic force microscopy the reconstituted ompg molecules assembled into both monomers and dimers single monomeric and dimeric ompg molecules showed open channel entrances at ph   and at room temperature the extracellular loops connecting the  strands that form the transmembrane  barrel pore exhibited elevated structural flexibility upon lowering the ph to   the conformation of ompg molecules changed to close the extracellular entrance of their channel it appears that one or more of the extracellular loops collapsed onto the channel entrance this conformational change was fully reversible our data confirm that the previously reported gating mechanism of ompg occurs at physiological conditions in e coli lipid membranes
