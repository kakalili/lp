crystal structure of  hydroxyl  oxo  phenylhexa   dienoic acid hpda hydrolase bphd enzyme from the rhodococcus sp strain rha of the pcb degradation pathway edited by r huber
hydroxyl  oxo  phenylhexa   dienoic acid hpda hydrolase the bphd enzyme hydrolyzes a ring cleavage product of an aromatic compound generated in a biphenyl polychlorinated biphenyl pcb degradation pathway of bacteria the crystal structure of the bphd enzyme has been determined at    resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method the final refined model of the bphd enzyme yields an r factor of    at    resolution with reasonable geometry the bphd enzyme is an octameric enzyme with a   point group symmetry the subunit can be divided into core and lid domains the active site of the enzyme is situated in the substrate binding pocket which is located between the two domains the substrate binding pocket can be divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions this feature of the pocket seems to be necessary for substrate binding as the substrate is composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts the proposed orientation of the substrate seems to be consistent with the general catalytic mechanism of    hydrolases
