The acid-denatured form of the protein LysN aggregates reversibly at pH 2.0. The strength of self-association increases with increasing Cl− anion concentration. At low concentrations of protein or Cl−anion, resonances of denatured LysN are in slow exchange with a minor form of the protein, which shows native-like NMR chemical shifts. The minor native-like resonances increase in intensity with increasing protein concentration, demonstrating that a native-like monomer fold is stabilized on aggregation of the acid-denatured protein. At high concentrations of protein or Cl− anion, interconversion between the major and minor resonances appears to shift from slow to intermediate exchange on the NMR timescale. NMR line-broadening is more pronounced for the major resonances of the denatured protein, which show sigmoidal decay curves with increasing Cl− concentration. The mid-points of the decay curves for residues in different parts of the molecule are non-coincident. We propose that differences in the NMR line-broadening transitions of individual residues reflect a stepwise stabilization of native-like structure on aggregation, starting with the segments of the protein that form the initial association interface. The resonances of the denatured protein with the greatest sensitivity to self-association correspond roughly to those that are most perturbed in the native protein on binding of the natural substrate tRNALys. This suggests that the hydrophobic surfaces that promote intermolecular misfolding of acid-denatured LysN, may resemble those used for substrate binding by the native protein.
