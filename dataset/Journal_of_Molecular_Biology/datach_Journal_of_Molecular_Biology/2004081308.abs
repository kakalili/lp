structure of the coat protein in pf bacteriophage determined by solid state nmr spectroscopy
the atomic resolution structure of pf coat protein determined by solid state nmr spectroscopy of magnetically aligned filamentous bacteriophage particles in solution is compared to the structures previously determined by x ray fiber and neutron diffraction the structure of its membrane bound form and the structure of fd coat protein these structural comparisons provide insights into several biological properties differences between class i and class ii filamentous bacteriophages and the assembly process the six n terminal amino acid residues adopt an unusual  double hook  conformation on the outside of the bacteriophage particle the solid state nmr results indicate that at   c some of the coat protein subunits assume a single fully structured conformation and some have a few mobile residues that provide a break between two helical segments in agreement with structural models from x ray fiber and neutron diffraction respectively the atomic resolution structure determined by solid state nmr for residues    and     which excludes the n terminal double hook and the break between the helical segments but encompasses more than   of the backbone including the distinct kink at residue   agrees with that determined by x ray fiber diffraction with an rmsd value of    the symmetry and distance constraints determined by x ray fiber and neutron diffraction enable the construction of an accurate model of the bacteriophage particle from the coordinates of the coat protein monomers
