interplay of posttranslational modifications in sp mediates sp stability during cell cycle progression
although sp is known to undergo posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation glycosylation acetylation sumoylation and ubiquitination little is known about the possible interplay between the different forms of sp that may affect its overall levels it is also unknown whether changes in the levels of sp influence any biological cell processes here we identified rnf as the ubiquitin e ligase of sp  from in vitro and in vivo experiments we found that sumoylated sp can recruit rnf as a ubiquitin e ligase that subjects sumoylated sp to proteasomal degradation sp mapping revealed two ubiquitination related domains a small ubiquitin like modifier in the n terminus of sp lys  and the c terminus of sp that directly interacts with rnf  interestingly when sp was phosphorylated at thr  by c jun nh terminal kinase  during mitosis this phosphorylated form of sp abolished the sp  rnf interaction our results show that while sumoylated sp subjects to proteasomal degradation the phosphorylation that occurs during the cell cycle can protect sp from degradation by repressing the sp  rnf interaction thus we propose that the interplay between posttranslational modifications of sp plays an important role in cell cycle progression and keeps sp at a critical level for mitosis
