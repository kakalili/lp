phosphatidylethanolamine and cardiolipin differentially affect the stability of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes
the mitochondrial inner membrane contains two non bilayer  forming phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine pe and cardiolipin cl  lack of cl leads to destabilization of respiratory chain supercomplexes a reduced activity of cytochrome c oxidase and a reduced inner membrane potential    although pe is more abundant than cl in the mitochondrial inner membrane its role in biogenesis and assembly of inner membrane complexes is unknown we report that similar to the lack of cl pe depletion resulted in a decrease of   and thus in an impaired import of preproteins into and across the inner membrane the respiratory capacity and in particular the activity of cytochrome c oxidase were impaired in pe depleted mitochondria leading to the decrease of    in contrast to depletion of cl depletion of pe did not destabilize respiratory chain supercomplexes but favored the formation of larger supercomplexes megacomplexes between the cytochrome bc complex and the cytochrome c oxidase we conclude that both pe and cl are required for a full activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the efficient generation of the inner membrane potential the mechanisms however are different since these non bilayer  forming phospholipids exert opposite effects on the stability of respiratory chain supercomplexes
