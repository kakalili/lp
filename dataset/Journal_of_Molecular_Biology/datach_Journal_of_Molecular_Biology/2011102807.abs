iron coordinating tyrosine is a key determinant of neat domain heme transfer
in humans heme iron is the most abundant iron source and bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus acquire it for growth isdb of s aureus acquires fe iii  protoporphyrin ix heme from hemoglobin for transfer to isdc via isda these three cell wall anchored isd iron regulated surface determinant proteins contain conserved neat near iron transport domains the purpose of this work was to delineate the mechanism of heme binding and transfer between the neat domains of isda isdb and isdc using a combination of structural and spectroscopic studies x ray crystal structures of isda neat domain isda n  variants reveal that removing the native heme iron ligand tyr  is compensated for by iron coordination by his  on the distal side and that no single mutation of distal loop residues is sufficient to perturb the isda  heme complex also alternate heme iron coordination was observed in structures of isda n bound to reduced fe ii  protoporphyrin ix and co iii  protoporphyrin ix the isda n structural data were correlated with heme transfer kinetics from the neat domains of isdb and isdc we demonstrated that the neat domains transfer heme at rates comparable to full length proteins the second order rate constant for heme transfer from isda n was modestly affected  lt  fold by the isda variants excluding those at tyr   substituting tyr  with ala or phe changed the reaction mechanism to one with two observable steps and decreased observed rates gt  fold to   fold excess isdc  we propose a heme transfer model wherein neat domain complexes pass heme iron directly from an iron coordinating tyr of the donor protein to the homologous tyr residues of the acceptor protein
