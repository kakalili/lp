The concept of multispecific antibodies is of high therapeutic interest but has failed to produce pharmaceutical products due to the poor biophysical properties of such molecules. Here, we propose an alternative and simple way to generate bispecific binding molecules using designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). For this purpose, monovalent DARPins with different epitope specificities were selected against the α chain of the high-affinity receptor for human immunoglobulin E (IgE) (FcɛRIα). Two of the isolated binders interfering with IgE binding to the receptor were joined to each other or to themselves via a flexible protein linker. The resulting bivalent and bispecific DARPins were tested for their ability to prevent allergen-induced cell degranulation using rat basophilic leukemia cells stably transfected with human FcɛRIα. The bispecific DARPin construct was the most potent one, efficiently blocking the IgE–FcɛRI interaction and preventing the release of proinflammatory mediators. Noteworthy, the multivalent and multispecific DARPin construct did not show any alteration of the beneficial biophysical properties of the monovalent parental DARPins. Hence, bispecific DARPins may be used to generate receptor antagonists simultaneously targeting different epitopes on the same molecule. Moreover, they easily overcome the limiting immunoglobulin binding paradigm (one binding molecule=one epitope) and thereby represent an alternative to monoclonal antibodies in cases where the immunoglobulin scaffold is unsuitable.
