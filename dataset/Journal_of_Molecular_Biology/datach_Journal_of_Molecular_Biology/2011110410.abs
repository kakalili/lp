structural change in  sheet a of z   antitrypsin is responsible for accelerated polymerization and disease
the presence of the z mutation glu  lys is responsible for more than   of   antitrypsin   at deficiency cases it leads to increased polymerization of the serpin  at during its synthesis and in circulation it has been proposed that the z mutation results in a conformational change within the folded state of antitrypsin that enhances its polymerization in order to localize the conformational change we have created two single tryptophan mutants of z  at and analyzed their fluorescence properties   at contains two tryptophan residues that are located in distinct regions of the molecule trp  at the top of  sheet a and trp  on  sheet b we have replaced each tryptophan residue individually with a phenylalanine in order to study the local environment of the remaining tryptophan residue in both m and z  at a detailed fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of each mutant was carried out and we detected differences in the emission spectrum the stern  volmer constant for potassium iodide quenching and the anisotropy of only trp  in z  at compared to m  at our data reveal that the z mutation results in a conformational change at the top of  sheet a but does not affect the structural integrity of  sheet b
