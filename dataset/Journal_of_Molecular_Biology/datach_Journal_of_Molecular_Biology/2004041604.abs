crystallographic study of inhibitors of trna guanine transglycosylase suggests a new structure based pharmacophore for virtual screening
the enzyme trna guanine transglycosylase tgt is involved in the pathogenicity of shigellae as the crystal structure of this protein is known it is a putative target for the structure based design of inhibitors here we report a crystallographic study of several new ligands exhibiting a   diamino h quinazolin  one scaffold which has been shown recently to be a promising template for tgt inhibitors crystal structure analysis of these complexes has revealed an unexpected movement of the side chain of asp   a detailed analysis of the water network disrupted by this rotation has lead to the derivation of a new composite pharmacophore a virtual screening has been performed based on this pharmacophore hypothesis and several new inhibitors of micromolar binding affinity with new skeletons have been discovered
