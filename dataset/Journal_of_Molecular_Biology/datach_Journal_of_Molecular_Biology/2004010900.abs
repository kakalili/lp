alternative splicing mechanisms for the modulation of protein function conservation between human and other species
alternative splicing as is an important process in eukaryotic organisms by which a given gene may express a set of different protein isoforms depending on the tissue or the developmental stage of the individual in the present work we have compared as among species focusing on the conservation of as mechanisms for the modulation of protein function for this purpose we first analysed the frequency with which different species human mouse rat and fruitfly utilise them second we focused more directly on the conservation among species of the mechanisms themselves to this end we compared biologically equivalent as events between human and mouse or rat our results indicate only minor differences in the frequency of use of these mechanisms as well as a high degree of conservation among the species studied
