activation of cdc contributes to apoptosis in hpv e expressing human keratinocytes in response to therapeutic agents
infection with human papillomaviruses hpv is strongly associated with the development of cervical cancer the hpv e oncogene induces apoptosis in cervical cancer precursor lesions but the mechanism is poorly understood while it is expected that inactivation of p  by e should lead to a reduction in apoptosis e also sensitizes cells to apoptosis under some experimental conditions here we demonstrate that expression of e in human keratinocytes rendered sensitization to chemotherapeutic agents the cell death was shown to be by apoptosis involving caspase activation and the mitochondria pathway to explore mechanisms involved in sensitization of e expressing cells to apoptosis we used a proteomic approach to identify proteins differentially expressed in e expressing and control keratinocytes among nearly a thousand proteins examined cdc was demonstrated to be the most dramatically up regulated protein in e expressing cells p  degradation appears to be important for the up regulation of cdc by e  using genetic pharmacologic and sirna strategies a role for cdc in e expression conferred apoptosis was demonstrated thus these results have important therapeutic implications in enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy
