a deoxyribozyme sero c uses light and serotonin to repair diverse pyrimidine dimers in dna
an in vitro selection search for dnas capable of catalyzing photochemistry yielded two distinctive deoxyribozymes dnazymes with photolyase activity uv c which repaired thymine dimers within dna using a uv light of gt   nm wavelength and no extraneous cofactor and sero c which required the tryptophan metabolite serotonin as cofactor in addition to the uv light catalysis by sero c conformed to michaelis  menten kinetics and analysis of the action spectrum of sero c confirmed that serotonin did indeed serve as a catalytic cofactor rather than as a structural cofactor sero c and uv c showed strikingly distinct wavelength optima for their respective photoreactivation catalyses although the rate enhancements characteristic of the two dnazymes were similar the cofactor requiring sero c repaired a substantially broader range of substrates compared to uv c including thymine uracil and a range of chimeric deoxypyrimidine and ribopyrimidine dimers similarities and differences in the properties of these two photolyase dnazymes suggest first that the harnessing of less damaging uv light for the repair of photolesions may have been a primordial catalytic activity of nucleic acids and second the broader substrate range of sero c may highlight an evolutionary advantage to coopting amino acid like cofactors by functionality poor nucleic acid enzymes
