contribution of ser  and ser  to activation of interferon regulatory factor
irf  a member of the interferon regulatory factor irf family of transcription factors functions in innate immune defense against viral infection upon infection host cell irf  is activated by phosphorylation at its seven c terminal ser thr residues   sslentvdlhisnshplslts   this phosphoactivation triggers irf  to react with the coactivators creb binding protein cbp p   to form a complex that activates target genes in the nucleus however the role of each phosphorylation site for irf  phosphoactivation remains unresolved to address this issue all seven ser thr potential phosphorylation sites were screened by mutational studies size exclusion chromatography and isothermal titration calorimetry using purified proteins we show that cbp amino acid residues       interacts directly with irf        and six of its single site mutants to form heterodimers but when cbp interacts with irf  s  d oligomerization is evident cbp also interacts in vitro with irf  double site mutants to form different levels of oligomerization among all the single site mutants irf  s  d showed the strongest binding to cbp although irf  s  d alone did not interact as strongly with cbp as did other mutants it strengthened the interaction and oligomerization of irf  s  d with cbp in contrast irf  s  d weakened the interaction and oligomerization of irf  s  d and s    d with cbp thus it appears that ser  and ser  serve antagonistic functions in regulating irf  phosphoactivation these results indicate that ser  and ser  are critical for irf  activation and support a phosphorylation oligomerization model for irf  activation
