origins of programmable nucleases for genome engineering
genome engineering with programmable nucleases depends on cellular responses to a targeted double strand break dsb  the first truly targetable reagents were the zinc finger nucleases zfns showing that arbitrary dna sequences could be addressed for cleavage by protein engineering ushering in the breakthrough in genome manipulation zfns resulted from basic research on zinc finger proteins and the foki restriction enzyme which revealed a bipartite structure with a separable dna binding domain and a non specific cleavage domain  studies on the mechanism of cleavage by  finger zfns established that the preferred substrates were paired binding sites which doubled the size of the target sequence recognition from  to  bp long enough to specify a unique genomic locus in plant and mammalian cells soon afterwards a zfn induced dsb was shown to stimulate homologous recombination in cells transcription activator like effector nucleases talens that are based on bacterial tales fused to the foki cleavage domain expanded this capability the fact that zfns and talens have been used for genome modification of more than  different organisms and cell types attests to the success of protein engineering the most recent technology platform for delivering a targeted dsb to cellular genomes is that of the rna guided nucleases which are based on the naturally occurring type ii prokaryotic crispr cas system unlike zfns and talens that use protein motifs for dna sequence recognition crispr cas depends on rna  dna recognition the advantages of the crispr cas system  the ease of rna design for new targets and the dependence on a single constant cas protein  have led to its wide adoption by research laboratories around the world these technology platforms have equipped scientists with an unprecedented ability to modify cells and organisms almost at will with wide ranging implications across biology and medicine however these nucleases have also been shown to cut at off target sites with mutagenic consequences therefore issues such as efficacy specificity and delivery are likely to drive selection of reagents for particular purposes human therapeutic applications of these technologies will ultimately depend on risk versus benefit analysis and informed consent
