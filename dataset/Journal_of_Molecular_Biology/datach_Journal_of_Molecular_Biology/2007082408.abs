histone hyperacetylation during sv  transcription is regulated by p  and rna polymerase ii translocation
the effects of the rna polymerase ii rnapii translocation inhibitors alpha amanitin and   dichloro  beta d ribobenzimidazole drb and an sirna targeting p  on the presence of rnapii p   hyperacetylated h and h and unmodified h and h in transcribing simian virus   sv  minichromosomes were determined following treatment with alpha amanitin we observed a profound reduction in the occupancy of the promoter by rnapii the loss of p  from chromatin fragments containing rnapii and an increase in the amount of unmodified h and h associated with the rnapii treatment with drb had little effect on the presence of rnapii or p  but also resulted in a significant increase in the amount of unmodified h and h present in chromatin fragments associated with rnapii following treatment with a p  small interfering rna sirna  we observed a significant decrease in late transcription and a corresponding reduction in the amounts of p  and hyperacetylated histones associated with the transcribing sv  minichromosomes we conclude that in transcribing sv  minichromosomes histone hyperacetylation and deacetylation is dependent upon the presence of p  and an as yet unknown histone deacetylase associated with the rnapii complex that occurs coordinately as the rnapii complex moves through a nucleosome
