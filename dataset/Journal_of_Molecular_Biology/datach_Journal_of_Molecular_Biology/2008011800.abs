predicting the magnitude of the reflex response to insertions in ubiquitin
the ability to predict the structural response of a protein to an insertion would be a significant advance for the fields of homology modeling and protein design however the effects of insertions on protein conformation are not well understood previous work has demonstrated that for two loops in ubiquitin the primary determinant of the structural adaptation to insertions is the insertion site rather than the sequence of the insertion this phenomenon was termed the reflex response of loops to insertions we report herein the analysis of ubiquitin mutants with insertions in two other loops this study demonstrates that the insertion site is the primary determinant of the response to insertions for these two new loops as well which further supports the reflex response hypothesis we also attempted to predict the relative magnitudes of the responses at each site but were unsuccessful using the additional data collected in this work we have refined our predictive hypothesis
