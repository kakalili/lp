control of directionality in l integrase mediated site specific recombination
mycobacteriophage l is a temperate phage that forms lysogens in mycobacterium smegmatis these lysogens carry an integrated l prophage inserted at a specific chromosomal location and undergo subsequent excision during induction of lytic growth both the integrative and excisive site specific recombination events are catalyzed by the phage encoded tyrosine integrase int l  and require the host encoded protein mihf the directionality of these recombination events is determined by a second phage encoded protein excise the product of gene   xis l  integration occurs efficiently in the absence of xis l while excision is dependent upon it we show here that xis l binds to attr dna introduces a dna bend and facilitates the formation of an intasome r complex this complex which requires mihf xis l and int l  readily recombines with a second intasome formed by int l  mihf and attl dna intasome l to generate the attp and attb products of excision xis l also strongly inhibits int l mediated integrative recombination but does not prevent either the protein  dna interactions that form the attp intasome intasome p or the capture of attb but acts later in the reaction presumably by preventing the formation of a recombinagenic synaptic intermediate the mechanism of action of xis l appears to be purely architectural influencing the assembly of protein  dna structures solely through its dna binding and dna bending properties
