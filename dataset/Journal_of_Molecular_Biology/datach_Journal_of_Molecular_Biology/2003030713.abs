coupling of drug protonation to the specific binding of aminoglycosides to the a site of  s rrna elucidation of the number of drug amino groups involved and their identities
deoxystreptamine  dos aminoglycoside antibiotics bind specifically to the central region of the  s rrna a site and interfere with protein synthesis recently we have shown that the binding of  dos aminoglycosides to an a site model rna oligonucleotide is linked to the protonation of drug amino groups here we extend these studies to define the number of amino groups involved as well as their identities specifically we use ph dependent  n nmr spectroscopy to determine the pka values of the amino groups in neomycin b paromomycin i and lividomycin a sulfate with the resulting pka values ranging from   to    for each drug the  amino group was associated with the lowest pka with this value being   in neomycin b    in paromomycin i and   in lividomycin a in addition we use buffer dependent isothermal titration calorimetry itc to determine the number of protons linked to the complexation of the three drugs with the a site model rna oligomer at ph      or   at ph   the binding of the three drugs to the host rna is independent of drug protonation effects by contrast at ph   the rna binding of paromomycin i and neomycin b is coupled to the uptake of   and   protons respectively with the rna binding of lividomycin a at ph   being coupled to the uptake of   protons a comparison of these values with the protonation states of the drugs predicted by our nmr derived pka values allows us to identify the specific drug amino groups whose protonation is linked to complexation with the host rna these determinations reveal that the binding of lividomycin a to the host rna is coupled to the protonation of all five of its amino groups with the rna binding of paromomycin i and neomycin b being linked to the protonation of four and at least five amino groups respectively for paromomycin i the protonation reactions involve the        and   amino groups while for neomycin b the binding linked protonation reactions involve at least the           and   amino groups our results clearly identify drug protonation reactions as important thermodynamic participants in the specific binding of  dos aminoglycosides to the a site of  s rrna
