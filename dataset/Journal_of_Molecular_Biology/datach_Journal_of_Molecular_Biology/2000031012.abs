site specific recombination in human cells catalyzed by phage  integrase mutants e lorbach and n christ contributed equally to this work  edited by m yaniv
phage lambda integrase int is the prototype of the so called integrase family of conservative site specific recombinases which includes cre and flp the natural function of int is to execute integration and excision of the phage into and out of the escherichia coli genome respectively in contrast to cre and flp however wild type int requires accessory proteins and dna supercoiling of target sites to catalyze recombination here we show that two mutant int proteins int h e  k and its derivative int h   e  k e  k  which do not require accessory factors are proficient to perform intramolecular integrative and excisive recombination in co transfection assays inside human cells intramolecular integrative recombination is also detectable by southern analysis in human reporter cell lines harboring target sites attb and attp as stable genomic sequences recombination by wild type int however is not detectable by this method the latter result implies that eukaryotic co factors which could functionally replace the prokaryotic ones normally required for wild type int are most likely not present in human cells
