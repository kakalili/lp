subunit residues      and      are commonly used by e   and e   rna polymerase for open promoter complex formation
during transcription initiation by dna dependent rna polymerase rnap promoter dna has to be melted locally to allow the synthesis of rna transcript localized melting of promoter dna is a target for genetic regulation and is poorly understood at the molecular level the escherichia coli rnap holoenzyme is a six subunit         e  protein complex the  subunit is directly responsible for promoter recognition and contributes to localized dna melting mutations in the  subunit have profound effects on promoter melting by e   the   subunit is a representative of an unrelated class of the  subunits here we determined whether mutations in the  subunit that affect late stages of promoter complex formation by e   also influence promoter complex formation by the enhancer dependent e   analyses of in vitro defects in promoter complex formation and transcription initiation exhibited by mutant e   suggest that during promoter complex formation by e   and e   a common set of  subunit sequences is used late stages of promoter complex formation and localized melting of promoter dna by e   and e   thus proceed through a common pathway
