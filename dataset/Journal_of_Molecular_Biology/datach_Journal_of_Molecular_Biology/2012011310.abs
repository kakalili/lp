altered strand transfer activity of a multiple drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase mutant with a dipeptide fingers domain insertion
prolonged highly active anti retroviral therapy with multiple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for the treatment of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  can induce the development of an hiv  reverse transcriptase rt harboring a dipeptide insertion at the rt fingers domain with a background thymidine analog mutation this mutation renders viral resistance to multiple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors we investigated the effect of the dipeptide fingers domain insertion mutation on strand transfer activity using two clinical rt variants isolated during the pre treatment and post treatment of an infected patient termed pre drug rt without dipeptide insertion and post drug rt with ser gly insertion respectively first the post drug rt displayed elevated strand transfer activity compared to the pre drug rt with two different rna templates second the post drug rt exhibited less rna template degradation than the pre drug rt but higher polymerization dependent rnase h activity third the post drug rt had a faster association rate kon for template binding and a lower equilibrium binding constant kd for the template leading to a template binding affinity tighter than that of the pre drug rt the koff values for the pre drug rt and the post drug rt were similar finally the removal of the dipeptide insertion from the post drug rt abolished the elevated strand transfer activity and rnase h activity in addition to the loss of azidothymidine resistance these biochemical data suggest that the dipeptide insertion elevates strand transfer activity by increasing the interaction of the rt with the rna donor template promoting cleavage that generates more invasion sites for the acceptor template during dna synthesis
