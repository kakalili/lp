nmr based substrate analog docking to escherichia coli peptidyl trna hydrolase
escherichia coli peptidyl trna hydrolase activity is inhibited by    l n n diacetyl lysinyl amino   deoxyadenosine a stable mimic of the minimalist substrate      o l n n diacetyl lysinyl adenosine the complex of this mimic with the enzyme has been analyzed by nmr spectroscopy enabling experimental mapping of the catalytic center for the first time chemical shift variations point out the sensitivity of residues asn  met  asn  gly   asn   leu   lys   gly   phe   and val  to complex formation docking simulations based on ambiguous interaction restraints involving these residues show bondings of the peptide moiety of    l n n diacetyl lysinyl amino   deoxyadenosine with asn  asn  and asn   a stacking interaction of phe  with the purine is also indicated drawn is a model of enzyme bound peptidyl trna substrate in which  i the asn    nh group holds the water molecule that participates in the hydrolysis of the substrate while tyr  binds the phosphate in the   position of the   terminal trna adenosine  ii the   nh group of asn  holds the main chain carbonyl of the c terminal residue of the peptide esterified to trna and iii the   nh group of asn  holds the main chain carbonyl of the penultimate c residue functional value is given to this model by i showing that the enzyme becomes confusable with an aminoacyl trna hydrolase upon mutagenesis of asn  and ii reinterpreting already obtained site directed mutagenesis data
