myofibrillar troponin exists in three states and there is signal transduction along skeletal myofibrillar thin filaments
activation of striated muscle contraction is a highly cooperative signal transduction process converting calcium binding by troponin c tnc into interactions between thin and thick filaments once calcium is bound transduction involves changes in protein interactions along the thin filament the process is thought to involve three different states of actin tropomyosin tm resulting from changes in troponin s tn interaction with actin tm a blocked b state preventing myosin interaction a closed c state allowing weak myosin interactions and favored by calcium binding to tn and an open or m state allowing strong myosin interactions this was tested by measuring the apparent rate of tn dissociation from rigor skeletal myofibrils using labeled tn exchange the location and rate of exchange of tn or its subunits were measured by high resolution fluorescence microscopy and image analysis three different rates of tn exchange were observed that were dependent on calcium concentration and strong cross bridge binding that strongly support the three state model the rate of tn dissociation in the non overlap region was   fold faster at pca  c state region than at pca  b state region  when tn contained engineered tnc mutants with weakened regulatory tni interactions the apparent exchange rate at pca  in the non overlap region increased proportionately with tni  tnc regulatory affinity this suggests that the mechanism of calcium enhancement of the rate of tn dissociation is by favoring a tni  tnc interaction over a tni  actin  tm interaction at pca  the rate of tn dissociation in the overlap region m state region was   fold faster than the non overlap region b state region suggesting that strong cross bridges increase the rate of tn dissociation at pca  the rate of tn dissociation was twofold faster in the non overlap region c state region than the overlap region m state region that likely involved a strong cross bridge influence on tnt s interaction with actin tm at sub maximal calcium pca       there was a long range influence of the strong cross bridge on tn to enhance its dissociation rate tens of nanometers from the strong cross bridge these observations suggest that the three different states of actin tm are associated with three different states of tn they also support a model in which strong cross bridges shift the regulatory equilibrium from a tni  actin  tm interaction to a tnc  tni interaction that likely enhances calcium binding by tnc
