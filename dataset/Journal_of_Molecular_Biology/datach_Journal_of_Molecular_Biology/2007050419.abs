ribosomal protein s is not essential for the trans translation machinery
in eubacteria ribosome stalling during protein synthesis is rescued by a tmrna derived trans translation system because ribosomal protein s specifically binds to tmrna with high affinity it is considered to be involved in the trans translation system however the role of s in trans translation is still unclear to study the function of s in the trans translation system we constructed an s free cell free translation system we found that trans translation proceeded even in the absence of s  addition of s into the s free system did not affect trans translation efficiency these results suggest that s does not play a role in the trans translation machinery
