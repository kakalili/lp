the outer membrane usher guarantees the formation of functional pili by selectively catalyzing donor strand exchange between subunits that are adjacent in the mature pilus
type  pili from uropathogenic escherichia coli are a prototype of adhesive surface organelles assembled and secreted by the conserved chaperone usher pathway they are composed of four different homologous protein subunits that need to be assembled in a defined order in the periplasm the pilus chaperone fimc donates a  strand segment to the subunits to complete their imperfect immunoglobulin like fold during subunit assembly this segment of the chaperone is displaced by an amino terminal extension of an incoming subunit in a reaction termed donor strand exchange to date the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordinated subunit assembly in particular the role of the outer membrane usher fimd are still poorly understood here we show that the binding of complexes between fimc and the different pilus subunits to the amino terminal substrate recognition domain of fimd is an extremely fast process with association rate constants in the range of      m   s   at    c furthermore we demonstrate that the ordered assembly of pilus subunits is a consequence of the usher s ability to selectively catalyze the assembly of defined subunit  subunit pairs that are adjacent in the mature pilus the usher therefore coordinates the assembly of pilus subunits at the stage of donor strand exchange between pairs of subunits and not at the level of the initial binding of chaperone  subunit complexes
