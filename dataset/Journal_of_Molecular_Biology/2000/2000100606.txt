Antibody 21D8 catalyzes the solvent-sensitive decarboxylation of 3-carboxybenzisoxazoles. The crystal structure of chimeric Fab 21D8 with and without hapten at 1.61 Å and 2.10 Å, respectively, together with computational analysis, shows how a melange of polar and non-polar sites are exploited to achieve both substrate binding and acceleration of a reaction normally facilitated by purely aprotic dipolar media. The striking similarity of the decarboxylase and a series of unrelated esterase antibodies also highlights the chemical versatility of structurally conserved anion binding sites and the relatively subtle changes involved in fine-tuning the immunoglobulin pocket for recognition of different ligands and catalysis of different reactions.
