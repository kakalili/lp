fibril formation of hsp  homologue proteins and determination of fibril core regions differences in fibril core regions dependent on subtle differences in amino acid sequence
heat shock protein   hsp  is a member of the molecular chaperones and works with hsp  in mediating various protein folding reactions groes is a representative protein of hsp  from escherichia coli recently we found that groes formed a typical amyloid fibril from a guanidine hydrochloride gdn  hcl unfolded state at neutral ph here we report that other hsp  homologues such as human hsp  hhsp   rat mitochondrial hsp  rhsp   gp  from t phage and hsp  from the hyperthermophilic bacteria thermotoga maritima also form amyloid fibrils from an unfolded state interestingly whereas groes formed fibrils from either the gdn  hcl unfolded state at neutral ph or the acidic unfolded state at ph       hhsp  rhsp  and gp  formed fibrils from only the acidic unfolded state core peptide regions of these protein fibrils were determined by proteolysis treatment followed by a combination of edman degradation and mass spectroscopy analyses of the protease resistant peptides the core peptides of groes fibrils were identical for fibrils formed from the gdn  hcl unfolded state and those formed from the acidic unfolded state however a peptide with a different sequence was isolated from fibrils of hhsp  and rhsp  with the use of synthesized peptides of the determined core regions it was also confirmed that the identified regions were capable of fibril formation these findings suggested that groes homologues formed typical amyloid fibrils under acidic unfolding conditions but that the fibril core structures were different perhaps owing to differences in local amino acid sequences
