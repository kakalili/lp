duplex unwinding and atpase activities of the dead box helicase eif a are coupled by eif g and eif b
eukaryotic initiation factor eif  a is a dead box helicase that stimulates translation initiation by unwinding mrna secondary structure the accessory proteins eif g eif b and eif h enhance the duplex unwinding activity of eif a but the extent to which they modulate eif a activity is poorly understood here we use real time fluorescence assays to determine the kinetic parameters of duplex unwinding and atp hydrolysis by these initiation factors to ensure efficient duplex unwinding eif b and eif g cooperatively activate the duplex unwinding activity of eif a our data reveal that eif h is much less efficient at stimulating eif a unwinding activity than eif b implying that eif h is not able to completely substitute for eif b in duplex unwinding by monitoring unwinding and atpase assays under identical conditions we demonstrate that eif b couples the atp hydrolysis cycle of eif a with strand separation thereby minimizing nonproductive unwinding events using duplex substrates with altered gc contents but similar predicted thermal stabilities we further show that the rate of formation of productive unwinding complexes is strongly influenced by the local stability per base pair in addition to the stability of the entire duplex this finding explains how a change in the gc content of a hairpin is able to influence translation initiation while maintaining the overall predicted thermal stability
