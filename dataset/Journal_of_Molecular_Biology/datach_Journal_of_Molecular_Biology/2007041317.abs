nuclear transport of ras associated tumor suppressor proteins different transport receptor binding specificities for arginine rich nuclear targeting signals
ras proteins regulate a wide range of biological processes by interacting with a variety of effector proteins in addition to the known role in tumorigensis the activated form of ras exhibits growth inhibitory effects by unknown mechanisms several ras effector proteins identified as mediators of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest also exhibit properties normally associated with tumor suppressor proteins here we show that ras effector rassf nore  binds strongly to k ras but weakly to both n ras and h ras rassf was found to localize both in the nucleus and the nucleolus in contrast to other ras effector proteins rassf c and rassf  which are localized in the nucleus and excluded from nucleolus a  amino acid residue transferable arginine rich nucleolar localization signal nols identified in rassf is capable of interacting with importin beta and transporting the cargo into the nucleolus surprisingly similar arginine rich signals identified in rassf c and rassf interact with importin alpha and transport the heterologous cytoplasmic proteins to the nucleus interestingly mutation of arginine residues within these nuclear targeting signals prevented interaction of ras effector proteins with respective transport receptors and abolished their nuclear translocation these results provide evidence for the first time that arginine rich signals are able to recognize different nuclear import receptors and transport the rassf proteins into distinct sub cellular compartments in addition our data suggest that the nuclear localization of rassf is critical for its cell growth control activity together these data suggest that the transport of ras effector superfamily proteins into the nucleus nucleolus may play a vital role in modulating ras mediated cell proliferation during tumorigenesis
