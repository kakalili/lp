We have recently shown that the anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) selectively represses nuclear hormone receptors. In this study, we found that LeTx repressed the activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter related to overexpression of the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor 3, octamer-binding protein 1, and c-Jun. LeTx transcriptional repression was associated with a decrease in the protein levels of these transcription factors in a lethal factor protease activity-dependent manner. Early administration of LeTx antagonists partially or completely abolished the repressive effects of LeTx. In contrast to the rapid cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases by LeTx, the degradation of these transcription factors occurred at a relatively late stage after LeTx treatment. In addition, LeTx repressed phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced mouse mammary tumor virus promoter activity and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate induction of endogenous c-Jun protein. Collectively, these findings suggest that transcription factors are intracellular targets of LeTx and expand our understanding of the molecular action of LeTx at a later stage of low-dose exposure.
