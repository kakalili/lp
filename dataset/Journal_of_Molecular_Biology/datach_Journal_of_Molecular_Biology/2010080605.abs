k r and k a substitutions in hiv  reverse transcriptase enhance polymerase fidelity by decreasing both dntp misinsertion and mispaired primer extension efficiencies
lys  residue in the fingers domain of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase rt  interacts with incoming dntp in a sequence independent fashion we showed previously that a  amino acid deletion spanning lys  and a k a substitution both enhanced the fidelity of dntp insertion we hypothesized that the lys  residue enhances dntp misinsertion via interactions with the  phosphate of the incoming dntp we now examine this hypothesis in pre steady state kinetic studies using wild type human immunodeficiency virus  rt and two substitution mutants k a and k r k r mutation did not greatly increase misinsertion fidelity but k a mutation led to higher incorporation fidelity for a misinsertion to become a permanent error it needs to be accompanied by the extension of the mispaired terminus thus formed both mutants and the wild type enzyme discriminated against the mismatched primer at the catalytic step kpol  additionally k a and k r mutants displayed a further decrease in mismatch extension efficiency primarily at the level of dntp binding we employed hydroxyl radical footprinting to determine the position of the rt on the primer template the wild type and lys  substituted enzymes occupied the same position at the primer terminus the presence of a mismatched primer terminus caused all three enzymes to be displaced to a   position relative to the primer   end in the context of an efficiently extended mismatched terminus the presence of the next complementary nucleotide overcame the displacement resulting in a complex resembling the matched terminus the results are consistent with the observed reduction in kpol in mispaired primer extension being due to the position of the enzyme at a mismatched terminus our work shows the influence of the stabilizing interactions of lys  with the incoming dntp on two different aspects of polymerase fidelity
