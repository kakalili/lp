dynamics of dna loop capture by the sfii restriction endonuclease on supercoiled and relaxed dna
the sfii endonuclease is a prototype for dna looping it binds two copies of its recognition sequence and if mg  is present cuts both concertedly looping was examined here on supercoiled and relaxed forms of a   kb plasmid with three sfii sites sites  and  were separated by   kb and sites  and  by   kb sfii converted this plasmid directly to the products cut at all three sites though dna species cleaved at one or two sites were formed transiently during a burst phase the burst revealed three sets of doubly cut products corresponding to the three possible pairings of sites the equilibrium distribution between the different loops was evaluated from the burst phases of reactions initiated by adding mgcl to sfii bound to the plasmid the short loop was favored over the longer loops particularly on supercoiled dna the relative rates for loop capture were assessed after adding sfii to solutions containing the plasmid and mgcl  on both supercoiled and relaxed dna the rate of loop capture across   kb was only marginally faster than over   kb or   kb the relative strengths and rates of looping were compared to computer simulations of conformational fluctuations in dna the simulations concurred broadly with the experimental data though they predicted that increasing site separations should cause a shallower decline in the equilibrium constants than was observed but a slightly steeper decline in the rates for loop capture possible reasons for these discrepancies are discussed
