pah domain specific interactions of the arabidopsis transcription coregulator sin like  snl  with telomere binding protein  and always early myb dna binding factors
the eukaryotic sin protein is the central component of the evolutionarily conserved multisubunit sin complex that has roles in regulating gene expression and genome stability here we characterise the structure of the sin protein in higher plants through the analysis of snl  sin like  snl  snl  snl  snl and snl  a family of six sin homologues in arabidopsis thaliana in an arabidopsis protoplast  glucuronidase reporter gene assay as well as in a heterologous yeast repression assay full length snl was shown to repress transcription in a histone deacetylase dependent manner demonstrating the conserved nature of sin function yeast two hybrid screening identified a number of dna binding proteins each containing a single myb domain that included the arabidopsis always early proteins ataly and ataly  and two telomere binding proteins attbp and attrp trfl as snl partners suggesting potential functions for snl in development and telomere maintenance the interaction with telomere binding protein  was found to be mediated through the well defined paired amphipathic helix domain pah  in contrast the ataly interaction was mediated through the pah domain of snl  which is structurally distinct from pah and pah  suggesting that evolution of this domain to a more novel structural motif has occurred these findings support a diverse role of snl in the regulation of transcription and genome stability
