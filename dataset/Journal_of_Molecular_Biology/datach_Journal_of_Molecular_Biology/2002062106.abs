folding and oxidation of the antibody domain ch
the non covalent homodimer formed by the c terminal domains of the igg heavy chains ch  is the simplest naturally occurring model system for studying immunoglobulin folding and assembly in the native state the intrachain disulfide bridge which connects a three stranded and a four stranded  sheet is buried in the hydrophobic core of the protein here we show that the disulfide bridge is not required for folding and association since the reduced ch domain folds to a dimer with defined secondary and tertiary structure however the thermodynamic stability of the reduced ch dimer is much lower than that of the oxidized state this allows the formation of disulfide bonds either concomitant with folding starting from the reduced denatured state or after folding starting from the reduced dimer  the analysis of the two processes revealed that under all conditions investigated one of the cysteine residues cys   reacts preferentially with oxidized glutathione to a mixed disulfide that subsequently interacts with the less reactive second thiol group of the intra molecular disulfide bond for folded ch  the second step in the oxidation process is slow in contrast starting from the unfolded and reduced protein the oxidation reaction is faster however the overall folding reaction of ch during oxidative folding is a slow process especially dimerization is slow compared to the association starting from the denatured oxidized state this deceleration may be due to misfolded conformations trapped by the disulfide bridge
