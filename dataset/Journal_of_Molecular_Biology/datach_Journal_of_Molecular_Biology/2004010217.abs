direct phage to intrabody screening dpis  demonstration by isolation of cytosolic intrabodies against the tes site of epstein barr virus latent membrane protein  lmp  that block nf  b transactivation
the expression of intracellular antibodies intrabodies in eukaryotic cells has provided a powerful tool to manipulate microbial and cellular signaling pathways in a highly precise manner however there have been several technical issues that have restricted their more widespread use in particular single chain antibodies sfv have been reported to fold poorly in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm and as such there has been a reluctance to use sfv phage libraries as a source of intrabodies unless a pre selection step to identify these rare sfvs from natural libraries or libraries of engineering sfvs that could fold properly in the absence of disulfide bonds were used here we investigated whether target specific sfvs that are isolated from a  billion member non immune human sfv phage display library could be directly screened in pools as intrabodies without prior knowledge of their individual identity or purity within pools of antigen specific sfvs as the target we used a synthetic transformation effector site  tes  polypeptide comprising the membrane most proximal  amino acid residues of the carboxy terminal cytoplasmic tail of the oncogenic latent membrane protein  lmp  of epstein barr virus which serves as a docking site for adapter proteins of the tumor necrosis factor tnf receptor tnfr associated factor traf family anti tes sfvs initially identified by phage elisa screens were grouped into pools according to the absorbance reading of the antigen specific phage elisa assays and then transferred as pools into eukaryotic expression vectors and expressed as cytoplasmic intrabodies using the pooling strategy there was no loss of individual anti tes sfvs in the transfer from prokaryotic to eukaryotic expression vectors in addition the initial assignments into sfv pools based on phage elisa readings allowed the segregation of individual anti tes sfvs into discrete or minimally overlapping intrabody pools further assessment of the biological activity of the anti tes intrabody pools demonstrated that they were all able to selectively block f lmp induced nf b activity that was mediated through the tes site and to bind lmp protein with high efficiency this direct phage to intrabody screening dpis strategy should allow investigators to bypass much of the in vitro sfv characterization that is often not predictive of in vivo intrabody function and provide a more efficient use of large native and synthetic sfv phage libraries already in existence to identify intrabodies that are active in vivo
