biophysical characterisation of the small ankyrin repeat protein myotrophin
the   residue protein myotrophin is composed of four ankyrin repeats that stack linearly to form an elongated predominantly  helical structure the protein folds via a two state mechanism at equilibrium the free energy change of unfolding in water  gu nh o is   kcal mol   the chevron plot reveals that the folding reaction has a broad energy barrier and that it conforms to a two state mechanism the rate of folding in water kfh o of   s   is several orders of magnitude slower than the value predicted by topological calculations proline mutants were used to show that the minor kinetic phases observed for myotrophin arise from heterogeneity of the ground states due to cis trans isomerisation of prolyl as well as non prolyl peptide bonds myotrophin is the first example of a naturally occurring ankyrin repeat protein that conforms to an apparent two state mechanism at equilibrium and under kinetic conditions making it highly suitable for high resolution protein folding studies
