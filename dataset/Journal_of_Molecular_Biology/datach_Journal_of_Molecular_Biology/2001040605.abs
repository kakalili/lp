the importance of hinge sequence for loop function and catalytic activity in the reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase edited by p e wright
we have determined the sequence requirements for the n terminal protein hinge of the active site lid of triosephosphate isomerase the codons for the hinge pvw were replaced with a genetic library of all possible   amino acid combinations the most active of these   mutants were selected using in vivo complementation of a triosephosphate isomerase deficient strain of escherichia coli df   approximately    of the mutants complement df  with an activity that is between  and   of wild type activity they all contain pro at the first position furthermore the sequences of these hinge mutants reveal that hydrophobic packing is very important for efficient formation of the enediol intermediate however the reduced catalytic activities observed are not due to increased rates of loop opening to explore the relationship between the n terminal and c terminal hinges three semi active mutants from the n terminal hinge selection experiment plh phs and ptf  and six active c terminal hinge mutants from previous work nss lwa ysl ktk npn kva were combined to form    double hinge  mutants the activities of these mutants suggest that the n terminal and c terminal hinge structures affect one another it appears that specific side chain interactions are important for forming a catalytically active enzyme but not for preventing release of the unstable enediol intermediate from the active site of the enzyme the independence of intermediate release on amino acid sequence is consistent with the absence of a  universal  hinge sequence in structurally related enzymes
