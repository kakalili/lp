recognition of a cxcr sulfotyrosine by the chemokine stromal cell derived factor   sdf   cxcl
tyrosine sulfation of the chemokine receptor cxcr enhances its interaction with the chemokine sdf   given similar post translational modification of other receptors including ccr  cx cr and ccr b tyrosine sulfation may be of universal importance in chemokine signaling n terminal domains from seven transmembrane chemokine receptors have been employed for structural studies of chemokine  receptor interactions but never in the context of proper post translational modifications known to affect function a cxcr peptide modified at position  by expressed tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase  and unmodified peptide are both disordered in solution but bind sdf   with low micromolar affinities nmr and fluorescence polarization measurements showed that the cxcr peptide stabilizes dimeric sdf   and that sulfotyrosine  binds a specific site on the chemokine that includes arginine   we conclude that the sdf   dimer preferentially interacts with receptor peptide and residues beyond the extreme n terminal region of cxcr  including sulfotyrosine   make specific contacts with the chemokine ligand
