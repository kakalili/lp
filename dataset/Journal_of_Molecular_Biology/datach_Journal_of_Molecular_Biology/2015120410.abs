conformational transitions that enable histidine kinase autophosphorylation and receptor array integration
during bacterial chemotaxis transmembrane chemoreceptor arrays regulate autophosphorylation of the dimeric histidine kinase chea the five domains of chea p  p  each play a specific role in coupling receptor stimulation to chea activity biochemical and x ray scattering studies of thermostable chea from thermotoga maritima determine that the his containing substrate domain p  is sequestered by interactions that depend upon p of the adjacent subunit non hydrolyzable atp analogs but not atp or adp release p from the protein core domains p p p  and increase its mobility detachment of both p domains or removal of one within a dimer increases net autophosphorylation substantially at physiological temperature   c  however nearly all activity is lost without the dimerization domain p  the linker length between p and p dictates intersubunit trans versus intrasubunit cis autophosphorylation with the trans reaction requiring a minimum length of  residues a new crystal structure of the most active dimerization plus kinase unit p p  reveals trans directing interactions between the tether connecting p to p  p and the adjacent atp binding p  domain the orientation of p relative to p in the p p structure supports a planar chea conformation that is required by membrane array models and it suggests that the atp lid of chea may be poised to interact with receptors and coupling proteins collectively these data suggest that the p domains are restrained in the off state as a result of cross subunit interactions perturbations at the nucleotide binding pocket increase p mobility and access of the substrate his to p bound atp
