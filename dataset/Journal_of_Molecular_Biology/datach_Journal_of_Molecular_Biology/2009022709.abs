purified membrane containing procapsids of bacteriophage prd package the viral genome
icosahedral tailed double stranded dna dsdna bacteriophages and herpesviruses translocate viral dna into a preformed procapsid in an atp driven reaction by a packaging complex that operates at a portal vertex a similar packaging system operates in the tailless dsdna phage prd  tectiviridae family  except that there is an internal membrane vesicle in the procapsid the unit length linear dsdna genome with covalently linked   terminal proteins enters the procapsid through a unique vertex two small integral membrane proteins p  and p  provide a conduit for dna translocation the packaging machinery also contains the packaging atpase p and the packaging efficiency factor p  here we describe a method used to obtain purified packaging competent prd procapsids the optimized in vitro packaging system allowed efficient packaging of defined dna substrates we determined that the genome terminal protein p is necessary for packaging and provided an estimation of the packaging rate
