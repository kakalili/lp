the role of rna interference in stem cell biology beyond the mutant phenotypes
complex gene regulation systems ensure the maintenance of cellular identity during early development in mammals eukaryotic small rnas have emerged as critical players in rna interference rnai by mediating gene silencing during embryonic stem cell self renewal most of the proteins involved in the biogenesis of small rnas are essential for proliferation and differentiation into the three germ layers of mouse embryonic stem cells in the last decade new functions for some rnai proteins independent of their roles in rnai pathways have been demonstrated in different biological systems in parallel new concepts in stem cell biology have emerged here we review and integrate the current understanding of how rnai proteins regulate stem cell identity with the new advances in the stem cell field and the recent non canonical functions of the rnai proteins finally we propose a reevaluation of all rnai mutant phenotypes as non canonical small non coding rna independent functions may contribute to the molecular mechanisms governing mouse embryonic stem cells commitment
