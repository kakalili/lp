ug repeats tdp  interactions near   splice sites exert unpredictable effects on splicing modulation
tdp  is a nuclear protein implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with broad involvement in numerous stages of rna processing ranging from transcription to translation in diseased neurons tdp  mostly aggregates in the cytoplasm suggesting that a loss of protein function in the nucleus may play an important role in neurodegeneration a better understanding of tdp  general nuclear functions is therefore an essential step to evaluate this possibility presently the tdp  best characterized functional property is its ability to modulate pre mrna splicing when binding in proximity of   ss acceptor sequences in this work using a variety of artificial and natural splicing substrates we have investigated the effects of tdp  binding to ug repeats in the vicinity of   ss donor sequences in general our results show that ug repeats are not powerful splicing regulatory elements when located near to exonic   ss sequences however in cases like the brca  etf  and rxrg genes tdp  binding to natural ug repeated sequences can act as either an activator or a suppressor of   ss recognition depending on splice site strength and on the presence of additional splicing regulatory sequences the results of this analysis suggest that a role of ug repeats tdp  in   ss recognition may exists and may become critical in the presence of mutations that weaken the   ss the general rule that can be drawn at the moment is that the importance of ug repeats near   splice sites should always be experimentally validated on a case by case basis
