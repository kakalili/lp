a genome wide ras effector interaction network
here using structural information and protein design tools we have drawn the network of interactions between  ras subfamily proteins with  putative ras binding domains to validate this network we have cloned six poorly characterized ras binding domains rbd and two ras proteins rerg diras  these together with previously described rbd domains ras and rap proteins have been analyzed in  pull down experiments comparing our interaction network with these and previous pull down experiments total of   cases shows a very high accuracy for distinguishing between binders and non binders      bioinformatics information was integrated to distinguish those in vitro interactions that are more likely to be relevant in vivo we proposed several new interactions between ras family members and effector domains that are of relevance in understanding the physiological role of these proteins more broadly our results demonstrate that domain  domain interaction specificities between members of protein families can be accurately predicted using structural information
