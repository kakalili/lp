structural characterization of intramolecular hg  transfer between flexibly linked domains of mercuric ion reductase
the enzyme mercuric ion reductase mera is the central component of bacterial mercury resistance encoded by the mer operon many mera proteins possess metallochaperone like n terminal domains  nmera that can transfer hg  to the catalytic core domain core for reduction to hg  these domains are tethered to the homodimeric core by    residue linkers that are susceptible to proteolysis the latter of which has prevented characterization of the interactions of nmera and the core in the full length protein here we report purification of homogeneous full length mera from the tn  mer operon using a fusion protein construct and combine small angle x ray scattering and small angle neutron scattering with molecular dynamics simulation to characterize the structures of full length wild type and mutant mera proteins that mimic the system before and during handoff of hg  from nmera to the core the radii of gyration distance distribution functions and kratky plots derived from the small angle x ray scattering data are consistent with full length mera adopting elongated conformations as a result of flexibility in the linkers to the nmera domains the scattering profiles are best reproduced using an ensemble of linker conformations this flexible attachment of nmera may facilitate fast and efficient removal of hg  from diverse protein substrates using a specific mutant of mera allowed the formation of a metal mediated interaction between nmera and the core and the determination of the position and relative orientation of nmera to the core during hg  handoff
