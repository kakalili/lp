cryo em structure of the archaeal  s ribosomal subunit in complex with initiation factor  and implications for ribosome evolution
translation of mrna into proteins by the ribosome is universally conserved in all cellular life the composition and complexity of the translation machinery differ markedly between the three domains of life organisms from the domain archaea show an intermediate level of complexity sharing several additional components of the translation machinery with eukaryotes that are absent in bacteria one of these translation factors is initiation factor  if  which associates with the large ribosomal subunit we have reconstructed the  s ribosomal subunit from the archaeon methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus in complex with archaeal if at     resolution using cryo electron microscopy em  the structure provides detailed architectural insights into the  s ribosomal subunit from a methanogenic archaeon through identification of the rrna expansion segments and ribosomal proteins that are shared between this archaeal ribosome and eukaryotic ribosomes but are mostly absent in bacteria and in some archaeal lineages furthermore the structure reveals that in spite of highly divergent evolutionary trajectories of the ribosomal particle and the acquisition of novel functions of if in eukaryotes the molecular binding of if on the ribosome is conserved between eukaryotes and archaea the structure also provides a snapshot of the reductive evolution of the archaeal ribosome and offers new insights into the evolution of the translation system in archaea
