transcription pattern of p  targeted dna repair genes in the hypoxia tolerant subterranean mole rat spalax
the tumor suppressor gene p  induces growth arrest and or apoptosis in response to dna damage hypoxia inactivation of p  confers a selective advantage to tumor cells under a hypoxic microenvironment during tumor progression the subterranean blind mole rat spalax spends its life underground at low oxygen tensions hence developing a wide range of respiratory molecular adaptations to hypoxic stress including critical changes in p  structure and signaling pathway the highly conserved p  arg r   is substituted by lysine k in spalax identical with a tumor associated mutation functionality assays revealed that spalax p  is unable to activate apoptotic target genes but is still capable of activating cell cycle arrest genes furthermore we have shown that the transcription patterns of representative p  induced genes apaf and mdm  in spalax are influenced by hypoxia cell cycle arrest allows the cells to repair dna damage via different dna repair genes we tested the transcription pattern of three p  related dna repair genes p r  mlh  and msh  under normoxia and short acute hypoxia in spalax c bl  wild type mice and two strains of mutant c bl  mice each carrying a different mutation at the r  position our results show that while wild type mutant mice exhibit strong hypoxia induced reductions of repair gene transcript levels no such inhibition is found in spalax under hypoxia moreover unlike mouse p r  spalax p r transcript levels are strongly elevated under hypoxia these results suggest that critical repair functions which are known to be inhibited under hypoxia in mice remain active in spalax as part of its unique hypoxia tolerance mechanisms
