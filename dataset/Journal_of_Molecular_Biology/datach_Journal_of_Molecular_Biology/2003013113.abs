reconstructing the binding site of factor xa in trypsin reveals ligand induced structural plasticity
in order to investigate issues of selectivity and specificity in protein  ligand interactions we have undertaken the reconstruction of the binding pocket of human factor xa in the structurally related rat trypsin by site directed mutagenesis three sequential regions the      the      and the      loops were selected as representing the major structural differences between the ligand binding sites of the two enzymes wild type rat trypsin and variants x rt and x      rt were expressed in yeast and analysed for their interaction with factor xa and trypsin inhibitors for most of the inhibitors studied progressive loop replacement at the trypsin surface resulted in inhibitory profiles akin to factor xa crystals of the variants were obtained in the presence of benzamidine   and could be soaked with the highly specific factor xa inhibitor   binding of the latter to x rt results in a series of structural adaptations to the ligand including the establishment of an  aromatic box  characteristic of factor xa in x      rt introduction of the   loop results in a surprising re orientation of the  intermediate helix   otherwise common to trypsin and factor xa the re orientation is accompanied by an isomerisation of the cys   cys  disulphide bond and burial of the critical phe  side chain in the presence of   a major re organisation of the binding site takes place to yield a geometry identical to that of factor xa in all binding of   to trypsin and its variants results in significant structural rearrangements inducing a binding surface strongly reminiscent of factor xa against which the inhibitor was optimised the structural data reveal a plasticity of the intermediate helix which has been implicated in the functional cofactor dependency of many trypsin like serine proteinases this approach of grafting loops onto scaffolds of known related structures may serve to bridge the gap between structural genomics and drug design
