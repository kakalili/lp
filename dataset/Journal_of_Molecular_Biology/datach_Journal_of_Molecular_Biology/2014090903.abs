interactions of the natural product kendomycin and the  s proteasome
natural products are a valuable source for novel lead structures in drug discovery but for the majority of isolated bioactive compounds the cellular targets are unknown the structurally unique ansa polyketide kendomycin km was reported to exert its potent cytotoxic effects via impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system but the exact mode of action remained unclear here we present a systematic biochemical characterization of km  proteasome interactions in vitro and in vivo including complex structures of wild type and mutant yeast  s proteasome with km our results provide evidence for a polypharmacological mode of action for km s cytotoxic effect on cancer cells
