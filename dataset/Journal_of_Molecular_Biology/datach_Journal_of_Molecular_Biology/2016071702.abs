structural mechanisms of peptide recognition and allosteric modulation of gene regulation by the rrnpp family of quorum sensing regulators
the members of rrnpp family of bacterial regulators sense population density specific secreted oligopeptides and modulate the expression of genes involved in cellular processes such as sporulation competence virulence biofilm formation conjugative plasmid transfer and antibiotic resistance signaling by rrnpp regulators include several steps generation and secretion of the signaling oligopeptides re internalization of the signaling molecules into the cytoplasm signal sensing by the cytosolic rrnpp regulators signal specific allosteric structural changes in the regulators and interaction of the regulators with their respective regulatory target and gene regulation the recently determined structures of the rrnpp regulators provide insight into the mechanistic aspects for several steps in this signaling circuit in this review we discuss the structural principles underlying peptide specificity regulatory target recognition and ligand induced allostery in rrnpp regulators and its impact on gene regulation despite the conserved tertiary structure of these regulators structural analyses revealed unexpected diversity in the mechanism of activation and molecular strategies that couple the peptide induced allostery to gene regulation although these structural studies provide a sophisticated understanding of gene regulation by rrnpp regulators much needs to be learned regarding the target dna binding by yet to be characterized rnpp regulators and the several aspects of signaling by rgg regulators
