a small protein protein interaction domain common to klcb and global regulators kora and trba of promiscuous incp plasmids edited by m belfort
the kor regulon of broad host range incompatibility group p incp plasmids uses the kora korb and korc repressors to regulate expression of genes for replication conjugation segregation and host range one operon kilc encodes the korc repressor and two genes of unknown function klca and klcb  the predicted sequences of the   kda klcb protein the   kda kora repressor and another small    kda regulatory protein trba show a highly related  amino acid residue segment v l p domain  we found that induction of the klcb gene is toxic to escherichia coli host cells harboring an incp plasmid we confirmed a model in which the v l p domain of klcb interacts directly with the v l p domain of kora to derepress kora regulated operons thereby allowing expression of toxic genes first a lacz reporter fused to the klea promoter which is regulated by kora and korc revealed that klcb induction specifically releases kora repression but has no effect on korc repression second induced expression of the v l p domains from kora or klcb is sufficient to release kora repression at the klea promoter third purified gst klcb fusion protein interacts specifically with his tagged kora fourth fusion of the v l p domains of kora and trba and full length klcb polypeptide to the dna binding domain of bacteriophage  repressor leads to the formation of functional dimeric repressors and mutations that alter conserved residues of the v l p domain adversely affect dimerization fifth crosslinking experiments demonstrated that the v l p domain of kora is able to dimerize in solution and form heterodimers in mixtures with full length kora polypeptide these findings show that the v l p domain is a protein protein interaction module that is likely to be responsible for dimerization of kora and trba and important for klcb dimerization we speculate on the possible significance of klcb kora heterodimers in incp plasmid maintenance
