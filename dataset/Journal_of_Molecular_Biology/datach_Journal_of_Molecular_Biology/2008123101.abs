mutational analysis of the stability of the h a and h b histone monomers
the eukaryotic histone heterodimer h a  h b folds through an obligatory dimeric intermediate that forms in a nearly diffusion limited association reaction in the stopped flow dead time it is unclear whether there is partial folding of the isolated monomers before association to address the possible contributions of structure in the monomers to the rapid association we characterized h a and h b monomers in the absence of their heterodimeric partner by far uv circular dichroism the h a and h b monomers are   and   helical respectively  significantly less than observed in x ray crystal structures acrylamide quenching of the intrinsic tyr fluorescence was indicative of tertiary structure the h a and h b monomers exhibit free energies of unfolding of   and   kcal mol   respectively at    m the sum of the stability of the monomers is    of the stability of the native dimer the helical content stability and m values indicate that h b has a more stable compact structure than h a the monomer m values are larger than expected for the extended histone fold motif suggesting that the monomers adopt an overly collapsed structure stopped flow refolding  initiated from urea denatured monomers or the partially folded monomers populated at low denaturant concentrations  yielded essentially identical rates indicating that monomer folding is productive in the rapid association and folding of the heterodimer a series of ala and gly mutations were introduced into h a and h b to probe the importance of helix propensity on the structure and stability of the monomers the mutational studies show that the central  helix of the histone fold which makes extensive intermonomer contacts is structured in h b but only partially folded in h a
