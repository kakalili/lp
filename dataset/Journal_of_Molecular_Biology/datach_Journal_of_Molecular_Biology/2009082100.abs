the structure of bacteriophage  cb reveals a role of the rna genome and metal ions in particle stability and assembly
the structure of the leviviridae bacteriophage  cb virus like particle has been determined at     resolution and the structure of the native bacteriophage  cb at     the structures of the coat protein shell appear to be identical while differences are found in the organization of the density corresponding to the rna the capsid is built of coat protein dimers and in shape corresponds to a truncated icosahedron with t  quasi symmetry the capsid is stabilized by four calcium ions per icosahedral asymmetric unit one is located at the symmetry axis relating the quasi  fold related subunits and is part of an elaborate network of hydrogen bonds stabilizing the interface the remaining calcium ions stabilize the contacts within the coat protein dimer the stability of the  cb particles decreases when calcium ions are chelated with edta in contrast to other leviviruses  cb particles are destabilized in solution with elevated salt concentration the model of the  cb capsid provides an explanation of the salt induced destabilization of  cb  since hydrogen bonds salt bridges and calcium ions have important roles in the intersubunit interactions electron density of three putative rna nucleotides per icosahedral asymmetric unit has been observed in the  cb structure the nucleotides mediate contacts between the two subunits forming a dimer and a third subunit in another dimer we suggest a model for  cb capsid assembly in which addition of coat protein dimers to the forming capsid is facilitated by interaction with the rna genome the  cb structure is the first example in the levivirus family that provides insight into the mechanism by which the genome  coat protein interaction may accelerate the capsid assembly and increase capsid stability
