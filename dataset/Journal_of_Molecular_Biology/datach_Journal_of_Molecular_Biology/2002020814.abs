effects of the n  s mutation on backbone dynamics of a tb cbegf domain pair from human fibrillin  edited by p e wright
the calcium binding epidermal growth factor like cbegf module and the transforming growth factor  binding protein like tb module are the two major structural motifs found in fibrillin  the extracellular matrix ecm protein defective in the marfan syndrome mfs  an mfs causing mutation n  s which removes a calcium ligand in cbegf  does not detectably affect fibrillin  biosynthesis rate of secretion processing or deposition of reducible fibrillin  into the ecm since the residue at position   is normally engaged in calcium ligation it is unable to mediate intermolecular interactions we have shown previously that this mutation does not affect the folding properties of the tb or cbegf domains in vitro but does decrease calcium binding in cbegf and tb cbegf domain constructs here we use nmr spectroscopy to probe the effects of the n  s mutation on backbone dynamic properties of tb cbegf  analysis of the backbone  n relaxation data of wild type tb cbegf  has revealed a flexible inter domain linkage parallel dynamics analysis of the n  s mutant has shown increased flexibility in the region joining the two domains as well as in the calcium binding site at the n terminus of cbegf  this research demonstrates that a small change in peptide backbone flexibility which does not enhance proteolytic susceptibility of the domain pair is associated with an mfs phenotype flexibility of the tb cbegf linkage is likely to contribute to the biomechanical properties of fibrillin rich connective tissue microfibrils and may play a role in the microfibril assembly process
