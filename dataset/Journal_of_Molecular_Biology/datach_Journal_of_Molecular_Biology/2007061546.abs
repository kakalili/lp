optimized variants of the cold shock protein from in vitro selection structural basis of their high thermostability
the bacterial cold shock proteins csp are widely used as models for the experimental and computational analysis of protein stability in a previous study in vitro evolution was employed to identify strongly stabilizing mutations in bs cspb from bacillus subtilis the best variant found by this approach contained the mutations m r e k and k i which raised the midpoint of thermal unfolding of bs cspb from     c to     c and increased the gibbs free energy of stabilization by    kj mol   another selected variant with the two mutations a k and s r was stabilized by    kj mol   to elucidate the molecular basis of these stabilizations we determined the crystal structures of these two bs cspb variants the mutated residues are generally well ordered and provide additional stabilizing interactions such as charge interactions additional hydrogen bonds and improved side chain packing several mutations improve the electrostatic interactions either by the removal of unfavorable charges e k or by compensating their destabilizing interactions a k s r  the stabilizing mutations are clustered at a contiguous surface area of bs cspb which apparently is critically important for the stability of the  barrel structure but not well optimized in the wild type protein
