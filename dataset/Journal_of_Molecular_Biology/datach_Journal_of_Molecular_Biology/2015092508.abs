the telomere binding protein cdc  and the single stranded dna binding protein rpa protect telomeric dna from resection by exonucleases
the telomere is present at the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes and usually consists of repetitive tg rich dna that terminates in a single stranded   tg extension and a   ca rich recessed strand a biochemical assay that allows the in vitro observation of exonuclease catalyzed degradation resection of telomeres has been developed the approach uses an oligodeoxynucleotide that folds to a stem  loop with a tg rich double stranded region and a   single stranded extension typical of telomeres cdc  the major component of the telomere specific cst complex strongly protects the recessed strand from the       exonuclease activity of the model exonuclease from bacteriophage   the isolated dna binding domain of cdc  is less effective at shielding telomeres protection is specific not being observed in control dna lacking the specific tg rich telomere sequence rpa the eukaryotic single stranded dna binding protein also inhibits telomere resection however this protein is non specific equally hindering the degradation of non telomere controls
