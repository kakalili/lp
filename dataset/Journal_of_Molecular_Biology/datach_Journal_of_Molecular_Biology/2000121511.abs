conformational changes in the ribosome induced by translational miscoding agents
ribosomes are dynamic complexes responsible for translating the genetic information encoded in mrnas to proteins the accuracy of this process is vital to the survival of an organism and is often compromised by translational miscoding agents aminoglycosides are a group of miscoding agents that bind to the ribosome and reduce the fidelity of translation previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides alter the higher order structure of the ribosome here we used a toeprinting assay to how that streptomycin neomycin kanamycin gentamycin and hygromycin b trigger conformational changes within escherichia coli ribosome miscoding agents viomycin and   ethanol also cause similar structural changes within the ribosome in contrast antibiotics that do not cause miscoding such as tetracycline chloramphenicol erythromycin fusidic acid and spectinomycin do not induce the conformational changes triggered by miscoding agents furthermore ribosomes isolated from strains that are either streptomycin resistant or dependent for growth do not show these conformational changes in the presence of streptomycin these results correlate structural changes in the ribosome induced by miscoding agents in vitro with their in vivo phenotype
