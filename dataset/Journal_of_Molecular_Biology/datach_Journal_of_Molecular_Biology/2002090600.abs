dna knotting caused by head on collision of transcription and replication
collision of transcription and replication is uncommon but the reason for nature to avoid this type of collision is still poorly understood in escherichia coli pbr  is unstable and rapidly lost without selective pressure stability can be rescued if transcription of the tetracycline resistance gene tetr  progressing against replication is avoided we investigated the topological consequences of the collision of transcription and replication in pbr  derived plasmids where head on collision between the replication fork and the rna polymerase transcribing the tetr gene was allowed or avoided the results obtained indicate that this type of collision triggers knotting of the daughter duplexes behind the fork we propose this deleterious topological consequence could explain the instability of pbr  and could be also one of the reasons for nature to avoid head on collision of transcription and replication
