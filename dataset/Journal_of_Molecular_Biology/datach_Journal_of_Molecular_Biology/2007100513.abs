molecular determination by electron microscopy of the dynein  microtubule complex structure
dynein is a minus end directed microtubule mt motor that is responsible for the wide range of mt based motility in eukaryotic cells detailed mechanism of the dynein chemomechanical conversion is still unknown partly because the structure of dynein is not studied at high resolution to address this problem and reconstruct the dynein  mt complex at higher resolution we have developed new procedures based on single particle analysis to accurately determine the orientation of the dynein  mt complex we introduced a  dynein track model  to restrict the possible dynein positions on the images we tested our procedures by reconstructing structures from simulated dynein  mt complex images starting from the simulated noisy images generated using three different models of the dynein  mt complex we have successfully recovered the original three dimensional  d structure we also showed that our procedure is robust against fluctuation of the dynein molecules and can determine the structure even when the dynein position fluctuates to a certain extent convergence of the final  d structure can be tested with a  two dimensional  d agreement value   which we introduced to see whether the final structure is a result of overfit from fluctuating dynein or not when the procedures did not work well due to the fluctuation we could recognize the failure by this  d agreement value finally the actual structure of the dynein  mt complex was determined from actual cryoelectron micrographs of dictyostelium cytoplasmic dynein  mt complex this method has revealed the detailed  d structures of the dynein  mt complex and will shed light on the motor mechanism of the dynein molecule
