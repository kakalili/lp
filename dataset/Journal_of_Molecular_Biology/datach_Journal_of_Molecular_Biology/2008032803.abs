recognition of non canonical peptides by the yeast fus p sh domain elucidation of a common mechanism for diverse sh domain specificities
the yeast fus p sh domain binds to peptides containing the consensus motif r s t s t sl which is a sharp contrast to most sh domains which bind to pxxp containing peptides here we have demonstrated that this domain binds to r s t s t sl containing peptides derived from two putative in vivo binding partners from yeast proteins bnr p and ste p with kd values in the low micromolar range the r s t s t sl consensus motif is necessary but not sufficient for binding to the fus p sh domain as residues lying n terminal to the consensus motif also play a critical role in the binding reaction through mutagenesis studies and comparisons to other sh domains we have discovered that the fus p sh domain utilizes a portion of the same binding surface as typical sh domains however the pxxp binding surface which plays the predominant role in binding for most sh domains is debilitated in the wt domain by the substitution of unusual residues at three key conserved positions by replacing these residues we created a version of the fus p sh domain that binds to a pxxp containing peptide with extremely high affinity kd   nm  based on our data and analysis we have clearly delineated two distinct surfaces comprising the typical sh domain binding interface and show that one of these surfaces is the primary mediator of almost every  non canonical  sh domain mediated interaction described in the literature within this framework dramatic alterations in sh domain specificity can be simply explained as a modulation of the binding strengths of these two surfaces
