pac  activates procaspase  in vitro through relief of zinc mediated inhibition
the direct induction of apoptosis has emerged as a powerful anticancer strategy and small molecules that either inhibit or activate certain proteins in the apoptotic pathway have great potential as novel chemotherapeutic agents central to apoptosis is the activation of the zymogen procaspase  to caspase  caspase  is the key  executioner  caspase catalyzing the hydrolysis of a multitude of protein substrates within the cell interestingly procaspase  levels are often elevated in cancer cells suggesting a compound that directly stimulates the activation of procaspase  to caspase  could selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells we recently reported the discovery of a compound pac  which enhances procaspase  activity in vitro and induces apoptotic death in cancer cells in culture and in mouse xenograft models described herein is the mechanism by which pac  activates procaspase  in vitro we show that zinc inhibits the enzymatic activity of procaspase  and that pac  strongly activates procaspase  in buffers that contain zinc pac  and zinc form a tight complex with one another with a dissociation constant of approximately   nm the combined data indicate that pac  activates procaspase  in vitro by sequestering inhibitory zinc ions thus allowing procaspase  to autoactivate itself to caspase  the small molecule mediated activation of procaspases has great therapeutic potential and thus this discovery of the in vitro mechanism of action of pac  is critical to the development and optimization of other procaspase activating compounds
