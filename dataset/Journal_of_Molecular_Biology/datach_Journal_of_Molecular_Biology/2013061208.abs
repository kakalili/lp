specific domains of a  facilitate aggregation on and association with lipid bilayers
a hallmark of alzheimer s disease a late onset neurodegenerative disease is the deposition of neuritic amyloid plaques composed of aggregated forms of the  amyloid peptide a   a  forms a variety of nanoscale toxic aggregate species ranging from small oligomers to fibrils a  and many of its aggregate forms strongly interact with lipid membranes which may represent an important step in several toxic mechanisms understanding the role that specific regions of a  play in regulating its aggregation and interaction with lipid membranes may provide insights into the fundamental interaction between a  and cellular surfaces we investigated the interaction and aggregation of several a  fragments a     a     a      a      a      a      and a     in the presence of supported model total brain lipid extract tble bilayers these fragments represent a variety of chemically unique domains within a  that is the extracellular domain the central hydrophobic core and the transmembrane domain using scanning probe techniques we elucidated aggregate morphologies for these different a  fragments in free solution and in the presence of tble bilayers these fragments formed a variety of oligomeric and fibrillar aggregates under free solution conditions exposure to tble bilayers resulted in distinct aggregate morphologies compared to free solution and changes in bilayer stability dependent on the a  sequence a      a      a      and a     aggregated into a variety of distinct fibrillar aggregates and disrupted the bilayer structure resulting in altered mechanical properties of the bilayer a     a     and a     had minimal interaction with lipid membranes forming only sparse oligomers
