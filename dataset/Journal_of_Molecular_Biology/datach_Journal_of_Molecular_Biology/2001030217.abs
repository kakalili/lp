the bowman birk inhibitor reactive site loop sequence represents an independent structural  hairpin motif edited by p e wright
we have determined the nmr structure in aqueous solution of a disulphide cyclised  residue peptide that forms a stable  hairpin incorporating a type vib  turn the structure is found to be extremely well ordered for a short peptide with the  lowest energy simulated annealing structures having an average pairwise r m s deviation of only     over the backbone all but three side chains adopt distinct conformations allowing a detailed analysis of their involvement in cross strand interactions the peptide sequence analysed originates from a previously reported study which identified potent inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase from screening a combinatorial peptide library based on the short protein  sheet segment that forms the reactive site loop of bowman birk inhibitors a detailed comparison of the peptide  s solution structure with the corresponding region in the whole protein structure reveals a very good correspondence not only for the backbone r m s deviation      but also for the side chains this isolated  hairpin retains the biologically active  canonical conformation  typical of small serine proteinase inhibitor proteins which explains why it retains inhibitory activity since the structural integrity is sequence inherent and does not depend upon the presence of the remaining protein this  hairpin represents an independent structural motif and so provides a useful model of this type of protein architecture and its relation to biological function the relationship between the conformation of this  hairpin and its biological activity is discussed
