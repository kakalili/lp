structural basis of the zinc inhibition of human tissue kallikrein
human kallikrein  hk  is a member of the tissue kallikrein family of serine peptidases it has trypsin like substrate specificity is inhibited by metal ions and is abundantly expressed in human skin where it is believed to play a central role in desquamation to further understand the interaction of hk with substrates and metal ions active recombinant hk was crystallized in complex with the tripeptidyl aldehyde inhibitor leupeptin and structures at     resolution were obtained with and without zn  while the overall structure and the specificity of s pocket for basic side chains were similar to that of hk  a closely related family member both differed in their interaction with zn  unlike hk  the  loop of hk is not structured to bind a zn  instead zn  binds adjacent to the active site becoming coordinated by the imidazole rings of his  and his  not present in hk  this zinc binding is accompanied by a large shift in the backbone conformation of the  loop and by large movements of both his side chains modeling studies show that in the absence of bound leupeptin zn  is likely further coordinated by the imidazolyl side chain of the catalytic his  which can similar to equivalent his  imidazole groups in the related rat kallikrein proteinase tonin and in an engineered metal binding rat trypsin rotate out of its triad position to provide the third co ordination site of the bound zn  rendering zn  bound hk inactive in solution this mode of binding likely occurs in the presence of free and substrate saturated hk  as kinetic analyses of zn  inhibition indicate a non competitive mechanism supporting the his  re orientation zn  does not fully inhibit hk hydrolysis of tripeptidyl substrates containing a p  his residue the p and his  imidazole groups would lie next to each other in the enzyme  substrate complex indicating that incomplete inhibition is due to competition between both imidazole groups for zn  the his     triad is thus suggested to be responsible for the zn  mediated inhibition of hk catalysis
