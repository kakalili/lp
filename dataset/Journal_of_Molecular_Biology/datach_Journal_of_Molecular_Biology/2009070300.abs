the crystal structure of ferritin from helicobacter pylori reveals unusual conformational changes for iron uptake
the crystal structure of recombinant ferritin from helicobacter pylori has been determined in its apo low iron bound intermediate and high iron bound states similar to other members of the ferritin family the bacterial ferritin assembles as a spherical protein shell of  subunits each of which folds into a four  helix bundle significant conformational changes were observed at the bc loop and the entrance of the  fold symmetry channel in the intermediate and high iron bound states whereas no change was found in the apo and low iron bound states the imidazole rings of his  at the channel entrance undergo conformational changes that bear resemblance to heme configuration and are directly coupled to axial translocation of fe ions through the  fold channel our results provide the first structural evidence of the translocation of fe ions through the  fold channel in prokaryotes and the transition from a protein dominated process to a mineral surface dominated process during biomineralization
