formation of a wrapped dna  protein interface experimental characterization and analysis of the large contributions of ions and water to the thermodynamics of binding ihf to h  dna
to characterize driving forces and driven processes in formation of a large interface wrapped protein  dna complex analogous to the nucleosome we have investigated the thermodynamics of binding the  base pair bp h  dna sequence to the escherichia coli dna remodeling protein integration host factor ihf  isothermal titration calorimetry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer are applied to determine effects of salt concentration kcl kf k glutamate kglu  and of the excluded solute glycine betaine gb on the binding thermodynamics at    c both the binding constant kobs and enthalpy  h obs depend strongly on salt and anion identity formation of the wrapped complex is enthalpy driven especially at low salt  e g   hoobs     kcal mol   in    m kcl   h obs increases linearly with salt with a slope d h obs d salt  which is much larger in kcl     kcal mol   m   than in kf or kglu     kcal mol   m    at    m salt  kobs is approximately  fold larger in kglu or kf than in kcl and the salt derivative skobs dlnkobs dln salt is almost twice as large in magnitude in kcl        as in kf or kglu        a novel analysis of the large effects of anion identity on kobs skobs and on  h obs dissects coulombic hofmeister and osmotic contributions to these quantities this analysis attributes anion specific differences in kobs skobs and  h obs to i displacement of a large number of water molecules of hydration estimated to be         from the      of ihf and h  dna surface buried in complex formation and ii significant local exclusion of f  and glu  from this hydration water relative to the situation with cl   which we propose is randomly distributed to quantify net water release from anionic surface   of the surface buried in complexation mostly from dna phosphates  we determined the stabilizing effect of gb on kobs dlnkobs d gb      at constant kcl activity indicating the net release of ca   h o molecules from anionic surface
