potentiating azt activation structures of wild type and mutant human thymidylate kinase suggest reasons for the mutants  improved kinetics with the hiv prodrug metabolite aztmp edited by j karn
the  fold reduced phosphorylation rate of azidothymidine azt monophosphate aztmp  the partially activated azt metabolite by human thymidylate kinase tmpk severely limits the efficacy of this anti hiv prodrug crystal structures of different tmpk nucleotide complexes indicate that steric hindrance by the azido group of aztmp prevents formation of the catalytically active closed conformation of the p loop of tmpk the f  y mutant and a chimeric mutant that contains sequences of the human and escherichia coli enzyme phosphorylate aztmp  fold faster than the wild type enzyme the structural basis of the increased activity is assigned to stabilization of the closed p loop conformation
