isolation of bsobi restriction endonuclease variants with altered substrate specificity
bsobi is a thermophilic restriction endonuclease that cleaves the degenerate dna sequence c pycgpug where the cleavage site and py c or t pu a or g  in the bsobi  dna co crystal structure the d  residue makes a water mediated hydrogen bond to n of the degenerate base adenine and was proposed to make a complementary bond to o of the alternative guanine residue to investigate the substrate specificity conferred by d  and to potentially alter bsobi specificity the d  residue was changed to the other  amino acids variants d  a d  c d  e d  r d  s d  t and d  y were purified and their cleavage activity determined variants d  a d  s and d  t display   to   of the wild type cleavage activity however the substrate specificity of the three variants is altered significantly d  a d  s and d  t cleave ctcgag sites poorly in filter binding assays using oligonucleotides wild type bsobi shows almost equal affinity for ctcgag and cccggg sites in contrast the d  a variant shows  fold greater binding affinity for the cccggg substrate recycled mutagenesis was carried out on the d  a variant and revertants with enhanced activity were isolated by their dark blue phenotype on a dind  lacz dna damage indicator strain most of the amino acid substitutions present within the revertants were located outside the dna  protein interface this study demonstrates that endonuclease mutants with altered specificity and non lethal activity can be evolved towards more active variants using a laboratory evolution strategy
