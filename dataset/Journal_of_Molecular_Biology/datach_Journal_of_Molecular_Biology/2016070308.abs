shifting fitness and epistatic landscapes reflect trade offs along an evolutionary pathway
nature repurposes proteins via evolutionary processes such adaptation can come at the expense of the original protein s function which is a trade off of adaptation we sought to examine other potential adaptive trade offs we measured the effect on ampicillin resistance of     unique single amino acid mutants of the tem  tem   tem   and tem    lactamase alleles which constitute an adaptive path in the evolution of cefotaxime resistance these protein fitness landscapes were compared and used to calculate epistatic interactions between these mutations and the two mutations in the pathway e  k and g  s  this series of protein fitness landscapes provides a systematic quantitative description of pairwise tertiary intragenic epistasis involving adaptive mutations we find that the frequency of mutations exhibiting epistasis increases along the evolutionary pathway adaptation moves the protein to a region in the fitness landscape characterized by decreased mutational robustness and increased ruggedness as measured by fitness effects of mutations and epistatic interactions for tem  s original function this movement to such a  fitness territory  has evolutionary consequences and is an important adaptive trade off and cost of adaptation our systematic study provides detailed insight into the relationships between mutation protein structure protein stability and epistasis and quantitatively depicts the different costs inherent in the evolution of new functions
