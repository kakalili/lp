structure of an aagu tetraloop and its contribution to substrate selection by yeast rnase iii
rnase iii enzymes are a highly conserved family of proteins that specifically cleave double stranded rna dsrna  these proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions including the processing of many non coding rnas mrna decay and rna interference in yeast rnt p a dsrna binding domain dsrbd recognizes its substrate by interacting with stems capped with conserved agnn tetraloops the enzyme uses the tetraloop to cut  nt to  nt away into the stem in a ruler like mechanism the solution structure of rnt p dsrbd complexed to one of its small nucleolar sno rna substrate revealed non sequence specific contacts with the sugar phosphate backbone in the minor groove of the agnn fold and the two non conserved tetraloop nucleotides recently a new form of rnt p substrates lacking the conserved agnn sequence but instead harboring an aagu tetraloop was found at the   end of snorna  precursor here we report the solution structure of this hairpin capped with an aagu tetraloop some of the stacking interactions and the position of the turn in the sugar phosphate backbone are similar to the one observed in the agnn loop structure however the aagu sequence adopts a different conformation the most striking difference was found at the   end of the loop where rnt p interacts with agnn substrates the last nucleotide is extruded from the aagu tetraloop structure in contrast to the compact agnn fold the aagu hairpin structure suggests that rnt p recognizes substrates with different tetraloop structures indicating that the structural repertoire specifically recognized by rnt p is larger than previously anticipated
