crystal structure of guanidinoacetate methyltransferase from rat liver a model structure of protein arginine methyltransferase
guanidinoacetate methyltransferase gamt is the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of creatine biosynthesis the enzyme is found in abundance in the livers of all vertebrates recombinant rat liver gamt has been crystallized with s adenosylhomocysteine sah  and the crystal structure has been determined at    resolution the  amino acid residues at the n terminus were cleaved during the purification and the truncated enzyme was crystallized the truncated enzyme forms a dimer and each subunit contains one sah molecule in the active site arg  of the partner subunit forms a pair of hydrogen bonds with asp  at the guanidinoacetate binding site on the basis of the crystal structure site directed mutagenesis on asp   and chemical modification and limited proteolysis studies we propose a catalytic mechanism of this enzyme the truncated gamt dimer structure can be seen as a ternary complex of protein arginine methyltransferase one subunit complexed with a protein substrate the partner subunit and the product sah therefore this structure provides insight into the structure and catalysis of protein arginine methyltransferases
