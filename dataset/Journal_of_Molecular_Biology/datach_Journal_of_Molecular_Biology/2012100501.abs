gating movement of acetylcholine receptor caught by plunge freezing
the nicotinic acetylcholine ach receptor converts transiently to an open channel form when activated by ach released into the synaptic cleft we describe here the conformational change underlying this event determined by electron microscopy of ach sprayed and freeze trapped postsynaptic membranes ach binding to the  subunits triggers a concerted rearrangement in the ligand binding domain involving an     outward displacement of the extracellular portion of the  subunit where it interacts with the juxtaposed ends of  helices shaping the narrow membrane spanning pore the  subunit helices tilt outward to accommodate this displacement destabilising the arrangement of pore lining helices which in the closed channel bend inward symmetrically to form a central hydrophobic gate straightening and tangential motion of the pore lining helices effect channel opening by widening the pore asymmetrically and increasing its polarity in the region of the gate the pore lining helices of the   and  subunits by flexing between alternative bent and straight conformations undergo the greatest movements this coupled allosteric transition shifts the structure from a tense closed state toward a more relaxed open state
