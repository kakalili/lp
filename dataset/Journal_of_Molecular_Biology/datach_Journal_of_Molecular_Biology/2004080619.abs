interactions between the rhodobacter sphaeroides ecf sigma factor  e and its anti sigma factor chrr
rhodobacter sphaeroides  e is a member of the extra cytoplasmic function sigma factor ecf family whose members have been shown to regulate gene expression in response to a variety of signals the functions of ecf family members are commonly regulated by a specific reversible interaction with a cognate anti sigma factor in r sphaeroides  e activity is inhibited by chrr a member of a newly discovered family of zinc containing anti sigma factors we used gel filtration chromatography to gain insight into the mechanism by which chrr inhibits  e activity we found that formation of the  e chrr complex inhibits the ability of  e to form a stable complex with core rna polymerase since the  e chrr complex inhibits the ability of the sigma factor to bind rna polymerase we sought to identify amino acid substitutions in  e that altered the sensitivity of this sigma factor to inhibition by chrr this analysis identified single amino acid changes in conserved region   of  e that either increased or decreased the sensitivity of  e for inhibition by chrr many of the amino acid residues that alter the sensitivity of  e to chrr are located within regions known to be important for interacting with core rna polymerase in other members of the   superfamily our results suggest a model where solvent exposed residues with region   of  e interact with chrr to sterically occlude this sigma factor from binding core rna polymerase and to inhibit target gene expression
