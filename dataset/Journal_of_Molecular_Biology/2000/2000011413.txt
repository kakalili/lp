The binding of multivalent antigen-antibody complexes to receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (FcγR) induces the clustering of the FcγR and triggers cell activation leading to defence reactions against pathogens. The Fc portion of IgG consists of two identical polypeptide chains which are related to each other by a 2-fold axis and are folded in two structural domains, the CH2 domain, near the flexible hinge region of the IgG molecule, and the CH3 domain. We studied the interaction in solution between the Fc fragment of mouse IgG2b and the extracellular region of mouse FcγRII. We find that one Fc molecule binds one FcγRII molecule only. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that FcγRII binds to a negatively charged area of the CH2 domain, corresponding to the lower hinge region, and that the binding of FcγRII onto one of the two symmetrically related sites on the Fc induces a conformational change in the other site. We therefore propose a model that explains why IgG molecules are unable to trigger FcγR-mediated cellular responses spontaneously in the absence of crosslinking by multivalent antigens.
