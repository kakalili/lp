the aquaporin sidedness revisited edited by w baumeister
aquaporins are transmembrane water channel proteins which play important functions in the osmoregulation and water balance of micro organisms plants and animal tissues all aquaporins studied to date are thought to be tetrameric assemblies of four subunits each containing its own aqueous pore moreover the subunits contain an internal sequence repeat forming two obversely symmetric hemichannels predicted to resemble an hour glass this unique arrangement of two highly related protein domains oriented at    to each other poses a significant challenge in the determination of sidedness aquaporin z aqpz from escherichia coli was reconstituted into highly ordered two dimensional crystals they were freeze dried and metal shadowed to establish the relationship between surface structure and underlying protein density by electron microscopy the shadowing of some surfaces was prevented by protruding aggregates thus images collected from freeze dried crystals that exhibited both metal coated and uncoated regions allowed surface relief reconstructions and projection maps to be obtained from the same crystal cross correlation peak searches along lattices crossing metal coated and uncoated regions allowed an unambiguous alignment of the surface reliefs to the underlying density maps aqpz topographs previously determined by afm could then be aligned with projection maps of aqpz and finally with human erythrocyte aquaporin  aqp  thereby features of the aqpz topography could be interpreted by direct comparison to the   three dimensional structure of aqp  we conclude that the sidedness we originally proposed for aquaporin density maps was inverted
