lysine deacetylases regulate the heat shock response including the age associated impairment of hsf
heat shock factor  hsf  is critical for defending cells from both acute and chronic stresses in aging cells the dna binding activity of hsf deteriorates correlating with the onset of pathological events including neurodegeneration and heart disease we find that dna binding by hsf is controlled by lysine deacetylases with hdac  hdac  and sirt distinctly increasing the magnitude and length of a heat shock response hsr  in contrast hdac inhibits hsf in a deacetylase independent manner in aging cells the levels of hdac are elevated and the hsr is impaired yet reduction of hdac in aged cells restores the hsr our results provide a mechanistic basis for the age associated regulation of the hsr besides hsf  the deacetylases differentially modulate the activities of unrelated dna binding proteins taken together our data further support the model that lysine deacetylases are selective regulators of dna binding proteins
