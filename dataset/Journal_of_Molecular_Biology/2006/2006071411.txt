Bacterial cold shock proteins (CSPs) are involved in cellular adaptation to cold stress. They bind to single-stranded nucleic acids with a KD value in the micro- to nanomolar range. Here we present the structure of the Bacillus subtilis CspB (Bs-CspB) in complex with hexathymidine (dT6) at a resolution of 1.78 Å. Bs-CspB binds to dT6 with nanomolar affinity via an amphipathic interface on the protein surface. Individual binding subsites interact with single nucleobases through stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding. The sugar-phosphate backbone and the methyl groups of the thymine nucleobases remain solvent exposed and are not contacted by protein groups. Fluorescence titration experiments monitoring the binding of oligopyrimidines to Bs-CspB reveal binding preferences at individual subsites and allow the design of an optimised heptapyrimidine ligand, which is bound with sub-nanomolar affinity. This study reveals the stoichiometry and sequence determinants of the binding of single-stranded nucleic acids to a preformed site on Bs-CspB and thus provides the structural basis of the RNA chaperone and transcription antitermination activities of the CSP.
