the structure of free l  and functional dynamics of l  in free l  rrna  nt binary and l  rrna  nt thiostrepton ternary complexes
the l  binding site is one of the most important functional sites in the ribosome the n terminal domain of l  has been implicated as a  reversible switch  in facilitating the coordinated movements associated with ef g driven gtp hydrolysis the reversible switch mechanism has been hypothesized to require conformational flexibility involving re orientation and re positioning of the two l  domains and warrants a close examination of the structure and dynamics of l  here we report the solution structure of free l  and relaxation studies of free l  l  complexed to its  nt rna recognition site and l  in a ternary complex with the rna and thiostrepton antibiotic the binding site of thiostrepton on l  was also defined by analysis of structural and dynamics data and chemical shift mapping the conclusions of this work are as follows first the binding of l  to rna leads to sizable conformation changes in the regions flanking the linker and in the hinge area that links a  sheet and a   helix turn helix element in the n terminus concurrently the change in the relative orientation may lead to re positioning of the n terminus as implied by a decrease of radius of gyration from     to      second the regions which undergo large conformation changes exhibit motions on milliseconds microseconds or nanoseconds picoseconds time scales third binding of thiostrepton results in more rigid conformations near the linker thr  and near its putative binding site leu   lastly conformational changes in the putative thiostrepton binding site are implicated by the re emergence of cross correlation peaks in the spectrum of the ternary complex which were missing in that of the binary complex our combined analysis of both the chemical shift perturbation and dynamics data clearly indicates that thiostrepton binds to a pocket involving residues in the   helix in l
