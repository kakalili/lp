crystal structure of grape dihydroflavonol  reductase a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis
the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph dependent enzyme dihydroflavonol  reductase dfr catalyzes a late step in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and condensed tannins two flavonoid classes of importance to plant survival and human nutrition this enzyme has been widely investigated in many plant species but little is known about its structural and biochemical properties to provide a basis for detailed structure  function studies the crystal structure of vitis vinifera dfr heterologously expressed in escherichia coli has been determined at     resolution the d structure of the ternary complex obtained with the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and dihydroquercetin one of the dfr substrates presents common features with the short chain dehydrogenase reductase family i e  an n terminal domain adopting a rossmann fold and a variable c terminal domain which participates in substrate binding the structure confirms the importance of the      region which lines the substrate binding site and enlightens the role of a specific residue at position   asn or asp  assumed to control substrate recognition the activity of the wild type enzyme and its variant n  d has been quantified in vitro using dihydroquercetin or dihydrokaempferol our results demonstrate that position   cannot be solely responsible for the recognition of the b ring hydroxylation pattern of dihydroflavonols
