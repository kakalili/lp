investigating the mechanism of the nucleocapsid protein chaperoning of the second strand transfer during hiv  dna synthesis
conversion of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genomic rna into the proviral dna by reverse transcriptase involves two obligatory strand transfers that are chaperoned by the nucleocapsid protein nc  the second strand transfer relies on the annealing of the    and   copies of the primer binding site    pbs and   pbs which fold into complementary stem  loops sls with terminal single stranded overhangs to understand how nc chaperones their hybridization we investigated the annealing kinetics of fluorescently labelled  pbs with various   pbs derivatives in the absence of nc the     pbs annealing was governed by a second order pathway nucleated mainly by the single stranded overhangs of the two pbs sls the annealing reaction appeared to be rate limited by the melting of the stable g c rich stem subsequent to the formation of the partially annealed intermediate a second pathway nucleated through the loops could be detected but was very minor nc     which consists primarily of the zinc finger domain increased the      pbs annealing kinetics by about sixfold by strongly activating the interaction between the pbs loops nc    also activated      pbs annealing through the single strand overhangs but by a factor of only  full length nc    further increased the     pbs annealing kinetics by tenfold the nc promoted     pbs mechanism proved to be similar with extended   dna molecules suggesting that it is relevant in the context of proviral dna synthesis these findings favour the notion that the ubiquitous role of nc in the viral life cycle probably relies on the ability of nc to chaperone nucleic acid hybridization via different mechanisms
