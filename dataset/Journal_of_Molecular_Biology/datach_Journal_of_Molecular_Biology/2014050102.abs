structural analysis and identification of phus as a heme degrading enzyme from pseudomonas aeruginosa
bacterial pathogens require iron for proliferation and pathogenesis pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent gram negative opportunistic human pathogen that takes advantage of immunocompromised hosts and encodes a number of proteins for uptake and utilization of iron here we report the crystal structures of phus previously known as the cytoplasmic heme trafficking protein from p aeruginosa in both the apo and the holo forms in comparison to its homologue chus from escherichia coli o  h  the heme orientation is rotated    across the    axis which may account for some of the unique functional properties of phus in contrast to previous findings heme binding does not result in an overall conformational change of phus we employed spectroscopic analysis and co measurement by gas chromatography to analyze heme degradation demonstrating that phus is capable of degrading heme using ascorbic acid or cytochrome p  reductase nadph as an electron donor and produces five times more co than chus addition of catalase slows down but does not stop phus catalyzed heme degradation through spectroscopic and mass spectrometry analysis we identified the enzymatic product of heme degradation to be verdoheme these data taken together suggest that phus is a potent heme degrading enzyme in addition to its proposed heme trafficking function
