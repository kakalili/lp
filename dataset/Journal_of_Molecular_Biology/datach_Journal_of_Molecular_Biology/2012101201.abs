structure and function of   tetrahydrocannabinolic acid thca synthase the enzyme controlling the psychoactivity of cannabissativa
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid thca synthase catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of cannabigerolic acid cbga into thca the precursor of the primary psychoactive agent   tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis sativa the enzyme was overproduced in insect cells purified and crystallized in order to investigate the structure  function relationship of thca synthase and the tertiary structure was determined to    resolution by x ray crystallography rcryst     the thca synthase enzyme is a member of the p cresol methyl hydroxylase superfamily and the tertiary structure is divided into two domains domains i and ii  with a flavin adenine dinucleotide coenzyme positioned between each domain and covalently bound to his  and cys   located in domain i  the catalysis of thca synthesis involves a hydride transfer from c of cbga to n of flavin adenine dinucleotide and the deprotonation of o   of cbga the ionized residues in the active site of thca synthase were investigated by mutational analysis and x ray structure mutational analysis indicates that the reaction does not involve the carboxyl group of glu  that was identified as the catalytic base in the related berberine bridge enzyme but instead involves the hydroxyl group of tyr   mutations at the active  site residues his  and tyr  resulted in a decrease in but not elimination of the enzymatic activity of thca synthase suggesting a key role for these residues in substrate binding and not direct catalysis
