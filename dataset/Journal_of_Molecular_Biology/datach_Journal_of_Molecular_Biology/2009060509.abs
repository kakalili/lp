preventing amyloid formation by catching unfolded transmembrane segments
a subset of protein misfolding diseases including for example alzheimer s disease is associated with the formation of highly insoluble amyloid fibrils with a  sheet structure the amyloidogenic human lung surfactant protein c sp c is generated from sp c precursor which has a c terminal domain ctc that prevents sp c amyloid fibril formation analysis of the substrate specificity of ctc reveals that it binds to all amino acid residues that promote membrane insertion provided that they are in a nonhelical conformation in line with this unexpectedly general substrate specificity the anti amyloid function of ctc extends to a transmembrane segment other than that of pro sp c namely the amyloid  peptide associated with alzheimer s disease these findings indicate that ctc is the first known chaperone to be directed towards nonhelical transmembrane segments and that it may be employed for the development of new diagnostics or anti amyloid therapies
