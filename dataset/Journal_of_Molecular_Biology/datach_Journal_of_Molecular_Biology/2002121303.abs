solution nmr structure of s  b bound to the high affinity target peptide trtk
the solution nmr structure is reported for ca  loaded s  b bound to a  residue peptide trtk   from the actin capping protein capz   or   subunit residues      trtkidwnkils  this peptide was discovered by dimlich and co workers by screening a bacteriophage random peptide display library and it matches exactly the consensus s  b binding sequence  k r l i xwxxil  as with other s  b target proteins a calcium dependent conformational change in s  b is required for trtk  binding the trtk  peptide is an amphipathic helix residues w to s  in the s  b  trtk complex and helix  of s  b is extended by three or four residues upon peptide binding however helical trtk  in the s  b  peptide complex is uniquely oriented when compared to the three dimensional structures of other s   peptide complexes the three dimensional structure of the s  b  trtk peptide complex illustrates that residues in the s  b binding consensus sequence k  i  w  i  l  are all involved in the s  b  peptide interface which can explain its orientation in the s  b binding pocket and its relatively high binding affinity a comparison of the s  b  trtk peptide structure to the structures of apo and ca  bound s  b illustrates that the binding site of trtk  is buried in apo s  b but is exposed in ca  bound s  b as necessary to bind the trtk  peptide
