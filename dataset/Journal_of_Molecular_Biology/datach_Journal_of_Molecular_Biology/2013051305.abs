the membrane binding domain of an amphitropic enzyme suppresses catalysis by contact with an amphipathic helix flanking its active site
ctp phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase cct  the regulatory enzyme in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is activated by binding membranes using a lipid induced amphipathic helix domain m  domain m functions to silence catalysis when cct is not membrane engaged the silencing mechanism is unknown we used photo cross linking and mass spectrometry to identify contacts between domain m and other cct domains in its soluble form each of four sites in domain m forged cross links to the same set of peptides that flank the active site and overlap at helix  e at the base of the active site these cross links were broken in the presence of activating lipid vesicles mutagenesis of domain m revealed that multiple hydrophobic residues within a putative auto inhibitory ai motif contribute to the contact with helix  e and silencing helix  e was confirmed as the docking site for domain m by deuterium exchange analysis we compared the dynamics and fold stability of cct domains by site directed fluorescence anisotropy and urea denaturation the results suggest a bipartite structure for domain m a disordered n terminal portion and an ordered c terminal ai motif with an unfolding transition identical with that of helix  e reduction in hydrophobicity of the ai motif decreased its order and fold stability as did deletion of the catalytic domain these results support a model in which catalytic silencing is mediated by the docking of an amphipathic ai motif onto the amphipathic helices  e an unstructured leash linking  e with the ai motif may facilitate both the silencing contact and its membrane triggered disruption
