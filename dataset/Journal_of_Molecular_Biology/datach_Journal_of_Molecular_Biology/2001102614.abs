crystal structure of an rna duplex r gugucgcac  with uridine bulges edited by j doudna
the crystal structure of a nonamer rna duplex with a uridine bulge in each strand r gugucgcac  was determined at    resolution the structure was solved by multiple anomalous diffraction phasing method using a three wavelength data set collected at the advanced protein source and refined to a final rwork rfree of        with    independent reflections friedel pairs unmerged  the rna duplex crystallized in the tetragonal space group p   with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit the unit cell dimensions are a  b      and c       the helical region of the nonamer adopts the a form conformation the uridine bulges assume similar conformations with uracils flipping out and protruding into the minor groove the presence of the bulge induces very large twist angles      between the base pairs flanking the bulges while causing profound kinks in the helix axis at the bulges this severe twist and the large kink in turn produces a very narrow major groove at the middle of the molecule the ribose sugars of the guanosines before the bulges adopt the c   endo conformation while the rest including the bulges are in the c   endo conformation the intrastrand phosphate phosphate p p distance of the phosphate groups flanking the bulges       are significantly shorter than the average p p distance in the duplex      this short distance between the two phosphate groups brings the non bridging oxygen atoms close to each other where a calcium ion is bound to each strand the calcium ions in molecule  are well defined while the calcium ions in molecule  are disordered
