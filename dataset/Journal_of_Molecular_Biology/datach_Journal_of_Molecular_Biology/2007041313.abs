crystal structure of rs  c  involved in nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolysis
rs  c  which is highly expressed in all vertebrate genomes and green plants is proposed to have nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase activity here we report the crystal structures of the core fragment of rs  c  named rscut and the complex with the substrate  methyl dctp the refined structure of rscut consists mainly of  helices and shows formation of a tightly associated tetramer on the basis of the structure of the rscut  m dctp complex and the results of pyrophosphatase activity assays several key residues involved in the substrate binding of rs  c have been identified tetramer formation is shown to be required for substrate binding
