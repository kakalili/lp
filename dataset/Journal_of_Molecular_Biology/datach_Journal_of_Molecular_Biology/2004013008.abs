insights into conformation and dynamics of protein gb during folding and unfolding by nmr
understanding protein stability requires characterization of structural determinants of the folded and unfolded states many proteins are capable of populating partially folded states under specific solution conditions occasionally coexistence of the folded and an unfolded state under non or mildly denaturing conditions can be observed by nmr allowing us to structurally probe these states under identical conditions here we report on a destabilized mutant of the b domain of protein g gb  whose equilibrium unfolding was systematically investigated backbone amide residual dipolar couplings rdcs  the tryptophan n   h resonance and the amide nitrogen transverse relaxation rates r s for varying ph values and different temperatures were measured the backbone amide rdcs indicate that prior to complete unfolding two melting hot spots are formed at the turn around t  l  and k  and the n terminus of the helix at a  and t  the rdcs for the low ph thermally unfolded state of gb are very small and do not indicate the presence of any native like structure amide nitrogen transverse relaxation rates for gb in the folded state at different temperatures exhibit large contributions from exchange processes and the associated dynamics display considerable heterogeneity our data provide clear evidence for intermediate conformations and multi state equilibrium un folding for this gb variant
