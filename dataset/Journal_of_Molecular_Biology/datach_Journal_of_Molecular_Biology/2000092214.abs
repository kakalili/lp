dissection of functional nf y rfx cooperative interactions on the mhc class ii ea promoter edited by m yaniv
transcription of major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii genes depends upon the trimeric complexes rfx and nf y binding to the conserved x y promoter elements we produced and purified the rfx subunits from escherichia coli reconstituted dna binding to the mouse ea x box and dissected the interactions with nf y rfx and nf y do not interact in solution but make cooperative interactions in emsa a minimal nf y composed of the evolutionary conserved domains is sufficient and the rfxap n terminal half is expendable altering the x y distance abolishes cooperativity indicating that dna imposes severe spatial constraints when tested on a highly positioned nucleosome rfx binds dna well and nf y does not increase its affinity further transfections of nf y subunits but not rfx in class ii negative cells improves basal transcription and coexpression of the two activators has a synergistic effect while modestly increasing ciita mediated activation these results show that interactions between the two trimers on dna are key to mhc class ii expression
