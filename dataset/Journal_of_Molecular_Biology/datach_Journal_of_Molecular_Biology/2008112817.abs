cryo electron microscopy structure of a yeast mitochondrial preprotein translocase
the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane tom complex is the main entry gate for proteins imported into mitochondria we determined the structure of the native unstained    kda core  tom  complex from saccharomyces cerevisiae by cryo electron microscopy at    resolution the complex is triangular measuring     on edge and has near  fold symmetry its bulk is made up of three globular     domains three elliptical pores on the c face merge into one central     cavity with a cage like assembly on the opposite t face nitrilotriacetic acid  gold labeling indicates that three tom  subunits in the tom complex are located at the perimeter of the complex near the interface of the globular domains we assign tom  which controls complex assembly to three peripheral protrusions on the c face while the tom  subunit is tentatively assigned to the central protrusion on this surface based on our three dimensional map we propose a model of transient interactions and functional dynamics of the tom assembly
