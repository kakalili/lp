massive sequence perturbation of the raf ras binding domain reveals relationships between sequence conservation secondary structure propensity hydrophobic core organization and stability
the contributions of specific residues to the delicate balance between function stability and folding rates could be determined in part comparing the sequences of structures having identical folds but insignificant sequence homology recently we have devised an experimental strategy to thoroughly explore residue substitutions consistent with a specific class of structure using this approach the amino acids tolerated at virtually all residues of the c raf raf ras binding domain raf rbd  an exemplar of the common  grasp ubiquitin like topology were obtained and used to define the sequence determinants of this fold herein we present analyses suggesting that more subtle sequence selection pressure including propensity for secondary structure the hydrophobic core organization and charge distribution are imposed on the raf rbd sequence secondly using the gibbs free energies  gf u obtained for  mutants of raf rbd we demonstrate a strong correlation between amino acid conservation and the destabilization induced by truncating mutants in addition four mutants are shown to significantly stabilize raf rbd native structure two of these mutations including the well studied r l are known to severely compromise binding affinity for ras another stabilized mutant consisted of a deletion of amino acid residues e   k   this deletion naturally occurs in the homologues a raf and b raf and could indicate functional divergence finally the combination of mutations affecting five of  residues of raf rbd results in stabilization of the structure by approximately   kj mol    gf u is    and    kj mol   for wt and mutant respectively  the sequence perturbation approach combined with sequence structure analysis of the ubiquitin like fold provide a basis for the identification of sequence specific requirements for function stability and folding rate of the raf rbd and structural analogues highlighting the utility of conservation profiles as predictive tools of structural organization
