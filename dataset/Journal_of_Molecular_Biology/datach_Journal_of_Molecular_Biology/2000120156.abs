an aspartic acid residue in tpr  a specific region of protein priming dna polymerases is required for the functional interaction with primer terminal protein edited by a fersht
a multiple sequence alignment of eukaryotic type dna polymerases led to the identification of two regions of amino acid residues that are only present in the group of dna polymerases that make use of terminal proteins  tps as primers to initiate dna replication of linear genomes these amino acid regions named terminal region tpr protein  and tpr  are inserted between the generally conserved motifs dx slyp and kx nsxyg tpr  and motifs kx nsxyg and yxdtds tpr  of the eukaryotic type family of dna polymerases we carried out site directed mutagenesis in two of the most conserved residues of   dna polymerase tpr  to study the possible role of this specific region two mutant dna polymerases in conserved residues asp  and leu   were purified and subjected to a detailed biochemical analysis of their enzymatic activities both mutant dna polymerases were essentially normal when assayed for synthetic activities in dna primed reactions however mutant d  y was drastically affected in   tp dna replication as a consequence of a large reduction in the catalytic efficiency of the protein primed reactions the molecular basis of this defect is a non functional interaction with tp that strongly reduces the activity of the dna polymerase tp heterodimer
