non standard insulin design structure activity relationships at the periphery of the insulin receptor edited by f cohen
the design of insulin analogues has emphasized stabilization or destabilization of structural elements according to established principles of protein folding to this end solvent exposed side chains extrinsic to the receptor binding surface provide convenient sites of modification an example is provided by an unfavorable helical c cap thra  whose substitution by favorable amino acids hisa or arga  has yielded analogues of improved stability remarkably these analogues also exhibit enhanced activity suggesting that activity may correlate with stability here we test this hypothesis by substitution of diaminobutyric acid daba  like threonine an amino acid of low helical propensity the crystal structure of daba insulin is similar to those of native insulin and the related analogue lysa insulin although no more stable than native insulin the non standard analogue is twice as active stability and affinity can therefore be uncoupled to investigate alternative mechanisms by which a substitutions enhance activity multiple substitutions were introduced surprisingly diverse aliphatic aromatic and polar side chains enhance receptor binding and biological activity because no relationship is observed between activity and helical propensity we propose that local interactions between the a side chain and an edge of the hormone receptor interface modulate affinity daba insulin illustrates the utility of non standard amino acids in hypothesis driven protein design
