We have been able to observe the first step in bacteriophage infection, the docking of phage lambda to its membrane receptor maltoporin, at the single-particle level. High-resolution conductance recording from a single trimeric maltoporin channel reconstituted into a planar lipid bilayer has allowed detection of the simultaneous and irreversible interaction of the phage tail with all three monomers of the receptor. The formation of a phage–maltoporin complex affects the channel transport properties. Our analysis demonstrates that phage attaches symmetrically to all three receptor monomers. The statistics of sugar binding to the phage–receptor complex on the side opposite to phage docking show that the monomers of maltoporin still bind sugar independently, with the kinetic constants expected from those of the phage-free receptor. This finding suggests that phage docking does not distort the structure of the receptor, and that the phage-binding regions are close to, but do not overlap with, the sugar-binding domains of the maltoporin monomers. However, ion fluxes through the pores of maltoporin in the phage–receptor complex share a new common pathway.We expect that the present study contributes to the current needs for structural information on the functional complexes involved in intercellular recognition.
