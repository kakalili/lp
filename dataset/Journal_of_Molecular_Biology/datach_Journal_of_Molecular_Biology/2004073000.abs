a functional interaction between rha and ubc  an e like enzyme specific for sumo
rna helicase a rha is a member of the deah helicase family of proteins recent studies imply the role of rha in the regulation of the topology of chromatin dna which could influence diverse nuclear processes such as transcription activity of the chromatin dna and chromosome condensation we previously reported that ubc  an e like enzyme specific for small ubiquitin like modifier  sumo   is required for the interaction between rha and topoisomerase ii  here we describe that ubc is a novel factor that functionally interacts with rha and activates the transcription activity of rha measured in the creb mediated pathway we demonstrate that the n terminal domain of rha encompassing amino acid residues     is sufficient for its interaction with ubc  our data also show that interaction with ubc leads to the sumo  conjugation of rha both in vitro and in vivo however the catalytic activity of ubc seems to be dispensable for the transcription activation activity of rha our observation suggests multiple roles for ubc in the regulation of the rha function
