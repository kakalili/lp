structural origins of aminoglycoside specificity for prokaryotic ribosomes edited by i tinoco
aminoglycoside antibiotics including paromomycin neomycin and gentamicin target a region of highly conserved nucleotides in the decoding region aminoacyl trna site a site of  s rrna on the  s subunit change of a single nucleotide a   to g reduces the affinity of many aminoglycosides for the ribosome g   distinguishes between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes the structures of a prokaryotic decoding region a site oligonucleotide free in solution and bound to the aminoglycosides paromomycin and gentamicin c a were determined previously here the structure of a eukaryotic decoding region a site oligonucleotide bound to paromomycin has been determined using nmr spectroscopy and compared to the prokaryotic a site paromomycin structure a conformational change in three adenosine residues of an internal loop critical for high affinity antibiotic binding was observed in the prokaryotic rna paromomycin complex in comparison to its free form this conformational change is not observed in the eukaryotic rna paromomycin complex disrupting the binding pocket for ring i of the antibiotic the lack of the conformational change supports footprinting and titration calorimetry data that demonstrate approximately    fold weaker binding of paromomycin to the eukaryotic decoding site oligonucleotide neomycin which is much less active against escherichia coli ribosomes with an a  g mutation binds non specifically to the oligonucleotide these results suggest that eukaryotic ribosomal rna has a shallow binding pocket for aminoglycosides which accommodates only certain antibiotics
