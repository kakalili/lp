evolved escherichia coli strains for amplified functional expression of membrane proteins
the major barrier to the physical characterization and structure determination of membrane proteins is low protein yield and or low functionality in recombinant expression the enteric bacterium escherichia coli is the most widely employed organism for producing recombinant proteins beside several advantages of this expression host one major drawback is that the protein of interest does not always adopt its native conformation and may end up in large insoluble aggregates we describe a robust strategy to increase the likelihood of overexpressing membrane proteins in a functional state the method involves fusion in tandem of green fluorescent protein and the erythromycin resistance protein  s ribosomal rna adenine n  methyltransferase ermc to the c terminus of a target membrane protein the fluorescence of green fluorescent protein is used to report the folding state of the target protein whereas ermc is used to select for increased expression by gradually increasing the erythromycin concentration of the medium and testing different membrane protein targets we obtained a number of evolved strains of which four ng  ng  ng and ng  were characterized and their genome was fully sequenced strikingly each of the strains carried a mutation in the hns gene whose product is involved in genome organization and transcriptional silencing the degree of expression of membrane proteins correlates with the severity of the hns mutation but cells in which hns was deleted showed an intermediate expression performance we propose that partial removal of the transcriptional silencing mechanism changes the levels of proteins essential for the functional overexpression of membrane proteins
