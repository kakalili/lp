tracing ancestors and relatives of escherichia coli b and the derivation of b strains rel  and bl  de
antecedents of escherichia coli b have been traced through publications inferences and personal communication to a strain from the institut pasteur in paris used by d herelle in his studies of bacteriophages as early as    a strain not in the current collection  this strain appears to have passed from d herelle to bordet in    and from bordet to at least three other laboratories by    the strain that gratia received from bordet was apparently passed to bronfenbrenner by   and from him to luria around    delbr ck and luria published the first paper calling this strain b in    its choice as the common host for phages t  t by the phage group that developed around delbr ck luria and hershey in the   s led to widespread use of b along with e coli k   chosen about the same time for biochemical and genetic studies by tatum and lederberg not all currently available strains related to b are descended from the b of delbr ck and luria at least three strains with somewhat different characteristics were derived independently by hershey directly from the bronfenbrenner strain and a strain that appears to have passed from bordet to wollman is in the current collection of the institut pasteur the succession of manipulations and strains that led from the b of delbr ck and luria to rel  and bl  de  is given established in part through evidence from their recently determined complete genome sequences
