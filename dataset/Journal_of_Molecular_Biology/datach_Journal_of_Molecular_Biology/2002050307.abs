inheritance and organisation of the mitochondrial genome differ between two saccharomyces yeasts
petite positive saccharomyces yeasts can be roughly divided into the sensu stricto including saccharomyces cerevisiae and sensu lato group including saccharomyces castellii the latter was recently studied for transmission and the organisation of its mitochondrial genome s castellii mitochondrial molecules mtdna carrying point mutations which confer antibiotic resistance behaved in genetic crosses as the corresponding point mutants of s cerevisiae while s castellii generated spontaneous petite mutants in a similar way as s cerevisiae the petites exhibited a different inheritance pattern in crosses with the wild type strains a majority of s castellii petites was neutral and the suppressivity in suppressive petites was never over   the two yeasts also differ in organisation of their mtdna molecules the    bp sequence of s castellii mtdna was determined and the coding potential of both yeasts is similar however the s castellii intergenic sequences are much shorter and do not contain sequences homologous to the s cerevisiae biologically active intergenic sequences as ori rep tra which are responsible for the hyper suppressive petite phenotype found in s cerevisiae the structure of one suppressive s castellii mutant ca  was also determined apparently a short direct intergenic repeat was involved in the generation of this petite mtdna molecule
