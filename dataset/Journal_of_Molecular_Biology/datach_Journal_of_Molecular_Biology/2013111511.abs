monitoring the activity of single translocons
recent studies introduced a novel view that the secyeg translocon functions as a monomer and interacts with the dimeric seca atpase which fuels the preprotein translocation reaction here we used nanodisc reconstituted secyeg to characterize the functional properties of single copies of the translocon using a method based on intermolecular f rster resonance energy transfer we show for the first time that isolated nanodisc reconstituted secyeg monomers support preprotein translocation when several copies of secyeg were co reconstituted within a nanodisc no change in translocation kinetics was observed suggesting that secyeg oligomers do not facilitate enhanced translocation in contrast nanodisc reconstituted monomers of the prla variant of secyeg showed increased translocation rates experiments based on intramolecular f rster resonance energy transfer within the nanodisc isolated monomeric secyeg demonstrated a nucleotide dependent opening of the channel upon interaction with seca in conclusion the nanodisc reconstituted secyeg monomers are functional for preprotein translocation and provide a new prospect for single molecule analysis of dynamic aspects of protein translocation
