the affinity grid a pre fabricated em grid for monolayer purification
we have recently developed monolayer purification as a rapid and convenient technique to produce specimens of his tagged proteins or macromolecular complexes for single particle electron microscopy em without biochemical purification here we introduce the affinity grid a pre fabricated em grid featuring a dried lipid monolayer that contains ni nta lipids lipids functionalized with a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid group  the affinity grid which can be stored for several months under ambient conditions further simplifies and extends the use of monolayer purification after characterizing the affinity grid we used it to isolate within minutes ribosomal complexes from escherichia coli cell extracts containing his tagged rpl  the human homolog of the e coli  s subunit rplc ribosomal complexes with or without associated mrna could be prepared depending on the way the sample was applied to the affinity grid  vitrified affinity grid specimens could be used to calculate three dimensional reconstructions of the  s ribosomal subunit as well as the  s ribosome and  s ribosomal subunit from images of the same sample we established that affinity grids are stable for some time in the presence of glycerol and detergents which allowed us to isolate his tagged aquaporin  aqp  from detergent solubilized membrane fractions of sf insect cells the affinity grid can thus be used to prepare single particle em specimens of soluble complexes and membrane proteins
