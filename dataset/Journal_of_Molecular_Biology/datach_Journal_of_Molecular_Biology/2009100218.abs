g domain dimerization orchestrates the trna wobble modification reaction in the mnme gida complex
mnme and gida are involved in the modification of wobble uridine to carboxymethylaminomethyl uridine in certain trnas malfunctioning of the human orthologs has been implicated in mitochondrial diseases mnme is a conserved g protein activated by dimerization here we show that complex formation between mnme and gida involves large conformational changes that induce g domain dimerization of mmne and that gida co stimulates gtp hydrolysis on mnme starting from a structural model of the complex we identify interface mutations disrupting complex formation or communication although gida does not directly contact the g domains conformational changes in mnme induced by g domain dimerization in the triphosphate state regulate the affinity for gida we developed a trna modification assay and demonstrate for the first time in vitro that the mnme gida complex catalyzes incorporation of glycine into trna an intact mnme gida complex rather than their sequential action is crucial for in vitro modification since only gtp but not gdp or non hydrolyzable gtp analogs drives the mnme gida catalyzed modification reaction we conclude that gtp hydrolysis is essential for activity we finally show that an active gtpase an intact mnme gida communication and dimerization of g domains are necessary for in vivo functioning since mutations disrupting either result in a respiratory deficient phenotype in yeast
