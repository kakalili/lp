three dimensional structure of cap gly domain of mammalian dynactin determined by magic angle spinning nmr spectroscopy conformational plasticity and interactions with end binding protein eb
microtubules and their associated proteins play important roles in vesicle and organelle transport cell motility and cell division perturbation of these processes by mutation typically gives rise to severe pathological conditions in our efforts to obtain atomic information on microtubule associated protein microtubule interactions with the goal to understand mechanisms that might potentially assist in the development of treatments for these diseases we have determined the three dimensional structure of cap gly cytoskeleton associated protein glycine rich domain of mammalian dynactin by magic angle spinning nmr spectroscopy we observe two conformations in the   strand encompassing residues t  v  a  residues that are adjacent to the disease associated mutation g s upon binding of cap gly to microtubule plus end tracking protein eb  the cap gly shifts to a single conformer we find extensive chemical shift perturbations in several stretches of residues of cap gly upon binding to eb  from which we define accurately the cap gly eb binding interface we also observe that the loop regions may exhibit unique flexibility especially in the gkndg motif which participates in the microtubule binding this study in conjunction with our previous reports suggests that conformational plasticity is an intrinsic property of cap gly likely due to its unusually high loop content and may be required for its biological functions
