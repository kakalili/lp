combining inference from evolution and geometric probability in protein structure evaluation
starting from the hypothesis that evolutionarily important residues form a spatially limited cluster in a protein s native fold we discuss the possibility of detecting a non native structure based on the absence of such clustering the relevant residues are determined using the evolutionary trace method we propose a quantity to measure clustering of the selected residues on the structure and show that the exact values for its average and variance over several ensembles of interest can be found this enables us to study the behavior of the associated z scores since our approach rests on an analytic result it proves to be general customizable and computationally fast we find that clustering is indeed detectable in a large representative protein set furthermore we show that non native structures tend to achieve lower residue clustering z scores than those attained by the native folds the most important conclusion that we draw from this work is that consistency between structural and evolutionary information manifested in clustering of key residues imposes powerful constraints on the conformational space of a protein
