excluded volume in protein side chain packing edited by a r fersht
the excluded volume occupied by protein side chains and the requirement of high packing density in the protein interior should severely limit the number of side chain conformations compatible with a given native backbone to examine the relationship between side chain geometry and side chain packing we use an all atom monte carlo simulation to sample the large space of side chain conformations we study three models of excluded volume and use umbrella sampling to effectively explore the entire space we find that while excluded volume constraints reduce the size of conformational space by many orders of magnitude the number of allowed conformations is still large an average repacked conformation has   of its  angles in a non native state a marked reduction from the expected   in the absence of excluded volume interestingly well packed conformations with up to   non native  angles exist the repacked conformations have native packing density as measured by a standard voronoi procedure entropy is distributed non uniformly over positions and we partially explain the observed distribution using rotamer probabilities derived from the protein data bank database in several cases native rotamers that occur infrequently in the database are seen with high probability in our simulation indicating that sequence specific excluded volume interactions can stabilize rotamers that are rare for a given backbone in spite of our finding that   of the native rotamers and   of   angles can be predicted correctly on the basis of excluded volume only    of positions can accommodate more than one rotamer in simulation we estimate that in order to quench the side chain entropy observed in the presence of excluded volume interactions other interactions hydrophobic polar electrostatic must provide an additional stabilization of at least   kt per residue in order to single out the native state
