structural basis for p  lys  acetylation dependent dna binding mode
normal cellular homeostasis depends on tight regulation of gene expression which requires the modulation of transcription factors dna binding specificity that said the mechanisms that allow transcription factors to distinguish between closely related response elements following different cellular signals are not fully understood in the tumor suppressor protein p  acetylation of loop l residue lys  within the dna binding domain has been shown to promote the transcription of proapoptotic genes such as bax here we report the crystal structures of lys  acetylated p  dna binding domain in complex with a consensus response element and with the natural bax response element our structural analyses reveal that lys  acetylation expands the conformational space of loop l in the dna bound state loop l flexibility is known to increase p  s dna binding specificity and lys  acetylation dependent conformational changes in loop l enable the formation of sequence dependent dna binding modes for p  furthermore binding to the natural bax response element is accompanied by global conformational changes deformation of the dna helical structure and formation of an asymmetric tetrameric complex based on these findings we suggest a model for p  s lys  acetylation dependent dna binding mode
