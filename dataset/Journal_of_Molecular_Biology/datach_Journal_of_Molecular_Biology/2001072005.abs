crystal structure of native and cd cd substituted dioclea guianensis seed lectin a novel manganese binding site and structural basis of dimer tetramer association edited by r huber
diocleinae legume lectins are a group of oligomeric proteins whose subunits display a high degree of primary structure and tertiary fold conservation but exhibit considerable diversity in their oligomerisation modes to elucidate the structural determinants underlaying diocleinae lectin oligomerisation we have determined the crystal structures of native and cadmium substituted dioclea guianensis dguia seed lectin these structures have been solved by molecular replacement using concanavalin cona coordinates as the starting model and refined against data to    resolution in the native mn ca dguia crystal form p    the asymmetric unit contains two monomers arranged into a canonical legume lectin dimer and the tetramer is formed with a symmetry related dimer in the cd cd substituted form i    the asymmetric unit is occupied by a monomer in both crystal forms the tetrameric association is achieved by the corresponding symmetry operators like other legume lectins native d guianensis lectin contains manganese and calcium ions bound in the vicinity of the saccharide combining site the architecture of these metal binding sites s and s  changed only slightly in the cadmium cadmium substituted form a highly ordered calcium native lectin or cadmium cd cd substituted lectin ion is coordinated at the interface between dimers that are not tetrameric partners in a similar manner as the previously identified cd  in site s of a cd ca cona an additional mn  coordination site called s  whose presence has not been reported in crystal structures of any other homologous lectin is present in both the mn ca and the cd cd substituted d guianensis lectin forms on the other hand comparison of the primary and quaternary crystal structures of seed lectins from d guianensis and dioclea grandiflora  dgl indicates that the loop comprising residues      is ordered to make interdimer contacts in the d grandiflora lectin structure while this loop is disordered in the d guianensis lectin structure a single amino acid difference at position   histidine in d grandiflora and asparagine in d guianensis drastically reduces interdimer contacts accounting for the disordered loop further this amino acid change yields a conformation that may explain why a ph dependent dimer tetramer equilibrium exists for the d guianensis lectin but not for the d grandiflora lectin
