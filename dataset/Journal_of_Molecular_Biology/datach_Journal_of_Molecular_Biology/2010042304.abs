structure of pp   reveals the molecular basis for different c di gmp binding modes by pilz domain proteins
cyclic diguanylate c di gmp is a global regulator that modulates pathogen virulence and biofilm formation in bacteria although a bioinformatic study revealed that pilz domain proteins are the long sought c di gmp binding proteins the mechanism by which c di gmp regulates them is uncertain pseudomonas putida pp   is one such protein that contains ycgr n and pilz domains and the apo pp   structure was solved earlier by the joint center for structural genomics we determined the crystal structure of holo pp   and found that two intercalated c di gmps fit into the junction of its ycgr n and pilz domains moreover c di gmp binding induces pp   to undergo a dimer to monomer transition interestingly another pilz domain protein vca   binds to a single molecule of c di gmp and both its apo and holo forms are dimeric mutational studies and the additional crystal structure of holo vca   l  r showed that the arg  residue of pp   is crucial for the recognition of two molecules of c di gmp thus pilz domain proteins exhibit different c di gmp binding stoichiometry and quaternary structure and these differences are expected to play a role in generating diverse forms of c di gmp mediated regulation
