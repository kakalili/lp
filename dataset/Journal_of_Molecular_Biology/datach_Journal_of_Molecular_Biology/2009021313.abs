effects of cpg methylation on recognition of dna by the tumour suppressor p
methylation of dna is one of the mechanisms controlling the expression landscape of the genome its pattern is altered in cancer and often results in the hypermethylation of the promoter regions and abnormal expression of tumour suppressor genes methylation of cpg dinucleotides located in the binding sites of transcription factors may contribute to the development of cancers by preventing their binding or altering their specificity we studied the effects of cpg methylation on dna recognition by the tumour suppressor p  a transcription factor involved in the response to carcinogenic stress p  recognises a large number of dna sequences many of which contain cpg dinucleotides we systematically substituted a cpg dinucleotide at each position in the consensus p  dna binding sequence and identified substitutions tolerated by p  we compared the binding affinities of methylated versus non methylated sequences by fluorescence anisotropy titration we found that binding of p  was not affected by cytosine methylation in a majority of cases however for a few sequences containing multiple cpg dinucleotides such as sites in the rb and met genes methylation resulted in a four to sixfold increase in binding of p  this approach can be used to quantify the effects of cpg methylation on the dna recognition by other dna binding proteins
