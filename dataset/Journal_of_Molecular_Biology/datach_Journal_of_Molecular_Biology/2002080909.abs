truncation of amino terminal tail stimulates activity of human endonuclease iii hnth
the human base excision repair enzyme hnth  a homologue of escherichia coli endonuclease iii nth  is a  kda dna glycosylase with associated abasic ap lyase activity it has significant sequence homology with nth in its dna binding motifs and catalytic residues but possesses a unique amino n terminal tail residues     we investigated the structure and function of this tail controlled proteolysis cleaved hnth into discrete fragments to generate a  kda core domain lacking the n terminal  residues surprisingly recombinant hnth lacking    or  residues from the n terminus had four to fivefold higher activities than the full length enzyme kinetic analysis at transition states revealed that release of the final product an ap site with a   nick is the rate limiting step in the multi step reaction mediated by hnth  the n terminal tail regulates its overall catalytic turnover by reducing this product release rate by five to sevenfold without affecting either the glycosylase or ap lyase activities or the steady state equilibrium concentration of schiff base intermediate the covalent complex of hnth and ap site dna formed after the base is excised the inhibitory role of the n terminal tail in catalytic turnover explains the low activity of hnth compared to that of its e coli homologue
