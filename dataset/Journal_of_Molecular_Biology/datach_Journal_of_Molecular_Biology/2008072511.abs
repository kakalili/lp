a novel photoactive gaf domain of cyanobacteriochrome anpixj that shows reversible green red photoconversion
we report the discovery of a novel cyanobacteriochrome the green red photoreceptor anpixj all    isolated from the heterocyst forming cyanobacterium anabaena nostoc sp pcc    cyanobacteriochromes are a recently emerging tetrapyrrole based photoreceptor superfamily that are distantly related to the conventional red far red photoreceptor phytochromes phys  the chromophore binding domains of anpixj produced in cyanobacterial and escherichia coli cells both showed a reversible and full photoconversion between a green absorbing form  max   nm and a red absorbing form  max   nm  denaturation analysis revealed that the green absorbing form and the red absorbing form covalently ligated phycocyanobilin with e configuration and z configuration at the c c  double bond respectively time resolved spectral analysis showed the formation of the first intermediate state peaking at   nm from the dark stable red absorbing form this step resembles the first photoconversion step from the red absorbing form to the red shifted lumi r intermediate state of the phys these results suggest that the pr of anpixj is almost equivalent to that of the phys and starts a primary photoreaction with z to e isomerization in a mechanism similar to that in the phys but is finally photoconverted to the unique green absorbing form
