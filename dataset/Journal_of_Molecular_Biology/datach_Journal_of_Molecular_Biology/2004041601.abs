crystal structure of isca an iron sulfur cluster assembly protein from escherichia coli
isca an  kda member of the hesb family of proteins binds iron and  fe s clusters and participates in the biosynthesis of iron sulfur proteins we report the crystal structure of the apo protein form of isca from escherichia coli to a resolution of    the crystals belong to the space group p   and have unit cell dimensions a b      c                  the structure was solved using single wavelength anomalous dispersion sad phasing of a selenomethionyl derivative and the isca model was refined to r    rfree     isca exists as an      homotetramer with the     dimer comprising the asymmetric unit cys  implicated in fe s cluster assembly is located in a central cavity formed at the tetramer interface with the  sulfur atoms of residues from the   and    monomers and      positioned close to one another      c terminal residues     are disordered and the exact positions of cys  and cys  could not be determined however computer modeling of c terminal residues in the tetramer suggests that cys  and cys  in the   monomer and those of the    monomer or   and     are positioned sufficiently close to coordinate  fe s clusters between the two dimers whereas this is not possible within the     or        dimer this symmetrical arrangement allows for binding of two  fe s clusters on opposite sides of the tetramer modeling further reveals that cys  is positioned sufficiently close to cys  to allow cys  to participate in cluster assembly formation or transfer
