salt anions promote the conversion of hypf n into amyloid like oligomers and modulate the structure of the oligomers and the monomeric precursor state
an understanding of the solution factors contributing to the rate of aggregation of a protein into amyloid oligomers to the modulation of the conformational state populated prior to aggregation and to the structure morphology of the resulting oligomers is one of the goals of present research in this field we have studied the influence of six different salts on the conversion of the n terminal domain of escherichia coli hypf hypf n into amyloid like oligomers under conditions of acidic ph our results show that salts having different anions nacl naclo  nai na so  accelerate oligomerization with an efficacy that follows the electroselectivity series of the anions so    clo   gt i  gt cl   by contrast salts with different cations nacl licl kcl have similar effects we also investigated the effect of salts on the structure of the final and initial states of hypf n aggregation the electroselectivity series does not apply to the effect of anions on the structure of the oligomers by contrast it applies to their effect on the content of secondary structure and on the exposure of hydrophobic clusters of the monomeric precursor state the results therefore indicate that the binding of anions to the positively charged residues of hypf n at low ph is the mechanism by which salts modulate the rate of oligomerization and the structure of the monomeric precursor state but not the structure of the resulting oligomers overall the data contribute to rationalize the effect of salts on amyloid like oligomer formation and to explain the role of charged biological macromolecules in protein aggregation processes
