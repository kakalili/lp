argininamide binding arrests global motions in hiv  tar rna comparison with mg  induced conformational stabilization
the structure and dynamics of the stem loop transactivation response element tar rna from the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  bound to the ligand argininamide arg has been characterized using a combination of a large number of residual dipolar couplings rdcs and trans hydrogen bond nmr methodology binding of arg to tar changes the average inter helical angle between the two stems from     in the free state to     in the bound state and leads to the arrest of large amplitude     inter helical motions observed previously in the free state while the global structural dynamics of tar  arg is similar to that previously reported for tar bound to mg  there are substantial differences in the hydrogen bond alignment of bulge and neighboring residues based on a novel h c nn experiment for probing hydrogen mediated hj n n scalar couplings as well as measured rdcs the tar  arg complex is stabilized by a u  a  u  base triple involving an a  u  reverse hoogsteen hydrogen bond alignment as well as by a a  u  watson  crick base pair at the junction of stem i these hydrogen bond alignments are not observed in either the free or mg  bound forms of tar the combined conformational analysis of tar under three states reveals that ligands and divalent ions can stabilize similar rna global conformations through distinct interactions involving different hydrogen bond alignments in the rna
