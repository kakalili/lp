unperturbing a non helically perturbed bacterial flagellar filament salmonella typhimurium sjw
salmonella typhimurium sjw  has a right handed non helically perturbed filament of serotype gt with a unique surface pattern non helical perturbations involve symmetry reduction along the five start helical lines resulting in layer lines of fractional bessel orders and a consequent seam the flagellin gene flic  which we sequenced differs from the sequence of the canonic plain sjw   flagellin flic   we modified discrete components of flic  in order to localize in the expressed filament the submolecular site responsible for the non helical perturbation these modifications include i deleting the outermost domain d   ii replacing d  with d    iii substituting a hydrophilic  helix at the interface between the neighboring domains d and d with a hydrophobic one from flic   and iv substituting a serine glycine pair in the loop connecting the modified  helix to its neighbor these modifications were made in the presence and absence of d   we used s typhimurium sjw   both as a reference and as a source for  spare parts   the symmetry of the constructs was assessed from the power spectra through changes in the layer lines at a height of       and           unique to the non helical perturbation deleting d   either alone or in combination with various substitutions or replacing it with d   transforms the non helically perturbed filament into a plain one as judged by the disappearance of the typical layer lines from the power spectra we conclude that the non helical perturbation is a product of unique interactions in the d  density shell whereas other minor structural changes may occur at the filaments interior they are all helically symmetric
