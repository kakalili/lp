nmr solution structure of the inserted domain of human leukocyte function associated antigen  edited by f e cohen
the interaction between the leukocyte function associated antigen  lfa  and the intercellular adhesion molecule is thought to be mediated primarily via the inserted domain i domain in the  subunit the activation of lfa  is an early step in triggering the adhesion of leukocytes to target cells decorated with intercellular adhesion molecules there is some disagreement in the literature over the respective roles of conformational changes in the i domain and of divalent cations mg  mn  in the activation of lfa  for intercellular adhesion molecule binding x ray crystallographic structures of the i domains of lfa  and mac  in the presence and absence of cations show structural differences in the c terminal  helix this change was proposed to represent the active and inactive conformations of the i domain however more recent x ray results have called this proposal into question the solution structure of the mg  complex of the i domain of lfa  has been determined by nmr methods using a model based approach to nuclear overhauser enhancement spectroscopy peak assignment the protein adopts the same structure in solution as that of the published i domain x ray structures but the c terminal region where the x ray structures are most different from each other is different again in the solution structures the secondary structure of this helix is well formed but nmr relaxation data indicate that there is considerable flexibility present probably consisting of breathing or segmental motion of the helix the conformational diversity seen in the various x ray structures could be explained as a result of the inherent flexibility of this c terminal region and as a result of crystal contacts our nmr data are consistent with a model where the c terminal helix has the potential flexibility to take up alternative conformations for example in the presence and absence of the intercellular adhesion molecule ligand the role of divalent cations appears from our results not to be as a direct mediator of a conformational change that alters affinity for the ligand rather the presence of the cation appears to be involved in some other way in ligand binding perhaps by acting as a bridge to the ligand and by modulation of the charge of the binding surface
