neuron cell type specific snap  expression driven by multiple regulatory elements in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans
in order to characterize the mechanisms regulating neuronal expression of the nematode snap  gene we identified the snap  genes of caenorhabditis elegans and caenorhabditis briggsae comparative sequence analysis and reporter assays revealed two putative   regulatory elements p and p  and four elements i h i m i h and i m in the first intron nuclear extracts contained activities that bound the p and i h elements different elements were required for snap  expression in different neuronal subsets p was required in da and dd motor neurons and i m and i m were required in db and da neurons respectively p was active in amphid and phasmid neurons i h in pharyngeal neurons and i h in touch receptor neurons the i h element contained a putative binding site for transcription factor unc   both unc  and mec  were required for i h activity in the mechanosensory neurons in these neurons gfp expression driven by i h was abolished in animals bearing either an unc  null or a mec  null mutation or an unc  mutation that leads to defective interaction with mec  deletion of the mec  binding site also abolished the gfp expression gel mobility shift assay results suggest that transcriptional regulation of snap  may involve multiple transcription factors
