coronin enhances actin filament severing by recruiting cofilin to filament sides and altering f actin conformation
high rates of actin filament turnover are essential for many biological processes and require the activities of multiple actin binding proteins working in concert the mechanistic role of the actin filament severing protein cofilin is now firmly established however the contributions of other conserved disassembly promoting factors including coronin have remained more obscure here we have investigated the mechanism by which yeast coronin crn  enhances f actin turnover using multi color total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy we show that crn enhances cof mediated severing by accelerating cof binding to actin filament sides further using biochemical assays to interrogate f actin conformation we show that crn alters longitudinal and lateral actin  actin contacts and restricts opening of the nucleotide binding cleft in actin subunits moreover crn and cof show opposite structural effects on f actin yet synergize in promoting release of phalloidin from filaments suggesting that crn cof co decoration may increase local discontinuities in filament topology to enhance severing
