functional fingerprints of folds evidence for correlated structure  function evolution
using structural similarity clustering of protein domains protein domain universe graph pdug  and a hierarchical functional annotation gene ontology go as two evolutionary lenses we find that each structural cluster domain fold exhibits a distribution of functions that is unique to it these functional distributions are functional fingerprints that are specific to characteristic structural clusters and vary from cluster to cluster furthermore as structural similarity threshold for domain clustering in the pdug is relaxed we observe an influx of earlier diverged domains into clusters these domains join clusters without destroying the functional fingerprint these results can be understood in light of a divergent evolution scenario that posits correlated divergence of structural and functional traits in protein domains from one or few progenitors
