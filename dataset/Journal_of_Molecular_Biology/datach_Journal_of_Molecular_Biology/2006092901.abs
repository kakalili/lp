a counterintuitive mg  dependent and modification assisted functional folding of mitochondrial trnas
mitochondrial trnas mtrnas often lack domains and posttranscriptional modifications that are found in cytoplasmic trnas these structural and chemical elements normally stabilize the folding of cytoplasmic trnas into canonical structures that are competent for aminoacylation and translation for example the dihydrouridine d stem and loop domain is involved in the tertiary structure of cytoplasmic trnas through hydrogen bonds and a mg  bridge to the ribothymidine t stem and loop domain these interactions are often absent in mtrna because the d domain is truncated or missing using gel mobility shift analyses uv circular dichroism and nmr spectroscopies and aminoacylation assays we have investigated the functional folding interactions of chemically synthesized and site specifically modified mitochondrial and cytoplasmic trnas we found that mg  is critical for folding of the truncated d domain of bovine mtrnamet with the trna s t domain contrary to the expectation that mg  stabilizes rna folding the mtrnamet d domain structure was unfolded and relaxed rather than stabilized in the presence of mg  because the d domain is transcribed prior to the t domain we conclude that mg  prevents misfolding of the   half of bovine mtrnamet facilitating its correct interaction with the t domain the interaction of the mtrnamet d domain with the t domain was enhanced by a pseudouridine located in either the d or t domains compared to that of the unmodified rnas kd      and     m respectively  mg  also affected the folding interaction of a yeast mtrnaleu  but had minimal effect on the folding of an escherichia coli cytoplasmic trnaleu the d domain modification dihydrouridine facilitated mtrnaleu folding these data indicate that conserved modifications assist and stabilize the formation of the functional mtrna tertiary structure
