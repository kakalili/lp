structural changes in the l photointermediate of bacteriorhodopsin
the l to m reaction of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle includes the crucial proton transfer from the retinal schiff base to asp  in spite of the importance of the l state in deciding central issues of the transport mechanism in this pump the serious disagreements among the three published crystallographic structures of l have remained unresolved here we report on the x ray diffraction structure of the l state to         resolutions from replicate data sets collected from six independent crystals unlike earlier studies the partial occupancy refinement uses diffraction intensities from the same crystals before and after the illumination to produce the trapped l state the high reproducibility of inter atomic distances and bond angles and torsions of the retinal lends credibility to the structural model the photoisomerized  cis retinal in l is twisted at the c  c  and c  nz double bonds and the schiff base does not lose its connection to wat  and therefore to the proton acceptor asp  the protonation of asp  by the schiff base in the l  m reaction is likely to occur therefore via wat   it is evident from the structure of the l state that various conformational changes involving hydrogen bonding residues and bound water molecules begin to propagate from the retinal to the protein at this stage already and in both extracellular and cytoplasmic directions their rationales in the transport can be deduced from the way their amplitudes increase in the intermediates that follow l in the reaction cycle and from the proton transfer reactions with which they are associated
