dna g quartets in a     resolution structure of an oxytricha nova telomeric protein dna complex edited by i tinoco
the oxytricha nova telomere end binding protein ontebp recognizes binds and protects the single stranded   terminal dna extension found at the ends of macronuclear chromosomes the structure of this complex shows that the single strand ggggttttgggg dna binds in a deep cleft between the two protein subunits of ontebp adopting a non helical and irregular conformation in extending the resolution limit of this structure to     we were surprised to find a g quartet linked dimer of the ggggttttgggg dna also packing within the crystal lattice and interacting with the telomere end binding protein the g quartet dna exhibits the same structure and topology as previously observed in solution by nmr with diagonally crossing d tttt loops at either end of the four stranded helix additionally the crystal structure reveals clearly visible na  and specific patterns of bound water molecules in the four non equivalent grooves although the g quartet protein contact surfaces are modest and might simply represent crystal packing interactions it is interesting to speculate that the two types of telomeric dna protein interactions observed here might both be important in telomere biology
