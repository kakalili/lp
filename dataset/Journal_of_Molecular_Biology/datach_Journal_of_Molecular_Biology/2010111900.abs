translesion synthesis across abasic lesions by human b family and y family dna polymerases           and rev
abasic apurinic apyrimidinic ap sites are the most common dna lesions formed in cells induce severe blocks to dna replication and are highly mutagenic human y family translesion dna polymerases pols such as pols       and rev have been suggested to play roles in replicative bypass across many dna lesions where b family replicative pols stall but their individual catalytic functions in ap site bypass are not well understood in this study oligonucleotides containing a synthetic abasic lesion tetrahydrofuran analogue were compared for catalytic efficiency and base selectivity with human y family pols       and rev and b family pols  and   pol  and pol  proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna copied past ap sites quite effectively and generated products ranging from one base to full length extension pol  and rev readily incorporated one base opposite ap sites but then stopped pols  and  were severely blocked at ap sites pol  preferentially inserted t and a pol  inserted t g and a pol  inserted c and a rev preferentially inserted c opposite ap sites the b family pols  and  pcna preferentially inserted a   and   respectively consonant with the a rule hypothesis pols  and  pcna were much more efficient in next base extension preferably from a positioned opposite an ap site than pol   these results suggest that ap sites might be bypassed with moderate efficiency by single b and y family pols or combinations possibly by rev and pols     and  pcna at the insertion step opposite the lesion and by pols  and  pcna at the subsequent extension step the patterns of the base preferences of human b family and y family pols in both insertion and extension are pertinent to some of the mutagenesis events induced by ap lesions in human cells
