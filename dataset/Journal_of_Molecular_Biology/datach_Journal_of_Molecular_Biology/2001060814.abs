subcellular localization and oligomerization of the arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  protein
the arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  atserk  gene is expressed in developing ovules and early embryos atserk is also transiently expressed during somatic embryogenesis the predicted atserk protein contains an extracellular domain with a leucine zipper motif followed by five leucine rich repeats a proline rich region a single transmembrane region and an intracellular kinase domain the atserk cdna was fused to two different variants of green fluorescent protein gfp  a yellow emitting gfp yfp and a cyan emitting gfp cfp  and transiently expressed in both plant protoplasts and insect cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy it was determined that the atserk yfp fusion protein is targeted to plasma membranes in both plant and animal cells the extracellular leucine rich repeats and in particular the n linked oligosaccharides that are present on them appear to be essential for correct localization of the atserk yfp protein the potential for dimerization of the atserk protein was investigated by measuring the yfp cfp fluorescence emission ratio using fluorescence spectral imaging microscopy this ratio will increase due to fluorescence resonance energy transfer if the atserk cfp and atserk yfp fusion proteins interact in   of the cells the yfp cfp emission ratio for plasma membrane localized atserk proteins was enhanced yeast protein interaction experiments confirmed the possibility for atserk homodimerization elimination of the extracellular leucine zipper domain reduced the yfp cfp emission ratio to control levels indicating that without the leucine zipper domain atserk is monomeric
