crystal structure of bacillus cereusd alanyl carrier protein ligase dlta in complex with atp
d alanylation of lipoteichoic acids modulates the surface charge and ligand binding of the gram positive cell wall disruption of the bacterial dlt operon involved in teichoic acid alanylation as well as inhibition of the dlta d alanyl carrier protein ligase protein has been shown to render the bacterium more susceptible to conventional antibiotics and host defense responses the dlta catalyzes the adenylation and thiolation reactions of d alanine this enzyme belongs to a superfamily of amp forming domains such as the ubiquitous acetyl coenzyme a synthetase we have determined the    resolution crystal structure of a dlta protein from bacillus cereus in complex with atp this structure sheds light on the geometry of the bound atp the invariant catalytic residue lys  appears to be mobile suggesting a molecular mechanism of catalysis for this superfamily of enzymes specific roles are also revealed for two other invariant residues the divalent cation stabilizing glu  and the  phosphate interacting arg   mutant proteins with a glutamine substitution at position   or   are inactive
