the denatured state of n pgk is compact and predominantly disordered
the organisation of the structure present in the chemically denatured n terminal domain of phosphoglycerate kinase n pgk has been determined by paramagnetic relaxation enhancements pres to define the conformational landscape accessible to the domain below   m guanidine hydrochloride guhcl  a species of n pgk denoted ib is detected distinct from those previously characterised by kinetic experiments folded f  kinetic intermediate ik and denatured d  the transition to ib is never completed at equilibrium because f predominates below   m guhcl therefore the ability of pres to report on transient or low population species has been exploited to characterise ib five single cysteine variants of n pgk were labelled with the nitroxide electron spin label mtsl   oxyl     tetramethyl  pyrroline  methyl methanesulfonate and the denaturant dependences of the relaxation properties of the amide nmr signals between   and   m guhcl were determined significant pres for ib were obtained but these were distributed almost uniformly throughout the sequence furthermore the pres indicate that no specific short tertiary contacts persist the data indicate a collapsed state with no coherent three dimensional structure but with a restricted radius beyond which the protein chain rarely reaches the nmr characteristics of ib indicate that it forms from the fully denatured state within    s and therefore a rapid collapse is the initial stage of folding of n pgk from its chemically denatured state by extrapolation ib is the predominant form of the denatured state under native conditions and the non specifically collapsed structure implies that many non native contacts and chain reversals form early in protein folding and must be broken prior to attaining the native state topology
