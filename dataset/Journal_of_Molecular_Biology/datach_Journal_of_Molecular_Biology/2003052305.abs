nmr solution structure of the non rgd disintegrin obtustatin
the solution structure of obtustatin a novel non rgd disintegrin of  residues isolated from vipera lebetina obtusa venom and a potent and selective inhibitor of the adhesion of integrin    to collagen iv has been determined by two dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance almost the whole set of chemical shifts for h  c and  n were assigned at natural abundance from d homonuclear and heteronuclear   mhz   mhz and   mhz spectra at ph   recorded at   k and   k final structural constraints consisted of   non redundant noe   long range   medium   sequential and  intra residue  four disulfide bond distances five   dihedral angles and four hydrogen bonds the  conformers with lowest total energy had no noe violations greater than    or dihedral angle violations greater than    the average root mean square deviation rmsd for backbone atoms of all residues among the  conformers was    and    for the  best defined residues obtustatin lacks any secondary structure compared to all known disintegrin structures in which the rgd motif is located at the apex of an  residue hairpin loop the active kts tripeptide of obtustatin is oriented towards a side of its nine residue integrin binding loop the c terminal tail is near to the active loop and these two structural elements display the largest atomic displacements due to local conformational disorder double cross peaks for w  y  and h  in the aromatic region of tocsy spectra local rmsd values for these residues and positive cross peaks in a roesy spectrum   mhz   ms mixing time  suggest that these residues act as a hinge allowing for the overall flexibility of the entire integrin binding loop these distinct structural features along with its different electrostatic surface potential in relation to other known disintegrins may confer to obtustatin its reported    integrin inhibitory selectivity
