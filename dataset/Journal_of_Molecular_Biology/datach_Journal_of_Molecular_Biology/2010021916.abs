crystal structures of an oligopeptide binding protein from the biosynthetic pathway of the  lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid
clavulanic acid ca is a clinically important  lactamase inhibitor that is produced by fermentation of streptomyces clavuligerus the ca biosynthesis pathway starts from arginine and glyceraldehyde  phosphate and proceeds via  s s clavaminic acid which is converted to  r r clavaldehyde the immediate precursor of  r r ca open reading frames  orf  and   orf  of the ca biosynthesis cluster encode oligopeptide binding proteins oppa and oppa  which are essential for ca biosynthesis oppa  are proposed to be involved in the binding and or transport of peptides across the s clavuligerus cell membrane peptide binding assays reveal that recombinant oppa and oppa bind di tripeptides containing arginine and certain nonapeptides including bradykinin crystal structures of oppa in its apo form and in complex with arginine or bradykinin were solved to      and     resolution respectively the overall fold of oppa consists of two lobes with a deep cavity in the center as observed for other oligopeptide binding proteins the large cavity creates a peptide arginine binding cleft the crystal structures of oppa in complex with arginine or bradykinin reveal that the c terminal arginine of bradykinin binds similarly to arginine the results are discussed in terms of the possible roles of oppa  in ca biosynthesis
