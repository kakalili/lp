a dimeric rna quadruplex architecture comprised of two g g a g g a hexads g g g g tetrads and uuuu loops
using cd and nmr we determined the structure of an rna oligomer r ggagguuuuggagg  r   comprising two ggagg segments joined by a uuuu segment a modified quadruplex structure was observed for r ggagguuuuggagg in solution even in the absence of k  an unusually stable dimeric rna quadruplex architecture formed from two strands of r ggagguuuuggagg at low k concentration is reported here in each strand of r ggagguuuuggagg  two sets of successive turns in the ggagg segments and turns at both ends of the uuuu loops drive four g g steps to align in a parallel manner a core with two stacked g tetrads being formed two adenine bases bind to two edges of one g g g g tetrad through the sheared g a mismatch augmenting the tetrad into a g g a g g a hexad thus one molecule of r ggagguuuuggagg folds into a modified quadruplex comprising a g g g g tetrad a uuuu double chain reversal loop and a g g a g g a hexad two such molecules further associate by stacking through the dimeric hexad  hexad interface with a rotational symmetry the ribose rings of most nucleotides take s close to c   endo puckering which is unusual for an rna k can increase the stability of this quadruplex structure the number of bound k was estimated from the results of the titration experiment besides g g and g a mismatches a network of hydrogen bonds including o    nh and c  h  o hydrogen bonds and the extensive base stacking contribute to the high thermodynamic stability of r  our results could provide the stereochemical and thermodynamic basis for elucidating the biological role of the ggagg containing rna segments abundantly existing in various rnas relevance to quadruplex mediated mrna  fmrp binding and hiv  genome rna dimerization is discussed
