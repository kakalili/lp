structural characterization of the as sb reductase lmacr from leishmania major
the arsenate antimonate reductase lmacr has been recently identified in the genome of leishmania major besides displaying phosphatase activity in vitro this enzyme is able to reduce both as v and sb v to their respective trivalent forms and is involved in the activation of pentostan a drug containing sb v used in the treatment of leishmaniasis lmacr displays sequence and functional similarity with the arsenate reductase scacr from saccharomyces cerevisiae and both proteins are homologous to the catalytic domain of cdc  phosphatases which in turn belong to the rhodanese cdc  phosphatase superfamily in this work the three dimensional structure of lmacr has been determined with crystallographic methods and refined at     resolution the protein structure maintains the overall rhodanese fold but substantial modifications are observed in secondary structure position and length however the conformation of the active site loop and the position of the catalytic residue cys  are unchanged with respect to the cdc  phosphatases from an evolutionary viewpoint lmacr and the related arsenate reductases form together with the known cdc  phosphatases a well defined subfamily of the rhodanese cdc  phosphatase superfamily characterized by a  amino acid long active site loop that is able to selectively bind substrates containing phosphorous arsenic or antinomy the evolutionary tree obtained for these proteins shows that besides the active site motif ce f y sxxr that characterizes cdc  phosphatase the novel calsq q v r motif is also conserved in sequences from fungi and plants similar to cdc  phosphatase these proteins are likely involved in cell cycle control the active site composition of lmacr  caqslvr does not belong to either group but gives to the enzyme a bifunctional activity of both phosphatase and as sb reductase the subtle dependence of substrate specificity on the amino acid composition of the active site loop displays the versatility of the ubiquitous rhodanese domain
