novel mechanism of regulation of the non receptor protein tyrosine kinase csk insights from nmr mapping studies and site directed mutagenesis edited by m f summers
csk c terminal src kinase  a protein tyrosine kinase consisting of the src homology  and  sh and sh  domains and a catalytic domain phosphorylates the c terminal tail of src family members resulting in downregulation of the src family kinase activity the src family kinases share   homology with csk but unlike src family kinases the catalytic domain of csk alone is weakly active and can be stimulated in trans by interacting with the csk sh domain suggesting a mode of intradomain regulation different from that of src family kinases the structural determinants of this intermolecular interaction were studied by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and site directed mutagenesis techniques chemical shift perturbation of backbone nuclei h  and  n has been used to map the csk catalytic domain binding site on the csk sh  the experimentally determined interaction surface includes three structural elements the n terminal tail a small part of the rt loop and the c terminal sh sh linker site directed mutagenesis revealed that mutations in the sh sh linker of the wild type csk decrease csk kinase activity up to fivefold whereas mutations in the rt loop left csk kinase activity largely unaffected we conclude that the sh sh linker plays a major role in the activation of the csk catalytic domain
