elements that regulate the dna damage response of proteins defective in cockayne syndrome
cockayne syndrome cs is a premature aging disorder characterized by developmental defects multisystem progressive degeneration and sensitivity to ultraviolet light cs is divided into two primary complementation groups a and b with the csa and csb proteins presumably functioning in dna repair and transcription using laser microirradiation and confocal microscopy we characterized the nature and regulation of the cs protein response to oxidative dna damage double strand breaks dsbs  angelicin monoadducts and trioxsalen interstrand crosslinks icls  our data indicate that csb recruitment is influenced by the type of dna damage and is most rapid and robust as follows icls gt dsbs gt monoadducts gt oxidative lesions transcription inhibition reduced accumulation of csb at sites of monoadducts and icls but it did not affect recruitment to although slightly affected retention at oxidative damage inhibition of histone deacetylation altered the dynamics of csb assembly suggesting a role for chromatin status in the response to dna damage whereas the proteasome inhibitor mg  had no effect the c terminus of csb and in particular its ubiquitin binding domain were critical to recruitment while the n terminus and a functional atpase domain played a minor role at best in facilitating protein accumulation although the absence of csa had no effect on csb recruitment csa itself localized at sites of icls dsbs and monoadducts but not at oxidative lesions our results reveal molecular components of the cs protein response and point to a major involvement of complex lesions in the pathology of cs
