on the role of  thr  in the allosteric regulation and catalytic mechanism of tryptophan synthase
the catalytic activity and substrate channeling of the pyridoxal   phosphate dependent tryptophan synthase    complex is regulated by allosteric interactions that modulate the switching of the enzyme between open low activity and closed high activity states during the catalytic cycle the highly conserved  thr  residue is part of loop  l and is located next to the  active site and forms part of the     subunit interface the role of the interactions of  thr  in  site catalysis and allosteric regulation was investigated by analyzing the kinetics and crystal structures of the isosteric mutant  thr  val the mutant displays strongly impaired allosteric     communication and the catalytic activity of the  reaction is reduced one hundred fold whereas the  activity is not affected the structural work establishes that the basis for the missing inter subunit signaling is the lack of loop  l closure even in the presence of the  subunit ligands  indolyl d glycerol   phosphate or  indolylpropanol   phosphate the structural basis for the reduced  activity has its origins in the missing hydrogen bond between  thr  and the catalytic residue  asp
