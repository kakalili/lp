autoinhibition of human dicer by its internal helicase domain
dicer a member of the ribonuclease iii family of enzymes processes double stranded rna substrates into    to  nt products that trigger sequence directed gene silencing by rna interference although the mechanism of rna recognition and length specific cleavage by dicer has been established the way in which dicing activity is regulated is unclear here we show that the n terminal domain of human dicer which is homologous to dexd h box helicases substantially attenuates the rate of substrate cleavage deletion or mutation of this domain activates human dicer in both single and multiple turnover assays the catalytic efficiency kcat km of the deletion construct is increased by  fold over that exhibited by the intact enzyme kinetic analysis shows that this activation is almost entirely due to an enhancement in kcat modest stimulation of catalysis by the full length dicer enzyme was observed in the presence of the tar rna binding protein which physically interacts with the dexd h box domain these results suggest that the dexd h box domain likely disrupts the functionality of the dicer active site until a structural rearrangement occurs perhaps upon assembly with its molecular partners
