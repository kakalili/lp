differential interactions of fluorescent agonists and antagonists with the yeast g protein coupled receptor ste p
we describe a rapid method to probe for mutations in cell surface ligand binding proteins that affect the environment of bound ligand the method uses fluorescence activated cell sorting to screen randomly mutated receptors for substitutions that alter the fluorescence emission spectrum of environmentally sensitive fluorescent ligands when applied to the yeast  factor receptor ste p a g protein coupled receptor the procedure identified  substitutions that red shift the emission of a fluorescent agonist including substitutions at residues previously implicated in ligand binding and at additional sites a separate set of substitutions identified in a screen for mutations that alter the emission of a fluorescent  factor antagonist occurs at sites that are unlikely to contact the ligand directly instead these mutations alter receptor conformation to increase ligand binding affinity and provide signaling in response to antagonists of normal receptors these results suggest that receptor  agonist interactions involve at least two sites of which only one is specific for the activated conformation of the receptor
