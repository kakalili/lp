phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate promotes budding yeast septin filament assembly and organization
septins are a conserved family of gtp binding proteins that assemble into symmetric linear heterooligomeric complexes which in turn are able to polymerize into apolar filaments and higher order structures in budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and other eukaryotes proper septin organization is essential for processes that involve membrane remodeling such as the execution of cytokinesis in yeast four septin subunits form a cdc   cdc   cdc  cdc   cdc   cdc  cdc   cdc  heterooctameric rod that polymerizes into filaments thought to form a collar around the bud neck in close contact with the inner surface of the plasma membrane to explore septin  membrane interactions we examined the effect of lipid monolayers on septin organization at the ultrastructural level using electron microscopy using this methodology we have acquired new insights into the potential effect of septin  membrane interactions on filament assembly and more specifically on the role of phosphoinositides our studies demonstrate that budding yeast septins interact specifically with phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate pip  and indicate that the n terminus of cdc  makes a major contribution to the interaction of septin filaments with pip  furthermore we found that the presence of pip promotes filament polymerization and organization on monolayers even under conditions that prevent filament formation in solution or for mutants that prevent filament formation in solution in the extreme case of septin complexes lacking the normally terminal subunit cdc  or the normally central cdc  doublet the combination of the pip containing monolayer and nucleotide permitted filament formation in vitro via atypical cdc   cdc  and cdc  cdc interactions respectively
