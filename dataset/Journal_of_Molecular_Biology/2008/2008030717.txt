The peptide bond preceding proline residues realizes a cis/trans conformational switch with high switching resistance in native proteins and folding intermediates. Therefore, individual isomers have the potential to differ in bioactivity. However, information about isomer-specific bioactivities is difficult to obtain because of the risk of affecting isomeric distribution by bioactivity assay components.Here we present an approach that allows for the measurement of the recovery of enzymatic activities of wild-type RNase T1 and RNase T1 variants during refolding under conditions where the population of enzyme–substrate or enzyme–product complexes is negligible. Recovery of enzymatic activity was continuously monitored within the visible range of the spectrum by addition of a fluorescence-labeled nucleotide substrate to the refolding sample. We found that a nonnative trans conformation at Pro39 renders the RNase T1 almost completely inactive. A folding intermediate having a nonnative trans conformation at Pro55 shows about 46% of the enzymatic activity referred to the native state. Pro55, in contrast to the active site located Pro39, is situated in a solvent-exposed loop region remote from active-site residues. In both cases, peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases accelerate the regain of nucleolytic activity. Our findings show that even if there is a considerable distance between the site of isomerization and the active site, conformational control of the bioactivity of proteins is likely to occur, and that the surface location of prolyl bonds suffices for the control of buried active sites mediated by peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerases.
