thermodynamic characterization of binding oxytricha nova single strand telomere dna with the alpha protein n terminal domain
the oxytricha nova telemere binding protein alpha subunit binds single strand dna and participates in a nucleoprotein complex that protects the very ends of chromosomes to understand how the n terminal dna binding domain of alpha interacts with dna we measured the stoichiometry enthalpy  h  entropy  s  and dissociation constant kd dna for binding telomere dna fragments at different temperatures and salt concentrations using native gel electrophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry itc  about   of the total free energy of binding corresponded with non electrostatic interactions for all dnas telomere dna fragments d t g  d t g  d g t g  and d g t g  each formed monovalent protein complexes in the case of d t g t g  which has two tandemly repeated d tttttgggg telomere motifs two binding sites were observed the high affinity  a site  has a dissociation constant kd dna a     nm while the low affinity  b site  is characterized by kd dna b       nm at    c nucleotide substitution variants verified that the a site corresponds principally with the   terminal portion of d t g t g  the relative contributions of entropy  s and enthalpy  h for binding reactions were dna length dependent as was heat capacity  cp  these trends with respect to dna length likely reflect structural transitions in the dna molecule that are coupled with dna  protein association results presented here are important for understanding early intermediates and subsequent stages in the assembly of the full telomere nucleoprotein complex and how binding events can prepare the telomere dna for extension by telomerase a critical event in telomere biology
