molecular cloning and crystal structural analysis of a novel  n acetylhexosaminidase from paenibacillus sp ts  capable of degrading glycosphingolipids
we report the molecular cloning and characterization of two novel  n acetylhexosaminidases   hex ec      from paenibacillus sp strain ts  the two  hexs hex and hex  were   identical in primary structure and the n terminal region of both enzymes showed significant similarity with  hexs belonging to glycoside hydrolase family   gh   interestingly however the c terminal region of hex and hex shared no sequence similarity with the gh   hexs or other known proteins both recombinant enzymes expressed in escherichia coli bl  de  hydrolyzed the  n acetylhexosamine linkage of chitooligosaccharides and glycosphingolipids such as asialo gm and gb cer in the absence of detergent however the enzyme was not able to hydrolyze gm ganglioside in the presence or in the absence of detergent we determined three crystal structures of hex  the hex deletion mutant hex  c at a resolution of     hex  c in complex with  n acetylglucosamine at     and hex  c in complex with  n acetylgalactosamine at     we made a docking model of hex  c with gm oligosaccharide revealing that the sialic acid residue of gm could hinder access of the substrate to the active site cavity this is the first report describing the molecular cloning characterization and x ray structure of a procaryotic  hex capable of hydrolyzing glycosphingolipids
