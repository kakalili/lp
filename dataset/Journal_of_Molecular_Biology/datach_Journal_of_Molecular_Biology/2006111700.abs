identification of escherichia coli m g methyltransferases i the ycby gene encodes a methyltransferase specific for g   of the   s rrna
n methylguanosine   of the   s rrna is located in a cluster of modified nucleotides concentrated at the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome here we describe the identification of a gene ycby as encoding an enzyme responsible for methylation of g   knock out of the ycby gene leads to loss of modification at g   as revealed by reverse transcription the modification is restored in the ycby knock out strain if co transformed with a plasmid expressing the ycby gene product recombinant ycby protein is able to methylate   s rrna purified from the ycby knock out strain in vitro assembled   s subunits are not a substrate for the methylase knock out of the ycby gene leads to growth retardation growth competition with the parental wild type strain leads to a gradual decrease in the knock out strain cells proportion in the media it is likely that the g   modification is necessary for prevention of non functional secondary or tertiary structure formation at the peptidyl transferase center based on these results we suggest that ycby be renamed to rlml in accordance with the accepted nomenclature for rrna methyltransferases
