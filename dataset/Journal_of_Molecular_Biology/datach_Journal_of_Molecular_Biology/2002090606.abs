trimeric crystal structure of the glycoside hydrolase family    galactosidase from thermus thermophilus a and the structure of its complex with galactose
the  galactosidase from an extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus a  a   gal  is thermostable and belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family   gh   as the first known structures of a gh  enzyme we determined the crystal structures of free and galactose bound a   gal at    and    resolution respectively a   gal forms a homotrimeric structure resembling a flowerpot each monomer has an active site located inside a large central tunnel the n terminal domain of a   gal has a tim barrel fold as predicted from hydrophobic cluster analysis the putative catalytic residues of a   gal glu  and glu   superimpose well with the catalytic residues of escherichia coli  galactosidase the environment around the catalytic nucleophile glu   is similar to that in the case of e coli  galactosidase but the recognition mechanism for a substrate is different trp  of the next subunit of the trimer constitutes a part of the active site pocket indicating that the trimeric structure is essential for the enzyme activity structural comparison with other glycoside hydrolases revealed that many features of the   superfamily are conserved in the a   gal structure on the basis of the results of h nmr spectroscopy a   gal was determined to be a  retaining  enzyme interestingly the active site was similar with those of retaining enzymes but the overall fold of the tim barrel domain was very similar to that of an inverting enzyme   amylase
