the sec  homology module of neurofibromin binds cellular glycerophospholipids mass spectrometry and structure of a lipid complex
neurofibromin is the protein product of the tumor suppressor gene nf  alterations of which are responsible for the pathogenesis of the common disorder neurofibromatosis type i nf  the only well characterized function of neurofibromin is its rasgap activity contained in the central gap related domain grd  by solving the crystal structure of a   kda fragment at the c terminal end of the grd we have recently identified a novel bipartite lipid binding module composed of a sec  homologous and a previously undetected pleckstrin homology ph like domain using lipid exchange assays along with mass spectrometry we show here that the sec  like portion binds to   sn phosphatidyl sn glycerol ptdgro   sn phosphatidyl ethanolamine ptdetn and  choline ptdcho and to a minor extent to  sn phosphatidyl l serine ptdser and   sn phosphatidyl d myo inositol ptdins  phosphorylated ptdins ptdinsps are not detected as binders in the mass spectrometry assay but their soluble inositol phosphate headgroups and related compounds can inhibit the lipid exchange reaction we also present here the crystal structure of this module with the sec  portion bound to a cellular glycerophospholipid ligand our structure has model character for the substrate bound form of yeast sec p of which only detergent bound structures are available so far to assess potential regulation of the lipid exchange reaction in detail we present a novel strategy using nanospray mass spectrometry ion intensities of initial phospholipids and exchanged deuterated analogues bound by the protein module allow the quantitative analysis of differences in the exchange activity under various conditions
