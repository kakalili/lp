the in vivo conformation of the plastid dna of toxoplasma gondii implications for replication edited by n h chua
the phylum apicomplexa comprises thousands of obligate intracellular parasites some of which cause serious disease in man and other animals though not photosynthetic some of them including the malaria parasites plasmodium spp  and the causative organism of toxoplasmosis toxoplasma gondii possess a remnant plastid partially determined by a highly derived residual genome encoded in  kb dna the genetic maps of the plastid genomes of these two organisms are extremely similar in nucleotide sequence gene function and gene order however a study using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy has shown that in contrast to the malarial version only a minority of the plastid dna of toxoplasma occurs as circular  kb molecules the majority consists of a precise oligomeric series of linear tandem arrays of the genome each oligomer terminating at the same site in the genetic map i e in the centre of a large inverted repeat ir which encodes duplicated trna and rrna genes this overall topology strongly suggests that replication occurs by a rolling circle mechanism initiating at the centre of the ir which is also the site at which the linear tails of the rolling circles are processed to yield the oligomers a model is proposed which accounts for the quantitative structure of the molecular population it is relevant that a somewhat similar structure has been reported for at least three land plant chloroplast genomes
