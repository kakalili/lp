probing structural determinants specifying high thermostability in bacillus licheniformis  amylase edited by a r fersht
bacillus licheniformis  amylase bla is a starch degrading enzyme that is highly thermostable although it is produced by a rather mesophilic organism over the last decade the origin of bla thermal properties has been extensively investigated in both academic and industrial laboratories yet it is poorly understood here we have used structure based mutagenesis in order to probe the role of amino acid residues previously proposed as being important for bla thermostability residues involved in salt bridges calcium binding or potential deamidation processes have been selected and replaced with various amino acids using a site directed mutagenesis method based on informational suppression a total of   amylase variants were created and analysed in vitro active amylase variants were tested for thermostability by measuring residual activities after incubation at high temperature out of the  target residues seven asp   asn   asp   asn   asp   asp  and ala   were found to be particularly intolerant to any amino acid substitutions some of which lead to very unstable mutant enzymes by contrast three asparagine residues asn   asn  and asn   could be replaced with amino acid residues that significantly increase the thermostability compared to the wild type enzyme the highest stabilization event resulted from the substitution of phenylalanine in place of asparagine at position   leading to a sixfold increase of the enzyme  s half life at   c ph     mm cacl  these results combined with those of previous mutational analyses show that the structural determinants contributing to the overall thermostability of bla concentrate in domain b and at its interface with the central a domain this region contains a triadic ca na ca metal binding site that appears extremely sensitive to any modification that may alter or reinforce the network of electrostatic interactions entrapping the metal ions in particular a loop spanning from residue   to   which undergoes pronounced conformational changes upon removal of calcium appears to be the key feature for maintaining the enzyme structural integrity outside this region most salt bridges that were destroyed by mutations were found to be dispensable except for an asp  arg  salt bridge that contributes to the enhanced thermostability of bla compared to other homologous bacterial  amylases finally our studies demonstrate that the natural resistance of bla against high temperature is not optimized and can be enhanced further through various means including the removal of possibly deamidating residues
