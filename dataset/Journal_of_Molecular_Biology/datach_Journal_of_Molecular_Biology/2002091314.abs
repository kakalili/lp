molecular mechanism of the atp synthase s fo motor probed by mutational analyses of subunit a
the most prominent residue of subunit a of the f fo atp synthase is a universally conserved arginine ar  in propionigenium modestum  which was reported to permit no substitution with retention of atp synthesis or h coupled atp hydrolysis activity we show here that atp synthases with r  k or r  h mutations in the p modestum a subunit catalyse atp driven na transport above or below ph   respectively reconstituted fo with either mutation catalysed  na out na in exchange with similar ph profiles as found in atp driven na transport atp synthase with an ar  a substitution catalysed na dependent atp hydrolysis which was completely inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but not coupled to na transport this suggests that in the mutant the dissociation of na becomes more difficult and that the alkali ions remain therefore permanently bound to the c subunit sites the reconstituted mutant enzyme was also able to synthesise atp in the presence of a membrane potential which stopped at elevated external na concentrations these observations reinforce the importance of ar  to facilitate the dissociation of na from approaching rotor sites this task of ar  was corroborated by other results with the ar  a mutant  i after reconstitution into liposomes fo with the ar  a mutation did not catalyse  na out na in exchange at high internal sodium concentrations and ii at a constant  pna   na uptake was inhibited at elevated internal na concentrations hence in mutant ar  a sodium ions can only dissociate from their rotor sites into a reservoir of low sodium ion concentration whereas in the wild type the positively charged ar  allows the dissociation of na even into compartments of high na concentration
