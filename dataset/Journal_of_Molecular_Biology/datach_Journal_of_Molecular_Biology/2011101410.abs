the interaction of cofilin with the actin filament
cofilin is a key actin binding protein that is critical for controlling the assembly of actin within the cell here we present the results of molecular docking and dynamics studies using a muscle actin filament and human cofilin i guided by extensive mutagenesis results and other biophysical and structural studies we arrive at a model for cofilin bound to the actin filament this predicted structure agrees very well with electron microscopy results for cofilin decorated filaments provides molecular insight into how the known f and g actin sites on cofilin interact with the filament and also suggests new interaction sites that may play a role in cofilin binding the resulting atomic scale model also helps us understand the molecular function and regulation of cofilin and provides testable data for future experimental and simulation work
