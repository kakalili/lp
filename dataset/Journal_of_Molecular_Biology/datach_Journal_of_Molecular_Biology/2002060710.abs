elucidation of primary   n and vestigial    heavy metal binding sites in staphylococcus aureus pi  cadc evolutionary implications for metal ion selectivity of arsr smtb metal sensor proteins
despite a common evolutionary origin individual members of the arsr smtb family of bacterial metal responsive transcriptional repressors sense a wide range of heavy metal ions the molecular basis for this metal ion selectivity is unclear here we establish that staphylococcus aureus plasmid pi  cadc a cd ii pb ii bi iii zn ii sensor contains two distinct metal binding sites a thiolate rich  n site comprised exclusively of cysteine ligands that preferentially binds larger softer metal ions such as cd ii  pb ii and bi iii  and a second c terminal   site found at the dimer interface that is devoid of cysteine ligands and preferentially binds smaller harder metal ions co ii and zn ii  concurrently with metal binding to the  n site optical absorption and x ray spectroscopies reveal that the  n site can adopt distinct coordination geometries in order to accommodate different metal ions i e cd ii  bi iii  co ii and zn ii form distorted tetrahedral s complexes while pb ii adopts a trigonal s complex characterization of mutant cadcs reveals that the  n site is composed of cys  and cys  from the   helix of the helix turn helix dna binding domain and cys and or cys  from the n terminal  arm  of cadc cys  is excluded from the pb ii coordination sphere only the thiolate rich  n site is metalloregulatory for repressor binding to a fluorescein labeled cad o p oligonucleotide upon coordination to cd ii  pb ii  bi iii  zn ii  and weakly for co ii  substitution of cys  and cys with non ligating residues specifically abrogates metal dependent negative regulation of cad o p binding despite the fact that c g and c g cadcs maintain high affinity for metals in altered coordination complexes these findings reveal that formation of metal coordination bonds to cys and cys  play primary roles in transducing the allosteric response in cadc the evolutionary implications for metal ion selectivity of arsr smtb metal sensor proteins are discussed
