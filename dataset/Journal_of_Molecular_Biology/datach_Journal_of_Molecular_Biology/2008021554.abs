the buried diversity of bovine seminal ribonuclease shape and cytotoxicity of the swapped non covalent form of the enzyme
bovine seminal ribonuclease exists in the native state as an equilibrium mixture of a swapped and an unswapped dimer the molecular envelope and the exposed surface of the two isomers are practically indistinguishable and their diversity is almost completely buried in the interior of the protein surprisingly the cytotoxic and antitumor activity of the enzyme is a peculiar property of the swapped dimer this buried diversity comes into light in the reducing environment of the cytosol where the unswapped dimer dissociates into monomers whereas the swapped one generates a metastable dimeric form ncd bs with a quaternary assembly that allows the molecule to escape the protein inhibitor of ribonucleases the stability of this quaternary shape was mainly attributed to the combined presence of pro  and leu  we have prepared and fully characterized by x ray diffraction the double mutant p a l q palq of the seminal enzyme while the swapped and unswapped forms of the mutant have structures very similar to that of the corresponding wild type forms the non covalent form ncd palq adopts an opened quaternary structure different from that of ncd bs moreover model building clearly indicates that ncd palq can be easily sequestered by the protein inhibitor in agreement with these results cytotoxic assays have revealed that palq has limited activity whereas the single mutants p a and l q display cytotoxic activity against malignant cells almost as large as the wild type enzyme the significant increase in the antitumor activity brought about by the substitution of just two residues in going from the double mutant to the wild type enzyme suggests a new strategy to improve this important biological property by strengthening the interface that stabilizes the quaternary structure of ncd bs
