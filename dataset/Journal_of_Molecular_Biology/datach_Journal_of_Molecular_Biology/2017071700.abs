etv and ap transcription factors form multivalent interactions with three sites on the med  activator interacting domain
the recruitment of transcriptional cofactors by sequence specific transcription factors challenges the basis of high affinity and selective interactions extending previous studies that the n terminal activation domain ad of etv interacts with mediator subunit   med   we establish that similar aromatic rich motifs located both in the ad and in the dna binding domain dbd of the related ets factor etv interact with med  these etv regions bind med  independently display distinct kinetics and combine to contribute to a high affinity interaction of full length etv with med  high affinity interactions with med  are specific for the etv   subfamily as other ets factors display weaker binding the ad binds to a single site on med  and the dbd interacts with three med  sites allowing for simultaneous binding of both domains in full length etv  med  also stimulates the in vitro dna binding activity of etv by relieving autoinhibition etv   factors are often overexpressed in prostate cancer and genome wide studies in a prostate cancer cell line indicate that etv and med  occupy enhancers that are enriched for ets binding sequences and are both functionally important for the transcription of genes regulated by these enhancers ap motifs which bind jun and fos transcription factor families were observed in med  occupied regions and jun fos also contact med  fos strongly binds to the same med  site as etv ad and jun interacts with the other two med  sites in summary we describe features of the multivalent etv  and ap med  interactions thereby implicating these factors in the recruitment of med  to transcriptional control elements
