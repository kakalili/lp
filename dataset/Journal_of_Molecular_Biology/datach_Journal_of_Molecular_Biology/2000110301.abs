arginine side chain dynamics in the hiv  rev rre complex edited by m f summers
the binding of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rev protein to its viral rna target stem loop iib sliib within the rev response element rre  mediates the export of singly spliced and unspliced viral mrna from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells this rev mediated transport of viral rna is absolutely required for the replication of infectious virus to identify important features that influence the binding affinity and specificity of this rev rre interaction we have characterized the arginine side chain dynamics of the rev arginine rich motif arm while bound to a  nt rna oligomer that corresponds to sliib as the specificity of the rev rre interaction varies with salt concentration arginine side chain dynamics were characterized at two different salt conditions following nmr measurements of  n spin relaxation parameters for the arginine  n  nuclei the dynamics of the corresponding n  h  bond vectors were interpreted in terms of lipari szabo model free parameters using anisotropic expressions for the spectral density functions results from these analyses indicate that a number of arginine side chains display a surprising degree of conformational freedom when bound to rna and that arginine residues having known importance for specific rre recognition show striking differences in side chain mobility the  n relaxation measurements at different salt conditions suggest that the previously reported increase in rev rre specificity at elevated salt concentrations is likely due to reduced affinity of non specific rev rna interactions the observed dynamical behavior of the arginine side chains at this protein rna interface likely plays an important role in the specificity and affinity of rev sliib complex formation
