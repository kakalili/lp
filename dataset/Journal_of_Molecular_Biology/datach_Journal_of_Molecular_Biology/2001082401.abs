correlated sequence signatures as markers of protein protein interaction edited by g von heijne
as protein protein interaction is intrinsic to most cellular processes the ability to predict which proteins in the cell interact can aid significantly in identifying the function of newly discovered proteins and in understanding the molecular networks they participate in here we demonstrate that characteristic pairs of sequence signatures can be learned from a database of experimentally determined interacting proteins where one protein contains the one sequence signature and its interacting partner contains the other sequence signature the sequence signatures that recur in concert in various pairs of interacting proteins are termed correlated sequence signatures and it is proposed that they can be used for predicting putative pairs of interacting partners in the cell we demonstrate the potential of this approach on a comprehensive database of experimentally determined pairs of interacting proteins in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the proteins in this database have been characterized by their sequence signatures as defined by the interpro classification a statistical analysis performed on all possible combinations of sequence signature pairs has identified those pairs that are over represented in the database of yeast interacting proteins it is demonstrated how the use of the correlated sequence signatures as identifiers of interacting proteins can reduce significantly the search space and enable directed experimental interaction screens
