assembly and maturation of the bacteriophage lambda procapsid gpc is the viral protease
viral capsids are robust structures designed to protect the genome from environmental insults and deliver it to the host cell the developmental pathway for complex double stranded dna viruses is generally conserved in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic groups and includes a genome packaging step where viral dna is inserted into a pre formed procapsid shell the procapsids self assemble from monomeric precursors to afford a mature icosahedron that contains a single  portal  structure at a unique vertex the portal serves as the hole through which dna enters the procapsid during particle assembly and exits during infection bacteriophage  has served as an ideal model system to study the development of the large double stranded dna viruses within this context the  procapsid assembly pathway has been reported to be uniquely complex involving protein cross linking and proteolytic maturation events in this work we identify and characterize the protease responsible for  procapsid maturation and present a structural model for a procapsid bound protease dimer the procapsid protease possesses autoproteolytic activity it is required for degradation of the internal  scaffold  protein required for procapsid self assembly and it is responsible for proteolysis of the portal complex our data demonstrate that these proteolytic maturation events are not required for procapsid assembly or for dna packaging into the structure but that proteolysis is essential to late steps in particle assembly and or in subsequent infection of a host cell the data suggest that the  like proteases and the herpesvirus like proteases define two distinct viral protease folds that exhibit little sequence or structural homology but that provide identical functions in virus development the data further indicate that procapsid assembly and maturation are strongly conserved in the prokaryotic and eukaryotic virus groups
