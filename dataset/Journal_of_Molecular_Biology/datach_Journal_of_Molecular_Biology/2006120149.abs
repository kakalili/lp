structural basis of the sulphate starvation response in e coli crystal structure and mutational analysis of the cofactor binding domain of the cbl transcriptional regulator
cbl is a member of the large family of lysr type transcriptional regulators lttrs common in bacteria and found also in archaea and algal chloroplasts the function of cbl is required in escherichia coli for expression of sulphate starvation inducible ssi genes associated with the biosynthesis of cysteine from organic sulphur sources sulphonates  here we report the crystal structure of the cofactor binding domain of cbl c cbl from e coli the overall fold of c cbl is very similar to the regulatory domain rd of another lysr family member cysb the rd is composed of two subdomains enclosing a cavity which is expected to bind effector molecules we have constructed and analysed several full length cbl variants bearing single residue substitutions in the rd that affect cofactor responses using in vivo and in vitro transcription assays we demonstrate that pssue a cbl responsive promoter is down regulated not only by the cofactor adenosine phosphosulphate aps  but also by thiosulphate and that the same rd determinants are important for the response to both cofactors we also demonstrate the effects of selected site directed mutations on cbl oligomerization and discuss these in the context of the structure based on the crystal structure and molecular modelling we propose a model for the interaction of cbl with adenosine phosphosulphate
