dispersed sites of hiv vif dependent polyubiquitination in the dna deaminase apobec f
apobec f a f and apobec g a g are dna cytosine deaminases that potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus type  replication when the virus is deprived of its accessory protein vif virion infectivity factor  vif counteracts these restriction factors by recruiting a f and a g to an e ubiquitin ub ligase complex that mediates their polyubiquitination polyub and proteasomal degradation while previous efforts have identified single amino acid residues in apobec proteins required for vif recognition less is known about the downstream ub acceptor sites that are targeted one prior report identified a cluster of polyubiquitinated residues in a g and proposed an antiparallel model of a g interaction with the vif  e ub ligase complex wherein vif binding at one terminus of a g orients the opposite terminus for polyub iwatani et al     proc natl acad sci usa            to test the generalizability of this model we carried out a complete mutagenesis of the lysine residues in a f and used a complementary unbiased proteomic approach to identify ub acceptor sites targeted by vif our data indicate that internal lysines are the dominant ub acceptor sites in both a f and a g in contrast with the proposed antiparallel model however we find that the vif dependent polyub of a f and a g can occur at multiple acceptor sites dispersed along predicted lysine enriched surfaces of both the n and c terminal deaminase domains these data suggest an alternative model for binding of apobec proteins to the vif  e ub ligase complex and diminish enthusiasm for the amenability of apobec ub acceptor sites to therapeutic intervention
