in vivo dissection of the tat translocation pathway in escherichia coli edited by g von heijne
the bacterial tat pathway is capable of exporting folded proteins carrying a special twin arginine rr signal peptide by using two in vivo reporter proteins we assessed factors that affect tat pathway transport we observed that like the intact rr signal peptide those with a kr or rk substitution were still capable of mediating the translocation of the folded green fluorescent protein gfp  however the translocation efficiency decreased in the order of rr gt kr gt rk the kk motif was unable to mediate gfp translocation the translocation of the rr gfp fusion required tata tatb and tatc proteins by exploiting the periplasmic bactericidal property of colicin v colv  we constructed a translocation suicide probe rr colv the translocation of rr colv fully inhibited the growth of wild type escherichia coli and those of the  tatd and  tate mutants in contrast the deletion of the tatc gene blocked rr colv in the cytoplasm and this strain exhibited a normal growth phenotype interestingly the growth of  tata and tatb mutants was inhibited partially by rr colv moreover kr rk and kk motifs were capable of mediating the colv translocation with a decreasing rr kr gt rk gt kk efficiency in addition to tate and tatc proteins either tata or tatb was sufficient for the translocation of rr colv or kr colv in contrast tata plus the conserved n terminal domain of tatb were required to mediate the killing effect of colv fused to the less efficient rk signal peptide taken together these results suggest that a fully efficient tat pathway transport is determined by the sequence of the signal peptide the composition of the tat apparatus and the intrinsic characteristics of exported proteins
