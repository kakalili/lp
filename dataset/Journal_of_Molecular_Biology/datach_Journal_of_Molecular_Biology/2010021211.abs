compensated pathogenic deviations analysis of structural effects
pathogenic deviations pds in humans are disease causing missense mutations however in some cases these disease associated residues occur as the wild type residues in functionally equivalent proteins in other species and these cases are termed  compensated pathogenic deviations   cpds  the lack of pathogenicity in a non human protein is presumed to be explained in most cases by the presence of compensatory mutations most commonly within the same protein identification of structural features of cpds and detection of specific compensatory events will help us to understand traversal along fitness landscape valleys in protein evolution we divided mutations listed in the omim online mendelian inheritance in man database into pd and cpd data sets and performed two independent analyses  i we searched for potential compensatory mutations spatially close to the cpds and  ii using our saapdb database we examined likely structural effects to try to explain why mutations are pathogenic comparing pds and cpds our data sets were obtained from a set of   human proteins of known structure and contained a total of   mutations of which   from  structures were seen to be compensated in at least one functionally equivalent protein in another non human species structural analysis results confirm previous findings that cpds are on average   milder  in their likely structural effects than uncompensated pds and tend to be on the protein surface we also showed that the residues surrounding the cpd residue in the folded protein are more often mutated than the residues surrounding an uncompensated mutation supporting the hypothesis that compensation is largely a result of structurally local mutations
