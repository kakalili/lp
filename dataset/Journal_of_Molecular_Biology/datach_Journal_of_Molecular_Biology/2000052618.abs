genomic sequences of bacteriophages hk  and hk   pervasive genetic mosaicism in the lambdoid bacteriophages edited by m gottesman
we report the complete genome dna sequences of hk      bp and hk      bp  double stranded dna bacteriophages of escherichia coli and members of the lambdoid or  like group of phages we provide a comparative analysis of these sequences with each other and with two previously determined lambdoid family genome sequences those of e coli phage  and salmonella typhimurium phage p  the comparisons confirm that these phages are genetic mosaics with mosaic segments separated by sharp transitions in the sequence the mosaicism provides clear evidence that horizontal exchange of genetic material is a major component of evolution for these viruses the data suggest a model for evolution in which diversity is generated by a combination of illegitimate and homologous recombination and mutational drift and selection for function produces a population in which most of the surviving mosaic boundaries are located at gene boundaries or in some cases at protein domain boundaries within genes comparisons of these genomes highlight a number of differences that allow plausible inferences of specific evolutionary scenarios for some parts of the genome the comparative analysis also allows some inferences about function of genes or other genetic elements we give examples for the generalized recombination genes of hk  hk  and p  and for a putative head tail adaptor protein of hk  and hk   we also use the comparative approach to identify a new class of genetic elements the morons which consist of a protein coding region flanked by a putative   promoter and a putative factor independent transcription terminator all located between two genes that may be adjacent in a different phage we argue that morons are autonomous genetic modules that are expressed from the repressed prophage sequence composition of the morons implies that they have entered the phages  genomes by horizontal transfer in relatively recent evolutionary time
