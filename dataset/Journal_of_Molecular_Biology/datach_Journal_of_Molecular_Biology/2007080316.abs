the nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase  cd  is incorporated into human immunodeficiency type  particles where it remains biologically active
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  carries a variety of host proteins in addition to virus encoded structural proteins both in its envelope and inside the viral particle previous studies have reported that the hiv  life cycle is affected by such virus associated host cell surface proteins the nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase  ntpdase  also known as cd  is a plasma membrane bound ectoenzyme that hydrolyzes extracellular atp and adp to amp it has been shown that cd  inhibits platelet function and is thus a critical thromboregulatory molecule we demonstrate here that host derived cd  is acquired by both laboratory adapted and clinical variants of hiv  produced in cellular reservoirs of the virus moreover purified cd  bearing virions but not isogenic viruses lacking cd  display strong atpase and adpase activities it is of particular interest that virions bearing this cellular enzyme can inhibit adp induced platelet aggregation an effect blocked by an ntpdase inhibitor on the basis of published and the present data on the functionality of human cellular proteins embedded within hiv  it can be proposed that these proteins might contribute to some of the immunologic deficiencies seen in infected individuals
