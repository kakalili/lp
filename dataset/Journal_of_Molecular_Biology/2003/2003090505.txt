The three-dimensional structure of the skeletal muscle voltage-gated L-type calcium channel (Cav1.1; dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR) was determined using electron cryo-microscopy and single-particle averaging. The structure shows a single channel complex with an approximate total molecular mass of 550 kDa, corresponding to the five known subunits of the DHPR, and bound detergent and lipid. Features visible in our structure together with antibody labeling of the β and α2 subunits allowed us to assign locations for four of the five subunits within the structure. The most striking feature of the structure is the extra-cellular α2 subunit that protrudes from the membrane domain in close proximity to the α1 subunit. The cytosolic β subunit is located close to the membrane and adjacent to subunits α1, γ and δ. Our structure correlates well with the functional and biochemical data available for this channel and suggests a three-dimensional model for the excitation–contraction coupling complex consisting of DHPR tetrads and the calcium release channel.
