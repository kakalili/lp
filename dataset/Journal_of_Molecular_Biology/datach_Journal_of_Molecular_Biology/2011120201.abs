s glutathionylation of cysteine  in the ape protein impairs abasic endonuclease activity
human apurinic apyrimidinic ap endonuclease  ape  is a central participant in the base excision repair pathway exhibiting ap endonuclease activity that incises the dna backbone   to an abasic site besides its prominent role as a dna repair enzyme ape was separately identified as a protein called redox effector factor  which is able to enhance the dna binding activity of several transcription factors through a thiol exchange based reduction  oxidation mechanism in the present study we found that human ape is s glutathionylated under conditions of oxidative stress both in the presence of glutathione in vitro and in cells s glutathionylated ape displayed significantly reduced ap endonuclease activity on abasic site containing oligonucleotide substrates a result stemming from impaired dna binding capacity the combination of site directed mutagenesis biochemical assays and mass spectrometric analysis identified cys  in human ape as the critical residue for the s glutathionylation that leads to reduced ap endonuclease activity this modification is reversible by reducing agents which restore ape incision function our studies describe a novel posttranslational modification of ape that regulates the dna repair function of the protein
