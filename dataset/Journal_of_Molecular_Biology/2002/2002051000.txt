We have solved the solution structure of the peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (PPIase) domain of the trigger factor from Mycoplasma genitalium by homo- and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Our results lead to a well-defined structure with a backbone rmsd of 0.23Å. As predicted, the PPIase domain of the trigger factor adopts the FK506 binding protein (FKBP) fold. Furthermore, our NMR relaxation data indicate that the dynamic behavior of the trigger factor PPIase domain and of FKBP are similar. Structural variations when compared to FKBP exist in the flap region and within the bulges of strand 5 of the β sheet. Although the active-site crevice is similar to that of FKBP, subtle steric variations in this region can explain why FK506 does not bind to the trigger factor. Sequence variability (27% identity) between trigger factor and FKBP results in significant differences in surface charge distribution and the absence of the first strand of the central β sheet. Our data indicate, however, that this strand may be partially structured as “nascent” β strand. This makes the trigger factor PPIase domain the most minimal representative of the FKBP like protein family of PPIases.
