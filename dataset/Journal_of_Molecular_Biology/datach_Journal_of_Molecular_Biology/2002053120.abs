monodisperse hsp   nonamer exhibits dynamic dissociation and reassociation with the nonamer dissociation prerequisite for chaperone like activity
small heat shock proteins shsps of various origins exist commonly as oligomers and exhibit chaperone like activities in vitro hsp   the shsp from mycobacterium tuberculosis was previously shown to exist as a monodisperse nonamer in solution when analyzed by size exclusion chromatography and electron cryomicroscropy this study represents part of our effort to understand the chaperone mechanism of hsp   focusing on the role of the oligomeric status of the protein here we present evidence to show that the hsp   nonamer dissociates at elevated temperatures accompanied by a greatly enhanced chaperone like activity moreover the chaperone like activity was increased dramatically when the nonameric structure of hsp   was disturbed by chemical cross linking which impeded the correct reassociation of hsp   nonamer these suggest that the dissociation of the nonameric structure is a prerequisite for hsp   to bind to denaturing substrate proteins on the other hand our data obtained by using radiolabeled and non radiolabeled proteins clearly demonstrated that subunit exchange occurs readily between the hsp   oligomers even at a temperature as low as  c in light of all these observations we propose that hsp   although it appears to be homogeneous when examined at room temperature actually undertakes rapid dynamic dissociation reassociation with the equilibrium and thus the chaperone like activities regulated mainly by the environmental temperature
