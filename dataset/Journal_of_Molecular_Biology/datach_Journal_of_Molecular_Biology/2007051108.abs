crystal structure of human filamin c domain  and small angle scattering model for filamin c     dimer
filamin c is a dimeric actin binding protein involved in organization of cortical cytoskeleton and of the sarcomere we performed crystallographic small angle x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments on the constructs containing carboxy terminal domains of the protein domains     and      the crystal structure of domain  of filamin c showed that the protein adopts the expected immunoglobulin ig like fold small angle x ray scattering experiments performed on filamin c tandem ig like domains  and  reveal a dimer that is formed by domain  and that domain  has little interactions with itself or with domain   while the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the filamin c domains     form elongated monomers in diluted solutions
