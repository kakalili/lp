stabilization of short collagen like triple helices by protein engineering edited by j karn
recombinant expression of collagens and fragments of collagens is often difficult as their biosynthesis requires specific post translational enzymes in particular prolyl  hydroxylase although the use of hydroxyproline deficient variants offers one possibility to overcome this difficulty these proteins usually differ markedly in stability when compared with the hydroxyproline containing analogs here we report a method to stabilize collagen like peptides by fusing them to the n terminus of the bacteriophage t fibritin foldon domain the isolated foldon domain and the chimeric protein glypropro  foldon were expressed in a soluble form in escherichia coli the recombinant proteins and the synthetic proprogly  peptide were characterized by circular dichroism cd spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation we show that the foldon domain which comprises only  amino acid residues forms an obligatory trimer with a high degree of thermal stability the cd thermal unfolding profiles recorded from foldon are monophasic and completely reversible upon cooling similar van  t hoff and calorimertic enthalpy values of trimer formation indicated a cooperative all or none transition as reported previously  proprogly  peptides form collagen triple helices of only moderate stability when fused to the foldon domain however triple helix formation of glypropro  is concentration independent and the midpoint temperature of the triple helix unfolding is significantly increased the stabilizing function of the trimeric foldon domain is explained by the close vicinity of its n termini which induce a high local concentration in the range of  m for the c termini of the collagen like peptide collagen foldon fusion proteins should be potentially useful to study receptor collagen interactions
