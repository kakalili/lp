localization of uroplakin ia the urothelial receptor for bacterial adhesin fimh on the six inner domains of the  nm urothelial plaque particle edited by w baumeister
the binding of uropathogenic escherichia coli to the urothelial surface is a critical initial event for establishing urinary tract infection because it prevents the bacteria from being removed by micturition and it triggers bacterial invasion as well as host cell defense this binding is mediated by the fimh adhesin located at the tip of the bacterial type  fimbrium and its urothelial receptor uroplakin ia upia  to localize the upia receptor on the  nm particles that form two dimensional crystals of asymmetric unit membrane aum covering gt   of the apical urothelial surface we constructed a    resolution  d model of the mouse  nm aum particle by negative staining and electron crystallography similar to previous lower resolution models of bovine and pig aum particles the mouse  nm aum particle consists of six inner and six outer domains that are interconnected to form a twisted ribbon like structure treatment of urothelial plaques with        v v triton x   allowed the stain to penetrate into the membrane revealing parts of the uroplakin transmembrane moiety with an overall diameter of  nm which was much bigger than the  nm value determined earlier by quick freeze deep etch atomic force microscopy of native unfixed mouse and bovine urothelial plaques confirmed the overall structure of the luminal  nm aum particle that was raised by   nm above the luminal membrane surface and in addition revealed a circular   nm high cytoplasmic protrusion of    nm diameter finally a difference map calculated from the mouse urothelial plaque images collected in the presence and absence of recombinant bacterial fimh fimc complex revealed the selective binding of fimh to the six inner domains of the  nm aum particle these results indicate that the  nm aum particle is anchored by a    nm diameter transmembrane stalk and suggest that bacterial binding to upia that resides within the six inner domains of the  nm aum particle may preferentially trigger transmembrane signaling involved in bacterial invasion and host cell defense
