structure and function of the escherichia coli protein ymgb a protein critical for biofilm formation and acid resistance
the escherichia coli gene cluster ymgabc was identified in transcriptome studies to have a role in biofilm development and stability in this study we showed that ymgb represses biofilm formation in rich medium containing glucose decreases cellular motility and protects the cell from acid indicating that ymgb has a major role in acid resistance in e coli our data show that these phenotypes are potentially mediated through interactions with the important cell signal indole in addition gel mobility shift assays suggest that ymgb may be a non specific dna binding protein using nickel enrichment dna microarrays we showed that ymgb binds either directly or indirectly via a probable ligand genes important for biofilm formation to advance our understanding of the function of ymgb we used x ray crystallography to solve the structure of the protein to     resolution ymgb is a biological dimer that is structurally homologous to the e coli gene regulatory protein hha despite having only  sequence identity this supports our dna microarray data showing that ymgb is a gene regulatory protein therefore this protein which clearly has a critical role in acid resistance in e coli has been renamed as arir for regulator of acid resistance influenced by indole
