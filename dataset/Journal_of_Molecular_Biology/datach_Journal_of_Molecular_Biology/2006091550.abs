flexibility and adaptability in binding of e coli cytidine repressor to different operators suggests a role in differential gene regulation
interactions between dna bound transcription factors cytr and crp regulate the promoters of the escherichia coli cytr regulon a distinctive feature of the palindromic cytr operators is highly variable length central spacers     bp  previously we demonstrated distinct modes of cytr binding to operators that differ in spacer length these different modes are characterized by opposite enthalpic and entropic contributions at    c of particular note were radically different negative  cp values suggesting variable contribution from coupled protein folding and or dna structural transitions we proposed that the cytr dna binding domain adopts either a more rigid or flexible dna bound conformation in response to the different spacer lengths more recently similar effects were shown to contribute to discrimination between operator and non specific dna binding by lacr a cytr homolog here we have extended the thermodynamic analysis to the remaining natural cytr operators plus a set of synthetic operators designed to isolate spacing as the single variable the thermodynamic results show a broad and monotonic range of effects that are primarily dependent on spacer length the magnitude of effects suggests participation by more than the dna binding domain  n hsqc nmr and cd spectral analyses were employed to characterize the structural basis for these effects the results indicate that while cytr forms a well ordered structure in solution it is highly dynamic we propose a model in which a large ensemble of native state conformations narrows upon binding to an extent governed by operator spacing this in turn is expected to constrain intermolecular interactions in the cytr crp dna complex thus generating operator specific effects on repression and induction of transcription
