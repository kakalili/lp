The stability and (un)folding of the 19-residue peptide, SCVTLYQSWRYSQADNGCA, corresponding to the first β-hairpin (residues 10 to 28) of the α-amylase inhibitor tendamistat (PDB entry 3AIT) has been studied by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water under periodic boundary conditions at several temperatures (300 K, 360 K and 400 K), starting from various conformations for simulation lengths, ranging from 10 to 30 ns. Comparison of trajectories of the reduced and oxidized native peptides reveals the importance of the disulphide bridge closing the β-hairpin in maintaining a proper turn conformation, thereby insuring a proper side-chain arrangement of the conserved turn residues. This allows rationalization of the conservation of those cysteine residues among the family of α-amylase inhibitors. High temperature simulations starting from widely different initial configurations (native β-hairpin, α and left-handed helical and extended conformations) begin sampling similar regions of the conformational space within tens of nanoseconds, and both native and non-native β-hairpin conformations are recovered. Transitions between conformational clusters are accompanied by an increase in energy fluctuations, which is consistent with the increase in heat capacity measured experimentally upon protein folding. The folding events observed in the various simulations support a model for β-hairpin formation in which the turn is formed first, followed by hydrogen bond formation closing the hairpin, and subsequent stabilization by side-chain hydrophobic interactions.
