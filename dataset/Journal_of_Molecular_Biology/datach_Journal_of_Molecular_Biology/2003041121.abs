spruce budworm antifreeze protein changes in structure and dynamics at low temperature
antifreeze proteins afps prevent the growth of ice and are used by some organisms that live in sub zero environments for protection against freezing all afps are thought to function by an adsorption inhibition process in order to elucidate the ice binding mechanism the structures of several afps have been determined and have been shown to consist of different folds recently the first structures of the highly active insect afps have been characterized these proteins have a  helix structure which adds yet another fold to the afp family the  residue spruce budworm choristoneura fumiferana afp consists of a  helix with  residues per coil the structure contains two ranks of aligned threonine residues known as the txt motif  which were shown by mutagenesis experiments to be located in the ice binding face in our previous nmr study of this afp at   c we found that the txt face was not optimally defined because of the broadening of nmr resonances potentially due to weak oligomerization we present here a structure of spruce budworm afp determined at  c where this broadening is reduced in addition the h   n nmr dynamics of the protein were examined at   c and  c the results show that the spruce budworm afp is more structured at  c and support the general observation that afps become more rigid as the temperature is lowered
