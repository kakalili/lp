radial displacement of myosin cross bridges in mouse myocardium due to ablation of myosin binding protein c
myosin binding protein c cmybp c is a thick filament accessory protein which in cardiac muscle functions to regulate the kinetics of cross bridge interaction with actin however the underlying mechanism is not yet understood to explore the structural basis for cmybp c function we used synchrotron low angle x ray diffraction to measure interfilament lattice spacing and the equatorial intensity ratio i  i  in skinned myocardial preparations isolated from wild type wt and cmybp c null cmybp c     in relaxed myocardium ablation of cmybp c appeared to result in radial displacement of cross bridges away from the thick filaments as there was a significant increase     in the i  i  ratio for cmybp c           myocardium as compared to wt        while lattice spacing tended to be greater in cmybp c    myocardium       nm when compared to wt       nm  the difference was not statistically significant furthermore liquid like disorder in the myofilament lattice was significantly greater     greater in cmybp c    myocardium as compared to wt these results are consistent with our working hypothesis that cmybp c normally acts to tether myosin cross bridges nearer to the thick filament backbone thereby reducing the likelihood of cross bridge binding to actin and limiting cooperative activation of the thin filament
