bacterial voltage gated sodium channels bacnavs from the soil sea and salt lakes enlighten molecular mechanisms of electrical signaling and pharmacology in the brain and heart
voltage gated sodium channels navs provide the initial electrical signal that drives action potential generation in many excitable cells of the brain heart and nervous system for more than  years functional studies of navs have occupied a central place in physiological and biophysical investigation of the molecular basis of excitability recently structural studies of members of a large family of bacterial voltage gated sodium channels bacnavs prevalent in soil marine and salt lake environments that bear many of the core features of eukaryotic navs have reframed ideas for voltage gated channel function ion selectivity and pharmacology here we analyze the recent advances unanswered questions and potential of bacnavs as templates for drug development efforts
