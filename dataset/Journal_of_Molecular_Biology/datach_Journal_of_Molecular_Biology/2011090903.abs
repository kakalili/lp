crystal structure of the cytoplasmic n terminal domain of subunit i a homolog of subunit a of v atpase
subunit  a  is associated with the membrane bound vo complex of eukaryotic vacuolar h atpase acidification machinery it has also been shown recently to be involved in diverse membrane fusion secretory functions independent of acidification here we report the crystal structure of the n terminal cytosolic domain from the meiothermus ruber subunit  i  homolog of subunit a the structure is composed of a curved long central  helix bundle capped on both ends by two lobes with similar    architecture based on the structure a reasonable model of its eukaryotic subunit a counterpart was obtained the crystal structure and model fit well into reconstructions from electron microscopy of prokaryotic and eukaryotic vacuolar h atpases respectively clarifying their orientations and interactions and revealing features that could enable subunit a to play a role in membrane fusion secretion
