p but not r axis interface is involved in cooperative binding of nad on tetrameric phosphorylating glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase from bacillus stearothermophilus
homotetrameric phosphorylating glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh from bacillus stearothermophilus can be described as a dimer of dimers with three non equivalent p r and q interfaces in our previous study negative cooperativity in nad binding to wild type gapdh was interpreted according to the induced fit model in terms of two independent dimers with two interacting binding sites in each dimer two dimeric mutant gapdhs i e y g s g and d  g e  g were shown to exhibit positive cooperativity in nad binding based on the molecular modeling of the substitutions and the fact that the most extensive inter subunit interactions are formed across the p axis interface of the tetramer it was postulated that both dimeric mutant gapdhs were of o  p type therefore the p axis interface was assumed to play a major role in causing cooperativity in nad binding here two other mutant gapdhs y g r g and d  g have been studied using small angle x ray scattering the dimeric form of the d  g mutant gapdh is shown to be of o  r type whereas both dimeric mutant gapdhs y g r g and y g s g are of o  p type similarly to dimeric y g s g mutant gapdh the dimeric y g r g mutant gapdh exhibits positive cooperativity in nad binding on the other hand no significant cooperativity in nad binding to the dimeric form of the d  g mutant gapdh is observed whereas its tetrameric counterpart exhibits negative cooperativity similarly to the wild type enzyme altogether the results support the view that the p axis interface is essential in causing cooperativity in nad binding by transmitting the structural information induced upon cofactor binding from one subunit to the other one within o  p q  r dimers in contrast to the r axis interface which does not transmit structural information within o  r q  p dimers the absence of activity of o  p and o  r dimer gapdhs is the consequence of a pertubation of the conformation of the active site at least of the nicotinamide subsite as evidenced by the absence of an ion pair between catalytic residues c  and h  and the greater accessibility of c  to a thiol kinetic probe
