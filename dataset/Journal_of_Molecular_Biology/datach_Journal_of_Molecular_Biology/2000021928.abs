active site gorge and buried water molecules in crystal structures of acetylcholinesterase from torpedo californica edited by r huber
buried water molecules and the water molecules in the active site gorge are analyzed for five crystal structures of acetylcholinesterase from torpedo californica in the resolution range       native enzyme and four inhibitor complexes  a total of  buried hydration sites are identified which are populated with between  and  water molecules about half of the buried water is located in a distinct region neighboring the active site gorge most of the buried water molecules are very well conserved among the five structures and have low displacement parameters b of magnitudes similar to those of the main chain atoms of the central  sheet structure the active site gorge of the native enzyme is filled with over  water molecules which have poor hydrogen bond coordination with an average of   polar contacts per water molecule upon ligand binding distinct groups of these water molecules are displaced whereas the others remain in positions similar to those that they occupy in the native enzyme possible roles of the buried water molecules are discussed including their possible action as a lubricant to allow large amplitude fluctuations of the loop structures forming the gorge wall such fluctuations are required to facilitate traffic of substrate products and water molecules to and from the active site because of their poor coordination the gorge water molecules can be considered as  activated  as compared to bulk water this should allow their easy displacement by incoming substrate the relatively loose packing of the gorge water molecules leaves numerous small voids and more efficient space filling by substrates and inhibitors may be a major driving force of ligand binding
