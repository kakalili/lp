Intracellular lipid-binding proteins contain a large binding cavity filled with water molecules. The role played by these water molecules in ligand binding is not well understood, but their energetic and dynamic properties must be important for protein function. Here, we use the magnetic relaxation dispersion (MRD) of the water 17O resonance to investigate the water molecules in the binding cavity of three different lipid-binding proteins: heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), ileal lipid-binding protein (I-LBP) and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP). Whereas about half of the crystallographically visible water molecules appear to be expelled by the ligand, we find that ligand binding actually increases the number of water molecules within the cavity. At 300 K, the water molecules in the cavity exchange positions on a time-scale of about 1ns and exchange with external water on longer time-scales (0.01–1 μs). Exchange of water molecules among hydration sites within the cavity should be strongly coupled to ligand motion. Whereas a recent MD simulation indicates that the structure of the cavity water resembles a bulk water droplet, the present MRD results show that its dynamics is more than two orders of magnitude slower than in the bulk. These findings may have significant implications for the strength, specificity and kinetics of lipid binding.
