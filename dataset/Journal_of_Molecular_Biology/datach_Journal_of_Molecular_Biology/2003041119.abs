mycobacterium tuberculosis thymidylate kinase structural studies of intermediates along the reaction pathway
mycobacterium tuberculosis tmp kinase tmpkmtub represents a promising target for developing drugs against tuberculosis because the configuration of its active site is unique in the tmpk family to help elucidate the phosphorylation mechanism employed by this enzyme structural changes occurring upon binding of substrates and subsequent catalysis were investigated by protein crystallography six new structures of tmpkmtub were solved at a resolution better than    including the first structure of an apo tmpk obtained by triggering catalysis in a crystal of a tmpkmtub  tmp complex which resulted in the release of the tdp product a series of snapshots along the reaction pathway is obtained revealing the closure of the active site in going from an empty to a fully occupied state suggestive of an induced fit mechanism typical of nmpks however in tmpkmtub the lid closure couples to the binding with an unusual location for a magnesium ion coordinating tmp in the active site our data suggest strongly that this ion is required for catalysis acting as a clamp possibly in concert with arg  to neutralise electrostatic repulsion between the anionic substrates optimise their proper alignment and activate them through direct and water mediated interactions the   hydroxyl moiety of tmp critical to metal stabilisation appears to be a target of choice for the design of potent inhibitors on the other hand the usual ntp bound magnesium is not seen in our structures and arg  a p loop residue unique to tmpkmtub may take over its role therefore tmpkmtub seems to have swapped the use of a metal ion as compared with e g human tmpk finally ttp was observed in crystals of tmpkmtub locked by arg  thus providing a structural explanation for the observed inhibitory effect of ttp putatively involved in a mechanism of feedback regulation of the enzymatic activity
