sequence specific dna binding of ets  transcription factor molecular dynamics study on the ets domain  dna complexes
molecular dynamics md simulations for ets  ets domain  dna complexes were performed to investigate the mechanism of sequence specific recognition of the ggaa dna core by the ets domain employing the crystal structure of the ets  ets domain  dna complex as a starting structure we carried out md simulations of  i the complex between ets  ets domain and a  base pair dna containing ggaa core sequence ets  ggaa  ii the complex between the ets domain and a dna having single base pair mutation ggag sequence ets  ggag  and iii the  base pair dna alone ggaa  comparative analyses of the md structures of ets  ggaa and ets  ggag reveal that the dna bending angles and the ets domain  dna phosphate interactions are similar in these complexes these results support that the ggaa core sequence is distinguished from the mutated ggag sequence by a direct readout mechanism in the ets  ets domain  dna complex further analyses of the direct contacts in the interface between the helix  region of ets  and the major groove of the core dna sequence clearly show that the highly conserved arginine residues arg  and arg   play a critical role in binding to the ggaa core sequence these arginine residues make bidentate contacts with the nucleobases of gg dinucleotides in ggaa core sequence in ets  ggaa the hydroxyl group of tyr  is hydrogen bonded to n nitrogen of a  the third adenosine in the ggaa core  while the hydroxyl group makes a contact with n nitrogen of c   the complementary nucleotide of the fourth guanosine g in the ggag sequence in the ets  ggag complex we have found that this difference in behavior of tyr  results in the relatively large motion of helix  in the ets  ggag complex causing the collapse of bidentate contacts between arg  arg  and the gg dinucleotides in the ggag sequence
