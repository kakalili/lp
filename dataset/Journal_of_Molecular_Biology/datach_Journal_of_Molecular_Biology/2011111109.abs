the evidence of large scale dna induced compaction in the mycobacterial chromosomal parb
the bacterial chromosome trafficking apparatus or the segrosome participates in the mitotic like segregation of the chromosomes prior to cell division in several bacteria parb which is the pars dna binding component of the segrosome polymerizes on the pars adjacent chromosome to form a nucleoprotein filament of unknown nature for the segregation function we combined static light scattering circular dichroism and small angle x ray scattering to present evidence that the apo form of the mycobacterial parb forms an elongated dimer with intrinsically disordered regions as well as folded domains in solution a comparison of the solution scattering of the apo and the pars bound parbs indicates a rather drastic compaction of the protein upon dna binding we propose that this binding induced conformational transition is priming the parb for polymerization on the dna template
