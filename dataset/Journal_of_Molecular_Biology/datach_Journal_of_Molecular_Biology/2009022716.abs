nucleotide induced flexibility change in neck linkers of dimeric kinesin as detected by distance measurements using spin labeling epr
using dipolar continuous wave and pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance methods we have determined the distribution of the distances between two spin labels placed on the middle of each of the neck linkers of dimeric kinesin in the absence of microtubules the distance was centered at   nm but displayed a broad distribution with a width of   nm this broad distribution implies that the linkers are random coils and extend well beyond the   nm distance expected of crystal structures in the presence of microtubules two linker populations were found one similar to that observed in the absence of microtubules a broad distribution centered at   nm  and the second population with a narrower distribution centered at      nm in the absence of nucleotide but in the presence of microtubules     of the linkers were at a distance centered at   nm with a   nm width the remaining fraction was at   nm as before this suggests that neck linkers exhibit dynamics covering a wide distance range between   and   nm in the presence of atp analogs adenosine       imido triphosphate and adenosine     thio triphosphate      of the spins showed a very narrow distribution centered at   nm with a width of      nm the remaining population displayed the broad   nm distribution under these conditions a large fraction of linkers are docked firmly onto a motor core or microtubule while the remainder is disordered we propose that large nucleotide dependent flexibility changes in the linkers contribute to the directional bias of the kinesin molecule stepping  nm along the microtubule
