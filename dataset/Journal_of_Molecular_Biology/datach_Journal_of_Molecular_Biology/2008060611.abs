a putative  helical porin from corynebacterium glutamicum
the cell wall of corynebacterium glutamicum contains a mycolic acid layer which is a protective nonpolar barrier similar to the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria the exchange of material across this barrier requires porins porin b porb is one of them recombinant porb has been produced in escherichia coli purified crystallized and analyzed by x ray diffraction yielding  independent molecular structures in four different crystal forms at resolutions up to     all  molecules have the same globular core which consists of  residues forming four  helices tied together by a disulfide bridge the  structures vary greatly with respect to the  residues in the n and c terminal extensions since corynebacteria belong to the group of mycolata that includes some prominent human pathogens the observed structure may be of medical relevance due to the clearly established solid structure of the core the native porin has to be oligomeric and the reported structure is one of the subunits an  helical porin in a bacterial outer envelope is surprising because all presently known structures of such porins consist of  barrels since none of the four crystal packing arrangements was compatible with an oligomeric membrane channel we constructed a model of such an oligomer that was consistent with all available data of native porb the proposed model is based on the required polar interior and nonpolar exterior of the porin on a recurring crystal packing contact around a  fold axis on the assumption of a simple cn symmetry a symmetric arrangement around an n fold axis  on the experimentally established electric conductivity and anion selectivity and on the generally observed shape of porin channels
