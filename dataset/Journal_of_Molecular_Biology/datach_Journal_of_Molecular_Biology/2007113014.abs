rad  oligomers translocate and cross bridge double stranded dna to stimulate synapsis
rad  is a key component of the eukaryotic recombination machinery its presence in dna strand exchange reactions in vitro results in a significant stimulation of the overall reaction rate using untagged rad  we show that this stimulation can be attributed to enhancement of the formation of a key reaction intermediate known as dna networks using a novel single dna molecule dual optical tweezers approach we show how rad  stimulates dna network formation we discovered that rad  oligomers possess a unique ability to cross bridge or bind double stranded dna molecules positioned in close proximity further rad  oligomers rapidly translocate double stranded dna while simultaneously inducing topological loops in the dna at the locus of the oligomer the combination of the cross bridging and double stranded dna translocation activities of rad  stimulates the formation of dna networks leading to rapid and efficient dna strand exchange by rad
