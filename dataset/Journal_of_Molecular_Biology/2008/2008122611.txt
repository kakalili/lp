PtdIns(3,5)P2 (with PtdIns indicating phosphatidylinositol) is vital in the differentiation and development of multicellular organisms because knockout of the PtdIns(3,5)P2-synthesizing enzyme PIKfyve (phosphoinositide kinase for position 5 containing a FYVE finger domain) or its associated regulator ArPIKfyve is lethal. In previous work with endogenous proteins, we identified that Sac3, a phosphatase that turns over PtdIns(3,5)P2, associates with the PIKfyve–ArPIKfyve biosynthetic complex. However, whether the three proteins suffice for the organization/maintenance of this complex [referred to as the PAS (PIKfyve–ArPIKfyve–Sac3) complex], how they interact with one another, and what the functional relevance of this ternary association would be remained unresolved. Using co-immunoprecipitation analyses in transfected mammalian cells with increased or decreased levels of the three proteins, singly or in double versus triple combinations, herein we report that the triad is sufficient to form and maintain the PAS complex. ArPIKfyve is the principal organizer interacting with both Sac3 and PIKfyve, whereas Sac3 is permissive for maximal PIKfyve–ArPIKfyve association in the PAS complex. We further identified that ArPIKfyve scaffolds the PAS complex through homomeric interactions, mediated via its conserved C-terminal domain. Introduction of the C-terminal peptide fragment of the ArPIKfyve–ArPIKfyve contact sites effectively disassembled the PAS complex and reduced the in vitro PIKfyve lipid kinase activity. Exploring insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation in 3T3L1 adipocytes as a functional readout, a process that is positively regulated by PIKfyve activity and ArPIKfyve levels, we determined that ectopic expression of the ArPIKfyve C-terminal peptide inhibits GLUT4 surface accumulation. Our data indicate that the PAS complex is organized to provide optimal PIKfyve functionality and is maintained via ArPIKfyve homomeric and heteromeric interactions.
