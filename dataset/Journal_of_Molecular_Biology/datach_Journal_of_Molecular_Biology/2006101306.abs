pas domain allostery and light induced conformational changes in photoactive yellow protein upon i intermediate formation probed with enhanced hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry
photoactive yellow protein pyp is a small bacterial photoreceptor that undergoes a light activated reaction cycle pyp is also the prototypical per arnt sim pas domain pas domains found in diverse multi domain proteins from bacteria to humans mediate protein  protein interactions and function as sensors and signal transducers here we investigate conformational and dynamic changes in solution in wild type pyp upon formation of the long lived putative signaling intermediate i with enhanced hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry dxms  the dxms results showed that the central  sheet remains stable but specific external protein segments become strongly deprotected light induced disruption of the dark state hydrogen bonding network in i produces increased flexibility and opening of pas core helices   and   releases the     hairpin and propagates conformational changes to the central  sheet surprisingly the first    n terminal residues which are essential for fast dark state recovery from i  become more protected by combining the dxms results with our crystallographic structures which reveal detailed changes near the chromophore but limited protein conformational change we propose a mechanism for i state formation this mechanism integrates the results from diverse biophysical studies of pyp and links an allosteric t to r state conformational transition to three pathways for signal propagation within the pyp fold on the basis of the observed changes in pyp plus commonalities shared among pas domain proteins we further propose that pas domains share this conformational mechanism which explains the versatile signal transduction properties of the structurally conserved pyp pas module by framework encoded allostery
