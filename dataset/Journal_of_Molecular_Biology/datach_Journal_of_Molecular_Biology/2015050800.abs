on the ph dependence of class  rf dependent termination of mrna translation
we have studied the ph dependence of the rate of termination of bacterial protein synthesis catalyzed by a class  release factor rf or rf  we used a classical quench flow technique and a newly developed stopped flow technique that relies on the use of fluorescently labeled peptides we found the termination rate to increase with increasing ph and eventually to saturate at about  s   with an apparent pka value of about   from our data we suggest that class  rf termination is rate limited by the chemistry of ester bond hydrolysis at low ph and by a stop codon dependent and ph independent conformational change of rfs at high ph we propose that rf dependent termination depends on the participation of a hydroxide ion rather than a water molecule in the hydrolysis of the ester bond between the p site trna and its peptide chain we provide a simple explanation for why the rate of termination saturated at high ph in our experiments but not in those of others
