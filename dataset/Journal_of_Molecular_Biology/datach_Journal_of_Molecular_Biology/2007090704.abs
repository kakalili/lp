the closed mtip myosin a tail complex from the malaria parasite invasion machinery
the myosin a tail interacting protein mtip of the malaria parasite links the actomyosin motor of the host cell invasion machinery to its inner membrane complex we report here that at neutral ph plasmodium falciparum mtip in complex with myosin a adopts a compact conformation with its two domains completely surrounding the myosin a tail helix dramatically different from previously observed extended mtip structures crystallographic and mutagenesis studies show that h  and k  of myosin a are key players in the formation of the compact mtip myosin a complex only the unprotonated state of myosin a h  is compatible with the compact complex most surprisingly every side chain atom of myosin a k  is engaged in contacts with mtip while this side chain was previously considered to prevent a compact conformation of mtip with myosin a it actually appears to be essential for the formation of the compact complex the hydrophobic pockets and adaptability seen in the available series of mtip structures bodes well for the discovery of inhibitors of cell invasion by malaria parasites
