the analysis of the human high affinity ige receptor fc ri  from multiple crystal forms edited by i a wilson
we have solved the structure of the human high affinity ige receptor fc ri  in six different crystal forms showing the structure in  different chemical environments this database of structures shows no change in the overall shape of the molecule as the angle between domains  and  d and d  varies little across the ensemble however the receptor has local conformational variability in the c  strand of d and in the bc loop of d  in every crystal form a residue inserts between tryptophan residues  and   mimicking the position of a proline from the ige ligand the different crystal forms reveal a distribution of carbohydrates lining the front and back surfaces of the structure an analysis of crystal contacts in the different forms indicates regions where the molecule interacts with other proteins and reveals a potential new binding site distal to the ige binding site the results of this study point to new directions for the design of molecules to inhibit the interaction of fc ri  with its natural ligand and thus to prevent a primary step in the allergic response
