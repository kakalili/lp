crystal structure of the catalytic domain of mmp  mt mmp characterization of mt mmp specific features
membrane type matrix metalloproteinases mt mmps have attracted strong attention because four of them can activate a key player in the tumor scenario prommp  progelatinase a in addition to this indirect effect on the cellular environment these mt mmps degrade extracellular matrix proteins and their overproduction is associated with tumor growth we have solved the structure of the catalytic domain cd of mt mmp mmp  in complex with the hydroxamic acid inhibitor batimastat cdmt  mmp exhibits a classical mmp fold with similarity to mt mmp nevertheless it also shows unique properties such as a modified mt specific loop and a closed s   specificity pocket which might help to design specific inhibitors some mt mmp specific features derived from the crystal structures of mt  mmp determined previously and mt mmp and revealed in recent mutagenesis experiments explain the impaired interaction of the mt mmps with timp  docking experiments with prommp  show some exposed loops including the mt loop of cdmt  mmp involved in the interaction with the prommp  prodomain in the activation encounter complex this model might help to understand the experimentally proven importance of the mt loop for the activation of prommp
