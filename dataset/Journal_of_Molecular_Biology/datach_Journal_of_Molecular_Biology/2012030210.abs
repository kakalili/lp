engineering domain swapped binding interfaces by mutually exclusive folding
domain swapping is a mechanism for forming protein dimers and oligomers with high specificity it is distinct from other forms of oligomerization in that the binding interface is formed by reciprocal exchange of polypeptide segments swapping plays a physiological role in protein  protein recognition and it can also potentially be exploited as a mechanism for controlled self assembly here we demonstrate that domain swapped interfaces can be engineered by inserting one protein into a surface loop of another protein the key to facilitating a domain swap is to destabilize the protein when it is monomeric but not when it is oligomeric we achieve this condition by employing the  mutually exclusive folding  design to apply conformational stress to the monomeric state ubiquitin ub is inserted into one of six surface loops of barnase bn  the    amino to carboxy terminal distance of ub stresses the bn monomer causing it to split at the point of insertion the    x ray structure of one insertion variant reveals that strain is relieved by intermolecular folding with an identically unfolded bn domain resulting in a domain swapped polymer all six constructs oligomerize suggesting that inserting ub into each surface loop of bn results in a similar domain swapping event binding affinity can be tuned by varying the length of the peptide linkers used to join the two proteins which modulates the extent of stress engineered swapped proteins have the potential to be used to fabricate  smart  biomaterials or as binding modules from which to assemble heterologous multi subunit protein complexes
