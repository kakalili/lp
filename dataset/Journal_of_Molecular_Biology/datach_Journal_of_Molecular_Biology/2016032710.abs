recruitment duplex unwinding and protein mediated inhibition of the dead box rna helicase dbp at actively transcribed chromatin
rna helicases play fundamental roles in modulating rna structures and facilitating rna  protein rnp complex assembly in vivo previously our laboratory demonstrated that the dead box rna helicase dbp in saccharomyces cerevisiae is required to promote efficient assembly of the co transcriptionally associated mrna binding proteins yra  nab  and mex  onto poly a rna we also found that yra associates directly with dbp and functions as an inhibitor of dbp dependent duplex unwinding suggestive of a cycle of unwinding and inhibition by dbp  to test this we undertook a series of experiments to shed light on the order of events for dbp in co transcriptional mrnp assembly we now show that dbp is recruited to chromatin via rna and forms a large rna dependent complex with yra and mex  moreover single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and bulk biochemical assays show that yra inhibits unwinding in a concentration dependent manner by preventing the association of dbp with single stranded rna this inhibition prevents over accumulation of dbp on mrna and stabilization of a subset of rna polymerase ii transcripts we propose a model whereby yra terminates a cycle of mrnp assembly by dbp
