the pms subunit of human mutl  contains a metal ion binding domain of the iron dependent repressor protein family
dna mismatch repair mmr is responsible for correcting replication errors mutl  one of the main players in mmr has been recently shown to harbor an endonuclease metal binding activity which is important for its function in vivo this endonuclease activity has been confined to the c terminal domain of the hpms subunit of the mutl  heterodimer in this work we identify a striking sequence  structure similarity of hpms to the metal binding dimerization domain of the iron dependent repressor protein family and present a structural model of the metal binding domain of mutl  according to our model this domain of mutl  comprises at least three highly conserved sequence motifs which are also present in most mutl homologs from bacteria that do not rely on the endonuclease activity of muth for strand discrimination furthermore based on our structural model we predict that mutl  is a zinc ion binding protein and confirm this prediction by way of biochemical analysis of zinc ion binding using the full length and c terminal domain of mutl  finally we demonstrate that the conserved residues of the metal ion binding domain are crucial for mmr activity of mutl  in vitro
