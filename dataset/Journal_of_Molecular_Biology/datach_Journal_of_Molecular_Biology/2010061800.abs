structural basis for the presentation of tumor associated mhc class ii restricted phosphopeptides to cd  t cells
dysregulated protein phosphorylation is a hallmark of malignant transformation transformation can generate major histocompatibility complex mhc bound phosphopeptides that are differentially displayed on tumor cells for specific recognition by t cells to understand how phosphorylation alters the antigenic identity of self peptides and how mhc class ii molecules present phosphopeptides for cd  t cell recognition we determined the crystal structure of a phosphopeptide derived from melanoma antigen recognized by t cells  pmart   selectively expressed by human melanomas in complex with hla dr  the structure revealed that the phosphate moiety attached to the serine residue at position p of pmart  is available for direct interactions with t cell receptor tcr and that the peptide n terminus adopts an unusual conformation orienting it toward tcr this structure combined with measurements of peptide affinity for hla dr and of peptide  mhc recognition by pmart  specific t cells suggests that tcr recognition is focused on the n terminal portion of pmart  this recognition mode appears to be distinct from that of foreign antigen complexes but is remarkably reminiscent of the way autoreactive tcrs engage self or altered self peptides consistent with the tolerogenic nature of tumor  host immune interactions
