structure of the bh domains from the p  inducible bh only proteins noxa and puma in complex with mcl
pro survival proteins in the b cell lymphoma  bcl  family have a defined specificity profile for their cell death inducing bh only antagonists solution structures of myeloid cell leukaemia  mcl  in complex with the bh domains from noxa and puma two proteins regulated by the tumour suppressor p  show that they bind as amphipathic  helices in the same hydrophobic groove of mcl  using conserved residues for binding thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of noxa puma and the related bh domains of bmf bim bid and bak with mcl  were determined by calorimetry these unstructured bh domains bind mcl  with affinities that span  orders of magnitude and binding is an enthalpically driven and entropy  enthalpy compensated process alanine scanning analysis of noxa demonstrated that only a subset of residues is required for interaction with mcl  and these residues are localised to a short highly conserved sequence motif that defines the bh domain chemical shift mapping of mcl  bh complexes showed that mcl  engages all bh ligands in a similar way and that in addition to changes in the immediate vicinity of the binding site small molecule wide structural adjustments accommodate ligand binding our studies show that unstructured peptides such as the bh domains behave like their structured counterparts and can bind tightly and selectively in an enthalpically driven process
