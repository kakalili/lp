identification of a  lactamase inhibitory protein variant that is a potent inhibitor of staphylococcus pc   lactamase
lactamase inhibitory protein blip binds and inhibits a diverse collection of class a  lactamases widespread resistance to  lactam antibiotics currently limits the treatment strategies for staphylococcus infections the goals of this study were to determine the binding affinity of blip for staphylococcus aureus pc   lactamase and to identify mutants that alter binding affinity the blip inhibition constant ki for pc   lactamase was measured at   nm and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicated a binding constant kd of   nm twenty three residue positions in blip that contact  lactamase were randomized and phage display was used to sort the libraries for tight binders to immobilized pc   lactamase the blipk g mutant was the dominant clone selected and it was found to inhibit the pc   lactamase with a ki of   nm while calorimetry indicated a kd of   nm molecular modeling studies suggested that blip binds weakly to the pc   lactamase due to the presence of alanine at position   of pc  this position is occupied by glutamate in the tem  enzyme where it forms a salt bridge with the blip residue lys  that is important for the stability of the complex this hypothesis was confirmed by showing that the pc a  e enzyme binds blip with  fold greater affinity than wild type pc   lactamase kinetic measurements indicated similar association rates for all complexes with variation in affinity due to altered dissociation rate constants suggesting that changes in short range interactions are responsible for the altered binding properties of the mutants
