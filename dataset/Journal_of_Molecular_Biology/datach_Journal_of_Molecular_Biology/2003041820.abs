a structure based model of the reaction catalyzed by lumazine synthase from aquifex aeolicus
dimethyl  ribityllumazine is the biosynthetic precursor of riboflavin which as a coenzyme plays a vital role in the electron transfer process for energy production in all cellular organisms the enzymes involved in lumazine biosynthesis have been studied in considerable detail however the conclusive mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by lumazine synthase has remained unclear here we report four crystal structures of the enzyme from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus in complex with different inhibitor compounds the structures were refined at resolutions of            and    respectively the inhibitors have been designed in order to mimic the substrate the putative reaction intermediates and the final product structural comparisons of the native enzyme and the inhibitor complexes as well as the kinetic data of single site mutants of lumazine synthase from bacillus subtilis showed that several highly conserved residues at the active site namely phe  his  arg   lys  and glu  are most likely involved in catalysis a structural model of the catalytic process which illustrates binding of substrates enantiomer specificity proton abstraction donation inorganic phosphate elimination formation of the schiff base and cyclization is proposed
