single molecule studies of the im folding landscape
under appropriate conditions the four helical im  immunity protein  folds from an ensemble of unfolded conformers to a highly compact native state via an on pathway intermediate here we investigate the unfolded intermediate and native states populated during folding using diffusion single pair fluorescence resonance energy transfer by measuring the efficiency of energy transfer or proximity or p ratio between pairs of fluorophores introduced into the side chains of cysteine residues placed in the center of helices  and   and  or  and  we show that while the native states of each variant give rise to a single narrow distribution with high p values the distributions of the intermediates trapped at equilibrium denoted ieqm are fitted by two gaussian distributions modulation of the folding conditions from those that stabilize the intermediate to those that destabilize the intermediate enabled the distribution of lower p value to be assigned to the population of the unfolded ensemble in equilibrium with the intermediate state the reduced stability of the ieqm variants allowed analysis of the effect of denaturant concentration on the compaction and breadth of the unfolded state ensemble to be quantified from  to  m urea significant compaction is observed as the concentration of urea is decreased in both the presence and absence of sodium sulfate as previously reported for a variety of proteins in the presence of na so in  m urea the p value of the unfolded state ensemble approaches that of the native state concurrent with compaction the ensemble displays increased peak width of p values possibly reflecting a reduction in the rate of conformational exchange among iso energetic unfolded but compact conformations the results provide new insights into the initial stages of folding of im and suggest that the unfolded state is highly conformationally constrained at the outset of folding
