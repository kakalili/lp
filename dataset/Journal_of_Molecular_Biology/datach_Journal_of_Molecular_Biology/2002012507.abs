protein fold similarity estimated by a probabilistic approach based on c  c  distance comparison edited by b honig
the distribution of the c  c  distances between residues separated by three to  amino acid residues is highly characteristic of protein folds and makes it possible to identify them from a straightforward comparison of the distance histograms the comparison is carried out by contingency table analysis and yields a probability of identity pride score  with values between zero and  for closely related structures pride is highly correlated with the root mean square distance between c  atoms but it provides a correct classification even for unrelated structures for which a structural alignment is not meaningful for example an analysis of the cath database of fold structures showed that    of the folds fall into the correct cath homologous superfamily category based on the highest pride score obtained structural alignment and secondary structure assignment are not necessary for the calculation of pride which is fast enough to allow the scanning of large databases
