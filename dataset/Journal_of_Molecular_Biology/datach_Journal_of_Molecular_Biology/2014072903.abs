assembly of helicobacter pylori initiation complex is determined by sequence specific and topology sensitive dnaa  oric interactions
in bacteria chromosome replication is initiated by binding of the dnaa initiator protein to dnaa boxes located in the origin of chromosomal replication oric  this leads to dna helix opening within the dna unwinding element helicobacter pylori oric the first bipartite origin identified in gram negative bacteria contains two subregions oric and oric  flanking the dnaa gene the dna unwinding element region is localized in the oric subregion downstream of dnaa surprisingly oric  dnaa interactions were shown to depend on dna topology which is unusual in bacteria but is similar to initiator  origin interactions observed in higher organisms in this work we identified three dnaa boxes in the oric subregion two of which were bound only as supercoiled dna we found that all three dnaa boxes play important roles in orisome assembly and subsequent dna unwinding but different functions can be assigned to individual boxes this suggests that the h pylori oric may be functionally divided similar to what was described recently for escherichia coli oric on the basis of these results we propose a model of initiation complex formation in h pylori
