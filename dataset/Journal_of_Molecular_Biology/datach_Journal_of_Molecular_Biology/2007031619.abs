induced fit folding and recognition of the nf  b nuclear localization signals by i b  and i b
protein structure prediction codes based on the associative memory hamiltonian were used to probe the binding modes between the nuclear localization signal nls polypeptide of nf  b and the inhibitors i b  and i b  experimentally it is known that the nls polypeptide is unstructured in the nf  b complex with dna but it forms an extended helical structure with the nls residues      between the two helices in the nf  b i b  complex the simulations included the nf  b p  and p  nls polypeptides and various mutants alone and in the presence of i b  and i b  the simulations predict that the nls polypeptide by itself binds tightly to i b  and i b  in the nf  b p  p  heterodimer the p  nls is predicted to remain free to bind to importin   in the interaction with i b  both p  nlss are predicted to be bound in i b  the nls polypeptide binds to two binding sites as seen in the crystal structure with one site heavily favored for stable binding
