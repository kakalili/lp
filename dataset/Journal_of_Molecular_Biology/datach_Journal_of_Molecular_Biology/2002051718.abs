two distinct stress signaling pathways converge upon the chop promoter during the mammalian unfolded protein response
chop is a non er localized transcription factor that is induced by a variety of adverse physiological conditions including er stress accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er activates an unfolded protein response pathway that targets both er resident chaperones e g bip and chop hence it is unclear if chop induction during er stress occurs through the er stress response element that is conserved in both chop and er chaperone promoters or through a separate regulatory pathway conserved among different chop inducing cellular stress conditions we identified a bona fide er stress element in the hamster chop promoter and found that similar transcription complexes containing nf y bound to both the chop and bip er stress response elements in addition we demonstrated for the first time the importance of the c ebp atf composite site for chop regulation during er stress activation of the er transmembrane eif  kinase perk induced atf protein expression direct binding to the composite site in chop promoter and as a consequence chop protein induction we propose that this eif  kinase atf c ebp atf composite site pathway is conserved for chop regulation during various cellular stress conditions including er stress our data indicate that both the erse and the perk atf pathways converge on the chop promoter during er stress and provide insights into the similarities and differences between chop and er chaperone expression during normal and stress conditions
