a gating model for the archeal voltage dependent k channel kvap in dphpc and pope popg decane lipid bilayers
voltage dependent k  kv channels form the basis of the excitability of nerves and muscles kvap is a well characterized archeal kv channel that has been widely used to investigate many aspects of kv channel biochemistry biophysics and structure in this study a minimal kinetic gating model for kvap function in two different phospholipid decane bilayers is developed in most aspects kvap gating is similar to the well studied eukaryotic shaker kv channel conformational changes occur within four voltage sensors followed by pore opening unlike the shaker kv channel kvap possesses an inactivated state that is accessible from the pre open state of the channel changing the lipid composition of the membrane influences multiple gating transitions in the model but most dramatically the rate of recovery from inactivation inhibition by the voltage sensor toxin vstx is most easily explained if vstx binds only to the depolarized conformation of the voltage sensor by delaying the voltage sensor s return to the hyperpolarized conformation vstx favors the inactivated state of kvap
