a molecular clock operates during chick autopod proximal distal outgrowth
temporal control can be considered the fourth dimension in embryonic development the identification of the somitogenesis molecular clock provided new insight into how embryonic cells measure time we provide the first evidence of a molecular clock operating during chick fore limb autopod outgrowth and patterning by showing that the expression of the somitogenesis clock component hairy cycles in autopod chondrogenic precursor cells with a  h periodicity we determined the length of time required to form an autopod skeletal limb element and established a correlation between the latter and the periodicity of cyclic hairy gene expression we suggest that temporal control exerted by cyclic gene expression can be a widespread mechanism providing cellular temporal information during vertebrate embryonic development
