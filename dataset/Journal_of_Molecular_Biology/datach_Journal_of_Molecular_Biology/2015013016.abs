the camsol method of rational design of protein mutants with enhanced solubility
protein solubility is often an essential requirement in biotechnological and biomedical applications great advances in understanding the principles that determine this specific property of proteins have been made during the past decade in particular concerning the physicochemical characteristics of their constituent amino acids by exploiting these advances we present the camsol method for the rational design of protein variants with enhanced solubility the method works by performing a rapid computational screening of tens of thousand of mutations to identify those with the greatest impact on the solubility of the target protein while maintaining its native state and biological activity the application to a single domain antibody that targets the alzheimer s a peptide demonstrates that the method predicts with great accuracy solubility changes upon mutation thus offering a cost effective strategy to help the production of soluble proteins for academic and industrial purposes
