crystal structure of the c domain of cardiac myosin binding protein c implications for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
c protein is a major component of skeletal and cardiac muscle thick filaments mutations in the gene encoding cardiac c protein cardiac myosin binding protein c cmybp c  are one of the principal causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cmybp c is a string of globular domains including eight immunoglobulin like and three fibronectin like domains termed c  c  it binds to myosin and titin and probably to actin and may have both a structural and a regulatory role in muscle function to help to understand the pathology of the known mutations we have solved the structure of the immunoglobulin like c domain of mybp c by x ray crystallography to a resolution of      mutations associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are clustered at one end towards the c terminus close to the important c c linker where they alter the structural integrity of this region and its interactions
