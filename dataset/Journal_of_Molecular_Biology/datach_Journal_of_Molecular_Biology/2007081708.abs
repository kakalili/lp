active and exo site inhibition of human factor xa structure of des gla factor xa inhibited by nap  a potent nematode anticoagulant protein from ancylostoma caninum
hookworms are hematophagous nematodes capable of growth development and subsistence in living host systems such as humans and other mammals approximately one billion or one in six people worldwide are infected by hookworms causing gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia the hematophagous hookworm ancylostoma caninum produces a family of small disulfide linked protein anticoagulants     amino acid residues  one of these nematode anticoagulant proteins nap  inhibits the amidolytic activity of factor xa fxa with ki  pm and is the most potent natural fxa inhibitor identified thus far the crystal structure of nap bound at the active site of  carboxyglutamic acid domainless factor xa des fxa has been determined at     resolution which indicates that asp   fxa s subsite binds to arg  nap  p site in a mode similar to that of the bpti trypsin interaction however the hydroxyl group of ser  of nap additionally forms a hydrogen bond      with his  ne of the catalytic triad replacing the hydrogen bond of ser  og to the latter in the native structure resulting in an interaction that has not been observed before furthermore the c terminal extension of nap surprisingly interacts with the fxa exosite of a symmetry equivalent molecule forming a short intermolecular  strand as observed in the structure of the napc fxa complex this indicates that nap can bind to fxa at the active site or the exosite and to fx at the exosite however unlike napc  nap does not inhibit fviia of the fviia tf complex
