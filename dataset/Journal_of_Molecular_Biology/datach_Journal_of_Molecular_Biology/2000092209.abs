the high resolution solution structure of the catalytic fragment of human collagenase  mmp   complexed with a sulfonamide derivative of a hydroxamic acid compound way     has been determined by multidimensional heteronuclear nmr a total of  structures were calculated for residues     by means of hybrid distance geometry simulated annealing using a total of   experimental nmr restraints the atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinate positions for the  structures is         for the backbone atoms         for all atoms and         for all atoms excluding disordered side chains the overall structure of mmp  is composed of a  sheet consisting of five  strands in a mixed parallel and anti parallel arrangement and three  helices where its overall fold is consistent with previously solved mmp structures a comparison of the nmr structure of mmp  with the published    resolution x ray structure indicates that the major differences between the structures is associated with loop dynamics and crystal packing interactions the side chains of some active site residues for the nmr and x ray structures of mmp  adopt distinct conformations this is attributed to the presence of unique inhibitors in the two structures that encounter distinct interactions with mmp   the major structural difference observed between the mmp  and mmp  nmr structures is the relative size and shape of the s   pocket where this pocket is significantly longer for mmp   nearly reaching the surface of the protein additionally mmp  and mmp  exhibit different dynamic properties for the active site loop and the structural zn binding region the inhibitor way    is well defined in the mmp  active site based on a total of  distance restraints the binding motif of way    in the mmp  complex is consistent with our previously reported mmp  cgs   a nmr structure and is similar to the mmp   rs    x ray structure
