crystal structure of d psicose  epimerase from agrobacterium tumefaciens and its complex with true substrate d fructose a pivotal role of metal in catalysis an active site for the non phosphorylated substrate and its conformational changes
d psicose a rare sugar produced by the enzymatic reaction of d tagatose  epimerase dtease  has been used extensively for the bioproduction of various rare carbohydrates recently characterized d psicose  epimerase dpease from agrobacterium tumefaciens was found to belong to the dtease family and to catalyze the interconversion of d fructose and d psicose by epimerizing the c  position with marked efficiency for d psicose the crystal structures of dpease and its complex with the true substrate d fructose were determined dpease is a tetramer and each monomer belongs to a tim barrel fold the active site in each subunit is distinct from that of other tim barrel enzymes which use phosphorylated ligands as the substrate it contains a metal ion with octahedral coordination to two water molecules and four residues that are absolutely conserved across the dtease family upon binding of d fructose the substrate displaces water molecules in the active site with a conformation mimicking the intermediate cis enediolate subsequently trp  and pro  in the      loop undergo significant structural changes sealing off the active site structural evidence and site directed mutagenesis of the putative catalytic residues suggest that the metal ion plays a pivotal role in catalysis by anchoring the bound d fructose and glu  and glu  carry out an epimerization reaction at the c  position
