catalytic efficiency and sequence selectivity of a restriction endonuclease modulated by a distal manganese ion binding site edited by k morikawa
crystal structures of ecorv endonuclease bound in a ternary complex with cognate duplex dna and manganese ions have previously revealed an mn  binding site located between the enzyme and the dna outside of the dyad symmetric gatatc recognition sequence in each of the two enzyme subunits this metal ion bridges between a distal phosphate group of the dna and the imidazole ring of his  the new metal binding site is specific to mn  and is not occupied in ternary cocrystal structures with either mg  or ca  characterization of the h a and h q mutants of ecorv now demonstrates that these distal mn  sites significantly modulate activity toward both cognate and non cognate dna substrates single turnover and steady state kinetic analyses show that removal of the distal site in the mutant enzymes increases mn  dependent cleavage rates of specific substrates by tenfold conversely the enhancement of non cognate cleavage at gttatc sequences by mn  is significantly attenuated in the mutants as a consequence under mn  conditions ecorv h a and ecorv h q are   to   fold more specific than the wild type enzyme for cognate dna relative to the gttatc non cognate site these data reveal a strong dependence of dna cleavage efficiency upon metal ion mediated interactions located some    distant from the scissile phosphodiester linkages they also show that discrimination of cognate versus non cognate dna sequences by ecorv depends in part on contacts with the sugar phosphate backbone outside of the target site
