crystal structure of an enzyme displaying both inositol polyphosphate  phosphatase and   phosphoadenosine   phosphate phosphatase activities a novel target of lithium therapy edited by r huber
lithium cations exert profound and selective psychopharmacological effects on ameliorate manic depressive psychosis although lithium is an effective drug for both treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar disorder the precise mechanism of action is not well understood lithium acts as both an uncompetitive and non competitive inhibitor of several lithium sensitive phosphatases with regard to substrate and magnesium cofactor respectively in this work we report the crystal structure and reaction mechanism of rattus norvegicus   phosphoadenosine   phosphate and inositol   bisphosphate phosphatase rnpip  a recently identified target of lithium therapy this li sensitive enzyme plays a crucial role in several cellular processes such as rna processing sulphation reactions and probably inositol recycling rnpip specifically removes the   phosphate group of   phosphoadenosine   phosphate pap and the   phosphate group of inositol   bisphosphate i  p  producing amp and inositol   phosphate respectively the crystal structure of rnpip complexed with amp pi and magnesium ions at     resolution provides insight into the reaction mechanism of the hydrolysis of pap the core fold of the enzyme is equivalent to that found in other li sensitive phosphatases such as inositol monophosphatase but molecular modelling of i  p in the rnpip active site reveals important structural determinants that accommodate this additional substrate rnpip is potently inhibited by lithium and as the accumulation of pap inhibits a variety of proteins including sulphotransferases and rna processing enzymes this dual specificity enzyme represents a potential target of lithium action in addition to inositol monophosphatases
