binding of c protein to p rna enhances the rate constant for catalysis for p rna processing of pre trnas lacking a consensus g   c   pair
the rna subunit of the ribonucleoprotein enzyme ribonuclease p rnase p p rna contains the active site but binding of escherichia coli rnase p protein c  to p rna increases the rate constant for catalysis for certain pre trna substrates up to   fold structure swapping experiments between a substrate that is cleaved slowly by p rna alone pre trnaf met   and one that is cleaved quickly pre trnamet   pinpoint the characteristic c   a   base pair of initiator trnaf met as the sole determinant of slow rna alone catalysis unlike other substrate modifications that slow rna alone catalysis the presence of a c   a   base pair reduces the rate constant for processing at both correct and miscleavage sites indicating an indirect but nonetheless important role in catalysis analysis of the mg  dependence of apparent catalytic rate constants for pre trnamet  and a pre trnamet    c   a mutant provides evidence that c promotes rate enhancement primarily by compensating for the decrease in the affinity of metal ions important for catalysis engendered by the presence of the ca pair together these results support and extend current models for rnase p substrate recognition in which contacts involving the conserved   g c   pair of trna stabilize functional metal ion binding additionally these observations suggest that c protein has evolved to compensate for trna variation at positions important for binding to p rna allowing for trna specialization
