the crystal structure of aminoglycoside   phosphotransferase iia an enzyme responsible for antibiotic resistance
a major factor in the emergence of antibiotic resistance is the existence of enzymes that chemically modify common antibiotics the genes for these enzymes are commonly carried on mobile genetic elements facilitating their spread one such class of enzymes is the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph family which uses atp mediated phosphate transfer to chemically modify and inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics such as streptomycin and kanamycin as part of a program to define the molecular basis for aminoglycoside recognition and inactivation by such enzymes we have determined the high resolution     crystal structure of aminoglycoside   phosphotransferase iia aph    iia in complex with kanamycin the structure was solved by molecular replacement using multiple models derived from the related aminoglycoside   phosphotransferase iii enzyme aph    iii  and refined to an r factor of    rfree     the bound kanamycin molecule is very well defined and occupies a highly negatively charged cleft formed by the c terminal domain of the enzyme adjacent to this is the binding site for atp which can be modeled on the basis of nucleotide complexes of aph    iii only one change is apparent with a loop residues     in a position where it could fold over an incoming nucleotide the three rings of the kanamycin occupy distinct sub pockets in which a highly acidic loop residues      and the c terminal residues      play important parts in recognition the a ring the site of phosphoryl transfer is adjacent to the catalytic base asp   these results give new information on the basis of aminoglycoside recognition and on the relationship between this phosphotransferase family and the protein kinases
