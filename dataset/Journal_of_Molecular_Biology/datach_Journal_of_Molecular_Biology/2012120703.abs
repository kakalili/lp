enthalpic barriers dominate the folding and unfolding of the human cu zn superoxide dismutase monomer
the rate limiting step in the formation of the native dimeric state of human cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  is a very slow monomer folding reaction that governs the lifetime of its unfolded state mutations at dozens of sites in sod are known to cause a fatal motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and recent experiments implicate the unfolded state as a source of soluble oligomers and histologically observable aggregates thought to be responsible for toxicity to determine the thermodynamic properties of the transition state ensemble tse limiting the folding of this high  contact  order  sandwich motif we performed a combined thermal urea denaturation thermodynamic kinetic analysis the barriers to folding and unfolding are dominated by the activation enthalpy at  k and neutral ph the activation entropy is favorable and reduces the barrier height for both reactions the absence of secondary structure formation or large scale chain collapse prior to crossing the barrier for folding led to the conclusion that dehydration of nonpolar surfaces in the tse is responsible for the large and positive activation enthalpy although the activation entropy favors the folding reaction the transition from the unfolded state to the native state is entropically disfavored at  k the opposing entropic contributions to the free energies of the tse and the native state during folding provide insights into structural properties of the tse the results also imply a crucial role for water in governing the productive folding reaction and enhancing the propensity for the aggregation of sod
