differential requirement of unfolded protein response pathway for calreticulin expression in caenorhabditis elegans
accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers the unfolded protein response upr pathway which increases the expression of chaperones to maintain the homeostasis calreticulin is a calcium binding chaperone located in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum er  here we show that in response to a upr inducing reagent tunicamycin the expression of calreticulin crt  is specifically up regulated in caenorhabditis elegans tunicamycin tm induced expression of the crt  requires ire  and xbp  but is atf  and pek  independent analysis of the crt  promoter reveals a putative xbp  binding site at the    to     bp region which was shown to be necessary for tm mediated induction genetic analysis of crt  mutants and mutants of upr pathway genes show various degrees of developmental arrest upon tm treatment our results suggest that the tm induced upr pathway culminates in the up regulation of crt  which protects the worm from deleterious accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er knockdown of the crt  pdi  or pdi  increased the crt  expression whereas knockdown of the hsp  or hsp  did not have any effect on crt  expression indicating the existence of complex compensatory networks to cope up with er stress
