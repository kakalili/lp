refined structures of  ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase iii edited by i a wilson
ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase iii fabh is a condensing enzyme that plays central roles in fatty acid biosynthesis three dimensional structures of e coli fabh in the presence and absence of ligands have been refined to     resolution the structures of improved accuracy revealed detailed interactions involved in ligand binding these structures also provided new insights into the fabh mechanism e g the possible role of a water or hydroxyl anion in cys  deprotonation a structure of the apo enzyme uncovered large conformational changes in the active site exemplified by the disordering of four essential loops                and      and the movement of catalytic residues cys  and his   the disordering of the loops leads to greater than   reduction in the fabh dimer interface suggesting a dynamic nature for an unusually large portion of the dimer interface the existence of a large solvent accessible channel in the dimer interface as well as two cis peptides cis pro  and cis phe   in two of the disordered loops may explain the observed structural instabilities
