reversal of the dna binding induced loop l conformational switch in an engineered human p  protein
the gene encoding the p  tumor suppressor protein a sequence specific dna binding transcription factor is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer crystal structures of homo oligomerizing p  polypeptides with specific dna suggest that dna binding is associated with a conformational switch specifically in the absence of dna loop l of the p  dna binding domain adopts an extended conformation whereas two p  subunits switch to a recessed loop l conformation when bound to dna as a tetramer we previously designed a p  protein p fg with amino substitutions s  f and v  g targeting loop l  these two substitutions enhanced the affinity of p  for specific dna yet counterintuitively decreased the residency time of p  on dna here we confirmed these dna binding properties of p fg using a different method we also determined by crystallography the structure of p fg in its free state and bound to dna as a tetramer in the free state loop l adopted a recessed conformation whereas upon dna binding two subunits switched to the extended loop l conformation resulting in a final structure that was very similar to that of wild type p  bound to dna thus altering the apo structure of p  changed its dna binding properties even though the dna bound structure was not altered
