structural and biochemical characterization of yeast monothiol glutaredoxin grx
glutaredoxins grxs are a ubiquitous family of proteins that reduce disulfide bonds in substrate proteins using electrons from reduced glutathione gsh  the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae grx is a monothiol grx that is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi compartments grx consists of three segments a putative signal peptide m i   an n terminal domain k  t   and a c terminal grx domain k  n   designated grx c  compared to the classic dithiol glutaredoxin grx  grx has a lower glutathione disulfide reductase activity but a higher glutathione s transferase activity in addition similar to human grx  grx binds gsh via an iron  sulfur cluster in vitro the n terminal domain is essential for noncovalent dimerization but not required for either of the above activities the crystal structure of grx c at     resolution revealed a novel two strand antiparallel  sheet opposite the gsh binding groove this extra  sheet might also exist in yeast grx and in a group of putative grxs in lower organisms suggesting that grx might represent the first member of a novel grx subfamily
