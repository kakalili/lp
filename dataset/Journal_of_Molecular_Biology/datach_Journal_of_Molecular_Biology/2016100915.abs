a novel in vitro cypd mediated p  aggregation assay suggests a model for mitochondrial permeability transition by chaperone systems
tissue necrosis as a consequence of ischemia  reperfusion injury and oxidative damage is a leading cause of permanent disability and death worldwide the complete mechanism by which cells undergo necrosis upon oxidative stress is not understood in response to an oxidative insult wild type p  has been implicated as a central regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition mpt  triggering necrosis this process is associated with cellular stabilization and translocation of p  into the mitochondrial matrix here we probe the mechanism by which p  activates the key mpt regulator cyclophilin d cypd  we explore the involvement of trap  an hsp  related mitochondrial matrix protein and a member of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response and its ability to suppress mpt in a p  dependent manner our study finds that catalytically active cypd causes strong aggregation of wild type p  protein both full length and isolated dna binding domain into amyloid type fibrils in vitro the responsible cypd residues for this activity were mapped by nmr to the active site amino acids r  f  f   and w   the data also present a new proline isomerization assay for cypd by monitoring the aggregation of p  as an indicator of cypd activity moreover we find that the inhibition of trap by the mitochondria specific hsp  atpase antagonist gamitrinib strongly sensitizes primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts to mpt and permeability transition pore opening in a p  and cypd dependent manner we propose a mechanism by which the influx of unfolded p  into the mitochondrial matrix in response to oxidative stress indirectly activates the normally inhibited cypd by displacing it from trap complexes this activates cypd s isomerase activity liberated cypd then isomerizes multiple proteins including p  causing p  aggregation and the structural components of the mptp pore inducing pore opening this working model can now be tested in the future
