a role for loop f in modulating gaba binding affinity in the gabaa receptor
the brain s major inhibitory neuroreceptor is the ligand gated ion channel   aminobutyric acid gaba type a receptor gabar  gabars exist in a variety of different subunit combinations that act to modulate the physiological behavior of gabar by altering its pharmacological profile as well as its affinity for gaba while the      subtype is one of the most prevalent gabars the less populous     subtype has much higher gaba sensitivity previous studies identified residues crucial for gaba binding however the specific molecular differences responsible for this diverse sensitivity are not known furthermore the role of loop f is a divisive subject with conflicting evidence for ligand binding function using homology modeling ligand docking and molecular dynamics simulations we investigated the gaba binding sites of the two receptor subtypes simulations identified seven residues that consistently interacted with gaba in both subtypes  f   r    l   e    r k    y   and  r   residue substitution at position    arginine in      lysine in      resulted in a shift in gaba binding however the major difference between the two binding sites was the magnitude of loop f involvement with a greater contribution in the     receptor free energy calculations confirm that the     binding pocket has an increased affinity for gaba thus the possible role for loop f across the gabar family is to modulate gaba affinity
