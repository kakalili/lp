new insights into the interactions of the translation initiation factor  from archaea with guanine nucleotides and initiator trna
heterotrimeric a eif     archaeal homologue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  with    and  subunits delivers charged initiator trna trnai to the small ribosomal subunit in this work we determined the structures of aif  from the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus in the nucleotide free and gdp bound forms comparison of the free gdp and gpp nh p  mg  forms of aif  revealed a sequence of conformational changes upon gdp and gtp binding our results show that the affinity of gdp to the g domain of the  subunit is higher than that of gpp nh p in analyzing a pyrophosphate molecule binding to domain ii of the  subunit we found a cleft that is very suitable for the acceptor stem of trna accommodation it allows the suggestion of an alternative position for met  trnaimet on the   intersubunit dimer at variance with a recently published one in the model reported here the acceptor stem of the trnai is approximately perpendicular to that of trna in the ternary complex elongation factor tu  gpp nh p  trna according to our analysis the elbow and t stem of met  trnaimet in this position should make extensive contact with the  subunit of aif  thus this model is in good agreement with experimental data showing that the  subunit of aif is necessary for the stable interaction of aif  with met  trnaimet
