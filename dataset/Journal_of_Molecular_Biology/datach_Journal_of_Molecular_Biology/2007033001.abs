developmental regulators containing the i mfa domain interact with t cyclins and tat and modulate transcription
positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb complexes composed of cyclin dependent kinase  cdk  and cyclin t or t  are engaged by many cellular transcription regulators that activate or inhibit transcription from specific promoters the related i mfa inhibitor of myod family a and hic human i mfa domain containing proteins function in myogenic differentiation and embryonic development by participating in the wnt signaling pathway we report that i mfa is a novel regulator of p tefb both hic and i mfa interact through their homologous i mfa domains with cyclin t and t at two binding sites one site is the regulatory histidine  rich domain that interacts with cdk substrates including rna polymerase ii the second site contains a lysine and arginine rich motif that is highly conserved between the two t cyclins this site overlaps and includes the previously identified tat tar recognition motif of cyclin t required for activation of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  transcription hic and i mfa can serve as substrates for p tefb their i mfa domains also bind the activation domain of hiv  tat and inhibit tat and p tefb dependent transcription from the hiv  promoter this transcriptional repression is cell type specific and can operate via tat and cyclin t  genomic and sequence comparisons indicate that the i mf and hic genes as well as flanking genes diverged from a duplicated chromosomal region our findings link i mfa and hic to viral replication and suggest that p tefb is modulated in the wnt signaling pathway
