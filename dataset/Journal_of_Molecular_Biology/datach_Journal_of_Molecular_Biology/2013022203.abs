coilin displays differential affinity for specific rnas in vivo and is linked to telomerase rna biogenesis
coilin is widely known as the protein marker of the cajal body a subnuclear domain important to the biogenesis of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and telomerase complexes that are crucial to pre messenger rna splicing and telomere maintenance respectively extensive studies have characterized the interaction between coilin and the various other protein components of cbs and related subnuclear domains however only a few have examined interactions between coilin and nucleic acid we have recently published that coilin is tightly associated with nucleic acid displays rnase activity in vitro and is redistributed to the ribosomal rna rrna rich nucleoli in cells treated with the dna damaging agents cisplatin and etoposide here we report a specific in vivo association between coilin and rrna u small nuclear rna snrna  and human telomerase rna which is altered upon treatment with dna damaging agents using chromatin immunoprecipitation we provide evidence of coilin interaction with specific regions of u snrna gene loci we have also utilized bacterially expressed coilin fragments in order to map the region s important for rna binding and rnase activity in vitro additionally we provide evidence of coilin involvement in the processing of human telomerase rna both in vitro and in vivo
