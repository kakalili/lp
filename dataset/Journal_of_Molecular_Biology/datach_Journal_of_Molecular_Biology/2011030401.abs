membrane insertion and topology of the translocating chain associating membrane protein tram
the translocating chain associating membrane protein tram is a glycoprotein involved in the translocation of secreted proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum er lumen and in the insertion of integral membrane proteins into the lipid bilayer as a major step toward elucidating the structure of the functional er translocation insertion machinery we have characterized the membrane integration mechanism and the transmembrane topology of tram using two approaches photocross linking and truncated c terminal reporter tag fusions our data indicate that tram is recognized by the signal recognition particle and translocon components and suggest a membrane topology with eight transmembrane segments including several poorly hydrophobic segments furthermore we studied the membrane insertion capacity of these poorly hydrophobic segments into the er membrane by themselves finally we confirmed the main features of the proposed membrane topology in mammalian cells expressing full length tram
