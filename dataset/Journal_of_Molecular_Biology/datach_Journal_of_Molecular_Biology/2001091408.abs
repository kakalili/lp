in vitro replication slippage by dna polymerases from thermophilic organisms edited by k morikawa
replication slippage of dna polymerases is a potential source of spontaneous genetic rearrangements in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells here we show that different thermostable dna polymerases undergo replication slippage in vitro during single round replication of a single stranded dna template carrying a hairpin structure low fidelity polymerases such as thermus aquaticus taq  high fidelity polymerases such as pyrococcus furiosus pfu and a highly thermostable polymerase from pyrococcus abyssi pyra  exo   undergo slippage thermococcus litoralis dna polymerase vent  is also able to slip however slippage can be inhibited when its strand displacement activity is induced moreover dna polymerases that have a constitutive strand displacement activity such as bacillus stearothermophilus dna polymerase bst  do not slip polymerases that slip during single round replication generate hairpin deletions during pcr amplification with the exception of vent  polymerase because its strand displacement activity is induced under these conditions we show that these hairpin deletions occurring during pcr are due to replication slippage and not to a previously proposed process involving polymerization across the hairpin base
