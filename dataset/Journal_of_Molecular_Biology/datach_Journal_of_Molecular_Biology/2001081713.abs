structure and dimerization of hiv  kissing loop aptamers edited by d e draper
dimerization of two homologous strands of genomic rna is an essential feature of the retroviral replication cycle in hiv  genomic rna dimerization is facilitated by a conserved stem loop structure located near the   end of the viral rna called the dimerization initiation site dis  the dis loop is comprised of nine nucleotides six of which define an autocomplementary sequence flanked by three conserved purine residues base pairing between the loop sequences of two copies of genomic rna is necessary for efficient dimerization we previously used in vitro evolution to investigate a possible structural basis for the marked sequence conservation of the dis loop in this study chemical structure probing measurements of the apparent dissociation constants and computer structure analysis of dimerization competent aptamers were used to analyze the dimers  structure and binding the selected aptamers were variants of the naturally occurring a and b subtypes the data suggest that a sheared base pair closing the loop of the dis is important for dimerization in both subtypes on the other hand the open or closed state of the last base pair in the stem differed in the two subtypes this base pair appeared closed in the subtype a dis dimer and open in subtype b finally evidence for a cross talk between nucleotides    and  was found in some but not all loop contexts indicating some structural plasticity depending on loop sequence discriminating between the general rules governing dimer formation and the particular characteristics of individual dis aptamers helps to explain the affinity and specificity of loop loop interactions and could provide the basis for development of drugs targeted against the dimerization step during retroviral replication
