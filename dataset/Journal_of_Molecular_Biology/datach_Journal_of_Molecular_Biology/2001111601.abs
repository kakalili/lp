crystal structure of an isolated v  domain of the c t cell receptor  edited by d rees
the t cell receptor tcr is a heterodimeric cell surface protein consisting of two chains   and   each of which is composed of a variable v and a constant c domain crystals of the isolated v  domain of the murine tcr c were grown by serendipity from a solution containing the extracellular domains of the intact tcr c and cd    chains the v  crystal structure shows how crystal packing can substitute for another v  domain in a different fashion from that observed in v  v  homodimer and v  v  heterodimer structures significant conformational changes occur in the cdr and    loops that normally form part of the dimer interface the monomeric v  domain provides the unique opportunity to study the effect of dimerization on the conformation of the unliganded complementarity determining regions cdr of a tcr this structure of an individual v  module has implications for stability and bioengineering of isolated antibody and immunoglobulin domains
