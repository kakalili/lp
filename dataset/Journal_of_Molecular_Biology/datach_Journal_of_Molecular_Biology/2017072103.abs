structural and enzymatic characterization of a camp dependent diguanylate cyclase from pathogenic leptospira species
leptospira interrogans serovar copenhageni is a human pathogen that causes leptospirosis a worldwide zoonosis the l interrogans genome codes for a wide array of potential diguanylate cyclase dgc enzymes with characteristic ggdef domains capable of synthesizing the cyclic dinucleotide c di gmp known to regulate transitions between different cellular behavioral states in bacteria among such enzymes lic    lcd  which has an n terminal cgmp specific phosphodiesterases adenylyl cyclases and fhla gaf domain and a c terminal ggdef domain is notable for having close orthologs present only in pathogenic leptospira species although the function and structure of ggdef and gaf domains have been studied extensively separately little is known about enzymes with the gaf ggdef architecture in this report we address the question of how the gaf domain regulates the dgc activity of lcd  the full length lcd and its gaf domain form dimers in solution the gaf domain binds specifically camp kd of    m and has an important role in the regulation of the dgc activity of the ggdef domain lcd dgc activity is negligible in the absence of camp and is significantly enhanced in its presence specific activity of   s    the crystal structure of the lcd gaf domain in complex with camp provides valuable insights toward explaining its specificity for camp and pointing to possible mechanisms by which this cyclic nucleotide regulates the assembly of an active dgc enzyme
