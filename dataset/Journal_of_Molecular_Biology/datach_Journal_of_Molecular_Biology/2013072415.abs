what makes a protein fold amenable to functional innovation fold polarity and stability trade offs
protein evolvability includes two elements  robustness or neutrality mutations having no effect and innovability mutations readily inducing new functions  how are these two conflicting demands bridged does the ability to bridge them relate to the observation that certain folds such as tim barrels accommodate numerous functions whereas other folds support only one here we hypothesize that the key to innovability is polarity  an active site composed of flexible loosely packed loops alongside a well separated highly ordered scaffold we show that highly stabilized variants of tem   lactamase exhibit selective rigidification of the enzyme s scaffold while the active site loops maintained their conformational plasticity polarity therefore results in stabilizing compensatory mutations not trading off but instead promoting the acquisition of new activities indeed computational analysis indicates that in folds that accommodate only one function throughout evolution for example dihydrofolate reductase     of the active site residues belong to the scaffold in contrast folds associated with multiple functions such as the tim barrel show high scaffold  active site polarity    of the active site comprises scaffold residues and gt  fold higher rates of sequence divergence at active site positions our work suggests structural measures of fold polarity that appear to be correlated with innovability thereby providing new insights regarding protein evolution design and engineering
