viral dsrna inhibitors prevent self association and autophosphorylation of pkr
host response to viral rna genomes and replication products represents an effective strategy to combat viral invasion pkr is a ser thr protein kinase that binds to double stranded ds rna autophosphorylates its kinase domain and subsequently phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor   eif   this results in attenuation of protein translation preventing synthesis of necessary viral proteins in certain dna viruses pkr function can be evaded by transcription of highly structured virus encoded dsrna inhibitors that bind to and inactivate pkr we probe here the mechanism of pkr inhibition by two viral inhibitor rnas eberi from epstein  barr and vai from human adenovirus  native gel shift mobility assays and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirmed that the rna binding domains of pkr are sufficient and necessary for the interaction with dsrna inhibitors both eberi and vai are effective inhibitors of pkr activation by preventing trans autophosphorylation between two pkr molecules the rna inhibitors prevent self association of pkr molecules providing a mechanistic basis for kinase inhibition a variety of approaches indicated that dsrna inhibitors remain associated with pkr under activating conditions as opposed to activator dsrna molecules that dissociate due to reduced affinity for the phosphorylated form of pkr finally we show using a hela cell extract system that inhibitors of pkr result in translational recovery by the protein synthesis machinery these data indicate that inhibitory dsrnas bind preferentially to the latent dephosphorylated form of pkr and prevent dimerization that is required for trans autophosphorylation
