structural basis for human phf jumonji domain interaction with metal ions
phf belongs to a class of  ketoglutarate fe  dependent dioxygenases phf harbors a plant homeodomain phd and a jumonji domain phf  via its phd binds lys trimethylated histone  in submicromolar affinity and has been reported to have the demethylase activity of monomethylated lysine  of histone  in vivo however we did not detect demethylase activity for phf jumonji domain with and without its linked phd in the context of histone peptides we determined the crystal structures of phf jumonji domain in the absence and presence of additional exogenous metal ions when fe  or ni  was added at a high concentration   mm and allowed to soak in the preformed crystals fe  or ni  was bound by six ligands in an octahedral coordination the side chains of h  and d  and the two oxygen atoms of n oxalylglycine an analog of  ketoglutarate provide four coordinations in the equatorial plane while the hydroxyl oxygen atom of y  and one water molecule provide the two axial coordinations as the fifth and sixth ligands respectively the metal binding site in phf closely resembles the fe  sites in other jumonji domains examined with one important difference  a tyrosine y  of phf  replaces histidine as the fifth ligand however neither y  h mutation nor high metal concentration renders phf an active demethylase on histone peptides wild type and y  h mutant bind ni  with an approximately equal affinity of    m we propose that there must be other regulatory factors required for the enzymatic activity of phf in vivo or that perhaps phf acts on non histone substrates furthermore phf shares significant sequence homology throughout the entire region including the above mentioned tyrosine at the corresponding iron binding position with that of schizosaccharomyces pombe epe  which plays an essential role in heterochromatin function but has no known enzymatic activity
