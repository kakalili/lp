unwinding by local strand separation is critical for the function of dead box proteins as rna chaperones
the dead box proteins cyt  in neurospora crassa and mss  p in saccharomyces cerevisiae are broadly acting rna chaperones that function in mitochondria to stimulate group i and group ii intron splicing and to activate mrna translation previous studies showed that the s cerevisiae cytosolic nuclear dead box protein ded p could stimulate group ii intron splicing in vitro here we show that ded p complements mitochondrial translation and group i and group ii intron splicing defects in mss   strains stimulates the in vitro splicing of group i and group ii introns and functions indistinguishably from cyt  to resolve different nonnative secondary and or tertiary structures in the tetrahymena thermophila large subunit rrna  p abc group i intron the escherichia coli dead box protein srmb also stimulates group i and group ii intron splicing in vitro while the e coli dead box protein dbpa and the vaccinia virus dexh box protein nph ii gave little if any group i or group ii intron splicing stimulation in vitro or in vivo the four dead box proteins that stimulate group i and group ii intron splicing unwind rna duplexes by local strand separation and have little or no specificity as judged by rna binding assays and stimulation of their atpase activity by diverse rnas in contrast dbpa binds group i and group ii intron rnas nonspecifically but its atpase activity is activated specifically by a helical segment of e coli  s rrna and nph ii unwinds rnas by directional translocation the ability of dead box proteins to stimulate group i and group ii intron splicing correlates primarily with their rna unwinding activity which for the protein preparations used here was greatest for mss  p followed by ded p cyt   and srmb furthermore this correlation holds for all group i and group ii intron rnas tested implying a fundamentally similar mechanism for both types of introns our results support the hypothesis that dead box proteins have an inherent ability to function as rna chaperones by virtue of their distinctive rna unwinding mechanism which enables refolding of localized rna regions or structures without globally disrupting rna structure
