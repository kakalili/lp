three dimensional structure and implications for the catalytic mechanism of  phosphogluconolactonase from trypanosoma brucei
enzymes from the pentose phosphate pathway ppp are potential drug targets for the development of new drugs against trypanosoma brucei the causative agent of african sleeping disease for instance the  phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is currently studied actively for such purposes structural and functional studies are necessary to better characterize the associated enzymes and compare them to their human homologues in order to undertake structure based drug design studies on such targets in this context the crystal structure of  phosphogluconolactonase  pgl from t brucei the second enzyme from ppp was determined at     resolution comparison of its sequence and structure to other related proteins in the pgl family with a known structure thermotoga maritima tm gpl pbt and vibrio cholerae vc pgl  y   which have not been discussed in print  or in the glucosamine  phosphate deaminase family hexameric escherichia coli dea and monomeric bacillus subtilis bkv  allowed the identification of the pgl active site in addition to the analysis of the crystal structure  d nmr interaction studies and docking experiments are reported here key residues involved in substrate binding or in catalysis were identified
