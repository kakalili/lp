elucidation of the structural determinants responsible for the specific formation of heterodimeric mxd max b hlh lz and its binding to e box sequences
the proteins of the mxd family formally known as mad are antagonists of the oncoprotein c myc they compete with c myc for their obligate partner max to prevent the c myc max heterodimer from binding to e box sequences in the target gene promoters in cancer cells where myc is overexpressed the expression of mxd proteins is usually insufficient or abrogated however the reintroduction of mxd expression in these cells prevents growth and proliferation while the antagonism of c myc functions by mxd proteins is of potential relevance for the development of cancer treatment strategies the structural determinants responsible for the specific heterodimerization between the mxd and the max b helix  loop  helix leucine zippers are not fully understood moreover whether the heterodimer is assembled on dna or in the nucleoplasm prior to dna binding is under debate in this article we demonstrate that mxd d  a and max n a and h d which are located in the leucine zippers of the proteins can dictate the specificity of heterodimerization and whether or not the mxd max dna complex forms our results also indicate that additional specific determinants exist in the helix  loop  helix domains of max and mxd  finally we provide evidence that heterodimerization must precede dna binding in vivo
