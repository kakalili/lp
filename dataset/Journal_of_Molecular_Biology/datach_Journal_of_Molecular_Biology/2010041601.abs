substrate binding and catalysis in carbamate kinase ascertained by crystallographic and site directed mutagenesis studies movements and significance of a unique globular subdomain of this key enzyme for fermentative atp production in bacteria
carbamate kinase ck makes atp from adp and carbamoyl phosphate cp in the final step of the microbial fermentative catabolism of arginine agmatine and oxalurate allantoin two previously reported ck structures failed to clarify cp binding and catalysis and to reveal the significance of the protruding subdomain psd that hangs over the ck active center as an exclusive and characteristic ck feature we clarify now these three questions by determining two crystal structures of enterococcus faecalis ck one at     resolution and containing bound mgadp and the other at     resolution and having in the active center one sulfate and two fixed water molecules that mimic one bound cp molecule and by mutating active center residues determining the consequences of these mutations on enzyme functionality superimposition of the present crystal structures reconstructs the filled active center in the ternary complex immediately suggesting in line associative phosphoryl group transfer and a mechanism for enzyme catalysis involving n  k   k   d   and the psd residue k   the large respective increases and decreases in kmcp and kcat triggered by the mutations n a k  a k  a and d  n corroborate the ternary complex active site architecture and the catalytic mechanism proposed the extreme negative effects of k  a demonstrate a key role of the psd in substrate binding and catalysis the crystal structures reveal large rigid body movements of the psd towards the enzyme body that place k  next to cp and bury the cp site a mechanism that connects cp site occupation with the psd approach involving v  i  in the cp site and p  s  in the psd stem is identified the effects of the v  a and v  l mutations support this mechanism it is concluded that the psd movement allows ck to select against the abundant cp carbamate analogues acetylphosphate acetate and bicarbonate rendering ck highly selective for cp carbamate
