structural basis for telomeric single stranded dna recognition by yeast cdc
the essential budding yeast telomere binding protein cdc  is required for telomere replication and end protection cdc  specifically binds telomeric single stranded dna ssdna    overhangs with high affinity using an ob fold domain we have determined the high resolution solution structure of the cdc  dna binding domain dbd complexed with a cognate telomeric ssdna the ssdna wraps around one entire face of the cdc  dbd ob fold in an extended irregular conformation recognition of the ssdna bases occurs primarily through aromatic basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues the majority of which are evolutionarily conserved among budding yeast species and contribute significantly to the energetics of binding contacting five of  ssdna nucleotides the large ordered      loop is crucial for complex formation and is a unique elaboration on the binding mode commonly observed in ob fold proteins the sequence specific cdc  dbd ssdna complex presents a complementary counterpoint to the interactions observed in the oxytricha nova telomere end binding and schizosaccharomyces pombe pot complexes analysis of the cdc  dbd ssdna complex indicates that molecular recognition of extended single stranded nucleic acids may proceed via a folding type mechanism rather than resulting from specific patterns of hydrogen bonds the structure reported here provides a foundation for understanding the mechanism by which cdc  recognizes gt rich heterogeneous sequences with both unusually strong affinity and high specificity
