structure of nfat bound to dna as a monomer
the nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat is a calcium dependent transcription factor that cooperates with a myriad of partner transcription factors to regulate distinct transcription programs transcription activation by nfat without the cooperation of co stimulatory signals in lymphocytes can also impose a genetic program of anergy although the ternary nfat fos jun dna complex has been structurally characterized how nfat recognizes dna in the absence of cooperative partners and how such a binary nfat dna complex may lead to the assembly of distinct high order nfat transcription complexes are still poorly understood we have determined the crystal structure of the entire rel homology region rhr of human nfat  nfatc  bound to dna as a monomer we also present footprinting evidence that corroborates the protein  dna contacts observed in the crystal structure our structural and biochemical studies reveal the mechanism by which the monomeric rel protein nfat recognizes its cognate dna site a remarkable feature of the binary nfat dna complex is the conformational flexibility exhibited by nfat in the four independent copies of the nfat dna complex in the crystal structure which may reflect a mechanism by which nfat interacts with a variety of protein partners as it mediates disparate biological responses
