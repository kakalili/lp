role of interaction of xpf with rpa in nucleotide excision repair
nucleotide excision repair ner is a very important defense system against various types of dna damage and it is necessary for maintaining genomic stability the molecular mechanism of ner has been studied in considerable detail and it has been shown that proper protein  protein interactions among ner factors are critical for efficient repair a structure specific endonuclease xpf  ercc  which makes the   incision in ner was shown to interact with a single stranded dna binding protein rpa however the biological significance of this interaction was not studied in detail we used the yeast two hybrid assay to determine that xpf interacts with the p  subunit of rpa to further examine the role of this xpf  p  interaction we isolated a p  interaction deficient mutant form of xpf that contains a single amino acid substitution in the n terminus of xpf by the reverse yeast two hybrid assay using randomly mutagenized xpf the biochemical properties of this rpa interaction deficient mutant xpf  ercc are very similar to those of wild type xpf  ercc in vitro interestingly expression of this mutated form of xpf in the xpf deficient chinese hamster ovary cell line uv  only partially restores ner activity and uv resistance in vivo compared to wild type xpf we discovered that the rpa interaction deficient xpf is not localized in nuclei and the mislocalization of xpf  ercc prevents the complex from functioning in ner
