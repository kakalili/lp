2-Hydroxyl-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HPDA) hydrolase (the BphD enzyme) hydrolyzes a ring-cleavage product of an aromatic compound generated in a biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) degradation pathway of bacteria. The crystal structure of the BphD enzyme has been determined at 2.4 Å resolution by the multiple isomorphous replacement method. The final refined model of the BphD enzyme yields an R-factor of 17.5 % at 2.4 Å resolution with reasonable geometry. The BphD enzyme is an octameric enzyme with a 422 point-group symmetry. The subunit can be divided into core and lid domains. The active site of the enzyme is situated in the substrate-binding pocket, which is located between the two domains. The substrate-binding pocket can be divided into hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. This feature of the pocket seems to be necessary for substrate binding, as the substrate is composed of hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts. The proposed orientation of the substrate seems to be consistent with the general catalytic mechanism of α/β-hydrolases.
