mechanism of origin activation by monomers of r k encoded  protein
one recurring theme in plasmid duplication is the recognition of the origin of replication ori by specific rep proteins that bind to dna sequences called iterons for plasmid r k this process involves a complex interplay between monomers and dimers of the rep protein   with seven tandem iterons of  ori remarkably both  monomers and  dimers can bind to iterons a new paradigm in replication control dimers the predominant form in the cell inhibit replication while monomers facilitate open complex formation and activate the ori here we investigate a mechanism by which  monomers out compete  dimers for iteron binding and in so doing activate the ori with an in vivo plasmid incompatibility assay we find that  monomers bind cooperatively to two adjacent iterons cooperative binding is eliminated by insertion of a half helical turn between two iterons but is diminished only slightly by insertion of a full helical turn between two iterons these studies show also that  bound to a consensus site promotes occupancy of an adjacent mutated site another hallmark of cooperative interactions   monomer iteron interactions were quantified using a monomer biased  variant in vitro with the same collection of two iteron constructs the cooperativity coefficients mirror the plasmid incompatibility results for each construct tested   dimer iteron interactions were quantified with a dimer biased mutant in vitro and it was found that  dimers bind with negligible cooperativity to two tandem iterons
