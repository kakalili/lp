stabilization of the human   adrenergic receptor tm  tm  tm helix interface by mutagenesis of glu     a critical residue in gpcr structure
g protein coupled receptor gpcr instability represents one of the most profound obstacles in the structural study of gpcrs that bind diffusible ligands the introduction of targeted mutations at nonconserved residues that lie proximal to helix interfaces has the potential to enhance the fold stability of the receptor helix bundle while maintaining wild type receptor function to test this hypothesis we studied the effect of amino acid substitutions at glu    in the well studied   adrenergic receptor   ar  which was predicted from sequence conservation to lie at a position equivalent to a tryptophan residue in rhodopsin at the    helix interface among transmembrane tm domains    and  replacement of glu    with bulky hydrophobic residues such as tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine increases the yield of functionally folded  ar by as much as  fold receptor stability in detergent solution was studied by isothermal denaturation and it was found that the e  w and e  y mutations enhanced the  ar thermal half life by   and   fold respectively at    c the  ar was also stabilized by the introduction of tryptophan at glu     and the effect on protein behavior was similar to the rescue of the unstable wild type receptor by the antagonist propranolol molecular modeling of the e  w and e  y mutants revealed that the tryptophan ring edge and tyrosine hydroxyl are positioned proximal to the helical break in tm introduced by the conserved pro    and may stabilize the helix by interacting favorably with the unpaired carbonyl oxygen of val     conformational flexibility of tm is likely to be a general property of class a gpcrs therefore engineering of the tm  tm  tm interface at the   position may provide a general strategy for the stabilization of other receptors
