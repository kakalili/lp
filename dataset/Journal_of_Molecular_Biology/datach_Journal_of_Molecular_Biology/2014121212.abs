quality control in eukaryotic membrane protein overproduction
the overexpression of authentically folded eukaryotic membrane proteins in milligramme quantities is a fundamental prerequisite for structural studies one of the most commonly used expression systems for the production of mammalian membrane proteins is the baculovirus expression system in insect cells however a detailed analysis by radioligand binding and comparative western blotting of g protein coupled receptors and a transporter produced in insect cells showed that a considerable proportion of the expressed protein was misfolded and incapable of ligand binding in contrast production of the same membrane proteins in stable inducible mammalian cell lines suggested that the majority was folded correctly it was noted that detergent solubilisation of the misfolded membrane proteins using either digitonin or dodecylmaltoside was considerably less efficient than using sodium dodecyl sulfate or foscholine   whilst these detergents were equally efficient at solubilising correctly folded membrane proteins this provides a simple and rapid test to suggest whether heterologously expressed mammalian membrane proteins are indeed correctly folded without requiring radioligand binding assays this will greatly facilitate the high throughput production of fully functional membrane proteins for structural studies
