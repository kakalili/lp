flanking polyproline sequences inhibit  sheet structure in polyglutamine segments by inducing ppii like helix structure
polyglutamine poly q  expansion is associated with protein aggregation into  sheet amyloid fibrils and neuronal cytotoxicity in the mutant poly q protein huntingtin associated with huntington s disease both aggregation and cytotoxicity may be abrogated by a polyproline poly p  domain flanking the c terminus of the poly q region to understand structural changes that may occur with the addition of the poly p sequence we synthesized poly q peptides with    glutamine residues and a corresponding set of poly q peptides flanked on the c terminus by  proline residues poly q poly p  as occurs in the huntingtin sequence the shorter soluble poly q peptides three or six glutamine residues showed polyproline type ii like ppii like helix conformation when examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and were monomers as judged by size exclusion chromatography sec  while the longer poly q peptides nine or  glutamine residues showed a  sheet conformation by cd and defined oligomers by sec soluble poly q poly p peptides showed ppii like content but sec showed poorly defined overlapping oligomeric peaks and as judged by cd these peptides retained significant ppii like structure with increasing poly q length more importantly addition of the poly p domain increased the threshold for fibril formation to    glutamine residues x ray diffraction electron microscopy and film cd showed that while poly q peptides with   glutamine residues formed  sheet rich fibrils only the longest poly q poly p peptide   glutamine residues did so from these and other observations we propose that poly q domains exist in a  tug of war  between two conformations a ppii like helix and a  sheet while the poly p domain is conformationally constrained into a proline type ii helix ppii  addition of poly p to the c terminus of a poly q domain induces a ppii like structure which opposes the aggregation prone  sheet these structural observations may shed light on the threshold phenomenon of poly q aggregation and support the hypothesized evolution of  protective  poly p tracts adjacent to poly q aggregation domains
