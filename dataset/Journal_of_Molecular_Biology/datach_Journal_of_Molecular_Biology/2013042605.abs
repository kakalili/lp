peptide binding by catalytic domains of the protein disulfide isomerase related protein erp
the protein disulfide isomerase pdi family member erp  endopdi thioredoxin domain containing protein  is preferentially expressed in a limited number of tissues where it may function as a survival factor for nitrosative stress in vivo it is involved in insulin production as well as in adiponectin signaling and interacts specifically with the redox regulatory endoplasmic reticulum proteins endoplasmic oxidoreductin   ero   and peroxiredoxin  here we show that erp  although lacking a pdi like redox inactive b  thioredoxin domain with its hydrophobic substrate binding site is able to bind to a large pool of peptides containing aromatic and basic residues via all three of its catalytic domains a  a and a   though the a domain may contain the primary binding site erp  which shows relatively higher activity as a disulfide reductase than as an oxidase isomerase in vitro compared to pdi and erp  possesses chaperone activity in vivo a property also shared by the c terminal a  domain a crystal structure of the a  domain is also presented offering a view of possible substrate binding sites within catalytic domains of pdi proteins
