crystal structure of myeloid cell activating receptor leukocyte ig like receptor a  lilra ilt lir  domain swapped dimer molecular basis for its non binding to mhc complexes
the leukocyte ig like receptor lilr ilt lir family comprises  members that are either activating or inhibitory receptors regulating a broad range of cells in the immune responses lilrb  ilt  lilrb  ilt  and lilra  lir  can recognize mhc major histocompatibility complex class i or class i like molecules and lilrb hla a  lilrb ul  and lilrb hla g complex extracellular domains d d  structures have been solved recently the details of binding to mhc have been described despite high levels of sequence similarity among lilra  lilra  ilt  lilra  ilt  and lilrb b  all earlier experiments showed that lilra does not bind to mhc but the reason is unknown here we report the lilra extracellular d d domain crystal structure at     resolution which reveals structural shifts of the corresponding mhc binding amino acid residues in comparison with lilr b b  explaining its non binding to mhc molecules we identify some key residues with great influence on the local structure which exist only in the mhc binding receptors moreover we show that lilra forms a domain swapped dimer further work with these key swapping residues yields a monomeric form confirming that the domain swapping is primarily amino acid sequence specific the structure described here supports the dimer conformation in solution observed earlier and implies a stress induced regulation by dimerization consistent with its function as a heat shock promoter
