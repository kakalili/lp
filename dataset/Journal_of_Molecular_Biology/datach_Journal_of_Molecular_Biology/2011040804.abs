enhancement of proton conductance by mutations of the selectivity filter of aquaporin
prevention of cation permeation in wild type aquaporin  aqp  is believed to be associated with the asn pro ala npa region and the aromatic arginine selectivity filter sf domain previous work has suggested that the npa region helps to impede proton permeation due to the protein backbone collective macrodipoles that create an environment favoring a directionally discontinuous channel hydrogen bonded water chain and a large electrostatic barrier the sf domain contributes to the proton permeation barrier by a spatial restriction mechanism and direct electrostatic interactions to further explore these various effects the free energy barriers and the maximum cation conductance for the permeation of various cations through the aqp r  v and aqp r  s mutants are predicted computationally the cations studied included the hydrated excess proton that utilizes the grotthuss shuttling mechanism a model  classical  charge localized hydronium cation that exhibits no grotthuss shuttling and a sodium cation the hydrated excess proton was simulated using a specialized multi state molecular dynamics method including a proper physical treatment of the proton shuttling and charge defect delocalization both aqp mutants exhibit a surprising cooperative effect leading to a reduction in the free energy barrier for proton permeation around the npa region due to altered water configurations in the sf region with aqp r  s having a higher conductance than aqp r  v the theoretical predictions are experimentally confirmed in wild type aqp and the mutants expressed in xenopus oocytes the combined results suggest that the sf domain is a specialized structure that has evolved to impede proton permeation in aquaporins
