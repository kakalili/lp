topological measurement of an a tract bend angle variation of duplex winding
the rotational variant method of lutter et al was developed to measure the bend angle induced when a protein binds to dna to measure the intrinsic bend conferred by a sequence of six adenine bases an a tract  the method was modified by relaxing at high temperature to remove the bend we describe here an alternative approach that involves unwinding the duplex dna between adjacent bends in plasmids containing tandemly repeated blocks of a tracts this method measures the topological difference contributed by adjacent bends when they are in two different rotational settings and therefore does not require reference to a straight state the interbend dna was unwound by use of the intercalator chloroquine or alternatively by raising the temperature in the relaxation reaction the effect of this unwinding is to change the pitch of the superhelix of the tandem repeats from which the bend angle is measured the result is a bend angle value that is consistent with that measured using the bend straightening version of the method this version offers several advantages that complement the conventional bent versus straight approach
