modulation of sp activity by a cyclin a cdk complex edited by m yaniv
transcription factors of the sp family are targets of several regulatory pathways and can induce or inhibit gene expression here we show that sp is associated with a histone  kinase activity this activity is growth regulated and correlates with the expression of cyclin a co immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that sp interacts with cyclin a and can be phosphorylated by a cyclin a associated kinase the interaction is direct and requires the zinc finger region of sp and the amino terminal domain of cyclin a over expression of cyclin a enhances the expression of a reporter gene controlled by an sp responsive promoter addition of olomoucine a specific inhibitor of cdk and cdc activity on the other hand reduces the expression of the reporter electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that this is due to a reduction of the dna binding ability of sp family members our results indicate that phosphorylation of sp and other members of the family by a cyclin a cdk complex may play a role in the growth and cell cycle regulation of its transcriptional activity
