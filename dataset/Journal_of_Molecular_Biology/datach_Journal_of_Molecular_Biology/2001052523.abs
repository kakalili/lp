structural requirements for cooperative binding of hmg to dna minicircles edited by m yaniv
dna minicircles where the length of dna is below the persistence length are highly effective preferred ligands for hmg box proteins the proteins bind to them  structure specifically  with affinities in the nanomolar range presumably to an exposed widened minor groove to understand better the basis of this preference we have studied the binding of hmg  which has two tandem hmg boxes linked by a basic extension to a long acidic tail and drosophila hmg d one hmg box linked by a basic region to a short and less acidic tail  and their hmg box domains to  bp and  bp dna minicircles in some cases we see cooperative binding of two molecules to the circles the requirements for strong cooperativity are two hmg boxes and the basic extension the latter also appears to stabilize and constrain the complex preventing binding of further protein molecules hmg d with a single hmg box does not bind cooperatively in the case of hmg  the acidic tail is not required for cooperativity and does not affect binding significantly in contrast to a much greater effect with linear dna or even four way junctions another distorted dna substrate  such effects could be relevant in the hierarchy of binding of hmg box proteins to dna distortions in vivo where both single box and two box proteins might co exist with or without basic extensions and acidic tails
