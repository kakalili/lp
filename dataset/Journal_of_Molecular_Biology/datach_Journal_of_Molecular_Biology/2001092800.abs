zipper like watson crick base pairs edited by i tinoco
a series of dna heptadecamers containing the dna analogues of rna e like   d gxa  ayg    motifs x y is complementary t a a t c g or g c pair were studied using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr methodology and distance geometry dg molecular dynamics md approaches such oligomers reveal excellent resolution in nmr spectra and exhibit many unusual nuclear overhauser effects noes that allow for good characterization of an unusual zipper like conformation with zipper like watson crick base pairs the potential canonical x  y h bonding is not present and the central x y pairs are transformed instead into inter strand stacks that are bracketed by sheared g  a base pairs such phenomenal structural change is brought about mainly through two backbone torsional angle adjustments i e   from c   endo to c   endo for the sugar puckers of unpaired residues and  from gauche to trans for the following   adenosine residues such motifs are analogous to the previously studied gga  motif presumably present in the human centromeric tggaa n tandem repeat sequence the novel zipper like motifs are only    deg c less stable than the gga  motif suggesting that inter strand base stacking plays an important role in stabilizing unusual nucleic acid structures the discovery that canonical watson crick g  c or a  t hydrogen bonded pairs can be transformed into stacking pairs greatly increases the repertoire for unusual nucleic acid structural motifs
