mechanism of dna methylation the double role of dna as a substrate and as a cofactor
methylation of cytosine residues in the dna is one of the most important epigenetic marks central to the control of differential expression of genes we perform quantum mechanical calculations to investigate the catalytic mechanism of the bacterial hhai dna methyltransferase we find that the enzyme nucleophile cys  can attack c of cytosine only after it is deprotonated by the dna phosphate group a reaction facilitated by a bridging water molecule this finding which indicates that the dna acts as both the substrate and the cofactor can explain the total loss of activity observed in an analogous enzyme thymidylate synthase when the phosphate group of the substrate was removed furthermore our results displaying the inability of the phosphate group to deprotonate the side chain of serine is in agreement with the total or the large extent of inactivity observed for the c s mutant in contrast to results from previous calculations we find that the active site conserved residues glu   arg   and arg   are crucial for catalysis in addition the enzyme  dna adduct formation and the methyl transfer from the cofactor s adenosyl l methionine are not concerted but proceed via stepwise mechanism in many of the different steps of this methylation reaction the transfer of a proton is found to be necessary to render these processes possible we find that several water molecules found in the crystal structure play an important role acting as a bridge between the donating and accepting proton groups
