structure and function of the conserved   hairpin in escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna iii    paper ii in this series is the accompanying paper morosyuk et al     functional analysis of the   loop edited by i tinoco
an instant evolution experiment was performed on the eight nucleotides comprising the loop region of the   hairpin in escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna positions   to   were randomly mutated and   unique functional mutants were isolated sequenced and analyzed for function in vivo non random nucleotide distributions were observed at each of the mutated positions except   and   nucleotide identity significantly affected ribosome function at positions        and   pyrimidines were absent at position   in the instant evolution pool as were c at position   and g at position   a highly significant covariation was observed between nucleotides   and   no functional double mutants at positions   and   were obtained from the instant evolution pool in our nmr structure of the   loop both the g   u  and g   a  form sheared hydrogen bonded mismatches to further examine the functional constraints between these paired nucleotides one set of site directed mutations was constructed at positions     and another set was constructed at positions     functional analysis of the site directed mutants is consistent with our instant evolution findings and revealed constraints on the placement of specific functional groups observed in the nmr structure ten instant evolution mutants were isolated that are more functional than the wild type hyperactivity in these mutants correlates with a single mutation at position
