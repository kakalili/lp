pathogen resistance mediated by il  signaling at the epithelial  microbiota interface
intestinal colonization resistance to bacterial pathogens is generally associated among other factors with mucosal homeostasis that preserves the integrity of the intestinal barrier mucosal homeostasis depends on physical and molecular interactions between three components the resident microbiota the epithelial layer and the local immune system the cytokine il  helps to orchestrate this three way interaction il  is produced by immune cells present beneath the epithelium and is induced by bacteria present in the intestine il  stimulates the epithelial cells via the il  ra  il  r receptor complex inducing changes in the expression of genes involved in the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity with a variety of functions in pathogen resistance such as mucus layer modifications and hydration tight junction fortification and the production of a broad range of bactericidal compounds these mechanisms of pathogen resistance in turn affect the microbiota composition and create an environment that excludes pathogens here we highlight the role of il  as key mediator in the give and take relationship between the microbiota and the host that impacts pathogen resistance
