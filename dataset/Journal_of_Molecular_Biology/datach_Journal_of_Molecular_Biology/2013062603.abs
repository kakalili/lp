brms     and brms     are crystal oligomeric coiled coils with different oligomerization states which behave as disordered protein fragments in solution
the breast cancer metastasis suppressor  brms  gene suppresses metastasis without affecting the primary tumor growth cellular localization of brms appears to be important for exerting its effects on metastasis inhibition we recently described a nucleo cytoplasmic shuttling for brms and identified a nuclear export signal within the n terminal coiled coil the structure of these regions shows an antiparallel coiled coil capable of oligomerizing which compromises the accessibility to the nuclear export signal consensus residues we have studied the structural and biophysical features of this region to further understand the contribution of the n terminal coiled coil to the biological function of brms  we have observed that residues  to  might be important in defining the oligomerization state of the brms n terminal coiled coil the fragments are mainly disordered in solution with evidence of residual structure in addition we report the presence of a conformational dynamic equilibrium oligomeric folded species   oligomeric unfolded in solution in the brms n terminal coiled coil that might facilitate the nuclear export of brms to the cytoplasm
