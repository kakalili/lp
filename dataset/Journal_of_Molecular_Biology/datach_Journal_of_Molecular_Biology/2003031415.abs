supramodular structure and synergistic target binding of the n terminal tandem pdz domains of psd
pdz domain proteins play critical roles in binding clustering and subcellular targeting of membrane receptors and ion channels pdz domains in multi pdz proteins often are arranged in groups with highly conserved spacing and intervening sequences however the functional significance of such tandem arrangements of pdzs is unclear we have solved the three dimensional structure of the first two pdz domains of postsynaptic density protein   psd  pdz and pdz  which are closely linked to each other in the psd  family of scaffold proteins the two pdzs have limited freedom of rotation and their c terminal peptide binding grooves are aligned with each other with an orientation preference for binding to pairs of c termini extending in the same direction increasing the spacing between pdz and pdz resulted in decreased binding between pdz  and its dimeric targets the same mutation impaired the functional ability of psd  to cluster kv  potassium channels in heterologous cells the data presented provide a molecular basis for preferential binding of psd  to multimeric membrane proteins with appropriate c terminal sequences
