mir  a p modulates phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells by targeting ets
micrornas are key regulators of vascular smooth muscle cells vsmcs phenotypic switch one of the main events responsible for bare metal in stent restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention mir  a p is an important modulator of differentiation proliferation and migration in different cell types however its role in vsmcs is still unknown the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of mir  a p in vsmcs phenotypic switch our results suggest that mir  a p is highly expressed in vsmcs but it is down regulated after vascular injury in vivo its overexpression is sufficient to reduce vsmcs proliferation and migration and it is able to promote the expression of selective vsmcs markers such as alpha smooth muscle actin myosin heavy chain   and smooth muscle  alpha interestingly mir  a p directly targets ets  a transcription factor implicated in cell proliferation and migration and is crucial in pdgf bb pathway in vsmcs thus mir  a p in this context inhibits pdgf bb pathway and is therefore a potential regulator of vsmcs phenotypic switch
