recycling of aborted ribosomal  s subunit nascent chain trna complexes by the heat shock protein hsp
when heat shock prematurely dissociates a translating bacterial ribosome its  s subunit is prevented from reinitiating protein synthesis by trna covalently linked to the unfinished protein chain that remains threaded through the exit tunnel hsp  a highly upregulated bacterial heat shock protein reactivates such dead end complexes here we show with cryo electron microscopy reconstructions and functional assays that hsp  translocates the trna moiety from the a site to the p site of stalled  s subunits by stabilizing the trna in the p site hsp  indirectly frees up the a site allowing a release factor to land there and cleave off the trna such a release factor must be stop codon independent suggesting a possible role for a poorly characterized class of putative release factors that are upregulated by cellular stress lack a codon recognition domain and are conserved in eukaryotes
