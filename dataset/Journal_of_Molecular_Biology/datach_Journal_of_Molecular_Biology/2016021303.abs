structures of the dfsb protein family suggest a cationic helical sibling lethal factor peptide
bacteria have developed a variety of mechanisms for surviving harsh environmental conditions nutrient stress and overpopulation paenibacillus dendritiformis produces a lethal protein slf that is able to induce cell death in neighbouring colonies and a phenotypic switch in more distant ones slf is derived from the secreted precursor protein dfsb after proteolytic processing here we present new crystal structures of dfsb homologues from a variety of bacterial species and a surprising version present in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae adopting a four helix bundle decorated with a further three short helices within intervening loops dfsb belongs to a non enzymatic class of the dinb fold the structure suggests that the biologically active slf fragment may possess a c terminal helix rich in basic and aromatic residues that suggest a functional mechanism akin to that for cationic antimicrobial peptides
