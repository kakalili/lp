Cleavage by RNase E is believed to be the rate-limiting step in the degradation of many RNAs. These cleavages are modulated by 5′ end-phosphorylation, folding and translation of the mRNA in question. Here, we present data suggesting that these cleavages are also regulated by environmental conditions. We report that rpsO mRNA, 15 minutes after a shift to 44°C, is stabilized in cells grown in minimal medium. This stabilization is correlated with a reduction in the efficiency of the RNase E cleavage which initiates its decay. We also observe the appearance of RNA fragments previously detected following RNase E inactivation and a defect in the adaptation of RNase E concentration. These observations, coupled to the fact that RNase E overproduction slightly reduces the accumulation of the rpsO mRNA, suggest that this stabilization is caused in part by a limitation in RNase E concentration. An increase in the steady-state level of rpsT mRNA is also observed following a shift to 44°C in minimal medium; however, processing of the 9S rRNA precursor is not affected under these conditions. We thus propose that RNase E concentration changes in the cell in response to environmental conditions and that these changes can selectively affect the processing and the stability of individual mRNAs. Our data also indicate that the efficiency of cleavage of the rpsO mRNA by RNase E is modified by other factor(s) which remain to be identified.
