insulin assembly damps conformational fluctuations raman analysis of amide i linewidths in native states and fibrils
the crystal structure of insulin has been investigated in a variety of dimeric and hexameric assemblies interest in dynamics has been stimulated by conformational variability among crystal forms and evidence suggesting that the functional monomer undergoes a conformational change on receptor binding here we employ raman spectroscopy and raman microscopy to investigate well defined oligomeric species monomeric and dimeric analogs in solution native t and r hexamers in solution and corresponding polycrystalline samples remarkably linewidths of raman bands associated with the polypeptide backbone amide i exhibit progressive narrowing with successive self assembly whereas dimerization damps fluctuations at an intermolecular  sheet deconvolution of the amide i band indicates that formation of hexamers stabilizes both helical and non helical elements although the structure of a monomer in solution resembles a crystallographic protomer its encagement in a native assembly damps main chain fluctuations further narrowing of a  sheet specific amide i band is observed on reorganization of insulin in a cross  fibril enhanced flexibility of the native insulin monomer is in accord with molecular dynamics simulations such conformational fluctuations may initiate formation of an amyloidogenic nucleus and enable induced fit on receptor binding
