the aspergillus nidulans multimeric ccaat binding complex ancf is negatively autoregulated via its hapb subunit gene edited by j karn
cis acting ccaat elements are frequently found in eukaryotic promoter regions many of them are bound by conserved multimeric complexes in the fungus aspergillus nidulans the respective complex was designated ancf a nidulans ccaat binding factor  ancf is composed of at least three subunits designated hapb hapc and hape here we show that the promoter regions of the hapb genes in both a nidulans and aspergillus oryzae contain two inversely oriented conserved ccaat boxes box  and box   electrophoretic mobility shift assays emsas using both nuclear extracts and the purified reconstituted ancf complex indicated that ancf binding in vitro to these boxes occurs in a non mutually exclusive manner western and northern blot analyses showed that steady state levels of hapb protein as well as hapb mrna were elevated in hapc and hape deletion mutants suggesting a repressing effect of ancf on hapb expression consistently in a hapb deletion background the hapb lacz expression level was elevated compared with the expression in the wild type this was further supported by overexpression of hapb using an inducible alca hapb construct induction of alca hapb expression strongly repressed the expression of a hapb lacz gene fusion however mutagenesis of box  led to a fivefold reduced expression of a hapb lacz gene fusion compared with the expression derived from a wild type hapb lacz fusion these results indicate that i box  is an important positive cis acting element in hapb regulation  ii ancf does not represent the corresponding positive trans acting factor and iii that ancf is involved in repression of hapb
