nuclear factor i regulates brain fatty acid binding protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein gene expression in malignant glioma cell lines
glial fibrillary acidic protein gfap  an intermediate filament protein normally found in astrocytes and the radial glial marker brain fatty acid binding protein b fabp also known as fabp  are co expressed in malignant glioma cell lines and tumors nuclear factor i nfi recognition sites have been identified in the b fabp and gfap promoters and transcription of both genes is believed to be regulated by nfi here we study the role of the different members of the nfi family in regulating endogenous and ectopic b fabp and gfap gene transcription in human malignant glioma cells we show by gel shifts that all four members of the nfi family nfia nfib nfic and nfix bind to b fabp and gfap nfi consensus sites over expression of nfis in conjunction with mutation analysis of nfi consensus sites using a reporter gene assay supports a role for all four nfis in the regulation of the gfap and b fabp genes knock down of single or combined nfis reveals promoter dependent and promoter context dependent interaction patterns and suggests cross talk between the different members of the nfi family our data indicate that the nfi family of transcription factors plays a key role in the regulation of both the b fabp and gfap genes in malignant glioma cells
