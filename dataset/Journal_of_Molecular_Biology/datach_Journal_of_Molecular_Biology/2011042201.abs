radically different amyloid conformations dictate the seeding specificity of a chimeric sup  prion
a remarkable feature of prion biology is that the same prion protein can misfold into more than one infectious conformation and these conformations in turn lead to distinct heritable prion strains with different phenotypes the yeast prion psi  is a powerful system for studying how changes in strain conformation affect cross species transmission we have previously established that a chimera of the saccharomyces cerevisiae sc and candida albicans ca sup  prion domains can cross the sc ca species barrier in a strain dependent manner in vitro the conversion of the monomeric chimera into the prion amyloid form can be seeded by either sc or ca sup  amyloid fibers resulting in two strains chim sc and chim ca  these strains have a  molecular memory  of their originating species in that chim sc preferentially seeds the conversion of sc sup  and vice versa to investigate how this species specificity is conformationally encoded we used amide exchange and limited proteolysis to probe the structures of these two strains we found that the amyloid cores of chim sc and chim ca are predominantly confined to the sc derived and ca derived residues respectively in addition the chimera is able to propagate the chim ca conformation even when the sc residues comprising the chim sc core were deleted thus the two strains have non overlapping and modular amyloid cores that determine whether sc or ca residues are presented on the growing face of the prion seed these observations establish how conformations determine the specificity of prion transmission and demonstrate a remarkable plasticity to amyloid misfolding
