crystal structure of ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase from arabidopsis thaliana a recently discovered enzyme in the biosynthesis of l lysine by plants and chlamydia
the essential biosynthetic pathway to l lysine in bacteria and plants is an attractive target for the development of new antibiotics or herbicides because it is absent in humans who must acquire this amino acid in their diet plants use a shortcut of a bacterial pathway to l lysine in which the pyridoxal   phosphate plp dependent enzyme ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase ll dap at transforms l tetrahydrodipicolinic acid l thdp directly to ll dap in addition ll dap at was recently found in chlamydia sp  suggesting that inhibitors of this enzyme may also be effective against such organisms in order to understand the mechanism of this enzyme and to assist in the design of inhibitors the three dimensional crystal structure of ll dap at was determined at     resolution the cdna sequence of ll dap at from arabidopsis thaliana atdap at was optimized for expression in bacteria and cloned in escherichia coli without its leader sequence but with a c terminal hexahistidine affinity tag to aid protein purification the structure of atdap at was determined using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion mad method with a seleno methionine derivative atdap at is active as a homodimer with each subunit having plp in the active site it belongs to the family of type i fold plp dependent enzymes comparison of the active site residues of atdap at and aspartate aminotransferases revealed that the plp binding residues in atdap at are well conserved in both enzymes however glu  and asn   in the active site of atdap at are not found at similar positions in aspartate aminotransferases suggesting that specific substrate recognition may require these residues from the other monomer a malate bound structure of atdap at allowed ll dap and l glutamate to be modelled into the active site these initial three dimensional structures of ll dap at provide insight into its substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism
