protelomerase uses a topoisomerase ib y recombinase type mechanism to generate dna hairpin ends
protelomerases are enzymes responsible for the generation of closed hairpin ends in linear dna it is proposed that they use a breaking and rejoin type mechanism to affect dna rearrangement on specific dna sequences in doing so one strand turns around and becomes the complementary strand using the purified enzyme from the escherichia coli phage n  and the klebsiella phage  ko and synthetic oligonucleotide substrates we directly demonstrate the location where the cutting re ligation occurs we identified a pair of transient staggered cleavages six base pairs apart centered around the axis of dyad symmetry of the target site two molecules of the protelomerase form a pair of protein linked dna intermediates at each   end of the cleaved openings leaving a   oh then in a process not yet clearly defined the partners of the two initial openings are exchanged and the transient breaks are resealed to generate hairpin ends the formation of   covalent dna  protein intermediates is a hallmark of the topoisomerase ib type reaction and we have thus shown experimentally that protelomerase is a member of the tyrosine recombinase superfamily in addition by introducing single nicks in the substrates as perturbation we found that the integrity of the nucleotide chain  bp away from the cutting site as well as this nucleotide s complementary location on the stem if the strands were to fold into a cruciform structure are required for activity suggesting that these locations may be important substrate  protein contacts we determined that n  and  ko protelomerases are monomers in solution and two molecules are needed to interact with the substrate to form two closed hairpin products the target sites of protelomerases invariably consist of inverted repeats comparative studies using the related target sites of different protelomerases suggest that these proteins may require both sequence specific and structure possibly cruciform specific recognition for activity
