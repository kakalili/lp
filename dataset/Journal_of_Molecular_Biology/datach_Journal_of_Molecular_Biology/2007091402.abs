three members of the human pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase gene family are direct targets of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor
the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator activated receptors ppars are known for their critical role in the metabolic syndrome here we show that they are direct regulators of the family of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pdk genes whose products act as metabolic homeostats in sensing hunger and satiety levels in key metabolic tissues by modulating the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex mis regulation of this tightly controlled network may lead to hyperglycemia in human embryonal kidney cells we found the mrna expression of pdk  pdk and pdk to be under direct primary control of ppar ligands and in normal mouse kidney tissue pdk and pdk are ppar targets both treatment of hek cells with ppar   specific sirna and the genetic disruption of the ppar   gene in mouse fibroblasts resulted in reduced expression of pdk genes and abolition of induction by ppar   ligands these findings suggest that ppar   is a key regulator of pdk genes in particular the pdk pdk gene in silico analysis of the human pdk genes revealed two candidate ppar response elements in the pdk gene five in the pdk gene and two in the pdk gene but none in the pdk gene for seven of these sites we could demonstrate both ppar   ligand responsiveness in context of their chromatin region and simultaneous association of ppar   with its functional partner proteins such as retinoidxreceptor co activator and mediator proteins and phosphorylated rna polymerase ii in conclusion pdk  pdk and pdk are primary ppar   target genes in humans underlining the importance of the receptor in the control of metabolism
