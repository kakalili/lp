involvement of dna polymerase  in dna replication and mutagenic consequences edited by m yaniv
overexpression in mammalian cells of the error prone dna polymerase   pol   has been found to increase the spontaneous mutagenesis here we investigated a possible mechanism used by pol  to be a genetic instability enhancer its interference in replicative dna synthesis which is normally catalysed by the dna polymerases    and   by taking advantage of the ability to incorporate efficiently into dna the chain terminator ddctp as well as the oxidised nucleotide  oxo dgtp we show here that purified pol  can compete with the replicative dna polymerases during replication in vitro of duplex dna when added to human cell extracts we found that involvement of pol  lowers replication fidelity and results in a modified error specificity furthermore we demonstrated that involvement of pol  occurred during synthesis of the lagging strand these in vitro data provide one possible explanation of how overexpression of the enzyme could perturb the genetic instability in mammalian cells we discuss these findings within the scope of the up regulation of pol  in many cancer cells
