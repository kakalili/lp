topoisomerase i mediated dna cleavage induced by the minor groove directed binding of bibenzimidazoles to a distal site
many agents e g camptothecins indolocarbazoles indenoisoquinolines and dibenzonaphthyridines stimulate topoisomerase i top  mediated dna cleavage a behavior termed topoisomerase i poisoning by interacting with both the dna and the enzyme at the site of cleavage typically by intercalation between the  and  base pairs  the bibenzimidazoles which include hoechst    and    are a family of dna minor groove directed agents that also stimulate topoisomerase i mediated dna cleavage however the molecular mechanism by which these ligands poison top is poorly understood toward this goal we have used a combination of mutational footprinting and dna binding affinity analyses to define the dna binding site for hoechst    and a related derivative that results in optimal induction of top mediated dna cleavage we show that this dna binding site is located downstream from the site of dna cleavage encompassing the base pairs from position  to   the distal nature of this binding site relative to the site of dna cleavage suggests that minor groove directed agents like the bibenzimidazoles poison top via a mechanism distinct from compounds like the camptothecins which interact at the site of cleavage
