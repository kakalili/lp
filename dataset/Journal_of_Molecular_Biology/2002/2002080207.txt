β2-Glycoprotein I (β2GPI) is a highly glycosylated phospholipid-binding plasma protein comprised of four complement control protein (CCP) domains and a distinct fifth domain. The structural organisation of human and bovine β2GPI in aqueous solution was studied by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Low-resolution models that match the SAXS experimental data best were independently constructed by three different ab initio 3D-reconstruction algorithms. Similar elongated S-shaped models with distinct side-arms, which were correlated to the position of the carbohydrate chains, were restored from all three algorithms. Due to an additional glycosylation site located on the CCP2 domain of bovine β2GPI a small change in the characteristic SAXS parameters was observed, which coincided with results obtained from SDS–PAGE. In comparison to the human analogue the corresponding restored low-resolution models displayed a similar S-shape with less bending in the middle part.As the experimental SAXS curves fit poorly to the simulated scattering curves calculated from the crystallographic coordinates of human β2GPI, the crystal structure was modified. First, additional carbohydrate residues missing from the crystal structure were modelled. Second, on the basis of the low-resolution models, the J-shaped crystal structure was rotated between CCP3 and CCP2 assuming the greatest interdomain flexibility between these domains. An S-shaped model with a tilt angle of ∼60° between CCP3 and CCP2 yielded the best fit to the experimental SAXS data. Since there is evidence that β2GPI can adopt different conformations, which reveal distinct differences in autoantibody recognition, our data clearly point to a reorientation of the flexible domains, which may be an essential feature for binding of autoantibodies.
