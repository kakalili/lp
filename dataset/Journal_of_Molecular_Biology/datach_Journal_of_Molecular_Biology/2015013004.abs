interplay between e coli dnak clpb and grpe during protein disaggregation
the dnak hsp  chaperone system and clpb hsp  collaboratively disaggregate protein aggregates and reactivate inactive proteins the teamwork is specific escherichia coli dnak interacts with e coli clpb and yeast hsp  ssa  interacts with yeast hsp   this interaction is between the middle domains of hexameric clpb hsp  and the dnak hsp  nucleotide binding domain nbd  to identify the site on e coli dnak that interacts with clpb we substituted amino acid residues throughout the dnak nbd we found that several variants with substitutions in subdomains ib and iib of the dnak nbd were defective in clpb interaction in vivo in a bacterial two hybrid assay and in vitro in a fluorescence anisotropy assay the dnak subdomain iib mutants were also defective in the ability to disaggregate protein aggregates with clpb dnaj and grpe although they retained some ability to reactivate proteins with dnaj and grpe in the absence of clpb we observed that grpe which also interacts with subdomains ib and iib inhibited the interaction between clpb and dnak in vitro suggesting competition between clpb and grpe for binding dnak computational modeling of the dnak  clpb hexamer complex indicated that one dnak monomer contacts two adjacent clpb protomers simultaneously the model and the experiments support a common and mutually exclusive grpe and clpb interaction region on dnak additionally homologous substitutions in subdomains ib and iib of ssa caused defects in collaboration between ssa and hsp   altogether these results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of collaboration between the dnak hsp  system and clpb hsp  for protein disaggregation
