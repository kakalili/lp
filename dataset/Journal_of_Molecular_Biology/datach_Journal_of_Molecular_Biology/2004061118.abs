mechanisms of camptothecin resistance by human topoisomerase i mutations
human topoisomerase i relaxes superhelical tension associated with dna replication transcription and recombination by reversibly nicking one strand of duplex dna and forming a covalent   phosphotyrosine linkage this enzyme is the sole target of the camptothecin family of anticancer compounds which acts by stabilizing the covalent protein  dna complex and enhancing apoptosis through blocking the advancement of replication forks mutations that impart resistance to camptothecin have been identified in several regions of human topoisomerase i we present the crystal structures of two camptothecin resistant forms of human topoisomerase i phe  ser at    resolution and asn  ser at    resolution in ternary complexes with dna and topotecan hycamtin   a camptothecin analogue currently in widespread clinical use while the alteration of asn  to ser leads to the elimination of a water mediated contact between the enzyme and topotecan we were surprised to find that a well ordered water molecule replaces the hydrophobic phenylalanine side chain in the phe  ser structure we further consider camptothecin resistant mutations at seven additional sites in human topoisomerase i and present structural evidence explaining their possible impact on drug binding these results advance our understanding of the mechanism of cell poisoning by camptothecin and suggest specific modifications to the drug that may improve efficacy
