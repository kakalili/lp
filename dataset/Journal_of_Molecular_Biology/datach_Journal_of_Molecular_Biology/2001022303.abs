crystal structure of the hexameric replicative helicase repa of plasmid rsf   edited by r huber
unwinding of double stranded dna into single stranded intermediates required for various fundamental life processes is catalyzed by helicases a family of mono  di or hexameric motor proteins fueled by nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis the three dimensional crystal structure of the hexameric helicase repa encoded by plasmid rsf   has been determined by x ray diffraction at    resolution the hexamer shows an annular structure with  fold rotational symmetry and a     wide central hole suggesting that single stranded dna may be threaded during unwinding homologs of all five conserved sequence motifs of the dnab like helicase family are found in repa and the topography of the monomer resembles reca and the helicase domain of the bacteriophage t gp protein in a modeled complex atp molecules are located at the subunit interfaces and clearly define adenine binding and atpase catalytic sites formed by amino acid residues located on adjacent monomers most remarkable is the  arginine finger  arg  contributing to the active site in the adjacent monomer this arrangement of active site residues suggests cooperativity between monomers in atp hydrolysis and helicase activity of repa the mechanism of dna unwinding remains elusive as repa is  fold symmetric contrasting the recently published asymmetric structure of the bacteriophage t gp helicase domain
