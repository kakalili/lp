interaction of t uvsw helicase and single stranded dna binding protein gp  through its carboxy terminal acidic tail
bacteriophage t uvsw helicase contains both unwinding and annealing activities and displays some functional similarities to bacterial recg and recq helicases uvsw is involved in several dna repair pathways playing important roles in recombination dependent dna repair and the reorganization of stalled replication forks the t single stranded dna ssdna binding protein gp  is a central player in nearly all dna replication and repair processes and is thought to facilitate their coordination by recruiting and regulating the various proteins involved here we show that the activities of the uvsw protein are modulated by gp  uvsw catalyzed unwinding of recombination intermediates such as d loops and static x dna holliday junction mimic to ssdna products is enhanced by the gp  protein the enhancement requires the presence of the protein interaction domain of gp  the acidic carboxy terminus  suggesting that a specific interaction between uvsw and gp  is required in the absence of this interaction the ssdna annealing and atp dependent translocation activities of uvsw are severely inhibited when gp  coats the ssdna lattice however when uvsw and gp  do interact uvsw is able to efficiently displace the gp  protein from the ssdna this ability of uvsw to remove gp  from ssdna may explain its ability to enhance the strand invasion activity of the t recombinase uvsx and suggests a possible new role for uvsw in gp  mediated dna transactions
