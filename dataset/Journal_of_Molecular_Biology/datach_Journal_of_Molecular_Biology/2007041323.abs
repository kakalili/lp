the egf like protein dlk inhibits notch signaling and potentiates adipogenesis of mesenchymal cells
the egf like homeotic gene dlk appears to function as an inhibitor of adipogenesis overexpression of dlk prevents adipogenesis of t l cells dlk deficient mice are obese however adipose tissue still develops in fc dlk transgenic mice suggesting that dlk is not a strict inhibitor of adipogenesis to clarify the role of dlk in adipogenesis we studied whether dlk could act differently on this process depending upon the differentiation state of the precursor cells we found that dlk is a potentiator of adipogenesis for mesenchymal c h t  cells this potentiating effect can be triggered by overexpressing the entire protein or the extracellular egf like containing region but not by overexpressing the intracellular dlk sequence in addition coculture of c h t  cells with other cells expressing dlk  but not with cells lacking dlk expression enhances their adipogenic response potentiation of adipogenesis by dlk was associated with changes in the activation of erk  after igfi insulin induction finally as reported with other cells dlk functioned as a notch signaling inhibitor in c h t  cells but inhibition of notch expression prevented the potentiating effects of dlk in adipogenesis these data suggest that dlk may potentiate or inhibit adipogenesis depending upon the cellular context and that notch expression and activation are important factors in this context
