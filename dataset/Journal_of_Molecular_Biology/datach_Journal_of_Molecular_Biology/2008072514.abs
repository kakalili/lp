cobalt and the iron acquisition pathway competition towards interaction with receptor
during iron acquisition by the cell complete homodimeric transferrin receptor  in an unknown state r  binds iron loaded human serum apotransferrin in an unknown state t and allows its internalization in the cytoplasm t also forms complexes with metals other than iron are these metals incorporated by the iron acquisition pathway and how can other proteins interact with r  we report here a four step mechanism for cobalt iii transfer from contaco   to t and analyze the interaction of cobalt loaded transferrin with r  the first step in cobalt uptake by t is a fast transfer of co  and co   from contaco   to the metal binding site in the c lobe of t direct rate constant k          m   s   reverse rate constant k           m   s   and equilibrium constant k      this step is followed by a proton assisted conformational change of the c lobe direct rate constant k         m   s   reverse rate constant k             s   and equilibrium constant k a      nm the two final steps are slow changes in the conformation of the protein    h and   h  which allow it to achieve its final thermodynamic state and also to acquire second cobalt the cobalt saturated transferrin in an unknown state tco  interacts with r in two different steps the first is an ultra fast interaction of the c lobe of tco with the helical domain of r  direct rate constant k          m   s   reverse rate constant k           s   and dissociation constant k d        m the second is a very slow interaction of the n lobe of tco with the protease like domain of r  this increases the stability of the protein  protein adduct by  fold with an average overall dissociation constant kd     nm the main trigger in the r mediated iron acquisition is the ultra fast interaction of the metal loaded c lobe of t with r  this step is much faster than endocytosis which in turn is much faster than the interaction of the n lobe of t with the protease like domain this can explain why other metal loaded transferrins or a protein such as hfe  with a lower affinity for r than iron saturated transferrin but with however similar or higher affinities for the helical domain than the c lobe  competes with iron saturated transferrin in an unknown state towards interaction with r
