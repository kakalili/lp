transmission electron microscopy reveals an optimal hiv  nucleocapsid aggregation with single stranded nucleic acids and the mature hiv  nucleocapsid protein
hiv  nucleocapsid protein ncp  condenses the viral rna within the mature capsid in a capsid free system ncp promotes an efficient mechanism of aggregation with both rna and dna here we show an analysis of these macromolecular complexes by dark field imaging using transmission electron microscopy thousands of mature ncp proteins co aggregate with hundreds of single stranded circular dna molecules ssdna within minutes as observed with poly ra  these co aggregates are highly stable but dynamic structures as they dissociate under harsh conditions and after addition of potent ssdna or ncp competitive ligands the n terminal domain and zinc fingers of ncp are both required for efficient association addition of magnesium slightly increases the avidity of ncp for ssdna while it strongly inhibits co aggregation with relaxed circular double stranded dna dsdna  this dna selectivity is restricted to mature ncp  compared to its precursors ncp  and ncp  moreover for ncp  the linkage of ncp with the gag c terminal p peptide provokes a deficiency in ssdna aggregation but results in dna spreading similar to prototypical ssb proteins finally this co aggregation is discussed in a dynamic architectural context with regard to the mature hiv  nucleocapsid on the basis of the present data we propose that condensation of encapsidated rna requires the c terminal processing of ncp subsequently disassembly of the nucleocapsid should be favoured once dsdna is produced by hiv  reverse transcriptase
