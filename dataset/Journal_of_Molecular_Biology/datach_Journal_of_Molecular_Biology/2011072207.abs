sprouty regulates pi   p ca  signaling and hiv  gag release
we reported recently that activation of the inositol    triphosphate receptor ip r is required for efficient hiv  gag trafficking and viral particle release ip r activation requires phospholipase c plc catalyzed hydrolysis of pi   p to ip and diacylglycerol we show that sprouty  spry  which binds pi   p and plc  interfered with pi   p in a manner similar to that of u    an inhibitor of pi   p hydrolysis suggesting that spry negatively regulates ip r by preventing formation of its activating ligand ip  mutation to asp of r   a crucial determinant of pi   p binding in the c terminal domain of spry  prevented the interference indicating that binding to the phospholipid is required by contrast deletion of the plc  binding region or mutation of a critical tyr residue in the region did not prevent the interference but spry pi   p colocalization was not detected suggesting that plc binding is required for their stable association like u    spry over expression inhibited wild type gag release as virus like particles disrupting either binding determinant relieved the inhibition ip r mediated ca signaling in turn was found to influence spry subcellular distribution and erk a spry regulator our findings suggest that spry influences ip r function through control of pi   p and ip r influences spry function by controlling its distribution and erk activation
