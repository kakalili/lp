methylated dna causes a physical block to replication forks independently of damage signalling o methylguanine or dna single strand breaks and results in dna damage
even though dna alkylating agents have been used for many decades in the treatment of cancer it remains unclear what happens when replication forks encounter alkylated dna here we used the dna fibre assay to study the impact of alkylating agents on replication fork progression we found that the alkylator methyl methanesulfonate mms inhibits replication elongation in a manner that is dose dependent and related to the overall alkylation grade replication forks seem to be completely blocked as no nucleotide incorporation can be detected following  h of mms treatment a high dose of  mm caffeine inhibiting most dna damage signalling decreases replication rates overall but does not reverse mms induced replication inhibition showing that the replication block is independent of dna damage signalling furthermore the block of replication fork progression does not correlate with the level of dna single strand breaks overexpression of o methylguanine o meg dna methyltransferase protein responsible for removing the most toxic alkylation o meg did not affect replication elongation following exposure to n methyl n  nitro n nitrosoguanidine this demonstrates that o meg lesions are efficiently bypassed in mammalian cells in addition we find that mms induced  h ax foci co localise with  bp foci and newly replicated areas suggesting that dna double strand breaks are formed at mms blocked replication forks altogether our data suggest that n alkylations formed during exposure to alkylating agents physically block replication fork elongation in mammalian cells causing formation of replication associated dna lesions likely double strand breaks
