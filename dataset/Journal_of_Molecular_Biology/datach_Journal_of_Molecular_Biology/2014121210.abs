lysophospholipid containing membranes modulate the fibril formation of the repeat domain of a human functional amyloid pmel
pmel  is an important protein for pigmentation in human skin and eyes proteolytic fragments from pmel  form fibrils upon which melanin is deposited in melanosomes the repeat domain rpt derived from pmel  only forms fibrils under acidic melanosomal conditions here we examined the effects of lipids on rpt aggregation to explore whether intramelanosomal vesicles can facilitate fibrillogenesis using transmission electron microscopy circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy we monitored fibril formation at the ultrastructural secondary conformational and local levels respectively phospholipid vesicles and lysophospholipid lysolipid micelles were employed as membrane mimics the surfactant like lysolipids are particularly pertinent due to their high content in melanosomal membranes interestingly rpt aggregation kinetics were influenced only by lysolipid containing phospholipid vesicles while both vesicles containing either anionic lysophosphatidylglycerol lpg or zwitterionic lysophosphatidylcholine lpc stimulate aggregation lpg exerted a greater effect on reducing the apparent nucleation time a detailed comparison showed distinct behaviors of lpg versus lpc monomers and micelles plausibly originating from their headgroup hydrogen bonding capabilities acceleration and retardation of aggregation were observed for lpg monomers and micelles respectively because a specific interaction between lpg and rpt was identified by intrinsic w  fluorescence and induced  helical structure it is inferred that binding of lpg near the c terminal amyloid core initiates intermolecular association whereas stabilization of  helical conformation inhibits  sheet formation contrastingly lpc promotes rpt aggregation at both submicellar and micellar concentrations via non specific binding with undetectable secondary structural change our findings suggest that protein  lysolipid interactions within melanosomes may regulate amyloid formation in vivo
