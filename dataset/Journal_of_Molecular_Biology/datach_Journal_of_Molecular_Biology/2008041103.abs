crystal structure of lsm octamer from saccharomyces cerevisiae implications for lsm ring organisation and recruitment
sm and sm like lsm proteins are core components of the ribonucleoprotein complexes essential to key nucleic acid processing events within the eukaryotic cell they assemble as polyprotein ring scaffolds that have the capacity to bind rna substrates and other necessary protein factors the crystal structure of yeast lsm reveals a new organisation of the l sm  propeller ring containing eight protein subunits little distortion of the characteristic l sm fold is required to form the octamer indicating that the eukaryotic lsm ring may be more pliable than previously thought the homomeric lsm octamer is found to successfully recruit lsm  lsm and lsm directly from yeast lysate our crystal structure shows the c terminal tail of each lsm subunit to be engaged in connections across rings through specific  sheet interactions with elongated loops protruding from neighbouring octamers while these loops are of distinct length for each lsm protein and generally comprise low complexity polar sequences several lsm c termini comprise hydrophobic sequences suitable for  sheet interactions the lsm structure thus provides evidence for protein  protein interactions likely utilised by the highly variable lsm loops and termini in the recruitment of rna processing factors to mixed lsm ring scaffolds our coordinates also provide updated homology models for the active lsm    and lsm    heptameric rings
