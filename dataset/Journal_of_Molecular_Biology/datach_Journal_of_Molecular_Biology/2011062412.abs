structural features and chaperone activity of the nudc protein family
the nudc family consists of four conserved proteins with representatives in all eukaryotes the archetypal nudc gene from aspergillus nidulans is a member of the nud gene family that is involved in the maintenance of nuclear migration this family also includes nudf whose human orthologue lis  codes for a protein essential for brain cortex development three paralogues of nudc are known in vertebrates nudc nudc like nudcl  and nudc like  nudcl  the fourth distantly related member of the family cml  contains a nudc like domain the three principal nudc proteins have no catalytic activity but appear to play as yet poorly defined roles in proliferating and dividing cells we present crystallographic and nmr studies of the human nudc protein and discuss the results in the context of structures recently deposited by structural genomics centers i e  nudcl and mouse nudcl  all proteins share the same core cs domain characteristic of proteins acting either as cochaperones of hsp  or as independent small heat shock proteins however while nudc and nudcl dimerize via an n terminally located coiled coil the smaller nudcl lacks this motif and instead dimerizes as a result of unique domain swapping we show that nudc and nudcl but not nudcl  inhibit the aggregation of several target proteins consistent with an hsp  independent heat shock protein function importantly and in contrast to several previous reports none of the three proteins is able to form binary complexes with lis  the availability of structural information will be of help in further studies on the cellular functions of the nudc family
