mutational studies uncover non native structure in the dimeric kinetic intermediate of the h a  h b heterodimer
the folding pathway of the histone h a  h b heterodimer minimally includes an on pathway dimeric burst phase intermediate i  the partially folded h a and h b monomers populated at equilibrium were characterized as potential monomeric kinetic intermediates folding kinetics were compared for initiation from isolated folded monomers and the heterodimer unfolded in  m urea the observed rates were virtually identical above   m urea exhibiting a log linear relationship on the final denaturant concentration below     m urea concentrations inaccessible from the   m urea unfolded state  a rollover in the rates was observed this suggests that a component of the i ensemble contains non native structure that rearranges isomerizes to a more native like species the contribution of helix propensity to the stability of the i ensemble was assessed with a set of h a  h b mutants containing ala and gly replacements at nine sites focusing mainly on the long central   helix equilibrium and kinetic folding unfolding data were collected to determine the effects of the mutations on the stability of i and the transition state between i and n  this limited mutational study indicated that residues in the   helices of h a and h b as well as   of h b and both the c terminus of   and the short  c helix of h a contribute to the stability of the i burst phase species interestingly at least eight of the nine targeted residues stabilize i by interactions that are non native to some extent given that destabilizing i and these non native interactions does not accelerate folding it is concluded that the native and non native structures present in the i ensemble enable efficient folding of h a  h b
