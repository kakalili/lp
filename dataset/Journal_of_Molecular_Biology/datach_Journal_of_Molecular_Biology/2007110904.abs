rz rz lysis gene equivalents in phages of gram negative hosts
under usual laboratory conditions lysis by bacteriophage  requires only the holin and endolysin genes but not the rz and rz genes of the lysis cassette defects in rz or rz block lysis only in the presence of high concentrations of divalent cations the  rz and rz lysis genes are remarkable in that rz  encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein is completely embedded in the  register within rz which itself encodes an integral inner membrane protein while rz and rz equivalents have been identified in t and p  most phages including such well studied classic phages as t  p  t  mu and sp  lack annotated rz rz equivalents here we report that a search strategy based primarily on gene arrangement and membrane localization signals rather than sequence similarity has revealed that rz rz equivalents are nearly ubiquitous among phages of gram negative hosts with   of   phages possessing genes that fit the search criteria in the case of t  a deletion of a non overlapping gene pair pset  and pset  identified as rz rz equivalents resulted in the same divalent cation dependent lysis phenotype remarkably in t and six other phages rz rz pairs were not found but a single gene encoding an outer membrane lipoprotein with a c terminal transmembrane domain capable of integration into the inner membrane was identified these proteins were named  spanins   since their protein products are predicted to span the periplasm providing a physical connection between the inner and outer membranes the t spanin gene was shown to complement the  rz  rz   lysis defect indicating that spanins function as rz rz equivalents the widespread presence of rz rz or their spanin equivalents in phages of gram negative hosts suggests a strong selective advantage and that their role in the ecology of these phages is greater than that inferred from the mild laboratory phenotype
