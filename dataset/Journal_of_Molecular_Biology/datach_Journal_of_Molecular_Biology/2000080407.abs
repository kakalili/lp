substitutions at the p   position in bpti strongly affect the association energy with serine proteinases edited by r huber
the role of the s   subsite in trypsin chymotrypsin and plasmin has been examined by measuring the association with seven different mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti  the mutants contain gly ala ser val leu arg and trp at the p   position of the reactive site the effects of substitutions at the p   position on the association constants are very large comprising seven orders of magnitude for trypsin and plasmin and over five orders for chymotrypsin all mutants showed a decrease of the association constant to the three proteinases in the same order ala gt gly gt ser gt arg gt val gt leu gt trp calorimetric and circular dichroism methods showed that none of the p   substitutions except the p   val mutant lead to destabilisation of the binding loop conformation the x ray structure of the complex formed between bovine  trypsin and p   leu bpti showed that the p   leu sterically conflicts with the side chain of p   ile which thereby is forced to rotate approximately    ile  p   in its new orientation in turn interacts with the tyr  side chain of trypsin introduction of a large side chain at the p   position apparently leads to a cascade of small alterations of the trypsin bpti interface that seem to destabilise the complex by it adopting a less optimized packing and by tilting the bpti molecule up to   compared to the native trypsin bpti complex
