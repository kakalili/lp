cyanide peroxide and nitric oxide formation in solutions of hydroxyurea causes cellular toxicity and may contribute to its therapeutic potency
hydroxyurea hu is a potent remedy against a variety of ailments and an efficient inhibitor of dna synthesis yet its pharmacology is unclear hu acts in escherichia coli by the same mechanism as it does in eukaryotes via inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase when examining a controversy about concentrations of hu that prevent thymineless death in e coli we found instability in hu solutions that avoided prior detection due to its peculiar nature in contrast to freshly dissolved hu which did not affect respiration and was bacteriostatic  day old hu solutions inhibited respiration and were immediately bactericidal respiration was inhibited by two gases hydrogen cyanide hcn and nitric oxide no  whose appearance we detected in  aged  hu stocks by gas chromatography  mass spectrometry however neither gas was bactericidal while determining the cause of toxicity we found that hu damages dna directly we also demonstrated accumulation of peroxides in hu solutions by enzymatic assays which explains the toxicity as both no and hcn are known to kill bacteria when combined with hydrogen peroxide remarkably we found that bactericidal effects of no h o and hcn h o mixtures were further synergistic accumulation of decomposition products in solutions of hu may explain the broad therapeutic effects of this drug
