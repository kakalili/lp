molecular dynamics simulation of the sh domain aggregation suggests a generic amyloidogenesis mechanism
we use molecular dynamics simulation to study the aggregation of src sh domain proteins for the case of two proteins we observe two possible aggregation conformations the closed form dimer and the open aggregation state the closed dimer is formed by  domain swapping   the two proteins exchange their rt loops all the hydrophobic residues are buried inside the dimer so proteins cannot further aggregate into elongated amyloid fibrils we find that the open structure  stabilized by backbone hydrogen bond interactions  packs the rt loops together by swapping the two strands of the rt loop the packed rt loops form a  sheet structure and expose the backbone to promote further aggregation we also simulate more than two proteins and find that the aggregate adopts a fibrillar double  sheet structure which is formed by packing the rt loops from different proteins our simulations are consistent with a possible generic amyloidogenesis scenario
