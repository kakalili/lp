structural model of human endoglin a transmembrane receptor responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
endoglin is a type i membrane protein expressed as a disulphide linked homodimer on human vascular endothelial cells whose haploinsufficiency is responsible for the dominant vascular dysplasia known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia hht  structurally endoglin belongs to the zona pellucida zp family of proteins that share a zp domain of    amino acid residues at their extracellular region endoglin is a component of the tgf  receptor complex interacts with the tgf  signalling receptors types i and ii and modulates cellular responses to tgf   here we have determined for the first time the three dimensional structure of the     kda extracellular domain of endoglin at    resolution using single particle electron microscopy em  this reconstruction provides the general architecture of endoglin which arranges as a dome made of antiparallel oriented monomers enclosing a cavity at one end a high resolution structure of endoglin has also been modelled de novo and found to be consistent with the experimental reconstruction each subunit comprises three well defined domains two of them corresponding to zp regions organised into an open u shaped monomer this domain arrangement was found to closely resemble the overall structure derived experimentally and the three modelled de novo domains were tentatively assigned to the domains observed in the em reconstruction this molecular model was further tested by tagging endoglin s c terminus with an igg fc fragment visible after d reconstruction of the labelled protein combined these data provide the structural framework to interpret endoglin s functional domains and mutations found in hht patients
