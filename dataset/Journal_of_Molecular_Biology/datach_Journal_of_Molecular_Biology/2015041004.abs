a first line of stress defense small heat shock proteins and their function in protein homeostasis
small heat shock proteins shsps are virtually ubiquitous molecular chaperones that can prevent the irreversible aggregation of denaturing proteins shsps complex with a variety of non native proteins in an atp independent manner and in the context of the stress response form a first line of defense against protein aggregation in order to maintain protein homeostasis in vertebrates they act to maintain the clarity of the eye lens and in humans shsp mutations are linked to myopathies and neuropathies although found in all domains of life shsps are quite diverse and have evolved independently in metazoans plants and fungi shsp monomers range in size from approximately  to  kda and are defined by a conserved  sandwich  crystallin domain flanked by variable n and c terminal sequences most shsps form large oligomeric ensembles with a broad distribution of different sphere or barrel like oligomers with the size and structure of the oligomers dictated by features of the n and c termini the activity of shsps is regulated by mechanisms that change the equilibrium distribution in tertiary features and or quaternary structure of the shsp ensembles cooperation and or co assembly between different shsps in the same cellular compartment add an underexplored level of complexity to shsp structure and function
