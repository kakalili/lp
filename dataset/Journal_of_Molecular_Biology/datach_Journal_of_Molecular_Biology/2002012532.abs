resistance to extinction of low fitness virus subjected to plaque to plaque transfers diversification by mutation clustering edited by j karn
plaque to plaque transfers of rna viruses lead to accumulation of mutations and fitness decrease to test whether continuing plaque to plaque transfers would lead to viral extinction we have subjected several low fitness foot and mouth disease virus fmdv clones to up to   successive plaque transfers and have analyzed the evolution of plaque titers and genomic nucleotide sequences no case of viral extinction could be documented some low fitness clones that posses an internal poly a tract evaded extinction by modifying the length or base composition of the poly a tract the comparison of entire genomic sequences of fmdv clones at increasing plaque transfer number revealed that mutations accumulated at a uniform rate and that they were distributed unevenly along the genome clusters of mutations were identified at different genomic sites in two plaque transfer lineages mutation clustering appears to occur stochastically and could not be related to fixation of compensatory mutations the results document resistance of viral clones to extinction and suggest that mutation clustering may be a mechanism of genetic diversification of low fitness virus
