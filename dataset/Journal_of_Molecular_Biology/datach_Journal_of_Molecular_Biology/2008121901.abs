thioredoxin  and its natural inhibitor vitamin d up regulated protein  are differentially regulated by ppar  in human macrophages
macrophage derived reactive oxygen species contribute to the initiation and development of atherosclerosis the cellular balance between oxidative and reductive states depends on the endogenous antioxidant capacity with the thioredoxin  trx  system playing a major role peroxisome proliferator activated receptor   ppar  is expressed by human macrophages and exhibits anti inflammatory properties here we show that the selective ppar  activator gw  significantly increased the trx  mrna and protein expression in human macrophages as determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western immunoblotting consistently the trx  activity was significantly increased by ppar  activation by contrast ppar  activation led to the down regulation of vitamin d up regulated protein  vdup   the physiological inhibitor of trx  analysis of the trx  and vdup  promoters with gene reporter assays mutational analysis gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses revealed the presence of a functional response element specific for ppar  in the trx  promoter and the presence of a functional activator protein  ap  site in the vdup  promoter the interference of ppar  retinoid x receptor  with the ap  transcription factor elements c jun c fos resulted in the inhibition of ap  binding and down regulation of the vdup  gene expression finally ppar  activation reduced the lidocaine induced caspase  activity and apoptosis which might be due to the vdup  mediated regulation of the bax bcl  ratio together these data indicate that stimulation of ppar  in human macrophages might reduce arterial inflammation through differential regulation of the trx  and vdup  gene expression
