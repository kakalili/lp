Processive motility of individual molecules is essential for the function of many kinesin motors. Processivity for kinesins relies on communication between the two heads of a dimeric molecule, such that binding strictly alternates. The main communicating elements are believed to be the two neck linkers connecting the motors' stalks and heads. A proposed mechanism for coordination is the transmission of stress through the neck linkers. It is believed that the efficiency of gating depends on the length of the neck linker. Recent studies have presented support for a simple model in which the length of the neck linker directly controls the degree of processivity. Based on a previously published Kinesin-1/Kinesin-5 chimera, Eg5Kin, we have analyzed the motility of 12 motor constructs: we have varied the length of the neck linker in the range between 9 and 21 amino acids using the corresponding native Kinesin-5 sequence (Xenopus laevis Eg5). We found, surprisingly, that neither velocity nor force generation depended on neck-linker length. We also found that constructs with short neck linkers, down to 12 amino acids, were still highly processive, while processivity was lost at a length of 9 amino acids. Run lengths were maximal with neck linkers close to the native Kinesin-5 length and decreased beyond that length. This finding generally confirms the coordinating role of the neck linker for kinesin motility but challenges the simplest model postulating a motor-type‚Äêindependent optimal length. Instead, our results suggest that different kinesins might be optimized for different neck-linker lengths.
