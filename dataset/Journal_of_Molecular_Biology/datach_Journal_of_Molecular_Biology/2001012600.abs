occurrence of two architectural types of hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin in annelids comparison of d reconstruction volumes of arenicola marina and lumbricus terrestris hemoglobins edited by m f moody
a d reconstruction at    resolution of native hemoglobin of the polychaete worm arenicola marina was carried out from frozen hydrated specimens examined in the electron microscope the reconstruction volume of this large extracellular multimeric respiratory pigment appears as a hexagonal bilayer structure with eclipsed vertices in its upper and lower hexagonal layers conversely in hemoglobins of oligochaetes achaetes and vestimentiferans and in chlorocruorins of the sabellidae polychaete family the vertices of the upper layer are   clockwise rotated with respect to those of the lower layer the fact that two other polychaete hemoglobins alvinella pompejana and tylorrhynchus heterochaetus have the same architecture as arenicola led us to define two types of hexagonal bilayer hemoglobins chlorocruorins  i type i present in oligochaete achaete and vestimentiferan hemoglobins and in sabellidae chlorocruorins and ii type ii present in polychaete hemoglobins a comparative study of the hemoglobins of lumbricus terrestris type i and arenicola marina type ii showed that only two small differences located in the c and c linking units are responsible of the important architectural difference present in oligomers a likely scheme proposed to explain the phylogenic distribution of the two types suggests that clitellata sabellida polychaete  and vestimentiferan hemoglobins and chlorocruorins derive from a type i ancestral molecule while terebellida alvinella  phyllodocida tylorrhynchus  and scolecida arenicola and possibly other polychaetes derive from an ancestor molecule with type ii hemoglobin the architectures of the hollow globular substructures are highly similar in arenicola and lumbricus hemoglobins with  globin chains and three linking units c a c b and c  the central piece of arenicola hemoglobin is an ellipsoid while that of lumbricus is a toroid no phylogenic correlation could be found between the structure of the central pieces and the architecture type
