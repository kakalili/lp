evidence for helical unwinding of an rna substrate by the rna enzyme rnase p use of an interstrand disulfide crosslink in substrate edited by k nagai
to gain an understanding of structural changes induced in substrates by escherichia coli ribonuclease p rnase p  we have incorporated an interstrand disulfide crosslink proximal to the cleavage site in a model substrate rnase p is able to process the reduced non crosslinked form of this substrate as well as a substrate in which the free thiol molecules have been alkylated with iodoacetamide however the oxidized crosslinked form is cleaved at a significantly lower rate therefore helical unwinding of the analog of the aminoacyl stem of the substrate near its site of cleavage may be necessary for efficient processing by e coli rnase p
