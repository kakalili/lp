characterization of the head to tail overlap complexes formed by human lamin a b and b   half minilamin  dimers
half minilamins representing amino and carboxy terminal fragments of human lamins a b and b with a truncated central rod domain were investigated for their ability to form distinct head to tail type dimer complexes this mode of interaction represents an essential step in the longitudinal assembly reaction exhibited by full length lamin dimers as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation the amino terminal fragments were soluble under low ionic strength conditions sedimenting with distinct profiles and s values       s indicating the formation of coiled coil dimers the smaller carboxy terminal fragments were except for lamin b  largely insoluble under these conditions however after equimolar amounts of homotypic amino and carboxy terminal lamin fragments had been mixed in  m urea upon subsequent renaturation the carboxy terminal fragments were completely rescued from precipitation and distinct soluble complexes with higher s values       s were obtained from this behavior we conclude that the amino and carboxy terminal coiled coil dimers interact to form distinct oligomers i e tetramers  furthermore a corresponding interaction occurred also between heterotypic pairs of a and b type lamin fragments hence a type lamin dimers may interact with b type lamin dimers head to tail to yield linear polymers these findings indicate that a lamin dimer principally has the freedom for a  combinatorial  head to tail association with all types of lamins a property that might be of significant importance for the assembly of the nuclear lamina furthermore we suggest that the head to tail interaction of the rod end domains represents a principal step in the assembly of cytoplasmic intermediate filament proteins too
