defining the bacillus subtilis  w regulon a comparative analysis of promoter consensus search run off transcription macroarray analysis roma  and transcriptional profiling approaches edited by m gottesman
the bacillus subtilis extracytoplasmic function ecf   factor  w controls a large regulon that is strongly induced by alkali shock to define the physiological role of  w we have sought to identify the complete set of genes under  w control previously we described a promoter consensus search procedure to identify  w controlled genes herein we introduce a novel method to identify additional target promoters run off transcription followed by macroarray analysis roma  we compare the resulting list of targets with those identified in conventional transcriptional profiling studies and using the consensus search approach while transcriptional profiling identifies genes that are strongly dependent on  w for in vivo expression some  w dependent promoters are not detected due to the masking effects of other promoter elements overlapping recognition with other ecf  factors or both taken together the consensus search roma and transcriptional profiling approaches establish a minimum of  promoter sites controlling    genes as direct targets for activation by  w significantly no single approach identifies more than     of the regulon so defined we therefore suggest that a combination of two or more complementary approaches be employed in studies seeking to achieve maximal coverage when defining bacterial regulons our results indicate that  w controls genes that protect the cell against agents that impair cell wall biosynthesis but fail to reveal any connection to operons likely to function in adaptation to alkaline growth conditions this is consistent with the observation that a sigw mutant is unaffected in its ability to survive alkali shock we conclude that in b subtilis sudden imposition of alkali stress activates the  w stress response perhaps by impairing the ability of the cell wall biosynthetic machinery to function
