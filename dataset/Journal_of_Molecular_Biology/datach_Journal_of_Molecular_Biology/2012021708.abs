crystal structure and regulation mechanisms of the cyab adenylyl cyclase from the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa
pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen and a major cause of healthcare associated infections while the organism s intrinsic and acquired resistance to most antibiotics hinders treatment of p aeruginosa infections the regulatory networks controlling its virulence provide novel targets for drug development cyab a key regulator of p aeruginosa virulence belongs to the class iii adenylyl cyclase ac family of enzymes that synthesize the second messenger cyclic adenosine      monophosphate these enzymes consist of a conserved catalytic domain fused to one or more regulatory domains we describe here the biochemical and structural characterization of cyab and its inhibition by small molecules we show that cyab belongs to the class iiib subfamily and like other subfamily members its activity is stimulated by inorganic carbon cyab is also regulated by its n terminal mase  membrane associated sensor  domain which acts as a membrane anchor using a genetic screen we identified activating mutations in cyab by solving the crystal structure of the cyab catalytic domain we rationalized the effects of these mutations and propose that cyab employs regulatory mechanisms similar to other class iii acs the cyab structure further indicates subtle differences compared to other class iii acs in both the active site and the inhibitor binding pocket consistent with these differences we observed a unique inhibition profile including identification of a cyab selective compound overall our results reveal mechanistic details of the physiological and pharmacological regulation of cyab and provide the basis for its exploitation as a therapeutic drug target
