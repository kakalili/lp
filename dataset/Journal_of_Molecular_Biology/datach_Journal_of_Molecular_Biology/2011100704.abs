dependent transcription pausing in escherichia coli
after promoter escape in escherichia coli the initiating   factor is retained by core rna polymerase rnap for at least tens of nucleotides while it is bound    can engage a repeat of a promoter dna element located downstream of the promoter and thereby induce a transcription pause the   dependent promoter proximal pause that occurs at all lambdoid phage late gene promoters is essential to regulation of the late gene operons several and possibly many e coli promoters have associated   dependent pauses clearly characterized   dependent pauses occur within  nucleotides of the start site but   dependent pausing might occur farther downstream as well in this review we summarize evidence for   dependent promoter proximal and promoter distal pausing and we discuss its potential regulatory function and mechanistic basis
