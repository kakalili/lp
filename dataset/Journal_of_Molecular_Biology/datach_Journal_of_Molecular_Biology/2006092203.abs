folding landscapes of the alzheimer amyloid      peptide
the energy landscape for folding of the    fragment of the alzheimer amyloid   a  peptide is characterized using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an all atom peptide model and explicit solvent at physiological temperatures the peptide exists mostly as a collapsed random coil populating a small fraction less than   of hairpins with a  turn at position v f  with another   of hairpin like conformations possessing a bend rather than a turn in the central vffa positions a small fraction of the populated states     adopt polyproline ii ppii conformations folding of the structured hairpin states proceeds through the assembly of two locally stable segments vffae and edvgs the interactions stabilizing these locally folded structural motifs are in conflict with those stabilizing the global fold of a    a signature of underlying residual frustration in this peptide at increased temperature the population of both  strand and ppii conformations diminishes in favor of  turn and random coil states on the basis of the conformational preferences of a     monomers two models for the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils formed by this peptide are proposed
