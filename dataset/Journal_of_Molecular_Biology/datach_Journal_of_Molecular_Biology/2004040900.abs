conformational differences among solution structures of the type i  ii  and ii  protein kinase a regulatory subunit homodimers role of the linker regions
the regulatory r subunits of the camp dependent protein kinase protein kinase a or pka are multi domain proteins responsible for conferring camp dependence and localizing pka to specific subcellular locations there are four isoforms of the r subunit in mammals that are similar in molecular mass and domain organization but clearly serve different biological functions although high resolution structures are available for the camp binding domains and dimerization docking domains of two isoforms there are no high resolution structures of any of the intact r subunit homodimer isoforms the results of small angle x ray scattering studies presented here indicate that the ri  rii  and rii  homodimers differ markedly in overall shape despite extensive sequence homology and similar molecular masses the rii  and rii  homodimers have very extended rod like shapes whereas the ri  homodimer likely has a compact y shape based on a comparison of the r subunit sequences we predict that the linker regions are the likely cause of these large differences in shape among the isoforms in addition we show that camp binding does not cause large conformational changes in type i  or ii  r subunit homodimers suggesting that the activation of pka by camp involves only local conformational changes in the r subunits
