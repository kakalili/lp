crystal structure of the filamin n terminal region reveals a hinge between the actin binding and first repeat domains
the filamin proteins cross link f actin and interact with protein partners to integrate both extracellular and intracellular signalling events with the cytoskeleton and to provide mechanoprotection and sensing to cells the filamins are large flexible multi domain homodimers with the interactions between domains important for protein function the crystal structure of the n terminal region of filamin b containing the actin binding domain abd and the first filamin repeat fr  domain reveals an extended two domain conformation with no interaction between the abd and fr other than the connecting linker region the two flnb  structures in the crystallographic asymmetric unit exhibit differing relative domain orientations providing the first high resolution structural characterisation of a filamin inter domain conformational change the structure reveals a new hinge in the linker region between abd and fr that is ideally positioned to orient the abd for actin binding and adds to the previously described hinge regions hinge  between repeats  and   and hinge  repeats  and   providing an additional mechanism by which filamin can exhibit inter domain flexibility the extended structure with the absence of interactions between the domains implies that any conformational rearrangements required for actin binding by the abd as observed for homologous proteins can freely occur without being influenced by fr  the abd retains its previously observed compact conformation fr exhibits a filamin immunoglobulin like domain fold with a closed c  d  strand groove in contrast to filamin repeats that bind protein partners with this region of the domain surface
