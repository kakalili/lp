eif controls multiple steps in start codon recognition during eukaryotic translation initiation
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif  is a central mediator of start codon recognition dissociation of eif from the preinitiation complex pic allows release of phosphate from the g protein factor eif  triggering downstream events in initiation mutations that weaken binding of eif to the pic decrease the fidelity of start codon recognition sui  phenotype by allowing increased eif release at non aug codons consistent with this overexpression of these mutant proteins suppresses their sui  phenotypes here we have examined mutations at the penultimate residue of eif  g   that produce sui  phenotypes without increasing the rate of eif release we provide evidence that in addition to its role in gating phosphate release dissociation of eif triggers conversion from an open scanning competent state of the pic to a stable closed one we also show that eif antagonizes binding of eif to the complex and that key interactions of eif with its partners are modulated by the charge at and around g   our data indicate that eif plays multiple roles in start codon recognition and suggest that prior to aug recognition it prevents eif from binding to a key site in the pic required for triggering downstream events
