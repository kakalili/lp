crystal structure of an asymmetric complex of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase  with lipoyl domain  and its biological implications
a homodimer of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase pdhk is an integral part of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc to which it is anchored primarily through the inner lipoyl bearing domains l  of transacetylase component the catalytic cycle of pdhk and its translocation over the pdc surface is thought to be mediated by the  symmetric  and  asymmetric  modes in which the pdhk dimer binds to two and one l domain s  respectively whereas the structure of the symmetric pdhk l complex was reported the structural organization and functional role of the asymmetric complex remain obscure here we report the crystal structure of the asymmetric pdhk l complex that reveals several functionally important features absent from the previous structures first the pdhk subunits have distinct conformations one subunit exhibits  open  and the other  closed  configuration of the putative substrate binding cleft second access to the closed cleft is additionally restricted by local unwinding of the adjacent  helix modeling indicates that the target peptide might gain access to the pdhk active center through the open but not through the closed cleft third the atp binding loop in one pdhk subunit adopts an open conformation implying that the nucleotide loading into the active site is mediated by the inactive  pre insertion  binding mode altogether our data suggest that the asymmetric complex represents a physiological state in which binding of a single l domain activates one of the pdhk protomers while inactivating another thus the l domains likely act not only as the structural anchors but also modulate the catalytic cycle of pdhk
