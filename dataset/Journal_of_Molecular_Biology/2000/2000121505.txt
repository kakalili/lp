During the maturation of rotaviral particles, non-structural protein 4 (NSP4) plays a critical role in the translocation of the immature capsid into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Full-length NSP4 and a 22 amino acid peptide (NSP4114-135) derived from this protein have been shown to induce diarrhea in young mice in an age-dependent manner, and may therefore be the agent responsible for rotavirally-induced symptoms. We have determined the crystal structure of the oligomerization domain of NSP4 which spans residues 95 to 137 (NSP495-137). NSP495-137 self-associates into a parallel, tetrameric coiled-coil, with the hydrophobic core interrupted by three polar layers occupying a and d-heptad positions. Side-chains from two consecutive polar layers, consisting of four Gln123 and two of the four Glu120 residues, coordinate a divalent cation. Two independent structures built from MAD-phased data indicated the presence of a strontium and calcium ion bound at this site, respectively. This metal-binding site appears to play an important role in stabilizing the homo-tetramer, which has implications for the engagement of NSP4 as an enterotoxin.
