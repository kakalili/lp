stochastic switching in gene networks can occur by a single molecule event or many molecular steps
due to regulatory feedback biological networks can exist stably in multiple states leading to heterogeneous phenotypes among genetically identical cells random fluctuations in protein numbers tuned by specific molecular mechanisms have been hypothesized to drive transitions between these different states we develop a minimal theoretical framework to analyze the limits of switching in terms of simple experimental parameters our model identifies and distinguishes between two distinct molecular mechanisms for generating stochastic switches in one class of switches the stochasticity of a single molecule event a specific and rare molecular reaction directly controls the macroscopic change in a cell s state in the second class no individual molecular event is significant and stochasticity arises from the propagation of biochemical noise through many molecular pathways and steps as an example we explore switches based on protein  dna binding fluctuations and predict relations between transcription factor kinetics absolute switching rate robustness and efficiency that differentiate between switching by single molecule events or many molecular steps finally we apply our methods to recent experimental data on switching in escherichia coli lactose metabolism providing quantitative interpretations of a single molecule switching mechanism
