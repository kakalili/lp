rpa mediates recombination repair during replication stress and is displaced from dna by checkpoint signalling in human cells
the replication protein a rpa is involved in most if not all nuclear metabolism involving single stranded dna here we show that rpa is involved in genome maintenance at stalled replication forks by the homologous recombination repair system in humans depletion of the rpa protein inhibited the formation of rad  nuclear foci after hydroxyurea induced replication stalling leading to persistent unrepaired dna double strand breaks dsbs  we demonstrate a direct role of rpa in homology directed recombination repair we find that rpa is dispensable for checkpoint kinase  chk  activation and that rpa directly binds rad  upon replication stress suggesting a direct role in recombination repair in addition we show that inhibition of chk with ucn  decreases dissociation of rpa from the chromatin and inhibits association of rad  and rad  with dna altogether our data suggest a direct role of rpa in homologous recombination in assembly of the rad  and rad  proteins furthermore our data suggest that replacement of rpa with the rad  and rad  proteins is affected by checkpoint signalling
