dna distortion and specificity in a sequence specific endonuclease
five new structures of the q  f hincii enzyme bound to a total of three different dna sequences and three different metal ions ca  mg  and mn  are presented while previous structures were produced from soaking ca  into preformed q  f hincii dna crystals the new structures are derived from cocrystallization with ca  mg  or mn  the mn  bound structure provides the first view of a product complex of q  f hincii with cleaved dna binding studies and a crystal structure show how ca  allows trapping of a q  f hincii complex with noncognate dna in a catalytically incompetent conformation many q  f hincii dna structures show asymmetry despite the binding of a symmetric substrate by a symmetric enzyme the various complexes are fit into a model describing the different conformations of the dna bound enzyme and show how dna conformational energetics determine dna cleavage rates by the q  f hincii enzyme
