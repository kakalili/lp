molecular basis of guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity of human neuroglobin by chemical cross linking and mass spectrometry
oxidized human neuroglobin ngb  a heme protein expressed in the brain has been proposed to act as a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor gdi for the gdp bound form of the heterotrimeric g protein  subunit g i  here to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the gdi activity of ngb we used an glutathione s transferase pull down assay to confirm that ngb competes with g protein   subunits g   for binding to g i and identified the g i binding site in ngb by chemical cross linking with  ethyl   dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride and sulfo n hydroxysuccinimide coupled with mass spectrometry ms  matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight maldi tof ms analysis for tryptic peptides derived from the cross linked ngb g i complex revealed several binding regions in ngb furthermore maldi tof tof ms analysis of the cross linked ngb and g i peptides together with the ms ms scoring method predicted cross linking between glu  ngb and ser   g i  and between glu  ngb and ser  g i  because ser  of g i is located in the region that contacts g   binding of ngb could facilitate the release of g   from g i binding of ngb to g i would also inhibit the exchange of gdp for gtp because ser  g i is adjacent to the gdp binding site and glu  ngb  which is cross linked to ser  g i  could be located close to gdp thus we have identified for the first time the sites of interaction between ngb and g i enabling us to discuss the functional significance of this binding on the gdi activity of ngb
