Tetanus neurotoxin binds via its carboxyl-terminal HC-fragment selectively to neurons mediated by complex gangliosides. We investigated the lactose and sialic acid binding pockets of four recently discovered potential binding sites employing site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of residues in the lactose binding pocket drastically decreased the binding of the HC-fragment to immobilized gangliosides and to rat brain synaptosomes as well as the inhibitory action of recombinant full length tetanus neurotoxin on exocytosis at peripheral nerves. The conserved motif of S1287XWY1290â€¦G1300 assisted by N1219, D1222, and H1271 within the lactose binding site comprises a typical sugar binding pocket, as also present, for example, in cholera toxin. Replacement of the main residue of the sialic acid binding site, R1226, again caused a dramatic decline in binding affinity and neurotoxicity. Since the structural integrity of the HC-fragment mutants was verified by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy, these data provide the first biochemical evidence that two carbohydrate interaction sites participate in the binding and uptake process of tetanus neurotoxin. The simultaneous binding of one ganglioside molecule to each of the two binding sites was demonstrated by mass spectroscopy studies, whereas ganglioside-mediated linkage of native tetanus neurotoxin molecules was ruled out by size exclusion chromatography. Hence, a subsequent displacement of one ganglioside by a glycoprotein receptor is discussed.
