a novel heme and peroxide dependent tryptophan  tyrosine cross link in a mutant of cytochrome c peroxidase
the crystal structure of a cytochrome c peroxidase mutant where the distal catalytic his  is converted to tyr reveals that the tyrosine side chain forms a covalent bond with the indole ring nitrogen atom of trp  we hypothesize that this novel bond results from peroxide activation by the heme iron followed by oxidation of trp  and tyr  this hypothesis has been tested by incorporation of a redox inactive zn protoporphyrin into the protein and the resulting crystal structure shows the absence of a trp   tyr  cross link instead the tyr  side chain orients away from the heme active site pocket which requires a substantial rearrangement of residues     and      additional experiments where heme containing crystals of the mutant were treated with peroxide support our hypothesis that this novel trp  tyr cross link is a peroxide dependent process mediated by the heme iron
