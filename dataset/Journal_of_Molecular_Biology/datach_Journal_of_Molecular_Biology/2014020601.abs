structural and functional analysis of human sirt
sirt is a nad dependent deacetylase that plays important roles in many cellular processes sirt activity is uniquely controlled by a c terminal regulatory segment ctr  here we present crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human sirt in complex with the ctr in an open apo form and a closed conformation in complex with a cofactor and a pseudo substrate peptide the catalytic domain adopts the canonical sirtuin fold the ctr forms a  hairpin structure that complements the  sheet of the nad binding domain covering an essentially invariant hydrophobic surface the apo form adopts a distinct open conformation in which the smaller subdomain of sirt undergoes a rotation with respect to the larger nad binding subdomain a biochemical analysis identifies key residues in the active site an inhibitory role for the ctr and distinct structural features of the ctr that mediate binding and inhibition of the sirt catalytic domain
