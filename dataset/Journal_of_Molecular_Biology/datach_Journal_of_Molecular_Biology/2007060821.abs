understanding the isomerization of the hiv  dimerization initiation domain by the nucleocapsid protein
the specific binding of hiv  nucleocapsid nc to the hinge region of the kissing loop kl dimer formed by stemloop  sl  can have significant consequences on its ability to isomerize into the corresponding extended duplex ed form the binding determinants and the effects on the isomerization process were investigated in vitro by a concerted strategy involving ad hoc rna mutants and electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance esi fticr mass spectrometry which enabled us to characterize the stoichiometry and conformational state of all possible protein rna and rna rna assemblies present simultaneously in solution for the first time nc  hinge interactions were observed in constructs including at least one unpaired guanine at the   end of the loop loop duplex whereas no interactions were detected when the unpaired guanine was placed at its   end this binding mode is supported by the presence of a grip like motif described by recent crystal structures which is formed by the   purines of both hairpins held together by mutual stacking interactions using tandem mass spectrometry hinge interactions were clearly shown to reduce the efficiency of kl ed isomerization without inducing its complete block this outcome is consistent with the partial stabilization of the extra helical grip by the bound protein which can hamper the purine components from parting ways and initiate the strand exchange process these findings confirm that the broad binding and chaperone activities of nc induce unique effects that are clearly dependent on the structural context of the cognate nucleic acid substrate for this reason the presence of multiple binding sites on the different forms assumed by sl can produce seemingly contrasting effects that contribute to a fine modulation of the two step process of rna dimerization and isomerization
