the foldon substructure of staphylococcal nuclease
to search for submolecular foldon units the spontaneous reversible unfolding and refolding of staphylococcal nuclease under native conditions was studied by a kinetic native state hydrogen exchange hx method as for other proteins it appears that staphylococcal nuclease is designed as an assembly of well integrated foldon units that may define steps in its folding pathway and may regulate some other functional properties the hx results identify  amide hydrogens that exchange with solvent hydrogens under native conditions by way of large transient unfolding reactions the hx data for each hydrogen measure the equilibrium stability  ghx and the kinetic unfolding and refolding rates kop and kcl of the unfolding reaction that exposes it to exchange these parameters separate the  identified residues into three distinct hx groupings two correspond to clearly defined structural units in the native protein termed the blue and red foldons the remaining hx grouping contains residues not well separated by their hx parameters alone that represent two other distinct structural units in the native protein termed the green and yellow foldons among these four sets a last unfolding foldon blue unfolds with a rate constant of      s   and free energy equal to the protein s global stability    kcal mol  it represents part of the  barrel including mutually h bonding residues in the   and   strands a part of the   strand that h bonds to   and residues at the n terminus of the   helix that is capped by   a second foldon green  which unfolds and refolds more rapidly and at slightly lower free energy includes residues that define the rest of the native   helix and its c terminal cap a third foldon yellow defines the mutually h bonded         meander completing the native  barrel plus an adjacent part of the   helix a final foldon red includes residues on remaining segments that are distant in sequence but nearly adjacent in the native protein although the structure of the partially unfolded forms closely mimics the native organization four residues indicate the presence of some nonnative misfolding interactions because the unfolding parameters of many other residues are not determined it seems likely that the concerted foldon units are more extensive than is shown by the  residues actually observed
