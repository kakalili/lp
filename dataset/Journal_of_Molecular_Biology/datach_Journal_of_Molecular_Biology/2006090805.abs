the signaling pathway in histidine kinase and the response regulator complex revealed by x ray crystallography and solution scattering
the structure of a histidine kinase thka complexed with a response regulator trra in the two component regulatory system from hyperthermophile thermotoga maritima was determined by a combination of x ray crystallography at a resolution of     and small angle x ray scattering saxs  the boundary of the three component domains pas sensor dimerization and catalytic domains of thka and the bound trra molecule were unambiguously assigned in the electron density map at     resolution thka forms a dimer with crystallographic  fold symmetry and two monomeric trras bind to the thka dimer saxs experiments also confirmed this association state in solution and specific binding between thka and trra kd      m   the association interface between thka and trra contains the phosphotransfer his residue in the thka indicative of an efficient receipt of the phosphoryl group one per arnt sim pas domain does not interact with the other pas domain but with the catalytic domain of the same polypeptide chain and with one trra molecule observed inter domain and inter molecular interactions reveal a definite pathway of signal transduction in the kinase regulator complex in addition we propose a responsible role of trra for the feedback regulation of sensing and or kinase activities of thka
