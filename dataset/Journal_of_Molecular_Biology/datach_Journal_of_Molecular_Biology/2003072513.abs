parallel pathways in cytochrome c  folding
the folding of cytochrome c  from pseudomonas aeruginosa was previously thought to follow a simple sequential mechanism consistent with the lack of histidine residues other than the native his  heme ligand that can give rise to mis coordinated species however further kinetic analysis reveals complexities indicative of a folding mechanism involving parallel pathways double jump interrupted refolding experiments at low ph indicate that    of the unfolded cytochrome c  population can reach the native state via a fast   ms folding track while the rest follows a slower folding path with populated intermediates stopped flow experiments using absorbance at   nm to monitor refolding confirm the presence of a rapidly folding species containing the native methionine iron bond while measurements on carboxymethylated cytochrome c   which lacks the met  fe coordination bond indicate that methionine ligation occurs late during folding along the fast folding track which appears to be dominant at physiological ph continuous flow measurements of tryptophan heme energy transfer using a capillary mixer with a dead time of about   s show evidence for a rapid chain collapse within    s preceding the rate limiting folding phase on the milliseconds time scale a third process with a time constant in the     ms time range is consistent with a minor population of molecules folding along a parallel channel as confirmed by quantitative kinetic modeling these findings indicate the presence of two or more slowly inter converting ensembles of denatured states that give rise to ph dependent partitioning among fast and slow folding pathways
