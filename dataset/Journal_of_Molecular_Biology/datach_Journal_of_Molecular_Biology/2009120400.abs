identification of a function specific mutation of clathrin heavy chain chc required for p  transactivation
the p  pathway is activated in response to various cellular stresses to protect cells from malignant transformation we have previously shown that clathrin heavy chain chc  which is a cytosolic protein regulating endocytosis is present in nuclei and binds to p  to promote p  mediated transcription however details of the binding interface between p  and chc remain unclear here we report on the binding mode between p  and chc using mutation analyses and a structural model of the interaction generated by molecular dynamics structural modeling analyses predict that an asn   residue in chc is crucial for binding to p  in fact substitution of this asn to ala of chc diminished its ability to interact with p  leading to reduced activity to transactivate p  surprisingly this mutation had little effect on receptor mediated endocytosis thus the function specific mutation of chc will clarify physiological roles of chc in the regulation of the p  pathway
