molecular basis for complement recognition and inhibition determined by crystallographic studies of the staphylococcal complement inhibitor scin bound to c c and c b
the human complement system plays an essential role in innate and adaptive immunity by marking and eliminating microbial intruders activation of complement on foreign surfaces results in proteolytic cleavage of complement component  c  into the potent opsonin c b which triggers a variety of immune responses and participates in a self amplification loop mediated by a multi protein assembly known as the c convertase the human pathogen staphylococcus aureus has evolved a sophisticated and potent complement evasion strategy which is predicated upon an arsenal of potent inhibitory proteins one of these the staphylococcal complement inhibitor scin  acts at the level of the c convertase c bbb and impairs downstream complement function by trapping the convertase in a stable but inactive state previously we have shown that scin binds c b directly and competitively inhibits binding of human factor h and to a lesser degree that of factor b to c b here we report the co crystal structures of scin bound to c b and c c at   and     limiting resolution respectively and show that scin binds a critical functional area on c b most significantly the scin binding site sterically occludes the binding sites of both factor h and factor b our results give insight into scin binding to activated derivatives of c  explain how scin can recognize c b in the absence of other complement components and provide a structural basis for the competitive c b binding properties of scin in the future this may suggest templates for the design of novel complement inhibitors based upon the scin structure
