osmolyte trimethylamine n oxide converts recombinant  helical prion protein to its soluble  structured form at high temperature
the thermal unfolding of full length human recombinant  helical prion protein   prp in neutral ph is reversible whereas in the presence of the osmolyte n trimethylamine oxide tmao  the protein acquires a  sheet structure at higher temperatures and the thermal unfolding of the protein is irreversible lysozyme an amyloidogenic protein similar to prion protein regains  helical structure on cooling from its thermally unfolded form in buffer and in tmao solutions the thermal stability of  prp decreases whereas that of lysozyme increases in tmao solution light scattering and turbidity values indicate that  sheet prion protein exists as soluble oligomers that increase thioflavin t fluorescence and bind to  anilino  naphthalene sulfonic acid ans  the oligomers are resistant to proteinase k digestion and during incubation for long periods they form linear amyloids gt   m long the comparable fluorescence polarization of the tryptophan groups and their accessibility to acrylamide in  prp and oligomers indicate that the unstructured n terminal segments of the protein which contain the tryptophan groups do not associate among themselves during oligomerization partial unfolding of  helical prion protein in tmao solution leads to its structural conversion to misfolded  sheet form the formation of the misfolded prion protein oligomers and their polymerization to amyloids in tmao are unusual since the osmolyte generally induces denatured protein to fold to a native like state and protects proteins from thermal denaturation and aggregation
