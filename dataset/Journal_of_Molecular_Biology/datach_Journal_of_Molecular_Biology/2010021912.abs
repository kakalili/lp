a single mutation at the sheet switch region results in conformational changes favoring   light chain fibrillogenesis
systemic amyloid light chain lc amyloidosis is a disease process characterized by the pathological deposition of monoclonal lcs in tissue all lc subtypes are capable of fibril formation although  chains particularly those belonging to the   type are overrepresented here we report the thermodynamic and in vitro fibrillogenic properties of several mutants of the   protein ajl in which pro and or his was substituted by ser or pro the h p and h s mutants were almost as stable as the wild type protein and were poorly fibrillogenic in contrast the p s mutation decreased the thermodynamic stability of ajl and greatly enhanced its capacity to form amyloid like fibrils in vitro the crystal structure of the p s mutant showed that the substitution induced both local and long distance effects such as the rearrangement of the vl variable region of the light chain  vl interface this mutant crystallized in two orthorhombic polymorphs p    and c   in the latter a monomer that was not arranged in the typical bence  jones dimer was observed for the first time crystal packing analysis of the c   lattice showed the establishment of intermolecular     interactions that involved the n terminus and  strand b and that these could be relevant in the mechanism of lc fibril formation our results strongly suggest that pro is a key residue in the conformation of the n terminal sheet switch motif and through long distance interactions is also critically involved in the contacts that stabilized the vl interface in   lcs
