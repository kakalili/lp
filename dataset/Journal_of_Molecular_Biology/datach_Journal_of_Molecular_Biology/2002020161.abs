base sequence specificity of hoechst    and dapi binding to five a t  dna sites with kinetic evidence for more than one high affinity hoechst    aatt complex edited by i tinoco
the binding of hoechst    and dapi to five different a t  sequences in a stable dna hairpin was studied exploiting the substantial increase in dye fluorescence upon binding the two dyes have comparable affinities for the aatt site e g association constant ka       m   for dapi  and their affinities decrease in the series aatt   taat   atat gt tata   ttaa the extreme values of ka differ by a factor of   for hoechst    but only  for dapi the binding kinetics of hoechst    were measured by stopped flow under pseudo first order conditions with an a t  site in excess the lower resolution experiments can be well represented by single exponential processes corresponding to a single step binding mechanism the calculated association rate parameters for the five a t  sites are similar       m   s   to       m   s   and nearly diffusion controlled while the dissociation rate parameters vary from   s   to  s   thus the association constants are kinetically controlled and are close to their equilibrium determined values however when obtained with increased signal to noise ratio the kinetic traces for hoechst    binding at the aatt site reveal two components the concentration dependencies of the two time constants and amplitudes are consistent with two different kinetically equivalent two step models in the first model fast bimolecular binding is followed by an isomerization of the initial complex in the second model two single step associations form two complexes that mutually exclude each other for both models the four reaction rate parameters are calculated finally specific dissociation kinetics using poly d a bru  show that the kinetics are even more complex than either two step model we correlate our results with the different binding orientations and locations of hoechst    in the dna minor groove found in several structural studies in the literature
