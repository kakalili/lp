upstream flanking sequences and transcription of sines edited by m gottesman
sines short interspersed repeated dna elements undergo amplification through retroposition and subsequent integration into a new location in the genome each new sine insertion will be located in a new chromosomal environment with different flanking sequences modulation of transcription by different flanking sequences may play an important role in determining which sine elements are preferentially active in a genome we evaluated the ability of upstream flanking sequences to regulate the transcription of three different sines alu b and id by constructing chimeric constructs with known   flanking sequences of rna polymerase iii transcribed genes upstream sequences from the sl rna gene u rna gene vault rna gene and bc gene increase transcription of alu b and bc in transient transfections of nih t  hela neuro a and c glioma cell lines the sl sequence proved most efficient in increasing sine transcription the sl upstream fused to the bc rna gene an id element was used to create a transgenic mouse line in contrast to the tissue specific endogenous bc transcription bc transgene transcripts were detected in all tissues tested however expression was much higher in those tissues that express the endogenous gene demonstrating both transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation the bc rna was detected in a similar ribonucleoprotein complex in the different tissues
