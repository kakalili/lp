the d arrangement of the  s and  s rrna in the escherichia coli  s ribosomal subunit based on a cryo electron microscopic reconstruction at    resolution edited by d e draper
the escherichia coli  s and  s rrna molecules have been fitted helix by helix to a cryo electron microscopic em reconstruction of the  s ribosomal subunit using an unfiltered version of the recently published  s reconstruction at    resolution at this resolution the em density shows a well defined network of fine structural elements in which the major and minor grooves of the rrna helices can be discerned at many locations the d folding of the rrna molecules within this em density is constrained by their well established secondary structures and further constraints are provided by intra and inter rrna crosslinking data as well as by tertiary interactions and pseudoknots rna protein cross link and foot print sites on the  s and  s rrna were used to position the rrna elements concerned in relation to the known arrangement of the ribosomal proteins as determined by immuno electron microscopy the published x ray or nmr structures of seven  s ribosomal proteins or rna protein complexes were incorporated into the em density the d locations of cross link and foot print sites to the  s rrna from trna bound to the ribosomal a p or e sites were correlated with the positions of the trna molecules directly observed in earlier reconstructions of the  s ribosome at    or    similarly the positions of cross link sites within the peptidyl transferase ring of the  s rrna from the aminoacyl residue of trna were correlated with the locations of the cca ends of the a and p site trna sites on the  s rrna that are cross linked to the n termini of peptides of different lengths were all found to lie within or close to the internal tunnel connecting the peptidyl transferase region with the presumed peptide exit site on the solvent side of the  s subunit the post transcriptionally modified bases in the  s rrna form a cluster close to the peptidyl transferase area the minimum conserved core elements of the secondary structure of the  s rrna form a compact block within the d structure and conversely the points corresponding to the locations of expansion segments in  s rrna all lie on the outside of the structure
