The possibility of obtaining, from any antibody, a fluorescent conjugate which responds to the binding of the antigen by a variation of fluorescence, would be of great interest in the micro- and nano-analytical sciences. This possibility was explored with antibody mAb4E11, which is directed against the dengue virus and for which no structural data is available. Three rules of design were developed to identify residues of the antibody to which a fluorophore could be chemically coupled, after changing them to cysteine by mutagenesis. (i) The target residue belonged to the hypervariable loops of the antibody. (ii) It was adjacent, along the amino acid sequence of the antibody, to a residue which was functionally important for the interaction with the antigen. (iii) It was not important in itself for the interaction with the antigen. Eight conjugates between a single chain variable fragment of mAb4E11 and an environment-sensitive fluorophore were constructed. Three of them showed an increase in their fluorescence intensity by 1.5â€“2.8-fold on antigen binding, without loss of affinity. This increase allowed the titration of the antigen in serum above a threshold concentration of 10nM. Experiments of quenching with potassium iodide suggested that the fluorescence variation was due to a shielding of the fluorescent group from the solvent by the binding of the antigen, and that therefore its mechanism is general.
