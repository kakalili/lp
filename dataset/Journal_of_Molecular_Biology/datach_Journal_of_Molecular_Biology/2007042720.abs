the ph dependence of the escherichia coli rnase hii catalysed reaction suggests that an active site carboxylate group participates directly in catalysis
rnase hii specifically catalyses the hydrolysis of phosphate diester linkages contained within the rna portion of dna rna hybrids the catalytic parameters of the enzyme derived from escherichia coli bl  have been measured using   fluorescent oligodeoxynucleotide substrates containing embedded ribonucleotides the products of the reaction and the chemistry of phosphate diester hydrolysis were assigned unequivocally using mass spectrometry the ph dependence of the catalytic parameters was measured under conditions of optimal magnesium ion concentration the logarithm of the turnover number of the enzyme increases steeply with ph until a ph independent region is reached close to neutrality the slope of the ph dependent region is  indicating that the catalytically proficient form of rnase hii is di anionic the ph dependence of log  km is a sigmoidal curve reaching a maximal value at higher ph suggesting deprotonation of a residue stabilises substrate binding possible mechanisms for the rnase hii catalysed reaction consistent with the ph dependent behaviour of the enzyme are discussed the active sites of rnase h enzymes contain a cluster of four strictly conserved carboxylate groups together the data suggest a requirement for ionisation of an active site carboxylic acid for metal ion binding or correct positioning of metal ion s in the enzyme  substrate complex and a role for a second active site carboxylate in general base catalysis
