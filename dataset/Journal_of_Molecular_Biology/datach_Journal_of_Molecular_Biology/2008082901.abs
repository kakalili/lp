characterization of human cytomegalovirus uracil dna glycosylase ul   and its interaction with polymerase processivity factor ul
here we report the molecular characterization of the human cytomegalovirus uracil dna glycosylase ung ul   purified ul  was shown to be a dna glycosylase which removes uracil from double stranded and single stranded dna however kinetic analysis has shown that viral ung removed uracil more slowly compared with the core form of human ung   hung  which has a catalytic efficiency kcat km    to   fold higher than that of ul   furthermore ul  showed a maximum level of dna glycosylase activity at equimolar concentrations of the viral polymerase processivity factor ul  next ul  was coprecipitated with dna immobilized to magnetic beads only in the presence of ul  suggesting that ul  facilitated the loading of ul  on dna moreover mutant analysis demonstrated that the c terminal part of ul  residues      is important for the interplay with ul   immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that ul  and ul  colocalized in numerous small punctuate foci at the immediate  early  and  hpi phases of infection and that these foci grew in size throughout the infection furthermore coimmunoprecipitation assays with cellular extracts of infected cells confirmed that ul  associated with ul   finally the nuclear concentration of ul  was estimated to be  to  fold higher than that of ul  in infected cells which indicated a ul  independent role of ul   in summary our data have demonstrated a catalytically inefficient viral ung that was highly enriched in viral replication foci thus supporting an important role of ul  in replication rather than repair of the viral genome
