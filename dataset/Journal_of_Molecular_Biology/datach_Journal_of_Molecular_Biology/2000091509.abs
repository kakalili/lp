crystal structures of mouse class ii alcohol dehydrogenase reveal determinants of substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency edited by j thornton
the structure of mouse class ii alcohol dehydrogenase adh  has been determined in a binary complex with the coenzyme nadh and in a ternary complex with both nadh and the inhibitor n cyclohexylformamide to    and    resolution respectively the adh dimer is asymmetric in the crystal with different orientations of the catalytic domains relative to the coenzyme binding domains in the two subunits resulting in a slightly different closure of the active site cleft both conformations are about half way between the open apo structure and the closed holo structure of horse adh  thus resembling that of adh  the semi open conformation and structural differences around the active site cleft contribute to a substantially different substrate binding pocket architecture as compared to other classes of alcohol dehydrogenase and provide the structural basis for recognition and selectivity of alcohols and quinones the active site cleft is more voluminous than that of adh but not as open and funnel shaped as that of adh  the loop with residues      from the coenzyme binding domain is short thus opening up the pocket towards the coenzyme on the opposite side the loop with residues      stretches out over the inter domain cleft a cavity is formed below this loop and adds an appendix to the substrate binding pocket asp  is positioned at the entrance of the pocket and may control the binding of  hydroxy fatty acids which act as inhibitors rather than substrates mouse adh is known as an inefficient adh with a slow hydrogen transfer step by replacing pro  with his the alcohol dehydrogenase activity is restored here the structure of this p h mutant was determined in complex with nadh to    resolution his  is suitably positioned to act as a catalytic base in the deprotonation of the substrate moreover in the more closed subunit the coenzyme is allowed a position closer to the catalytic zinc this is consistent with hydrogen transfer from an alcoholate intermediate where the pro his replacement focuses on the function of the enzyme
