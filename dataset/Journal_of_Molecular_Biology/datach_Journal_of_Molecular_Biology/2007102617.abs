the translational fidelity function of if during transition from the   s initiation complex to the   s initiation complex
if has a fidelity function in the initiation of translation inducing the dissociation of fmet trnafmet from the   s initiation complexes  sic containing a non canonical initiation triplet e g auu in place of a canonical initiation triplet e g  aug  if has a complementary role selectively promoting initiator trna binding to the ribosome here we used parallel rapid kinetics measurements of gtp hydrolysis pi release light scattering and changes in intensities of fluorophore labeled if and fmet trnafmet to determine the effects on both  sic formation and  sic conversion to   s initiation complexes  sic of a substituting aug with auu and or b omitting if  and or c replacing gtp with the non hydrolyzable analog gdpcp we demonstrate that the presence or absence of if has at most minor effects on the rate of  sic formation using either aug or auu as the initiation codon and conclude that the high affinity of if for both   s subunit and initiator trna overrides any perturbation of the codon  anticodon interaction resulting from auu for aug substitution in contrast replacement of aug by auu leads to a dramatic reduction in the rate of  sic formation from  sic upon addition of   s subunits interpreting our results in the framework of a quantitative kinetic scheme leads to the conclusion that within the overall process of  sic formation the step most affected by substituting auu for aug involves the conversion of an initially labile   s ribosome into a more stable complex in the absence of if  the difference between aug and auu largely disappears with each initiation codon affording rapid  sic formation leading to the hypothesis that it is the rate of if dissociation from the   s ribosome during ic s formation that is critical to its fidelity function
