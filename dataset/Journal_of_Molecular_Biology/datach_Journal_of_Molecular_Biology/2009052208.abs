structural snapshots for the conformation dependent catalysis by human medium chain acyl coenzyme a synthetase acsm a
acyl coa synthetases belong to the superfamily of adenylate forming enzymes and catalyze the two step activation of fatty acids or carboxylate containing xenobiotics the carboxylate substrate first reacts with atp to form an acyl adenylate intermediate which then reacts with coa to produce an acyl coa ester here we report the first crystal structure of a medium chain acyl coa synthetase acsm a in a series of substrate product cofactor complexes central to the catalytic mechanism we observed a substantial rearrangement between the n and c terminal domains driven purely by the identity of the bound ligand in the active site our structures allowed us to identify the presence or absence of the atp pyrophosphates as the conformational switch and elucidated new mechanistic details including the role of invariant lys  and a divalent magnesium ion in coordinating the atp pyrophosphates as well as the involvement of a gly rich p loop and the conserved arg  glu  salt bridge in the domain rearrangement
