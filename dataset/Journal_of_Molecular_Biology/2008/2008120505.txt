We have examined the folding ensembles present in solution for a series of RNA oligonucleotides that encompass the replicase translational operator stem–loop of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. Single-molecule (SM) fluorescence assays suggest that these RNAs exist in solution as ensembles of differentially base-paired/base-stacked states at equilibrium. There are two distinct ensembles for the wild-type sequence, implying the existence of a significant free energy barrier between “folded” and “unfolded” ensembles. Experiments with sequence variants are consistent with an unfolding mechanism in which interruptions to base-paired duplexes, in this example by the single-stranded loop and a single-base bulge in the base-paired stem, as well as the free ends, act as nucleation points for unfolding. The switch between folded and unfolded ensembles is consistent with a transition that occurs when all base-pairing and/or base-stacking interactions that would orientate the legs of the RNA stem are broken. Strikingly, a U-to-C replacement of a residue in the loop, which creates a high-affinity form of the operator for coat protein binding, results in dramatically different (un)folding behaviour, revealing distinct subpopulations that are either stabilised or destabilised with respect to the wild-type sequence. This result suggests additional reasons for selection against the C-variant stem–loop in vivo and provides an explanation for the increased affinity.
