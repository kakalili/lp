minimalist protein model as a diagnostic tool for misfolding and aggregation
we propose a realistic coarse grained protein model and a technique to  anchor  the model to available experimental data we apply this procedure to characterize the effect of multiple mutations on the folding mechanism of protein s  we show that the mutation of a few  gatekeeper  residues triggers significant changes on the folding landscape of s  these results suggest that gatekeeper residues control the flexibility of critical regions of s  that in turn regulates the delicate balance between folding and aggregation although obtained with a minimalist protein model these results are fully consistent with experimental evidence and offer a clue to understand the interplay between folding and aggregation in protein s
