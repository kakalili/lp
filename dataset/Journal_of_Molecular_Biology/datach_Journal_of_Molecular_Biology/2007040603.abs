structural analysis of abc family periplasmic zinc binding protein provides new insights into mechanism of ligand uptake and release
atp binding cassette superfamily of periplasmic metal transporters are known to be vital for maintaining ion homeostasis in several pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria we have determined crystal structure of the high affinity zinc transporter znua from escherichia coli at     resolution this structure represents the first native non recombinant protein structure of a periplasmic metal binding protein znua reveals numerous conformational features which occur either in zn  or in mn  transporters and presents a unique conformational state a comprehensive comparison of znua with other periplasmic ligand binding protein structures suggests vital mechanistic differences between bound and release states of metal transporters the key new attributes in znua include a c domain disulfide bond an extra  helix proximal to the highly charged metal chelating mobile loop region alternate conformations of secondary shell stabilizing residues at the metal binding site and domain movements potentially controlled by salt bridges based on in depth structural analyses of five metal binding transporters we present here a mechanistic model termed as  partial domain slippage  for binding and release of zn
