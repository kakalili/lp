signal transmission through the htrii transducer alters the interaction of two  helices in the hamp domain
a conformational change of the transducer htrii upon photoexcitation of the associated photoreceptor sensory rhodopsin ii srii was investigated by monitoring the kinetics of volume changes and the diffusion coefficient d of the complex during the photochemical reaction cycle to localize the region of the transducer responsible we truncated it at various positions in the cytoplasmic hamp histidine kinases adenylyl cyclases methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins and phosphatases domain the truncations do not alter receptor binding which is dependent primarily on membrane embedded domain interactions we found that the light induced reduction in d occurs in transducers of lengths   and   residues tr  and tr   which are both predicted to contain a hamp domain consisting of two amphipathic  helices as  and as   in contrast the change in d was abolished in a transducer of   amino acid residues tr   which lacks a distal portion of the second  helix as  the volume changes in srii  tr  are comparable in amplitude and kinetics with those in srii  tr  and srii  tr   confirming the integrity of the complex which was previously concluded from the similar srii binding affinity and similar blocking of srii proton transport by full length htrii and tr   our results indicate that a substantial conformational change occurs in the hamp domain during srii  htrii signaling the data presented here are the first demonstration of stimulus induced conformational changes of a hamp domain and provide evidence that the presence of as  is crucial for the conformational alterations the reduction in diffusion coefficient is likely to due to structural changes in the as  and as  helices such that hydrogen bonding with the surrounding water molecules is increased thereby increasing friction with the solvent similar structural changes may be a general feature in hamp domain switching which occurs in diverse signaling proteins including sensor kinases taxis receptors transducers adenylyl cyclases and phosphatases
