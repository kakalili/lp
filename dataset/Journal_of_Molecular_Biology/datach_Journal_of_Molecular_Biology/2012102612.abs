protein folding adding a nucleus to guide helix docking reduces landscape roughness
the elongated three helix  bundle spectrin domains r  and r  fold and unfold unusually slowly over a rough energy landscape in contrast to the homologue r  which folds fast over a much smoother more typical landscape r  folds via a nucleation  condensation mechanism that guides the docking of the a and c helices however in r  and r  the secondary structure forms first and the two helices must then dock in the correct register here we use variants of r  and r  to demonstrate that substitution of just five key residues is sufficient to alter the folding mechanism and reduce the landscape roughness we suggest that by providing access to an alternative faster folding route over their landscape r  and r  can circumvent their slow frustrated wild type folding mechanism
