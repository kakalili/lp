internal gene duplication in the evolution of prokaryotic transmembrane proteins
we investigated the evolution of transmembrane tm topology by detecting partial sequence repeats in tm protein sequences and analyzing them in detail a total of   sequences that seem to have evolved by internal gene duplication events were found among    predicted tm protein sequences except for single spannings from  prokaryotic genomes various types of internal duplication patterns were identified in these sequences the majority of them are diploid type including quasi diploid type duplication in which a primordial protein sequence was duplicated internally to become an extant tm protein with twice as many tm segments as the primordial one and the remaining ones are partial duplications including triploid type the diploid type repeats are recognized in many  tms   tms and  tms tm protein sequences suggesting the diploid type duplication was a principle mechanism in the evolutionary development of these types of tm proteins the  positive inside  rule is satisfied in whole sequences of both  tms and  tms tm proteins and in both halves of  tms proteins while not necessarily in the second half of  tms proteins providing fit examples of  internal divergent topology evolution  likely occurred after a diploid type internal duplication event from analyzing the partial duplication patterns several evolutionary pathways were recognized for  tms tm proteins i e from primordial  tms  tms and  tms tm proteins to extant  tms proteins similarly the duplication pattern analysis revealed plausible evolution scenarios that  tms tm proteins have arisen from  tms  tms and  tms tm protein precursors via partial internal gene duplications
