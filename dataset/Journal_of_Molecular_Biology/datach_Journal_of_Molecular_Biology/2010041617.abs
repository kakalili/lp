a conserved protonation induced switch can trigger  ionic lock  formation in adrenergic receptors
the mechanism of signal transduction in g protein coupled receptors gpcrs is a crucial step in cell signaling however the molecular details of this process are still largely undetermined carrying out submicrosecond molecular dynamics simulations of  adrenergic receptors we found that cooperation between a number of highly conserved residues is crucial to alter the equilibrium between the active state and the inactive state of diffusible ligand gpcrs in particular   ionic lock  formation in  adrenergic receptors is directly correlated with the protonation state of a highly conserved aspartic acid residue asp    even though the two sites are located more than    away from each other internal polar residues acting as local microswitches cooperate to propagate the signal from asp    to the g protein interaction site at the helix iii  helix vi interface evolutionarily conserved differences between opsin and non opsin gpcrs in the surrounding of asp    influence the acidity of this residue and can thus help in rationalizing the differences in constitutive activity of class a gpcrs
