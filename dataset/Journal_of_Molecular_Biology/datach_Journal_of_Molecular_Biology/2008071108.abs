recycling of ribosomal complexes stalled at the step of elongation in escherichia coli
translating ribosomes often stall during elongation the stalled ribosomes are known to be recycled by tmrna ssra mediated trans translation another process that recycles the stalled ribosomes is characterized by peptidyl trna release however the mechanism of peptidyl trna release from the stalled ribosomes is not well understood we used a defined system of an aga minigene containing a small open reading frame atg aga aga  translation of the aga minigene mrna is toxic to escherichia coli because it stalls ribosomes during elongation and sequesters trnaarg as a short chain peptidyl trnaarg in the ribosomal p site we show that a ribosome recycling factor rrf mediated process rescues the host from the aga minigene toxicity by releasing the peptidyl trnaarg from the ribosomes the growth phenotypes of e coli strains harboring mutant alleles of rrf and initiation factor  if  genes and their consequences on  immp  phage replication upon aga minigene expression reveal that if facilitates the rrf mediated processing of the stalled ribosomes additionally we have designed a uracil dna glycosylase gene construct ung stopless whose expression is toxic to e coli we show that the rrf mediated process also alleviates the ung stopless construct mediated toxicity to the host by releasing the ung mrna from the ribosomes harboring long chain peptidyl trnas
