association of  b crystallin a small heat shock protein with actin role in modulating actin filament dynamics in vivo
disruption of cytoskeletal assembly is one of the early effects of any stress that can ultimately lead to cell death stabilization of cytoskeletal assembly therefore is a critical event that regulates cell survival under stress  b crystallin a small heat shock protein has been shown to associate with cytoskeletal proteins under normal and stress conditions earlier reports suggest that  b crystallin could prevent stress induced aggregation of actin in vitro however the molecular mechanisms by which  b crystallin stabilizes actin filaments in vivo are not known using the h c rat cardiomyoblast cell line as a model system we show that upon heat stress  b crystallin preferentially partitions from the soluble cytosolic fraction to the insoluble cytoskeletal protein rich fraction confocal microscopic analysis shows that  b crystallin associates with actin filaments during heat stress and the extent of association increases with time further immunoprecipitation experiments show that  b crystallin interacts directly with actin treatment of heat stressed h c cells with the actin depolymerzing agent cytochalasin b failed to disorganize actin we show that this association of  b crystallin with actin is dependent on its phosphorylation status as treatment of cells with mapk inhibitors sb    or pd   results in abrogation of this association our results indicate that  b crystallin regulates actin filament dynamics in vivo and protects cells from stress induced death further our studies suggest that the association of  b crystallin with actin helps maintenance of pinocytosis a physiological function essential for survival of cells
