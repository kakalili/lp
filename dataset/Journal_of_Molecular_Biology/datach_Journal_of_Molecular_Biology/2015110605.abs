the antibody light chain linker is important for domain stability and amyloid formation
the association of light chains lcs and heavy chains is the basis for functional antibodies that are essential for adaptive immune responses however in some cases lcs and especially fragments consisting of the lc variable vl domain are pathologically deposited in fatal aggregation diseases the two domains of the lc are connected by a highly conserved linker we show here that unexpectedly the linker residue arg  affects the conformational stability and folding of both vl  and lc constant cl  domains interestingly the extension of vl by arg  results in its resistance to amyloid formation which suggests that the nature of the truncation of the lc plays a crucial role in disease progression increased solvation due to the exposed charged c terminal arg  residue explains its stabilizing effects on the vl domain for the cl domain the interaction of n terminal loop residues with arg  is important for the integrity of the domain as the disruption of this interaction results in fluctuation partial opening of the protein s interior and the exposure of hydrophobic residues that destabilize the domain this establishes new principles for antibody domain architecture and amyloidogenicity
