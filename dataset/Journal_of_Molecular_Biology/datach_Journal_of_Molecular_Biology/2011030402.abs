mechanism of binding site conformational switching in the cd   hyaluronan protein  carbohydrate binding interaction
the transmembrane protein cd  which has been implicated in cancer biology and inflammation mediates cell adhesion through multimeric interactions with the linear extracellular glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan ha in megadaltons  affinity switching of cd  from a low affinity state to a high affinity state is required for normal cd  physiological function crystal structures of the cd  hyaluronan binding domain complexed with ha oligomers point to a conformational rearrangement at a binding site loop leading to the formation of direct contact between the oligomer and an arginine side chain as a molecular basis for affinity switching here all atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the dynamics and thermodynamics of oligomeric hyaluronan oha and its two crystallographic complexes with the cd  hyaluronan binding domain the  a form   which lacks arginine  ha close contact and the  b form   which has direct arginine side chain  ha contact from the simulations the conformational properties of oha are essentially unaltered in going from the unbound state to either the a form or the b form bound state with the oligomer retaining its flexibility when bound and with only two of the eight monosaccharides in the oligomer maintaining uninterrupted contact with the protein biased simulations revealed that altering the backbone conformation of a tyrosine residue in the arginine loop can induce the a form  b form conformational transition and that a large free energy barrier prevents ready interconversion between the two forms thereby suggesting that the tyrosine backbone forms a molecular switch
