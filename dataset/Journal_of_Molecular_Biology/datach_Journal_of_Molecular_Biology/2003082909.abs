dna recognition by the ecorv restriction endonuclease probed using base analogues
the ecorv restriction endonuclease recognises palindromic gatatc sequences and cuts between the central t and da bases in a reaction that has an absolute requirement for a divalent metal ion physiologically mg  use has been made of base analogues which delete hydrogen bonds between the protein and dna or hydrophobic interactions in the case of the  ch group of thymine  to evaluate the roles of the outer two base pairs gatatc in dna recognition selectivity arises at both the binding steps leading to the formation of the enzyme  dna  metal ion ternary complex assayed by measuring the dissociation constant in the presence of the non reactive metal ca  and the catalytic step evaluated using single turnover hydrolysis in the presence of mg   with each protein  dna contact contributing to recognition with the a t base pair binding was reduced by the amount expected for the simple loss of a single contact much more severe effects were observed with the g c base pair suggesting additional conformational perturbation most of the modified bases lowered the rate of hydrolysis furthermore the presence of an analogue in one strand of the duplex diminished cutting at the second unmodified strand indicative of communication between dna binding and the active site the essential metal ion mg  plays a key role in mediating interactions between the dna binding site and active centre and in many instances rescue of hydrolysis was seen with mn  it is suggested that contacts between the gatatc site are required for tight binding and for the correct assembly of metal ions and bound water at the catalytic site functions important in providing acid base catalysis and transition state stabilisation
