sequence dependent upstream dna  rna polymerase interactions in the open complex with  pr and  prm promoters and implications for the mechanism of promoter interference
upstream interactions of escherichia coli rna polymerase rnap in an open promoter complex rpo formed at the pr and prm promoters of bacteriophage  have been studied by atomic force microscopy we demonstrate that the previously described  nm dna compaction observed upon rpo formation at pr rivetti c  guthold m  amp bustamante c     wrapping of dna around the e coli rna polymerase open promoter complex embo j           is a consequence of the specific interaction of the rnap with two at rich sequence determinants positioned from    to    and from    to     likewise rpos formed at prm showed a specific contact between rnap and the upstream dna sequence we further demonstrate that this interaction which results in dna wrapping against the polymerase surface is mediated by the c terminal domains of  subunits carboxy terminal domain  substitution of these at rich sequences with heterologous dna reduces dna wrapping but has only a small effect on the activity of the pr promoter we find however that the frequency of dna templates with both pr and prm occupied by an rnap significantly increases upon loss of dna wrapping these results suggest that  carboxy terminal domain interactions with upstream dna can also play a role in regulating the expression of closely spaced promoters finally a model for a possible mechanism of promoter interference between pr and prm is proposed
