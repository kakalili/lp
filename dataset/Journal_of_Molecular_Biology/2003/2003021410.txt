Tag7/PGRP, a recently characterized antimicrobial protein, is conserved from insects to mammals. Recently its involvement in Toll signalling in Drosophila was demonstrated. A number of genes representing a new family homologous to PGRP were identified in Drosophila and human. Here we describe a splicing pattern of the tagL gene, mouse member of tag7/PGRP family. Some of the identified splice variants lacked characteristics for the family T phage lysozyme homology domain (also known as PGRP domain). Accordingly to the predicted transmembrane domains, mouse TagL may be secreted as inducible proteins or retained on intracellular membranes. All detected splice variant isoforms of TagL bound Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and peptidoglycan. This binding did not depend on the presence of T phage lysozyme homology domain but was associated with the C-terminal portion of the polypeptides. Thus, this variety of isoforms of a single gene may play a role in circulating bacteria recognition in mammals.
