three dimensional organization of retroviral capsid proteins on a lipid monolayer edited by m summers
we have used a method for the two dimensional crystallization of retroviral structural proteins to obtain a three dimensional structure of negatively stained membrane bound histidine tagged moloney murine leukemia virus m mulv capsid protein his moca arrays tilted and untilted micrographs from crystals formed by purified his moca proteins incubated beneath lipid monolayers containing nickel chelating lipids were used in d reconstructions the d crystals had unit cell dimensions of a     b     and       but appeared to have no intrinsic symmetry p  in d in contrast to the trigonal or hexagonal appearance of their d projections membrane bound his moca proteins showed a strand like organization apparently with dimer building blocks membrane proximal regions or putative n terminal domains ntds  dimerized with different partners than the membrane distal putative c terminal domains ctds  evidence also suggests that ctds can adopt alternate orientations relative to their ntds forming interstrand connections our results are consistent with helical spiral models for retrovirus particle assembly but are not easily reconcilable with icosahedral models
