switching of troponin i ca  and myosin induced activation of heart muscle
the principal task of the ca  activation of striated muscle is the release of the troponin i tni inhibitory region tni i from actin tni i release facilitates the repositioning of tropomyosin across the actin surface and the formation of strong force generating actin myosin cross bridges full activation of the ca  regulatory switch crs requires two switching steps in ctni binding of the tni regulatory region to hydrophobic sites in the n domain of ca  bound troponin c and release of the adjacent tni i from actin using f rster resonance energy transfer we have examined the requirements for full activation of the cardiac crs in the presence of actin both ca  and strong cross bridges are required for full activation actin desensitizes the crs to ca  and produces cooperativity in the ca  activation of the crs strong cross bridges eliminate cooperativity and re sensitize the crs to ca  we propose a kinetic scheme and a structural model to account for these findings
