structural and biochemical studies elucidate the mechanism of rhamnogalacturonan lyase from aspergillus aculeatus
we present here the first experimental evidence for bound substrate in the active site of a rhamnogalacturonan lyase belonging to family  of polysaccharide lyases aspergillus aculeatus rhamnogalacturonan lyase rgl  rgl is involved in the degradation of rhamnogalacturonan i an important pectic plant cell wall polysaccharide based on the previously determined wild type structure enzyme variants rgl h  a and rgl k  a have been produced and characterized both kinetically and structurally showing that his  and lys  are key active site residues crystals of the rgl k  a variant soaked with a rhamnogalacturonan digest gave a clear picture of substrate bound in the     subsites the crystallographic and kinetic studies on rgl  and structural and sequence comparison to other enzymes in the same and other pl families enable us to propose a detailed reaction mechanism for the  elimination on     l rhamno     d galacturonic acid    the mechanism differs significantly from the one established for pectate lyases in which most often calcium ions are engaged in catalysis
