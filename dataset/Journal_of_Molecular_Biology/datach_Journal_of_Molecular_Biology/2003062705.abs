statistical models for discerning protein structures containing the dna binding helix turn helix motif
a method for discerning protein structures containing the dna binding helix turn helix hth motif has been developed the method uses statistical models based on geometrical measurements of the motif with a decision tree model key structural features required for dna binding were identified these include a high average solvent accessibility of residues within the recognition helix and a conserved hydrophobic interaction between the recognition helix and the second alpha helix preceding it the protein data bank was searched using a more accurate model of the motif created using the adaboost algorithm to identify structures that have a high probability of containing the motif including those that had not been reported previously
