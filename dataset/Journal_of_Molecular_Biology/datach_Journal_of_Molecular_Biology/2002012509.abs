potential contact sites between the protein and rna subunit in the bacillus subtilis rnase p holoenzyme edited by j karn
we have detected by nucleotide analog interference mapping naim amp s and imp s modifications in bacillus subtilis rnase p rna that interfere with binding of the homologous protein subunit interference as well as some enhancement effects were clustered in two main areas in p  a l   and p  of the specificity domain cluster  domain i and in p  p  p   j   and j   of the catalytic domain cluster a domain ii  minor interferences in p and p  and a strong and weak enhancement effect in p  represent a third area located in domain ii cluster b  our results suggest that p  p j   and j   are key elements for anchoring of the protein to the catalytic domain close to the scissile phosphodiester in enzyme substrate complexes sites of interference or enhancement in clusters  and a are located at distances between  and    from each other in the current d model of a full length rnase p rna substrate complex taking into account that the rnase p protein monomer can bridge a maximum distance of about    simultaneous direct contacts to the two aforementioned potential rna binding areas would be incompatible with our current understanding of bacterial rnase p rna architecture our findings suggest that the current d model has to be rearranged in order to reduce the distance between clusters  and a alternatively based on the recent finding that b subtilis rnase p forms a tetramer consisting of two protein and two rna subunits cluster  may reflect one protein contact site in domain i and cluster a a separate one in domain ii
