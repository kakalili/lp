the transition between the open and closed states of rubisco is triggered by the inter phosphate distance of the bound bisphosphate edited by d rees
d ribulose   bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco catalyses the central co fixing reaction of photosynthesis in a complex multiple step process several structures of rubisco complexed with substrate analogues inhibitors and products have been determined by x ray crystallography the structures fall into two well defined and distinct states the active site is either  open  or  closed   the timing and mechanism of the transition between these two states have been uncertain we solved the crystal structure of unactivated metal free rubisco from tobacco with only inorganic phosphate bound and conclude that phosphate binding per se does not trigger closure as it does in the similarly structured enzyme triosephosphate isomerase comparison of all available rubisco structures suggests that instead the distance between the terminal phosphates p and p  of the bisphosphate ligand is the trigger if that distance is less than     then the active site closes if it is greater than    then the enzyme remains open shortening of the inter phosphate distance results from the ligand binding in a more curved conformation when o atoms of the ligand  s sugar backbone interact either with the metal if it is present or with charged groups in the metal binding site if the metal is absent this shortening brings the p phosphate into hydrogen bonding contact with thr  thr  exists in two discrete states related by a rotation of the backbone  torsion angle this rotation is coupled to domain rotation and hence to active site closure rotation of the side chain of thr  also affects the c terminal strand of large subunit which packs against loop  after closure the position of the c terminal strand in the closed state is stabilised by multiple polar interactions with a distinctive highly charged latch site involving the side chain of asp   in the open state this latch site may be occupied instead by phosphorylated anions
