conservation and diversity among the three dimensional folds of the dicistroviridae intergenic region ireses
internal ribosome entry site ires rnas are necessary for successful infection of many pathogenic viruses but the details of the rna structure based mechanism used to bind and manipulate the ribosome remain poorly understood the ires rnas from the dicistroviridae intergenic region igr are an excellent model system to understand the fundamental tenets of ires function requiring no protein factors to manipulate the ribosome and initiate translation here we explore the architecture of four members of the igr ireses representative of the two divergent classes of these ires rnas using biochemical and structural probing methods we show that despite sequence variability they contain a common three dimensional fold the three dimensional architecture of the ribosome binding domain from these ireses is organized around a core helical scaffold around which the rest of the rna molecule folds however subtle variation in the folds of these ireses and the presence of an additional secondary structure element suggest differences in the details of their manipulation of the large ribosomal subunit overall the results demonstrate how a conserved three dimensional rna fold governs ribosome binding and manipulation
