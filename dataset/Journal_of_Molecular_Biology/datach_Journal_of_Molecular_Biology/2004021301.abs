functional compatibility of elongation factors between mammalian mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes characterization of gtpase activity and translation elongation by hybrid ribosomes bearing heterologous l   proteins
the mammalian mitochondrial mt ribosome mitoribosome is a bacterial type ribosome but has a highly protein rich composition almost half of the rrna contained in the bacterial ribosome is replaced with proteins in the mitoribosome escherichia coli elongation factor g ef g ec has no translocase activity on the mitoribosome but ef g mt is functional on the e coli ribosome to investigate the functional equivalency of the mt and e coli ribosomes we prepared hybrid mt and e coli ribosomes the hybrid mitoribosome containing e coli l   l   ec instead of l   mt clearly activated the gtpase of ef g ec and efficiently promoted its translocase activity in an in vitro translation system thus the mitoribosome is functionally equivalent to the e coli ribosome despite their distinct compositions the mt ef tu dependent translation activity of the e coli ribosome was also clearly enhanced by replacing the c terminal domain ctd of l   ec with the mt counterpart the hybrid e coli ribosome  this strongly indicates that the ctd of l   is responsible for ef tu function these results demonstrate that functional compatibility between elongation factors and the l   protein in the ribosome governs its translational specificity
