telomerase activity is sensitive to subtle perturbations of the tlc pseudoknot   stem and tertiary structure
pseudoknot formation in the core region of the telomerase rna has been demonstrated to be important for telomerase activity in vertebrates ciliates and yeast characterization of the saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase rna tlc  pseudoknot identified tertiary structural interactions that are also important for telomerase activity as previously observed for the kluyveromyces lactis and human telomerase rna pseudoknots in addition the contributions of backbone ribose   oh groups in the pseudoknot to telomerase catalysis were investigated previously using   oh ribose to   h deoxyribose or   o methyl substitutions in the stem  helix and it was proposed that one or more   oh groups from the stem  sequences at or near the triple helix participate in telomerase catalysis based on these studies and investigations of the structural and thermodynamic properties of the tlc rna pseudoknot region we have examined the structural and thermodynamic perturbations of the   o methyl and   h substituted pseudoknots using uv monitored thermal denaturation native gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism spectroscopy our results demonstrate the presence of a form helical geometry perturbations in the backbone sugar substituted pseudoknots show a correlation between thermodynamic stability and telomerase activity and are consistent with the identification of the u  ribose   oh as a potential contributor to telomerase activity
