construction of a large phage displayed human antibody domain library with a scaffold based on a newly identified highly soluble stable heavy chain variable domain
currently almost all u s food and drug administration approved therapeutic antibodies and the vast majority of those in clinical trials are full size antibodies mostly in an immunoglobulin g format of about   kda in size two fundamental problems for such large molecules are their poor penetration into tissues e g  solid tumors and poor or absent binding to regions on the surface of some molecules e g  on the human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein env  that are accessible by molecules of smaller size we have identified a phage displayed heavy chain only antibody by panning of a large size        human naive fab antigen binding fragment library against an env and found that the heavy chain variable domain vh of this antibody designated as m  was independently folded stable highly soluble monomeric and expressed at high levels in bacteria m was used as a scaffold to construct a large size         highly diversified phage displayed human vh library by grafting naturally occurring complementarity determining regions cdrs  and  of heavy chains from five human antibody fab libraries and by randomly mutating four putative solvent accessible residues in cdr to a d s or y the sequence diversity of all cdrs was determined from   randomly selected clones most of these vhs were with different cdr origins six of seven groups of vh germlines or cdr lengths ranging from  to  residues and could be purified directly from the soluble fraction of the escherichia coli periplasm the quality of the library was also validated by successful selection of high affinity vhs against viral and cancer related antigens all selected vhs were monomeric easily expressed and purified with high solubility and yield this library could be a valuable source of antibodies targeting size restricted epitopes and antigens in obstructed locations where efficient penetration could be critical for successful treatment
