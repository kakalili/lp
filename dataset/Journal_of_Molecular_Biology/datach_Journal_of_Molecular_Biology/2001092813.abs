solution nmr structure and folding dynamics of the n terminus of a rat non muscle  tropomyosin in an engineered chimeric protein edited by p e wright
tropomyosin is an  helical coiled coil protein that aligns head to tail along the length of the actin filament and regulates its function the solution structure of the functionally important n terminus of a short   residue non muscle tropomyosin was determined in an engineered chimeric protein glytm bzip consisting of the first  residues of rat short  tropomyosin and the last  residues of the gcn leucine zipper a gene encoding glytm bzip was synthesized cloned and expressed in escherichia coli triple resonance nmr spectra were analyzed with the program autoassign to assign its backbone resonances multidimensional nuclear overhauser effect spectra x filtered spectra and j hn h  scalar coupling were analyzed using autostructure this is the first application of this new program to determine the three dimensional structure of a symmetric homodimer and a structure not previously reported residues   in glytm bzip form a coiled coil but neither end is helical heteronuclear  n h nuclear overhauser effect data showed that the non helical n terminal residues are flexible the  c  chemical shifts of the coiled coil backbone carbonyl groups in glytm bzip showed a previously unreported periodicity where resonances arising from residues at the coiled coil interface in a and d positions of the heptad repeat were displaced relatively upfield and those arising from residues in c positions were displaced relatively downfield heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra collected as a function of temperature showed that cross peaks arising from the  helical backbone and side chains at the coiled coil interface broadened or shifted with tm values    c lower than the loss of  helix measured by circular dichroism suggesting the presence of a folding intermediate the side chain of ile  a residue essential for binding interactions exhibited multiple conformations the conformational flexibility of the n termini of short tropomyosins may be important for their binding specificity
