multi domain packing in the aminoacylatable   end of a plant viral rna
turnip yellow mosaic virus tymv contains a trna like structure tls in its   untranslated region    utr   this highly structured element induces valylation of the viral rna by host cell enzymes and is important for virus proliferation directly upstream of the tymv tls is an upstream pseudoknot domain upd that has been considered to be structurally distinct from the tls  however using a combination of functional biochemical and biophysical assays we show that the entire   utr of the viral genome is a single structured element in the absence of cellular protein  this packing architecture stabilizes the rna structure and creates a better substrate for aminoacylation and thus the upd and tls are functionally and structurally coupled  it has been proposed that the tymv tls acts as a molecular switch between translation and replication our results suggest that this putative switch could be based on structural changes within the global architecture of the utr induced by interactions with the ribosome the tymv tls upd might demonstrate how rna structural plasticity can play a role in regulation of biological processes
