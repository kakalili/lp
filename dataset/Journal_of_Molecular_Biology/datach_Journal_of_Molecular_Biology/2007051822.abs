the dh and ph domains of trio coordinately engage rho gtpases for their efficient activation
rho family gtpases are activated by the exchange of bound gdp for gtp a process that is catalyzed by dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs  the catalytic unit of dbl family gefs consists of a dbl homology dh domain followed almost invariantly by a pleckstrin homology ph domain the majority of the catalytic interface forms between the switch regions of the gtpase and the dh domain but full catalytic activity often requires the associated ph domain although ph domains are usually characterized as lipid binding regions they also participate in protein  protein interactions for example the dh associated ph domain of dbs must contact its cognate gtpases for efficient exchange similarly the n terminal dh ph fragment of trio which catalyzes exchange on both rac and rhog is fourfold more active in vitro than the isolated dh domain given continued uncertainty regarding functional roles of dh associated ph domains we have undertaken structural and functional analyses of the n terminal dh ph cassette of trio the crystal structure of this fragment of trio bound to nucleotide depleted rac highlights the engagement of the ph domain with rac and substitution of residues involved in this interface substantially diminishes activation of rac and rhog also these mutations significantly reduce the ability of full length trio to induce neurite outgrowth dependent on rhog activation in pc  cells overall these studies substantiate a general role for dh associated ph domains in engaging rho gtpases directly for efficient guanine nucleotide exchange and support a parsimonious explanation for the essentially invariant linkage between dh and ph domains
