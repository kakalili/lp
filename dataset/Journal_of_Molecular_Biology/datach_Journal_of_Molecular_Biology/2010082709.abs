positive autoregulation shapes response timing and intensity in two component signal transduction systems
positive feedback loops are regulatory elements that can modulate expression output kinetics and noise in genetic circuits transcriptional regulators participating in such loops are often expressed from two promoters one constitutive and one autoregulated here we investigate the interplay of promoter strengths and the intensity of the stimulus activating the transcriptional regulator in defining the output of a positively autoregulated genetic circuit using a mathematical model of two component regulatory systems which are present in all domains of life we establish that positive feedback strongly affects the steady state output levels at both low and high levels of stimulus if the constitutive promoter of the regulator is weak by contrast the effect of positive feedback is negligible when the constitutive promoter is sufficiently strong unless the stimulus intensity is very high furthermore we determine that positive feedback can affect both transient and steady state output levels even in the simplest genetic regulatory systems we tested our modeling predictions by abolishing the positive feedback loop in the two component regulatory system phop phoq of salmonella enterica which resulted in diminished induction of phop activated genes
