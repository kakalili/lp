a novel open barrel structure of octameric translin reveals a potential rna entryway
the single stranded dna ssdna rna binding protein translin was suggested to be involved in chromosomal translocations telomere metabolism and mrna transport and translation oligonucleotide binding surfaces map within a closed cavity of translin octameric barrels raising the question as to how dna rna gain access to this inner cavity particularly given that to date none of the barrel structures reported hint to an entryway here we argue against a mechanism by which translin octamers may  dissociate and reassemble  upon rna binding and report a novel  open  barrel structure of human translin revealing a feasible dna rna entryway into the cavity additionally we report that translin not only is confined to binding of ssdna oligonucleotides or single stranded extensions of double stranded dna dsdna  but also can bind single stranded sequences internally embedded in dsdna molecules
