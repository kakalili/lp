ra induced transcriptional silencing of checkpoint kinase  through promoter methylation by dnmt b is required for neuronal differentiation of p  cells
in a previous study we identified several novel targets of dnmt b using a chromatin library from retinoic acid ra treated p  cells the present study describes the regulation of expression and function of checkpoint kinase chk  which was one of the target genes of dnmt b chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative pcr analysis showed that recruitment of dnmt b on chk promoter is induced following ra treatment of p  cells both bisulfite genomic sequence and cobra analyses showed that the methylation level of chk promoter is progressively increased during ra induced neuronal differentiation of p  cells concomitantly both mrna and protein expression of chk are reduced as determined by real time pcr and western blot analysis respectively suppression of dnmt b expression by lentiviral mediated shrna resulted in increased expression and reduced methylation of chk  which clearly showed that dnmt b is responsible for transcriptional silencing of chk gene in ra treated p  cells neuronal differentiation of p  cells was inhibited upon enforced chk expression in p  cells which showed that the decrease in endogenous expression of chk is essential for normal differentiation ectopic chk expression also negatively regulated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following ra treatment which could also contribute to impaired neuronal differentiation together this study described the regulation of chk expression through promoter methylation and also presented a novel role of chk during neuronal differentiation which is independent of its previously known function in dna damage response
