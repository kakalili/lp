molecular basis of a million fold affinity maturation process in a protein  protein interaction
protein engineering is becoming increasingly important for pharmaceutical applications where controlling the specificity and affinity of engineered proteins is required to create targeted protein therapeutics affinity increases of several thousand fold are now routine for a variety of protein engineering approaches and the structural and energetic bases of affinity maturation have been investigated in a number of such cases previously a  million fold affinity maturation process was achieved in a protein  protein interaction composed of a variant t cell receptor fragment and a bacterial superantigen here we present the molecular basis of this affinity increase using x ray crystallography shotgun reversion replacement scanning mutagenesis and computational analysis we describe in molecular detail a process by which extrainterfacial regions of a protein complex can be rationally manipulated to significantly improve protein engineering outcomes
