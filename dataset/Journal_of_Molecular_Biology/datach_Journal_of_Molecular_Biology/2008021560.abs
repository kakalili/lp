a rationally designed monomeric variant of anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase from sulfolobus solfataricus is as active as the dimeric wild type enzyme but less thermostable
the anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase from sulfolobus solfataricus ssanprt forms a homodimer with a hydrophobic subunit interface to elucidate the role of oligomerisation for catalytic activity and thermal stability of the enzyme we loosened the dimer by replacing two apolar interface residues with negatively charged residues mutations i e and m d  the purified double mutant i e m d formed a monomer with wild type catalytic activity but reduced thermal stability the single mutants i e and m d were present in a monomer  dimer equilibrium with dissociation constants of about   m and    m respectively which were calculated from the concentration dependence of their heat inactivation kinetics the monomeric form of m d which is populated at low subunit concentrations was as thermolabile as monomeric i e m d likewise the dimeric form of i e which was populated at high subunit concentrations was as thermostable as dimeric wild type ssanprt these findings show that the increased stability of wild type ssanprt compared to the i e m d double mutant is not caused by the amino acid exchanges per se but by the higher intrinsic stability of the dimer compared to the monomer in accordance with the negligible effect of the mutations on catalytic activity and stability the x ray structure of m d contains only minor local perturbations at the dimer interface we conclude that the monomeric double mutant resembles the individual wild type subunits and that ssanprt is a dimer for stability but not for activity reasons
