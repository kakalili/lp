The N-terminal domains of cardiac myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C) play a regulatory role in modulating interactions between myosin and actin during heart muscle contraction. Using NMR spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering, we have determined specific details of the interaction between the two-module human C0C1 cMyBP-C fragment and F-actin. The small-angle neutron scattering data show that C0C1 spontaneously polymerizes monomeric actin (G-actin) to form regular assemblies composed of filamentous actin (F-actin) cores decorated by C0C1, similar to what was reported in our earlier four-module mouse cMyBP-C actin study. In addition, NMR titration analyses show large intensity changes for a subset of C0C1 peaks upon addition of G-actin, indicating that human C0C1 interacts specifically with actin and promotes its assembly into filaments. During the NMR titration, peaks corresponding to cardiac-specific C0 domain are the first to be affected, followed by those from the C1 domain. No peak intensity or position changes were detected for peaks arising from the disordered proline/alanine-rich (P/A) linker connecting C0 with C1, despite previous suggestions of its involvement in binding actin. Of considerable interest is the observation that the actin-interaction “hot-spots” within the C0 and C1 domains, revealed in our NMR study, overlap with regions previously identified as binding to the regulatory light chain of myosin and to myosin ΔS2. Our results suggest that C0 and C1 interact with myosin and actin using a common set of binding determinants and therefore support a cMyBP-C switching mechanism between myosin and actin.
