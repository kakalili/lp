news from an ancient world two novel astacin metalloproteases from the horseshoe crab
in this work we report the cloning heterologous expression and characterization of two novel astacin proteases from the chelicerate limulus polyphemus horseshoe crab  designated as last limulus astacin and last mam limulus astacin containing a mam domain  respectively the expression pattern showed ubiquitous occurrence of last mam while last was predominantly restricted to the eyes and brain indicating a function in the nervous system both enzymes contain the characteristic metzincin type zinc binding region and met turn while last is made up only of the typical prodomain and astacin like protease domain last mam contains an additional mam meprin a protein tyrosine phosphatase   domain which so far only has been found in few astacins such as the vertebrate meprin hydra and squid enzymes and in a number of other extracellular proteins such as a protein and tyrosine phosphatase   these gave rise to the designation mam for this protein module mam domains have been shown to be responsible for protein oligomerization in meprin proteases and tyrosine phosphatase   since the horseshoe crab has kept its body plan for almost half a billion years it is therefore a privileged organism for the study of protease evolution in this context we could show by phylogenetic analysis that this protease is not related to the other mam domain containing astacins indicating different evolutionary origins of these proteins moreover we clearly demonstrated the divergent evolvement of the mam module itself and not only with regard to proteases however there are some unique functional features that are not shared by other members of this protein family for example last mam is the only astacin protease known so far that is active in its zymogen form indicating that the presence of the n terminal propeptide does not prevent proteolytic activity
