inositol    trisphosphate receptor contains multiple cavities and l shaped ligand binding domains
calcium concentrations are strictly regulated in all biological cells and one of the key molecules responsible for this regulation is the inositol    trisphosphate receptor which was known to form a homotetrameric ca  channel in the endoplasmic reticulum the receptor is involved in neuronal transmission via ca  signaling and for many other functions that relate to morphological and physiological processes in living organisms we analysed the three dimensional structure of the ligand free form of the receptor based on a single particle technique using an originally developed electron microscope equipped with a helium cooled specimen stage and an automatic particle picking system we propose a model that explains the complex mechanism for the regulation of ca  release by co agonists ca  inositol    trisphosphate based on the structure of multiple internal cavities and a porous balloon shaped cytoplasmic domain containing a prominent l shaped density which was assigned by the x ray structure of the inositol    trisphosphate binding domain
