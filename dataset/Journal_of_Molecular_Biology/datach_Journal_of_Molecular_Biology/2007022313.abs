mapping the adf cofilin binding site on monomeric actin by competitive cross linking and peptide array evidence for a second binding site on monomeric actin
the binding sites for actin depolymerising factor adf and cofilin on g actin have been mapped by competitive chemical cross linking using deoxyribonuclease i dnase i  gelsolin segment  g  thymosin   t   and vitamin d binding protein dbp  to reduce adf cofilin induced actin oligomerisation we used adp ribosylated actin both vitamin d binding protein and thymosin   inhibit binding by adf or cofilin while cofilin or adf and dnase i bind simultaneously competition was observed between adf or cofilin and g  supporting the hypothesis that cofilin preferentially binds in the cleft between sub domains  and  similar to or overlapping the binding site of g  because the affinity of g is much higher than that of adf or cofilin even at a  fold excess of the latter the complexes contained predominantly g  nevertheless cross linking studies using actin g complexes and adf or cofilin showed the presence of low concentrations of ternary complexes containing both adf or cofilin and g  thus even with monomeric actin it is shown for the first time that binding sites for both g and adf or cofilin can be occupied simultaneously confirming the existence of two separate binding sites employing a peptide array with overlapping sequences of actin overlaid by cofilin we have identified five sequence stretches of actin able to bind cofilin these sequences are located within the regions of f actin predicted to bind cofilin in the model derived from image reconstructions of electron microscopical images of cofilin decorated filaments three of the peptides map to the cleft region between sub domains  and  of the upper actin along the two start long pitch helix while the other two are in the dnase i loop corresponding to the site of the lower actin in the helix in the absence of any crystal structures of adf or cofilin in complex with actin these studies provide further information about the binding sites on f actin for these important actin regulatory proteins
