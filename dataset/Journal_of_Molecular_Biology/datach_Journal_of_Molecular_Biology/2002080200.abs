crystal structure of thermotoga maritima   glucanotransferase and its acarbose complex implications for substrate specificity and catalysis
glucanotransferase gtase is an essential enzyme in    glucan metabolism in bacteria and plants it catalyses the transfer of maltooligosaccharides from an    d glucan molecule to the  hydroxyl group of an acceptor sugar molecule the crystal structures of thermotoga maritima gtase and its complex with the inhibitor acarbose have been determined at    and    resolution respectively the gtase structure consists of three domains an n terminal domain with the     barrel topology domain a  a  residue domain domain b inserted between strand   and helix   of the barrel and a c terminal domain domain c which forms an antiparallel  structure analysis of the complex of gtase with acarbose has revealed the locations of five sugar binding subsites    to   in the active site cleft lying between domain b and the c terminal end of the     barrel the structure of gtase closely resembles the family  glycoside hydrolases and conservation of key catalytic residues previously identified for this family is consistent with a double displacement catalytic mechanism for this enzyme a distinguishing feature of gtase is a pair of tryptophan residues w  and w   which upon the carbohydrate inhibitor binding form a remarkable aromatic  clamp  that captures the sugar rings at the acceptor binding sites  and   analysis of the structure of the complex shows that sugar residues occupying subsites from   to  engage in extensive interactions with the protein whereas the  glucosyl residue makes relatively few contacts with the enzyme thus the structure suggests that four subsites from   to   play the dominant role in enzyme  substrate recognition consistent with the observation that the smallest donor for t maritima gtase is maltotetraose the smallest chain transferred is a maltosyl unit and that the smallest residual fragment after transfer is maltose a close similarity between the structures of gtase and oligo   glucosidase has allowed the structural features that determine differences in substrate specificity of these two enzymes to be analysed
