ordered multi site phosphorylation of the splicing factor asf sf by srpk
the human alternative splicing factor asf sf  an sr serine  arginine rich protein involved in mrna splicing control is activated by the multisite phosphorylation of its c terminal rs domain a segment containing numerous arginine  serine dipeptide repeats the protein kinase responsible for this modification sr specific protein kinase  srpk  catalyzes the selective phosphorylation of approximately a dozen serines in only the n terminal portion of the rs domain rs  to gain insights into the nature of selective phosphate incorporation in asf sf  region specific phosphorylation in the rs domain was monitored as a function of reaction progress arg to lys mutations were made at several positions to produce unique protease cleavage sites that separate the rs domain into identifiable n and c terminal phosphopeptides upon treatment with lysyl endoproteinase these studies reveal that srpk docks near the c terminus of the rs segment and then moves in an n terminal direction along the rs domain multiple quadruple ser to ala and deletion mutations did not disrupt the phosphorylation of other sites regardless of position suggesting that the active site of srpk docks in a flexible manner at the center of the rs domain taken together these data suggest that srpk uses a unique  grab and pull  mechanism to control the regiospecific phosphorylation of its protein substrate
