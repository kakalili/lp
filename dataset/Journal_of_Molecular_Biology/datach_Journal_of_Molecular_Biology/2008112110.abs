akap  binds to hiv  reverse transcriptase and is involved in the reverse transcription
like all retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  undergoes reverse transcription during its replication cycle the cellular cofactors potentially involved in this process still remain to be identified we show here that a kinase anchoring protein   akap   interacts with hiv  reverse transcriptase rt in both the yeast two hybrid system and human cells the akap  binding site has been mapped to the rnase h domain of hiv  rt akap  silencing by rna interference in hiv  infected cells inhibited viral replication at the reverse transcription step we selected single point mutants of rt defective for akap  binding and demonstrated that mutant g  r despite retaining significant intrinsic rt activity in vitro failed to carry out hiv  reverse transcription correctly in infected cells this suggests that the interaction between rt and akap  in infected cells may play an important role in hiv  reverse transcription
