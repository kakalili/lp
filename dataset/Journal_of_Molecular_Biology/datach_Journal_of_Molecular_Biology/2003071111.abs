integration host factor putting a twist on protein  dna recognition
integration host factor ihf is a dna  bending protein that recognizes its cognate sites through indirect readout previous studies have shown that binding of wild type wt ihf is disrupted by a t to a mutation at the center position of a conserved ttr motif in its binding site and that substitution of  glu  with ala prevented ihf from discriminating between a and t at this position we have determined the crystal structures and relative binding affinities for all combinations of wt ihf and ihf  glu ala bound to the wt and mutant dnas comparison of these structures reveals that dna twist plays a major role in dna recognition by ihf and that this geometric parameter is dependent on the dinucleotide step and not on the bound ihf variant
