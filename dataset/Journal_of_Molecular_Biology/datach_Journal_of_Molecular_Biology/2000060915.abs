crystal structure of the  m  antibody fab fragment in complex with a dna dt    t photoproduct formed by ultraviolet radiation  edited by i a wilson
dna photoproducts with     pyrimidine pyrimidone adducts formed by ultraviolet radiation are implicated in mutagenesis and cancer particularly skin cancer the crystal structure of the fab fragment of the murine  m  antibody specific to dna t    t photoproducts is determined as a complex with dt    t a     pyrimidine pyrimidone photodimer of dtpt at    resolution to a crystallographic r factor of    and an rfree value of    the  m  fab molecule is in an extended arrangement with an elbow angle of    and its five complementarity determining regions except l  are involved in the ligand binding the bound dt    t ligand adopting a ring structure with     linked   thymine   pyrimidone bases is fully accommodated in an antigen binding pocket of about        the   thymine and   pyrimidone bases are in half chair and planar conformations respectively and are nearly perpendicular to each other the   thymine base is hydrogen bonded to arg h and ser h and is in van der waals contact with tyr  ih the   pyrimidone base is hydrogen bonded to his h and is in contact with trp h three water molecules are located at the interface between the bases and the fab residues hydrogen bonds involving these water molecules also contribute to fab recognition of the dt    t bases the sugar phosphate backbone connecting the bases is surrounded by residues his dl tyr l ser l trp h and ser h but is not hydrogen bonded to these residues
