heterotypic trans interaction of li and e cadherin and their localization in plasmalemmal microdomains
cadherins are calcium dependent adhesion molecules important for tissue morphogenesis and integrity li cadherin and e cadherin are the two prominent cadherins in intestinal epithelial cells whereas li cadherin belongs to the subfamily of d seven domain cadherins defined by their seven extracellular cadherin repeats and short intracellular domain e cadherin is the prototype of classical cadherins with five extracellular domains and a highly conserved cytoplasmic part that interacts with catenins and thereby modulates the organization of the cytoskeleton here we report a specific heterotypic trans interaction of li with e cadherin two cadherins of distinct subfamilies using atomic force microscopy and laser tweezer experiments the trans interaction of li and e cadherin was characterized on the single molecule level and on the cellular level respectively this heterotypic interaction showed similar binding strength      pn at       nm s and lifetime    s as the respective homotypic interactions of li and e cadherin ve cadherin another classical cadherin did not bind to li cadherin in enterocytes li cadherin and e cadherin are located in different membrane regions li cadherin is distributed along the basolateral membrane whereas the majority of e cadherin is concentrated in adherens junctions this difference in membrane distribution was also reflected in chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing either li or e cadherin we found that li cadherin is localized almost exclusively in cholesterol rich fractions whereas e cadherin is excluded from these membrane fractions given their different membrane localization in enterocytes the heterotypic trans interaction of li and e cadherin might play a role during development of the intestinal epithelium when the cells do not yet have elaborate membrane specializations
