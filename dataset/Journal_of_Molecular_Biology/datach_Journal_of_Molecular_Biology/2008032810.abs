methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus trnagln confines the amidotransferase gatcab to asparaginyl trnaasn formation
many prokaryotes form the amide aminoacyl trnas glutaminyl trna and asparaginyl trna by trna dependent amidation of the mischarged trna species glutamyl trnagln or aspartyl trnaasn archaea employ two such amidotransferases gatcab and gatde while bacteria possess only one gatcab the methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus gatde is slightly more efficient using asn as an amide donor than gln kcat km of   s   mm and   s   mm respectively  unlike the bacterial gatcab enzymes studied to date the m thermautotrophicus gatcab uses asn almost as well as gln as an amide donor kcat km of   s   mm and   s   mm respectively  in contrast to the initial characterization of the m thermautotrophicus gatcab as being able to form asn trnaasn and gln trnagln our data demonstrate that while the enzyme is able to transamidate asp trnaasn kcat km of   s   mm it is unable to transamidate m thermautotrophicus glu trnagln however m thermautotrophicus gatcab is capable of transamidating glu trnagln from h pylori or b subtilis and m thermautotrophicus glu trnaasn thus m thermautotrophicus encodes two amidotransferases each with its own activity gatde for gln trna and gatcab for asn trna synthesis
