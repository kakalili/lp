mcm  and cdc  cooperate in origin activation in saccharomyces cerevisiae
mcm  has recently been found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of the dna replication initiation process in eukaryotes here we have examined the role of mcm  in assembling initiation factors at a well characterized yeast replication origin ars  we find that the pre replication complex pre rc components cdc and mcm associate with ars in the mcm   mutant suggesting that establishment of the pre rc is not compromised in this mutant association of cdc  with ars is reduced in the mcm   mutant suggesting that mcm  is involved in recruiting cdc  to the pre rc we find that overexpression of either mcm   or cdc  suppresses the growth defect of mcm   and that a physical interaction between cdc  and mcm  is disrupted in the mcm   mutant our results show that interaction between the mcm  and cdc  proteins facilitates the recruitment of cdc  onto the ars origin
