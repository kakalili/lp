membrane dependent conformation dynamics and lipid interactions of the fusion peptide of the paramyxovirus piv from solid state nmr
the entry of enveloped viruses into cells requires protein catalyzed fusion of the viral and cell membranes the structure  function relation of a hydrophobic fusion peptide fp in viral fusion proteins is still poorly understood we report magic angle spinning solid state nmr results of the membrane bound conformation dynamics and lipid interactions of the fp of the f protein of the paramyxovirus parainfluenza virus  piv   c chemical shifts indicate that the piv fp structure depends on the composition of the phospholipid membrane the peptide is  helical in palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol containing anionic membranes but mostly  sheet in neutral phosphocholine membranes other environmental factors including peptide concentration cholesterol membrane reconstitution protocol and a lys solubility tag do not affect the secondary structure the  helical and  sheet states exhibit distinct dynamics and lipid interactions the  sheet fp is immobilized resides on the membrane surface and causes significant membrane curvature in contrast the  helical fp undergoes intermediate timescale motion and maintains the lamellar order of the membrane two dimensional  p  h correlation spectra show clear  p  water cross peaks for anionic membranes containing the  helical fp but weak or no  p  water cross peak for neutral membranes containing the  sheet fp these results suggest that the  sheet fp may be associated with high curvature dehydrated fusion intermediates while the  helical state may be associated with the extended prehairpin state and the post fusion state conformational plasticity is also a pronounced feature of the influenza and human immunodeficiency virus fps suggesting that these gly rich sequences encode structural plasticity to generate and sense different membrane morphologies
