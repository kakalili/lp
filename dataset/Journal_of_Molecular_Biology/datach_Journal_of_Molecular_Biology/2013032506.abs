crystal structure of the archaeal translation initiation factor  in complex with a gtp analogue and met trnafmet
heterotrimeric aif     archaeal homologue of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor  in its gtp bound form delivers met trnaimet to the small ribosomal subunit it is known that the heterodimer containing the gtp bound  subunit and domain  of the  subunit of aif is required for the formation of a stable complex with met trnai here the crystal structure of an incomplete ternary complex including aif  d   gdpnp  met trnafmet has been solved at    resolution this structure is in good agreement with biochemical and hydroxyl radical probing data the analysis of the complex shows that despite the structural similarity of aif  and the bacterial translation elongation factor ef tu their modes of trna binding are very different remarkably the recently published    resolution structure of almost the same ternary initiation complex differs dramatically from the structure presented reasons for this discrepancy are discussed
