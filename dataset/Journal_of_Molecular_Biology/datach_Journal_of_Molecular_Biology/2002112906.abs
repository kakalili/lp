conservation of helical structure contributes to functional metal ion interactions in the catalytic domain of ribonuclease p rna
like protein enzymes catalytic rnas contain conserved structure motifs important for function a universal feature of the catalytic domain of ribonuclease p rna is a bulged helix motif within the p  p helix junction here we show that changes in bulged nucleotide identity and position within helix p affect both catalysis and substrate binding while a subset of the mutations resulted only in catalytic defects we find that the proximity of the bulge to sites of metal ion coordination in p is important for catalysis moving the bulge distal to these sites and deleting it had similarly large effects while moving it proximal to these sites had only a moderate effect on catalysis to test whether the effects of the mutations are linked to metal ion interactions we used terbium dependent cleavage of the phosphate backbone to probe metal ion binding sites in the wild type and mutant ribozymes we detect cleavages at specific sites within the catalytic domain including helix p and j   which have previously been shown to participate directly in metal ion interactions mutations introduced into p cause local changes in the terbium cleavage pattern due to alternate metal ion binding configurations with the helix in addition a bulge deletion mutation results in a   fold decrease in the single turnover cleavage rate constant at saturating magnesium levels and a reduced affinity for magnesium ions important for catalysis in light of the alternate terbium cleavage pattern in p caused by bulge deletion this decreased ability to utilize magnesium ions for catalysis appears to be due to localized structural changes in the ribozyme s catalytic core that weaken metal ion interactions in p and j   the information reported here therefore provides evidence that the universal conservation of the p structure is based in part on optimization of metal ion interactions important for catalysis
