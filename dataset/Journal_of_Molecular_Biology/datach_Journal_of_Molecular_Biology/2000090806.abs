conversion of two state to multi state folding kinetics on fusion of two protein foldons edited by j karn
chymotrypsin inhibitor  ci  is the archetypal single foldon protein that folds in simple two state kinetics without the accumulation of a folding intermediate to model the effects of fusion of single foldons to give a multi foldon protein we engineered a  double ci   protein in which another ci polypeptide was inserted into the loop region of the parent ci  cd and hsqc spectra demonstrated that while the double ci protein adopted two kinds of native conformations ci like structure was almost preserved in both the domains of double ci  in the folding kinetic studies double ci exhibited a remarkable rollover of the observed folding rates at low denaturant concentrations indicating that double ci accumulated a kinetic folding intermediate the different folding mechanisms between wt ci and double ci support the present view that protein size or number of domains is an important determinant for formation of folding intermediates
