constraining enzyme conformational change by an antibody leads to hyperbolic inhibition
although it has been known for many years that antibodies display properties characteristic of allosteric effectors the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects remain poorly understood here we describe a single domain antibody fragment nanobody that modulates protein function by constraining conformational change in the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase dhfr  nanobody   nb   behaves as a potent allosteric inhibitor of dhfr giving rise to mixed hyperbolic inhibition kinetics the crystal structure of nb  in complex with dhfr reveals that the nanobody binds adjacent to the active site half of the epitope consists of residues from the flexible met  loop this loop which ordinarily oscillates between occluded and closed conformations during catalysis assumes the occluded conformation in the nb  bound state using stopped flow we show that nb  inhibits dhfr by stabilising the occluded met  loop conformation surprisingly kinetic data indicate that the met  loop retains sufficient conformational flexibility in the nb  bound state to allow slow substrate turnover to occur
