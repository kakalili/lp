the switch that does not flip the blue light receptor ytva from bacillus subtilis adopts an elongated dimer conformation independent of the activation state as revealed by a combined auc and saxs study
photoreceptors play an important role in plants and bacteria by converting extracellular stimuli into intracellular signals one distinct class are the blue light sensitive phototropins harboring a light  oxygen  voltage lov domain coupled to various effector domains photon absorption by the chromophore within the lov domain results in an activation of the output domain via mechanisms that are hitherto not well understood the photoreceptor ytva from bacillus subtilis is a bacterial analog of phototropins consists of an lov and a sulfate transporter anti sigma factor antagonist domain and is involved in the response of the bacterium to environmental stress we present here analytical ultracentrifugation studies and small angle x ray scattering experiments showing that ytva is a dimer on the basis of these results we present a low resolution model of the dimer in the dark and the lit state of the protein in addition we show that ytva does not change its oligomerization state or its overall shape upon light activation
