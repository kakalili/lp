the prototypical h galactose symporter galp assembles into functional trimers
glucose is a primary source of energy for human cells glucose transporters form specialized membrane channels for the transport of sugars into and out of cells galactose permease galp is the closest bacterial homolog of human facilitated glucose transporters here we report the functional reconstitution and d crystallization of galp single particle electron microscopy analysis of purified galp shows that the protein assembles as an oligomer with three distinct densities reconstitution assays yield d galp crystals that exhibit a hexagonal array having p symmetry the projection structure of galp at    resolution shows that the protein is trimeric each monomer in the trimer forms its own channel but an additional cavity       in diameter is apparent at the  fold axis of the oligomer we show that the crystalline galp is able to selectively bind substrate suggesting that the trimeric form is biologically active
