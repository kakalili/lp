infectious bursal disease virus ribonucleoprotein complexes of a double stranded rna virus
genome binding proteins with scaffolding and or regulatory functions are common in living organisms and include histones in eukaryotic cells histone like proteins in some double stranded dna dsdna viruses and the nucleocapsid proteins of single stranded rna viruses dsrna viruses nevertheless lack these ribonucleoprotein rnp complexes and are characterized by sharing an icosahedral t  core involved in the metabolism and insulation of the dsrna genome the birnaviruses with a bipartite dsrna genome constitute a well established exception and have a single shelled t  capsid only moreover as in many negative single stranded rna viruses the genomic dsrna is bound to a nucleocapsid protein vp  and the rna dependent rna polymerase vpg  we used electron microscopy and functional analysis to characterize these rnp complexes of infectious bursal disease virus the best characterized member of the birnaviridae family mild disruption of viral particles revealed that vp  the most abundant core protein present at    copies per virion is found in filamentous material tightly associated with the dsrna we developed a method to purify rnp and vpg  dsrna complexes analysis of these complexes showed that they are linear molecules containing a constant amount of protein sensitivity assays to nucleases indicated that vp renders the genomic dsrna less accessible for rnase iii without introducing genome compaction additionally we found that these rnp complexes are functionally competent for rna synthesis in a capsid independent manner in contrast to most dsrna viruses
