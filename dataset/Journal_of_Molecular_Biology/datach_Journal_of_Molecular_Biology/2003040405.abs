recognition of nucleic acid bases and base pairs by hydrogen bonding to amino acid side chains
sequence specific protein  nucleic acid recognition is determined in part by hydrogen bonding interactions between amino acid side chains and nucleotide bases to examine the repertoire of possible interactions we have calculated geometrically plausible arrangements in which amino acids hydrogen bond to unpaired bases such as those found in rna bulges and loops or to the  possible rna base pairs we find  possible interactions that involve two or more hydrogen bonds to the six unpaired bases including protonated a and c   of which have been observed we find    spanning  interactions to base pairs in which the amino acid hydrogen bonds to both bases in principle allowing particular base pairs to be selectively targeted and nine of these have been observed four calculated interactions span the watson  crick pairs and  span the g u wobble pair including two interesting arrangements with three hydrogen bonds to the arg guanidinum group that have not yet been observed the inherent donor  acceptor arrangements of the bases support many possible interactions to asn or gln and ser or thr or tyr  few interactions to asp or glu even though several already have been observed and interactions to u or t only if the base is in an unpaired context as also observed in several cases this study highlights how complementary arrangements of donors and acceptors can contribute to base specific recognition of rna predicts interactions not yet observed and provides tools to analyze proposed contacts or design novel interactions
