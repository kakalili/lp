structural analysis of a metazoan nuclear pore complex reveals a fused concentric ring architecture
the sole gateway for molecular exchange between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is the nuclear pore complex npc  this large supramolecular assembly mediates transport of cargo into and out of the nucleus and fuse the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form an aqueous translocation channel the npc is composed of eight proteinaceous asymmetric units forming a pseudo  fold symmetric passage due to its shear size complexity and plastic nature dissecting the high resolution three dimensional structure of the npc in its hydrated state is a formidable challenge toward this goal we applied cryo electron tomography to spread nuclear envelopes from xenopus oocytes to compensate for perturbations of the  fold symmetry of individual npcs we performed symmetry independent asymmetric unit averaging of three dimensional tomographic npc volumes to eventually yield a refined model at   nm resolution this approach revealed novel structural features particularly in the spoke  ring complex and luminal domains fused concentric ring architecture of the spoke  ring complex was found along the translocation channel additionally a comparison of the refined xenopus model to that of its dictyostelium homologue yielded similar pore diameters at the level of the three canonical rings although the xenopus npc was found to be   taller than the dictyostelium pore this discrepancy is attributed primarily to the relatively low homology and different organization of some nucleoporins in the dictyostelium genome as compared to that of vertebrates nevertheless the experimental conditions impose a preferred axial orientation of the npcs within spread xenopus oocyte nuclear envelopes this may at least in part explain the increased height of the reconstructed vertebrate npcs compared to those obtained from tomographic reconstruction of intact dictyostelium nuclei
