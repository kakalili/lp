x ray structure and mutagenesis of the scorpion depressant toxin lqhit reveals key determinants crucial for activity and anti insect selectivity
scorpion depressant  toxins show high preference for insect voltage gated sodium channels navs and modulate their activation although their pharmacological and physiological effects were described their three dimensional structure and bioactive surface have never been determined we utilized an efficient system for expression of the depressant toxin lqhit  from leiurus quinquestriatus hebraeus  mutagenized its entire exterior and determined its x ray structure at     resolution the toxin molecule is composed of a conserved cysteine stabilized    core core globule  and perpendicular to it an entity constituted from the n and c terminal regions nc globule  the surface topology and overall hydrophobicity of the groove between the core and nc globules n groove is important for toxin activity and plays a role in selectivity to insect navs the n groove is flanked by glu  and tyr  which belong to the  pharmacophore  of scorpion  toxins and by the side chains of trp  and asn  that are important for receptor site recognition substitution of ala  by trp in the n groove uncoupled activity from binding suggesting that this region of the molecule is also involved in  voltage sensor trapping   the mode of action that typifies scorpion  toxins the involvement of the n groove in recognition of the receptor site which seems to require a defined topology as well as in sensor trapping which involves interaction with a moving channel region is puzzling on the basis of the mutagenesis studies we hypothesize that following binding to the receptor site the toxin undergoes a conformational change at the n groove region that facilitates the trapping of the voltage sensor in its activated position
