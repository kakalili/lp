early collapse is not an obligate step in protein folding
the dimensions and secondary structure content of two proteins which fold in a two state manner are measured within milliseconds of denaturant dilution using synchrotron based stopped flow small angle x ray scattering and far uv circular dichroism spectroscopy even upon a jump to strongly native conditions neither ubiquitin nor common type acylphosphatase contract prior to the major folding event circular dichroism and fluorescence indicate that negligible amounts of secondary and tertiary structures form in the burst phase thus for these two denatured states collapse and secondary structure formation are not energetically downhill processes even under aqueous low denaturant conditions in addition water appears to be as good a solvent as that with high concentrations of denaturant when considering the over all dimensions of the denatured state however the removal of denaturant does subtly alter the distribution of backbone dihedral    angles most likely resulting in a shift from the polyproline ii region to the helical region of the ramachandran map we consider the thermodynamic origins of these behaviors along with implications for folding mechanisms and computer simulations thereof
