In the folding of β-lactoglobulin (βLG), a predominantly β-sheet protein, a transient intermediate possessing an excess amount of non-native α-helix is formed within a few milliseconds. To characterize the early folding dynamics of βLG in terms of secondary structure content and compactness, we performed submillisecond-resolved circular dichroism (CD) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements. Time-resolved CD after rapid dilution of urea showed non-native α-helix formation within 200μs. Time-resolved SAXS showed that the radius of gyration (Rg) of the intermediate at 300μs was 23.3±0.7Å, indicating a considerable collapse from the unfolded state having Rg of 35.1±7.1Å. Further compaction to Rg of 21.2±0.3Å occurred with a time constant of 28±11ms. Pair distribution functions showed that the intermediate at 300μs comprises a single collapsed domain with a small fluctuating domain, which becomes more compact after the second collapse. Kinetic measurements in the presence of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol showed that the intermediate at several milliseconds possessed an increased amount of α-helix but similar Rg of 23.0±0.8Å, suggesting similarity of the shape of the intermediate in different solvents. Consequently, the initial collapse occurs globally to a compact state with a small fluctuating domain irrespective of the non-native α-helical contents. The second collapse of the fluctuating domain occurs in accordance with the reported stabilization of the non-native helix around strand A. The non-native helix around strand A might facilitate the formation of long-range contacts required for the folding of βLG.
