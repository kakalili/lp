loop relaxation a mechanism that explains the reduced specificity of rabbit   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase a member of the aldo keto reductase superfamily
the aldo keto reductase rabbit    hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase rb    hsd akr c  is less selective than other hsds since it exerts its activity both on androgens c  steroids and progestins c  steroids  in order to identify the molecular determinants responsible for this reduced selectivity binary nadph and ternary nadp testosterone complex structures were solved to    and    resolution respectively inspection of the cofactor binding cavity led to the identification of a new interaction between side chains of residues his  and lys   which cover the central phosphate chain of the cofactor reminiscent of the  safety belt  found in other aldo keto reductases testosterone is stabilized by a phenol benzene tunnel composed of side chains of numerous residues among which phe  which forces the steroid to take up an orientation markedly contrasting with that found in hsd ternary complexes reported combining structural site directed mutagenesis kinetic and fluorescence titration studies we found that the selectivity of rb    hsd is mediated by i the relaxation of loop b residues       partly controlled by the nature of residue    ii the nature of the residue found at position   and iii the residues found in the c terminal tail of the protein especially the side chain of the amino acid
