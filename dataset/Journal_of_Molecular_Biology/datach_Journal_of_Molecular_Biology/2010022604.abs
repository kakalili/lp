dna replication coupled pcna mono ubiquitination and polymerase switching in a human invitro system
translesion dna synthesis is a mechanism of dna damage tolerance and mono ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna is considered to play a key role in regulating the switch from replicative to translesion dna polymerases pols  in this study we analyzed effects of a replicative pol  on pcna mono ubiquitination with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme and ligase ube a hhr a rad a  rad  the results revealed that pcna interacting with pol  is a better target for ubiquitination and pcna mono ubiquitination could be coupled with dna replication consequently we could reconstitute replication coupled switching between pol  and a translesion pol pol   on an ultraviolet light irradiated template with this system we obtained direct evidence that polymerase switching reactions are stimulated by mono ubiquitination of pcna depending on a function of the ubiquitin binding zinc finger domain of pol   this study provides a framework for detailed analyses of molecular mechanisms of human pol switching and regulation of translesion dna synthesis
