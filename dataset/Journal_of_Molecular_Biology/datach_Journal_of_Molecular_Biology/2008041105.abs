the crystal structure of  alanine synthase from drosophila melanogaster reveals a homooctameric helical turn like assembly
alanine synthase  as is the third enzyme in the reductive pyrimidine catabolic pathway which is responsible for the breakdown of the nucleotide bases uracil and thymine in higher organisms it catalyzes the hydrolysis of n carbamyl  alanine and n carbamyl  aminoisobutyrate to the corresponding  amino acids  ass are grouped into two phylogenetically unrelated subfamilies a general eukaryote one and a fungal one to reveal the molecular architecture and understand the catalytic mechanism of the general eukaryote  as subfamily we determined the crystal structure of drosophila melanogaster  as to     resolution it shows a homooctameric assembly of the enzyme in the shape of a left handed helical turn in which tightly packed dimeric units are related by  fold symmetry such an assembly would allow formation of higher oligomers by attachment of additional dimers on both ends the subunit has a nitrilase like fold and consists of a central  sandwich with a layer of  helices packed against both sides however the core fold of the nitrilase superfamily enzymes is extended in d melanogaster  as by addition of several secondary structure elements at the n terminus the active site can be accessed from the solvent by a narrow channel and contains the triad of catalytic residues cys glu and lys conserved in nitrilase like enzymes
