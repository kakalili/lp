constraints for zinc finger linker design as inferred from x ray crystal structure of tandem zif   dna complexes
zinc finger proteins offer a versatile and effective framework for the recognition of dna binding sites by connecting multiple fingers together with canonical tgekp linkers a protein may be designed to recognize almost any desired target dna sequence however proteins containing more than three zinc fingers do not bind as tightly as one might predict and it appears that some type of strain is introduced when a six finger protein is constructed with canonical linkers in an attempt to understand the sources of this strain we have solved the    resolution x ray crystallographic structure of a complex that has two copies of the three finger zif  protein bound to adjacent sites on one duplex dna conceptually this is equivalent to a six finger protein in which the central linker has been removed and the complex has been allowed to  relax  to its most stable conformation as in other zif   dna complexes the dna is approximately linear and is slightly underwound surprisingly the structure of the complex is similar within    to an arrangement that would allow a canonical linker at the center of the complex and it seems possible that entropic effects involving the librational degrees of freedom in the complex could be important in determining optimal linker length
