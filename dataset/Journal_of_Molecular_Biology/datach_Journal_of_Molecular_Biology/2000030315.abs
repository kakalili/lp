a motif for quinone binding sites in respiratory and photosynthetic systems edited by r huber
many of the membrane bound protein complexes of respiratory and photosynthetic systems are reactive with quinones to date no clear structural relationship between sites that bind quinone has been defined apart from that in the homologous family of  type ii  photosynthetic reaction centres we show here that a structural element containing a weak sequence motif is common to the qa and qb sites of bacterial reaction centres and the qi site of the mitochondrial bc complex analyses of sequence databases indicate that this element may also be present in the psaa b subunits of photosystem i in the nd and nd subunits of complex i and possibly in the mitochondrial alternative quinol oxidase this represents a first step in the structural classification of quinone binding sites
