probing possible downhill folding native contact topology likely places a significant constraint on the folding cooperativity of proteins with    residues
experiments point to appreciable variations in folding cooperativity among natural proteins with approximately  residues indicating that the behaviors of these proteins are valuable for delineating the contributing factors to cooperative folding to explore the role of native topology in a protein s propensity to fold cooperatively and how native topology might constrain the degree of cooperativity achievable by a given set of physical interactions we compared folding unfolding kinetics simulated using three classes of native  centric c  chain models with different interaction schemes the approach was applied to two homologous  residue fragments from the peripheral subunit binding domain family and a  residue fragment of the n terminal domain of ribosomal protein l  free energy profiles as functions of native contact number were computed to assess the heights of thermodynamic barriers to folding in addition chevron plots of folding unfolding rates were constructed as functions of native stability to facilitate comparison with available experimental data although common g  like models with pairwise lennard jones type interactions generally fold less cooperatively than real proteins the rank ordering of cooperativity predicted by these models is consistent with experiment for the proteins investigated showing increasing folding cooperativity with increasing nonlocality of a protein s native contacts models that account for water expulsion desolvation barriers and models with many body nonadditive interactions generally entail higher degrees of folding cooperativity indicated by more linear model chevron plots but the rank ordering of cooperativity remains unchanged a robust experimentally valid rank ordering of model folding cooperativity independent of the multiple native  centric interaction schemes tested here argues that native topology places significant constraints on how cooperatively a protein can fold
