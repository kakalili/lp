role of the   activator interacting domain in bacterial transcription initiation
bacterial sigma factors are subunits of rna polymerase that direct the holoenzyme to specific sets of promoters in the genome and are a central element of regulating transcription most polymerase holoenzymes open the promoter and initiate transcription rapidly after binding however polymerase containing the members of the   family must be acted on by a transcriptional activator before dna opening and initiation occur a key domain in these transcriptional activators forms a hexameric aaa atpase that acts through conformational changes brought on by atp hydrolysis contacts between the transcriptional activator and   are primarily made through an n terminal   activator interacting domain aid  to better understand this mechanism of bacterial transcription initiation we characterized the   aid by nmr spectroscopy and other biophysical methods and show that it is an intrinsically disordered domain in   alone we identified a minimal construct of the aquifex aeolicus   aid that consists of two predicted helices and retains native like binding affinity for the transcriptional activator ntrc  using the ntrc atpase domain bound with the non hydrolyzable atp analog adp beryllium fluoride we studied the ntrc     aid complex using nmr spectroscopy we show that the   aid becomes structured after associating with the core loops of the transcriptional activators in their atp state and that the primary site of the interaction is the first predicted helix understanding this complex formed as the first step toward initiation will help unravel the mechanism of   bacterial transcription initiation
