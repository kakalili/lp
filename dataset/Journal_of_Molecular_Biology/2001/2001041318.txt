The presence of tissue factor is essential for factor VIIa (FVIIa) to reach its full catalytic potential. The previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that substitution of the EGF1 domain of factor VIIa with that of factor IX (FVII(IXegf1)a) results in a substantial decrease in TF-binding affinity and catalytic activity. Supporting simulations of the solution structures of Ca2+-bound factor VIIa and FVII(IXegf1)a with tissue factor are provided. Mutants are generated, based on the simulation model, to study the effect of EGF1 substitution on catalytic activity. The simulations show larger Gla-EGF1 and EGF1-EGF2 inter-domain motions for FVII(IXegf1)a than for factor VIIa. The catalytic domain of the chimeric factor VIIa has been disturbed and several surface loops in the catalytic domain of FVII(IXegf1)a (Loop 170s (170-182), Loop 1 (185-188) and Loop 2 (221A-225)) manifest larger position fluctuations than wild-type. The position of Loop 140s (142-152) of FVII(IXegf1)a, near the N terminus insertion site of the catalytic domain, shifts relative to factor VIIa, resulting in a slight alteration of the active site. The results suggest that these four loops mediate the effect of the EGF1 domain substitution on the S1 site and catalytic residues. To test the model, we prepared mutations of these surface loops, including four FVII mutants, D186A, K188A, L144A and R147A, a FVII mutant with multiple mutations (MM3: L144A + R147A + D186A) and a FVII mutant with Loop 170s partially deleted, Loop 170sdel. The catalytic activities towards a small peptidyl substrate decreased 2.4, 4.5 and 9-fold for Loop 170sdela (a, activated), L144Aa and D186Aa, respectively, while MM3a lost almost all catalytic activity. The combined results of the simulations and mutants provide insight into the mechanism by which tissue factor enhances factor VIIa catalytic activity.
