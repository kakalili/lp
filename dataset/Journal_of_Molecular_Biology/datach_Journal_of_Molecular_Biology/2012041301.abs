multistate allostery in response regulators phosphorylation and mutagenesis activate rega via alternate modes
response regulators rrs belong to two component signaling pathways widely prevalent in bacteria and lower eukaryotes for sensing and mediating responses to diverse environmental stress stimuli rrs are modular proteins and in most instances a receiver domain is found connected to diverse effector domain s  all receiver domains contain a conserved aspartate which is the site of phosphorylation by an associated histidine kinase rrs function as phosphorylatable signaling switches whereby histidine kinase mediated phosphorylation of rrs alters its output function it is largely unknown how phosphorylation of the receiver domain triggers activation of distally positioned effector domain s  although crystal structures have highlighted differences in conformations from comparisons of snapshots of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated receiver domains how this is translated into altered activity of a distal effector domain has remained a mystery while allosteric relays have been identified within receiver domains by nmr and x ray crystallography phosphorylated states of larger multidomain rrs have not yet been characterized in this study we have used amide hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the conformational dynamics of a multidomain rr rega from dictyostelium discoideum by comparisons of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states and an activating mutant our results reveal allosteric coupling between the site of phosphorylation and the activating mutation interestingly however the conformations of the effector domains in both instances are distinct hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry indicates that the  inactive  and  active  conformations exist as ensembles of multiple conformations this is consistent with the  conformational selection  model for describing phosphorylation dependent regulation of multidomain rrs
