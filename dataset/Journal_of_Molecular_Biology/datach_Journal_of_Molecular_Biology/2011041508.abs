a polypeptide  building block  for the  trefoil fold identified by  top down symmetric deconstruction
fibroblast growth factor  a member of the  fold symmetric  trefoil fold was subjected to a series of symmetric constraint mutations in a process termed  top down symmetric deconstruction   the mutations enforced a cumulative exact  fold symmetry upon symmetrically equivalent positions within the protein and were combined with a stability screen this process culminated in a  trefoil protein with exact  fold primary structure symmetry that exhibited excellent folding and stability properties subsequent fragmentation of the repeating primary structure motif yielded a  residue polypeptide capable of spontaneous assembly as a homotrimer producing a thermostable  trefoil architecture the results show that despite pronounced reduction in sequence complexity pure symmetry in the design of a foldable thermostable  trefoil fold is possible the top down symmetric deconstruction approach provides a novel alternative means to successfully identify a useful polypeptide  building block  for subsequent  bottom up  de novo design of target protein architecture
