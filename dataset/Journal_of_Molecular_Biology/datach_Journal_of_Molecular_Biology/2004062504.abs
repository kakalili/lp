multiple probes reveal a native like intermediate during low temperature refolding of ubiquitin
we investigate the refolding of ubiquitin phe trp ile ala ub  i a in a low temperature high viscosity buffer where folding is slowed so that apparent two state and three state mechanisms are readily distinguishable ub  i a forms a compact ensemble rapidly as judged from stopped flow small angle x ray scattering with a secondary structure signature similar to that of the native state as judged from stopped flow circular dichroism from   nm to   nm  but the fluorescence signature still resembles the guanidinium denatured state the compact ensemble forms over a range of solvent and temperature conditions the native fluorescence signature which requires the tryptophan residue to be packed tightly is acquired at least   times more slowly molecular dynamics simulations at   k show no contraction of the backbone in ethylene glycol buffer compared to pure aqueous buffer and no significant effect on the local backbone structure of the unfolded protein only at higher simulation temperature does a backbone contraction appear thus it appears unlikely that the aqueous ethylene glycol buffer fundamentally changes the folding mechanism of ubiquitin we suggest that ubiquitin forms a compact ensemble with native like secondary structure but without tight packing long before the native state
