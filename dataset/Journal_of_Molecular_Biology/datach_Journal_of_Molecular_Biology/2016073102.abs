challenges in structural approaches to cell modeling
computational modeling is essential for structural characterization of biomolecular mechanisms across the broad spectrum of scales adequate understanding of biomolecular mechanisms inherently involves our ability to model them structural modeling of individual biomolecules and their interactions has been rapidly progressing however in terms of the broader picture the focus is shifting toward larger systems up to the level of a cell such modeling involves a more dynamic and realistic representation of the interactomes in vivo in a crowded cellular environment as well as membranes and membrane proteins and other cellular components structural modeling of a cell complements computational approaches to cellular mechanisms based on differential equations graph models and other techniques to model biological networks imaging data etc structural modeling along with other computational and experimental approaches will provide a fundamental understanding of life at the molecular level and lead to important applications to biology and medicine a cross section of diverse approaches presented in this review illustrates the developing shift from the structural modeling of individual molecules to that of cell biology studies in several related areas are covered biological networks automated construction of three dimensional cell models using experimental data modeling of protein complexes prediction of non specific and transient protein interactions thermodynamic and kinetic effects of crowding cellular membrane modeling and modeling of chromosomes the review presents an expert opinion on the current state of the art in these various aspects of structural modeling in cellular biology and the prospects of future developments in this emerging field
