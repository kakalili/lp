design of a modular immunotoxin connected by polyionic adapter peptides
immunotoxins are genetically engineered fusion proteins of an antibody fv fragment and a toxin from bacteria or plants which function as anti cancer therapeutics here we describe a new generation of immunotoxins in which both proteins do not form a single fusion protein but are coupled specifically via cysteine containing polyionic fusion peptides the engineered pseudomonas exotoxin pe  was n terminally fused to the peptide e c in combination with the disulfide stabilized fv fragment of the tumor specific antibody b  which was extended by the peptide r cp the fusion peptides ensured a specific and covalent coupling of the fv fragment and the toxin the resulting immunotoxin was as active and as specific as an immunotoxin consisting of a fusion protein of the same antibody fragment connected to the toxin
