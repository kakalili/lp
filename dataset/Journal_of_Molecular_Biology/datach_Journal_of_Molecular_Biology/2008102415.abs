evidence for stepwise formation of amyloid fibrils by the mouse prion protein
the full length mouse prion protein moprp is shown to form worm like amyloid fibrils at ph  in the presence of    m nacl in a slow process that is accelerated at higher temperatures upon reduction in ph to  native moprp transforms into a mixture of soluble  rich oligomers and  rich monomers which exist in a slow concentration dependent equilibrium with each other it is shown that only the  rich oligomers and not the  rich monomers can form worm like amyloid fibrils the mechanism of formation of the worm like amyloid fibrils from the  rich oligomers has been studied with four different physical probes over a range of temperatures and over a range of protein concentrations the observed rate of fibrillation is the same whether measured by changes in ellipticity at   nm in thioflavin fluorescence upon binding or in the mean hydrodynamic radius the observed rate is significantly slower when monitored by total scattering intensity suggesting that lateral association of the worm like fibrils occurs after they form the activation energy for worm like fibril formation was determined to be   kj mol the observed rate of fibrillation increases with an increase in protein concentration but saturates at protein concentrations above    m the dependence of the observed rate of fibrillation on protein concentration suggests that aggregate growth is rate limiting at low protein concentration and that conformational change which is independent of protein concentration becomes rate limiting at higher protein concentrations hence fibril formation by moprp occurs in at least two separate steps longer but fewer worm like fibrils are seen to form at low protein concentration and shorter but more worm like fibrils are seen to form at higher protein concentrations this observation suggests that the  rich oligomers grow progressively in size to form critical higher order oligomers from which the worm like amyloid fibrils then form
