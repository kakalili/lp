a cleavable n terminal membrane anchor is involved in membrane binding of the escherichia coli srp receptor
different from eukaryotes the bacterial signal recognition particle srp receptor lacks a membrane tethering srp receptor sr   subunit and is composed of only the sr  homologue ftsy ftsy is a modular protein composed of three domains the n and g domains of ftsy are highly similar to the corresponding domains of ffh srp  and sr  and constitute the essential core of ftsy in contrast the weakly conserved n terminal a domain does not seem to be essential and its exact function is unknown our data show that a  amino acid long positively charged region at the n terminus of the a domain is involved in stabilizing the ftsy  secyeg interaction mutant analyses reveal that the positively charged residues are crucial for this function and we propose that the  amino acid region serves as a transient lipid anchor in its absence the activity of ftsy to support cotranslational integration is reduced to about   strikingly in vivo a truncated isoform of ftsy that lacks exactly these first  amino acids exists different from full length ftsy which primarily cofractionates with the membrane the n terminally truncated isoform is primarily present in the soluble fraction mutating the conserved glycine residue at position  prevents the formation of the truncated isoform and impairs the activity of ftsy in cotranslational targeting these data suggest that membrane binding and function of ftsy are in part regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the conserved  amino acid motif
