structural basis for the binding of an immunodominant peptide from myelin basic protein in different registers by two hla dr proteins edited by i wilson
susceptibility to multiple sclerosis ms is associated with certain mhc class ii haplotypes in particular hla dr  two dr  chains drb     and drb     are co expressed in the hla dr haplotype resulting in the formation of two functional cell surface heterodimers hla dr a dra     drb     and hla dr b dra     drb      both isotypes can present an immunodominant peptide of myelin basic protein mbp      to mbp specific t cells from ms patients we have determined the crystal structure of hla dr a complexed with mbp     to    resolution a comparison of this structure with that of hla dr b complexed with mbp     reported previously reveals that the peptide register is shifted by three residues such that the mbp peptide is bound in strikingly different conformations by the two mhc molecules this shift in binding register is attributable to a large p pocket in dr a which accommodates phe  in conjunction with a relatively shallow p pocket which is occupied by ile  in dr b by contrast the small p pocket accommodates val  while the deep p pocket is filled by phe  in both complexes however the c terminal half of the peptide is positioned higher in the binding groove than in other mhc class ii peptide structures as a result of the register shift different side chains of the mbp peptide are displayed for interaction with t cell receptors in the dr a and dr b complexes these results demonstrate that mhc molecules can impose different alignments and conformations on the same bound peptide as a consequence of topological differences in their peptide binding sites thereby creating distinct t cell epitopes
