amp sensing by dead box rna helicases
in eukaryotes cellular levels of adenosine monophosphate amp signal the metabolic state of the cell amp concentrations increase significantly upon metabolic stress such as glucose deprivation in yeast here we show that several dead box rna helicases are sensitive to amp which is not produced during atp hydrolysis by these enzymes we find that amp potently inhibits rna binding and unwinding by the yeast dead box helicases ded p mss  p and eif a however the yeast dead box helicases sub p and dbp p are not inhibited by amp our observations identify a subset of dead box helicases as enzymes with the capacity to directly link changes in amp concentrations to rna metabolism
