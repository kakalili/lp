crystallographic and mass spectrometric characterisation of eif e with n alkylated cap derivatives
structural complexes of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor e eif e with a series of n alkylated guanosine derivative mrna cap analogue structures have been characterised mass spectrometry was used to determine apparent gas phase equilibrium dissociation constants kd values of     m     m and     m for eif e with  methyl gtp m gtp  gtp and gmp respectively for tight and specific binding to the eif e mononucleotide binding site there seems to be a clear requirement for guanosine derivatives to possess both the delocalised positive charge of the n methylated guanine system and at least one phosphate group we show that the n benzylated monophosphates  benzyl gmp bn gmp and  p fluorobenzyl gmp fbn gmp bind eif e substantially more tightly than non n alkylated guanosine derivatives kd values of    m and    m respectively  the eif e complex crystal structures with bn gmp and fbn gmp show that additional favourable contacts of the benzyl groups with eif e contribute binding energy that compensates for loss of the  and  phosphates the n benzyl groups pack into a hydrophobic pocket behind the two tryptophan side chains that are involved in the cation   stacking interaction between the cap and the eif e mononucleotide binding site this pocket is formed by an induced fit in which one of the tryptophan residues involved in cap binding flips through    relative to structures with n methylated cap derivatives this and other observations made here will be useful in the design of new families of eif e inhibitors which may have potential therapeutic applications in cancer
