characterization of conformational and dynamic properties of natively unfolded human and mouse  synuclein ensembles by nmr implication for aggregation
conversion of human  synuclein as from the free soluble state to the insoluble fibrillar state has been implicated in the etiology of parkinson s disease human as is highly homologous in amino acid sequence to mouse as which contains seven substitutions including the a t that has been linked to familial parkinson s disease and including five substitutions in the c terminal region it has been shown that the rate of fibrillation is highly dependent on the exact sequence of the protein and mouse as is reported to aggregate more rapidly than human as in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance experiments of mouse and human as at supercooled temperatures    k are used to understand the effect of sequence on conformational fluctuations in the disordered ensembles and to relate these to differences in propensities to aggregate we show that both as are natively unfolded at low temperature with different propensities to secondary structure backbone dynamics and long range contacts across the protein mouse as exhibits a higher propensity to helical conformation around the c terminal substitutions as well as the loss of transient long range contacts from the c to the n terminal end and hydrophobic central regions of the protein relative to human as lack of back folding from the c terminal end of mouse as exposes the n terminal region which is shown by  n relaxation experiments to be very restricted in mobility relative to human as we propose that the restricted mobility in the n terminal region may arise from transient interchain interactions suggesting that the n terminal ktk e q gv repeats may serve as initiation sites for aggregation in mouse as these transient interchain interactions coupled with a non a  amyloid component nac region that is both more exposed and has a higher propensity to  structure may accelerate the rate of fibril formation of as
