regulation of hiv  latency by chromatin structure and nuclear architecture
current antiretroviral therapies fail to cure hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  infection because hiv  persists as a transcriptionally inactive provirus in resting memory cd  t cells multiple molecular events are known to regulate hiv  gene expression yet the mechanisms governing the establishment and maintenance of latency remain incompletely understood here we summarize different molecular aspects of viral latency from its establishment in resting cd  t cells to the mechanisms involved in the reactivation of latent viral reservoirs we focus on the relevance of chromatin structure and nuclear architecture in determining the transcriptional fate of integrated hiv  genomes in light of recent findings indicating that proximity to specific subnuclear neighborhoods regulates hiv  gene expression
