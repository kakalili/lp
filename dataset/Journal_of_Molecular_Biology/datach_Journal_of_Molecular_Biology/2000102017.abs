alteration of a single tryptophan residue of the cellulose binding domain blocks secretion of the erwinia chrysanthemicel cellulase ex egz via the type ii system edited by b holland
cel  formerly known as endoglucanase z of erwinia chrysanthemi is secreted by the out type ii pathway previous studies have shown that the catalytic domain cd  linker region lr and cellulose binding domain cbd each contain information needed for secretion the aim of this work was to further investigate the secretion related information present in the cbdcel  firstly deleting a surface exposed flexible loop had no effect on secretion this indicated that some structural freedom is tolerated by the type ii system secondly mutation of a single tryptophan residue previously shown to be important for binding to cellulose i e trp  was found also to impair secretion this indicated that the flat cellulose binding surface of cbdcel contains secretion related information thirdly cbdcel was substituted by the cbdegg of alteromonas haloplanctis endoglucanase g yielding a hybrid protein cdcel lrcel cbdegg that exhibited   identity with cel  including the trp  residue the hybrid protein was not secreted this indicated that the trp  residue is necessary but not sufficient for secretion here we propose a model in which the secretion of cel involves a transient intramolecular interaction between the cellulose binding surface of cbdcel and a region close to the entry into the active site in cdcel  once secreted the protein may then open out to allow the cellulose binding surface of cbdcel to interact with the surface of the cellulose substrate an implication of this model is that protein molecules fold to a specific secretion competent conformation prior to secretion that is different from the folding state of the secreted species
