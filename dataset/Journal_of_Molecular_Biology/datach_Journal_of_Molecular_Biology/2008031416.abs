a structural analysis of the catalytic mechanism of methionine sulfoxide reductase a from neisseria meningitidis
the methionine sulfoxide reductases msrs are thioredoxin dependent oxidoreductases that catalyse the reduction of the sulfoxide function of the oxidized methionine residues these enzymes have been shown to regulate the life span of a wide range of microbial and animal species and to play the role of physiological virulence determinant of some bacterial pathogens two structurally unrelated classes of msrs exist msra and msrb with opposite stereoselectivity towards the r and s isomers of the sulfoxide function respectively both msrs share a similar three step chemical mechanism including   the formation of a sulfenic acid intermediate on the catalytic cys with the concomitant release of the product  methionine   the formation of an intramonomeric disulfide bridge between the catalytic and the regenerating cys and   the reduction of the disulfide bridge by thioredoxin or its homologues in this study four structures of the msra domain of the pilb protein from neisseria meningitidis representative of four catalytic intermediates of the msra catalytic cycle were determined by x ray crystallography the free reduced form the michaelis like complex the sulfenic acid intermediate and the disulfide oxidized forms they reveal a conserved overall structure up to the formation of the sulfenic acid intermediate while a large conformational switch is observed in the oxidized form the results are discussed in relation to those proposed from enzymatic nmr and theoretical chemistry studies in particular the substrate specificity and binding the catalytic scenario of the reductase step and the relevance and role of the large conformational change observed in the oxidized form are discussed
