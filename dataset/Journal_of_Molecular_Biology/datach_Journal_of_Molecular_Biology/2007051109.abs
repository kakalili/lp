evolution of an interloop disulfide bond in high affinity antibody mimics based on fibronectin type iii domain and selected by yeast surface display molecular convergence with single domain camelid and shark antibodies
the  th human fibronectin type iii domain  fn  is one of several protein scaffolds used to design and select families of proteins that bind with high affinity and specificity to macromolecular targets to date the highest affinity  fn variants have been selected by mrna display of libraries generated by randomizing all three complementarity determining region like loops of the  fn scaffold the sub nanomolar affinities of such antibody mimics have been attributed to the extremely large size of the library accessible by mrna display    unique sequences here we describe the selection and affinity maturation of  fn based antibody mimics with dissociation constants as low as   pm selected from significantly smaller libraries      different sequences  which were constructed by randomizing only   fn residues the finding that two adjacent loops in human  fn provide a large enough variable surface area to select high affinity antibody mimics is significant because a smaller deviation from wild type  fn sequence is associated with a higher stability of selected antibody mimics our results also demonstrate the utility of an affinity maturation strategy that led to a   fold improvement in affinity by maximizing sampling of sequence space close to the original selected antibody mimic a striking feature of the highest affinity antibody mimics selected against lysozyme is a pair of cysteines on adjacent loops in positions  and   which are critical for the affinity of the  fn variant for its target and are close enough to form a disulfide bond the selection of this cysteine pair is structurally analogous to the natural evolution of disulfide bonds found in new antigen receptors of cartilaginous fish and in camelid heavy chain variable domains we propose that future library designs incorporating such an interloop disulfide will further facilitate the selection of high affinity highly stable antibody mimics from libraries accessible to phage and yeast surface display methods
