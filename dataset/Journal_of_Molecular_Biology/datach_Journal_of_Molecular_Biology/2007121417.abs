specific interaction between ef g and rrf and its implication for gtp dependent ribosome splitting into subunits
after termination of protein synthesis the bacterial ribosome is split into its  s and  s subunits by the action of ribosome recycling factor rrf and elongation factor g ef g in a guanosine   triphosphate gtp hydrolysis dependent manner based on a previous cryo electron microscopy study of ribosomal complexes we have proposed that the binding of ef g to an rrf containing posttermination ribosome triggers an interdomain rotation of rrf which destabilizes two strong intersubunit bridges b a and b  and ultimately separates the two subunits here we present a    fourier shell correlation cutoff of   cryo electron microscopy map of a  s ef g guanosine       imido triphosphate rrf complex and a quasi atomic model derived from it showing the interaction between ef g and rrf on the  s subunit in the presence of the noncleavable gtp analogue guanosine       imido triphosphate the detailed information in this model and a comparative analysis of ef g structures in various nucleotide and ribosome bound states show how rotation of the rrf head domain may be triggered by various domains of ef g for validation of our structural model all known mutations in ef g and rrf that relate to ribosome recycling have been taken into account more importantly our results indicate a substantial conformational change in the switch i region of ef g suggesting that a conformational signal transduction mechanism similar to that employed in transfer rna translocation on the ribosome by ef g translates a large scale movement of ef g s domain iv induced by gtp hydrolysis into the domain rotation of rrf that eventually splits the ribosome into subunits
