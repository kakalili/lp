loopy proteins appear conserved in evolution
over the last decade structural biologists have unravelled many proteins that appear natively disordered common assumptions are that many of these proteins adopt structure through binding and that the structural flexibility enables them to adopt different functions here we investigated regions of more than  sequence consecutive residues that have no regular secondary structure nors  analysing  entirely sequenced organisms we predicted five times as many proteins with nors regions loopy proteins in eukaryotes    than in prokaryotes and archaeas    thousands of these nors regions were over   residues long the amino acid composition of nors regions differed from that of loops in pdb although nors proteins had significantly more residues in low complexity regions than other proteins simple cut off thresholds for sequence bias missed most nors regions on average nors regions were evolutionarily at least as conserved as their flanking regions furthermore yeast proteins with nors regions had more protein  protein interaction partners than other proteins regulatory and transcription related functions were over represented in loopy proteins biosynthesis and energy metabolism were under represented overall our analysis confirmed that proteins with non regular structures appear to play important functional roles and they may adopt as yet unknown types of protein structures
