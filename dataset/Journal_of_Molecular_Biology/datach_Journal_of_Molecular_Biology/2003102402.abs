a structural analysis of the interaction between ncd tail and tubulin protofilaments
ncd is a minus end directed kinesin like motor which binds to microtubules with its motor domain and its cargo domain as well typical of retrograde motors the motor domain of ncd locates to the c terminal end of the polypeptide chain and hence the cargo domain constitutes the n terminal region to date several studies have investigated the interaction properties of the motor domain with microtubules but very few structural data are available about the tail itself or its interaction with microtubules as cargo here we applied cryo electron microscopy and helical d image reconstruction to  protofilament microtubules decorated with an ncd tail fragment n terminal residues      named nt  in our study the ncd tail shows a behaviour resembling filamentous maps such as tau protein exhibiting a highly flexible structure with no large globular domains nt binds to four different sites on the outer side of microtubules within the proximity of the kinesin motor binding site two of these sites locate within the groove between two neighbouring protofilaments and appear as strong binding sites while the other two sites located at the outer rim appear to play a secondary role in addition the ncd tail fragment induces the formation of large protofilament sheets suggesting a tail induced modification of lateral protofilament contacts
