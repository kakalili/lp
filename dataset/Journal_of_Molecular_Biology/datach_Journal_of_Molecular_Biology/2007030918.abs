cross reactivity studies of an anti plasmodium vivax apical membrane antigen  monoclonal antibody binding and structural characterisation
apical membrane antigen  ama  has an important but as yet uncharacterised role in host cell invasion by the malaria parasite plasmodium the protein which is quite conserved between plasmodium species comprises an ectoplasmic region a single transmembrane segment and a small cytoplasmic domain the ectoplasmic region which can induce protective immunity in animal models of human malaria is a leading vaccine candidate that has entered clinical trials the monoclonal antibody f     raised against the recombinant ectoplasmic region of ama from plasmodium vivax cross reacts with homologues from plasmodium knowlesi plasmodium cynomolgi plasmodium berghei and plasmodium falciparum as shown by immunofluorescence assays on mature schizonts the binding of f    to recombinant ama from both p vivax and p falciparum was measured by surface plasmon resonance revealing an apparent affinity constant that is about   fold weaker for the cross reacting antigen when compared to the cognate antigen crystal structure analysis of fab f    complexed to ama from p vivax and p falciparum shows that the monoclonal antibody recognises a discontinuous epitope located on domain iii of the ectoplasmic region the major component being a loop containing a cystine knot the structures provide a basis for understanding the cross reactivity antibody contacts are made mainly to main chain and invariant side chain atoms of ama  contact antigen residues that differ in sequence are located at the periphery of the antigen binding site and can be accommodated at the interface between the two components of the complex the implications for ama vaccine development are discussed
