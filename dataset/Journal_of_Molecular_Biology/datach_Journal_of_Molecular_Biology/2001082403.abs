structure of the c domain from novel protein kinase c  a membrane binding model for ca  independent c domains edited by r huber
protein kinase c  pkc  is a member of the novel pkcs which are activated by acidic phospholipids diacylglycerol and phorbol esters but lack the calcium dependence of classical pkc isotypes the crystal structures of the c domain of pkc  crystallized both in the absence and in the presence of the two acidic phospholipids   dicaproyl sn phosphatidyl l serine dcps and   dicaproyl sn phosphatidic acid dcpa  have now been determined at     and    resolution respectively the central feature of the pkc  c domain structure is an eight stranded antiparallel   sandwich with a type ii topology similar to that of the c domains from phospholipase c and from novel pkc  despite the similar topology important differences are found between the structures of c domains from pkcs  and   suggesting they be considered as different pkc subclasses site directed mutagenesis experiments and structural changes in the pkc  c domain from crystals with dcps or dcpa indicate though phospholipids were not visible in these structures that loops joining strands     and     participate in the binding to anionic membranes the different behavior in membrane binding and activation between pkc  and classical pkcs appears to originate in localized structural changes which include a major reorganization of the region corresponding to the calcium binding pocket in classical pkcs a mechanism is proposed for the interaction of the pkc  c domain with model membranes that retains basic features of the docking of c domains from classical calcium dependent pkcs
