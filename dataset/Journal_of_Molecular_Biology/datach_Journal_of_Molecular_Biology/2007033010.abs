a quaternary snare  synaptotagmin  ca   phospholipid complex in neurotransmitter release
the function of synaptotagmin as a ca  sensor in neurotransmitter release involves ca  dependent phospholipid binding to its two c domains but this activity alone does not explain why ca  binding to the c b domain is more critical for release than ca  binding to the c a domain synaptotagmin also binds to snare complexes which are central components of the membrane fusion machinery and displaces complexins from the snares however it is unclear how phospholipid binding to synaptotagmin is coupled to snare binding and complexin displacement using supported lipid bilayers deposited within microfluidic channels we now show that ca  induces simultaneous binding of synaptotagmin to phospholipid membranes and snare complexes resulting in an intimate quaternary complex that we name sscap complex mutagenesis experiments show that ca  binding to the c b domain is critical for sscap complex formation and displacement of complexin providing a clear rationale for the preponderant role of the c b domain in release this and other correlations between the effects of mutations on sscap complex formation and their functional effects in vivo suggest a key role for this complex in release we propose a model whereby the highly positive electrostatic potential at the tip of the sscap complex helps to induce membrane fusion during release
