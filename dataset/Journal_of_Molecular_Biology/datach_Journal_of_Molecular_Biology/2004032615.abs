highly discriminating protein  protein interaction specificities in the context of a conserved binding energy hotspot
we explore the thermodynamic basis for high affinity binding and specificity in conserved protein complexes using colicin endonuclease  immunity protein complexes as our model system we investigated the ability of each colicin specific immunity protein im  im  im and im  to bind the endonuclease dnase domains of colicins e  e and e in vitro and compared these to the previously studied colicin e  we find that high affinity binding kd     m is a common feature of cognate colicin dnase  im protein complexes as are non cognate protein  protein associations which are generally      fold weaker comparative alanine scanning of im and im residues involved in binding the e dnase revealed similar behaviour to that of the two proteins binding the e dnase helix iii forms a conserved binding energy hotspot with specificity residues from helix ii only contributing favourably in a cognate interaction a combination we have termed as  dual recognition   significant differences are seen however in the number and side chain chemistries of specificity sites that contribute to cognate binding in im  asp  from helix ii dominates colicin e specificity whereas in im several hydrophobic residues including position   leucine  help define its colicin specificity a similar distribution of specificity sites was seen using phage display where with im as the template a library of randomised sequences was generated in helix ii and the library panned against either the e or e dnase position  was the dominant specificity site recovered in all e dnase selected clones whereas a number of im specificity sites were recovered in e dnase selected clones including position   in order to probe the relationship between biological specificity and in vitro binding affinity we compared the degree of protection afforded to bacteria against colicin e toxicity by a set of immunity proteins whose affinities for the e dnase differed by up to ten orders of magnitude this analysis indicated that the kd required for complete biological protection is lt    m and that the  affinity window  over which the selection of novel immunity protein specificities likely evolves is         m this comprehensive survey of colicin dnase  immunity protein complexes illustrates how high affinity protein  protein interactions can be very discriminating even though binding is dominated by a conserved hotspot with single or multiple specificity sites modulating the overall binding free energy we discuss these results in the context of other conserved protein complexes and suggest that they point to a generic specificity mechanism in divergently evolved protein  protein interactions
