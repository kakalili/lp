tests of the single hit dna damage model
the algebra of target theory for damage by radiation was laid out by atwood and norman in    their equations provide a widely embraced framework for distinguishing single hit and multi hit mechanisms of damage the present work asks whether in vitro damage to dna duplexes by different agents affects amplification by the polymerase chain reaction pcr in a single hit manner real time monitoring of fluorescent pcr product qpcr was used to measure the fraction of dna s surviving doses d of three damaging agents   irradiation dnase i and uv radiation the log fraction surviving was compared to the best fit straight line predicted for a random single hit model lns kd  human dna targets for analysis were segments of multiple nested dna lengths from the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes within   of                and   bases for  irradiation the results were consistent with a single hit model for all segment sizes in the case of dnase i the shortest segment    bp  for both genomic and mitochondrial dna experienced more damage at low concentrations of dnase than the random single hit model predicted conversely in the case of uv all segments of the nuclear target gene were less damaged at low doses and more damaged at high doses than predicted by the one hit model these deviations from the predictions of a random single hit model were interpreted as evidence for concerted activity in the case of dnase and of a multi hit sequence dependent mechanism in the case of uv perhaps due to the accumulation of lesions that slowed but did not entirely block taq polymerase elongation
