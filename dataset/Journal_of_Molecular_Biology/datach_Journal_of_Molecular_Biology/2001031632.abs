an unexpected extended conformation for the third tpr motif of the peroxin pex from trypanosoma brucei edited by d rees
a number of helix rich protein motifs are involved in a variety of critical protein protein interactions in living cells one of these is the tetratrico peptide repeat tpr motif that is involved amongst others in cell cycle regulation chaperone function and post translation modifications so far these helix rich tpr motifs have always been observed to be a compact unit of two helices interacting with each other in antiparallel fashion here we describe the structure of the first three tpr motifs of the peroxin pex from trypanosoma brucei the causative agent of sleeping sickness peroxins are proteins involved in peroxisome glycosome and glyoxysome biogenesis pex is the receptor of the proteins targeted to these organelles by the  peroxisomal targeting signal    a c terminal tripeptide called pts  the first two of the three tpr motifs of t brucei pex appear to adopt the canonical antiparallel helix hairpin structure in contrast the third tpr motif of pex has a dramatically different conformation in our crystals the two helices that were supposed to form a hairpin are folded into one single    long continuous helix such a conformation has never been observed before for a tpr motif this raises interesting questions including the potential functional importance of a  jack knife  conformational change in tpr motifs
