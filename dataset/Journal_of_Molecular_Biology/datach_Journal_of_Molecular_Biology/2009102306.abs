cell cycle regulatory effects of retinoic acid and forskolin are mediated by the cyclin c gene
as a partner of cyclin dependent kinase cdk   cyclin c controls cellular proliferation and together with cdk  represses gene transcription in this study we showed that the highly expressed cyclin c gene is a direct target of the nuclear hormone all trans retinoic acid ra in hek  human embryonal kidney cells the ra receptor rar   associates with a cyclin c promoter region containing two rar binding sites the cyclin c gene also directly responds to the camp activator forskolin via the transcription factor creb  camp response element binding protein   for which we identified four binding sites within the first    bp of its promoter rar  and creb show functional convergence via the corepressor ncor  which controls in particular the forskolin response of cyclin c the histone deacetylases      and  are involved in the basal expression of cyclin c but in hek  and mcf  human breast carcinoma cells the antiproliferative effects of the histone deacetylase inhibitor saha suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid are not mediated by cyclin c however cell cycle progressing effects of all trans ra and forskolin are dependent on cyclin c expression levels this suggests that the primary regulation of cyclin c by all trans ra and forskolin mediates some of the cell cycle control actions of these compounds
