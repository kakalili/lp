crystal structure of the motor domain of the human kinetochore protein cenp e
the human kinetochore is a highly complex macromolecular structure that connects chromosomes to spindle microtubules mts in order to facilitate accurate chromosome segregation centromere associated protein e cenp e  a member of the kinesin superfamily is an essential component of the kinetochore since it is required to stabilize the attachment of chromosomes to spindle mts to develop tension across aligned chromosomes to stabilize spindle poles and to satisfy the mitotic checkpoint here we report the    resolution crystal structure of the motor domain and linker region of human cenp e with mgadp bound in the active site this structure displays subtle but important differences compared to the structures of human eg and conventional kinesin our structure reveals that the cenp e linker region is in a  docked  position identical to that in the human plus end directed conventional kinesin cenp e has many advantages as a potential anti mitotic drug target and this crystal structure of human cenp e will provide a starting point for high throughput virtual screening of potential inhibitors
