apo states of calmodulin and cabp control cav voltage gated calcium channel function through direct competition for the iq domain
in neurons binding of calmodulin cam or calcium binding protein  cabp  to the cav  l type voltage gated calcium channel iq domain endows the channel with diametrically opposed properties cam causes calcium dependent inactivation and limits calcium entry whereas cabp blocks calcium dependent inactivation cdi and allows sustained calcium influx here we combine isothermal titration calorimetry with cell based functional measurements and mathematical modeling to show that these calcium sensors behave in a competitive manner that is explained quantitatively by their apo state binding affinities for the iq domain this competition can be completely blocked by covalent tethering of cam to the channel further we show that ca  cam has a sub picomolar affinity for the iq domain that is achieved without drastic alteration of calcium binding properties the observation that the apo forms of cam and cabp compete with each other demonstrates a simple mechanism for direct modulation of cav function and suggests a means by which excitable cells may dynamically tune cav activity
