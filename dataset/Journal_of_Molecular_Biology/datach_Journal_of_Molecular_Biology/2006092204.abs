the hb a variant    asp  leu disrupts hb s polymerization by a novel mechanism
polymerization of a   mixture of hemoglobin s hb s and the artificial mutant hba  leu produces a dramatic morphological change in the polymer domains in   m phosphate buffer that are a characteristic feature of polymer formation instead of feathery domains with quasi  fold symmetry that characterize polymerization of hb s and all previously known mixtures such as hb a s and hb f s mixtures these domains are compact structures of quasi spherical symmetry solubility of hb s a  leu mixtures was similar to that of hb s f mixtures kinetics of polymerization indicated that homogeneous nucleation rates of hb s a  leu mixtures were the same as those of hb s f mixtures while exponential polymer growth b of hb s a  leu mixtures were about three times slower than those of hb s f mixtures differential interference contrast dic image analysis also showed that fibers in the mixture appear to elongate between three and five times more slowly than in equivalent hb s f mixtures by direct measurements of exponential growth of mass of polymer in a domain we propose that these results of hb s a  leu mixtures arise from a non productive binding of the hybrid species of this mixture to the end of the growing polymer this  cap  prohibits growth of polymers but by nature is temporary so that the net effect is a lowered growth rate of polymers such a cap is consistent with known features of the structure of the hb s polymer domains would be more spherulitic because slower growth provides more opportunity for fiber bending to spread domains from their initial  fold symmetry moreover since monomer depletion proceeds more slowly in this mixture more homogeneous nucleation events occur and the resulting gel has a far more granular character than normally seen in mixtures of non polymerizing hemoglobins with hb s this mixture is likely to be less stiff than polymerized mixtures of other hybrids such as hb s with hbf potentially providing a novel approach to therapy
