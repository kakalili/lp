structural tightening and interdomain communication in the catalytic cycle of phosphoglycerate kinase
changes in amide nh chemical shift and hydrogen exchange rates as phosphoglycerate kinase progresses through its catalytic cycle have been measured to assess whether they correlate with changes in hydrogen bonding within the protein four representative states were compared the free enzyme a product complex containing  phosphoglyceric acid  pg  a substrate complex containing adp and a transition state analogue tsa complex containing a pg  alf    adp moiety there are an overall increases in amide protection from hydrogen exchange when the protein binds the substrate and product ligands and an additional increase when the tsa complex is formed this is consistent with stabilisation of the protein structure by ligand binding however there is no correlation between the chemical shift changes and the protection factor changes indicating that the protection factor changes are not associated with an overall shortening of hydrogen bonds in the protected ground state but rather can be ascribed to the properties of the high energy exchange competent state therefore an overall structural tightening mechanism is not supported by the data instead we observed that some cooperativity is exhibited in the n domain such that within this domain the changes induced upon forming the tsa complex are an intensification of those induced by binding pg furthermore chemical shift changes induced by pg binding extend through the interdomain region to the c domain  sheet highlighting a network of hydrogen bonds between the domains that suggests interdomain communication interdomain communication is also indicated by amide protection in one domain being significantly altered by binding of substrate to the other even where no associated change in the structure of the substrate free domain is indicated by chemical shifts hence the communication between domains is also manifested in the accessibility of higher energy exchange competent states overall the data that are consistent with structural tightening relate to defined regions and are close to the pg binding site and in the hinge regions of  phosphoglycerate kinase
