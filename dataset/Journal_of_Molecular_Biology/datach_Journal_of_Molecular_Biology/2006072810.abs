structural basis for detoxification and oxidative stress protection in membranes
synthesis of mediators of fever pain and inflammation as well as protection against reactive molecules and oxidative stress is a hallmark of the mapeg superfamily membrane associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism  the structure of a mapeg member rat microsomal glutathione transferase  at     resolution solved here in complex with glutathione by electron crystallography defines the active site location and a cytosolic domain involved in enzyme activation the glutathione binding site is found to be different from that of the canonical soluble glutathione transferases the architecture of the homotrimer supports a catalytic mechanism involving subunit interactions and reveals both cytosolic and membraneous substrate entry sites providing a rationale for the membrane location of the enzyme
