single particle image reconstruction of a tetramer of hiv integrase bound to dna
the hiv integrase enzyme in catalyzes the initial dna breaking and joining reactions that integrate viral dna in the host chromosome structures for individual in domains have been determined by x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy but the structure of the complete in  dna complex has remained elusive homogeneous complexes of in tetramers were assembled on dna three way junction substrates designed to resemble integration intermediates electron microscopy and single particle image analysis of these complexes yielded a three dimensional reconstruction at      resolution the map of the in  dna complex displays four lobes of density      in diameter three of the lobes form a roughly triangular base with a central channel      in diameter the fourth lobe is centered between two lobes and extends      above the base we propose that the central channel tethers the target dna and two of the lobes may bind the ends of the viral dna the asymmetry of the complex is a feature not incorporated in previous structural models and potentially provides the first view of an asymmetric reaction intermediate
