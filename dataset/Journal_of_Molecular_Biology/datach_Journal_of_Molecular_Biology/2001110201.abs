multi targeted antifolates aimed at avoiding drug resistance form covalent closed inhibitory complexes with human and escherichia coli thymidylate synthases edited by i a wilson
crystal structures of four pyrrolo   d pyrimidine based antifolate compounds developed as inhibitors of thymidylate synthase ts in a strategy to circumvent drug resistance have been determined in complexes with their in vivo target human thymidylate synthase and with the structurally best characterized escherichia coli enzyme to resolutions of       the    crystal structure of a complex of human ts with one of the inhibitors the multi targeted antifolate ly    demonstrates that this compound induces a  closed  enzyme conformation and leads to formation of a covalent bond between enzyme and substrate this structure is one of the first liganded human ts structures and its solution was aided by mutation to facilitate crystallization structures of three other pyrrolo   d pyrimidine based antifolates in complex with escherichia coli ts confirm the orientation of this class of inhibitors in the active site specific interactions between the polyglutamyl moiety and a positively charged groove on the enzyme surface explain the marked increase in affinity of the pyrrolo   d pyrimidine inhibitors once they are polyglutamylated as mediated in vivo by the cellular enzyme folyl polyglutamate synthetase
