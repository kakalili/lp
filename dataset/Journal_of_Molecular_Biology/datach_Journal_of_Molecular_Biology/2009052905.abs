molecular interactions between hiv  integrase and the two viral dna ends within the synaptic complex that mediates concerted integration
a macromolecular nucleoprotein complex in retrovirus infected cells termed the preintegration complex is responsible for the concerted integration of linear viral dna genome into host chromosomes isolation of sufficient quantities of the cytoplasmic preintegration complexes for biochemical and biophysical analysis is difficult we investigated the architecture of hiv  nucleoprotein complexes involved in the concerted integration pathway in vitro hiv  integrase in non covalently juxtaposes two viral dna termini forming the synaptic complex a transient intermediate in the integration pathway and shares properties associated with the preintegration complex in slowly processes two nucleotides from the   oh ends and performs the concerted insertion of two viral dna ends into target dna in remains associated with the concerted integration product termed the strand transfer complex the synaptic complex and strand transfer complex can be isolated by native agarose gel electrophoresis in gel fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements demonstrated that the energy transfer efficiencies between the juxtaposed cy and cy    end labeled viral dna ends in the synaptic complex       was significantly different from that observed in the strand transfer complex        the calculated distances were      and      respectively dnasei footprint analysis of the complexes revealed that in protects u and u dna sequences up to    bp from the end suggesting two in dimers were bound per terminus enhanced dnasei cleavages were observed at nucleotide positions  and  from the terminus on u but not on u  suggesting independent assembly events protein  protein cross linking of in within these complexes revealed the presence of dimers tetramers and a larger multimer  gt   kda  our results suggest a new model where two in dimers individually assemble on u and u ends before the non covalent juxtaposition of two viral dna ends producing the synaptic complex
