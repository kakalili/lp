both yidc and secyeg are required for translocation of the periplasmic loops  and  of the multispanning membrane protein tatc
tatc a subunit of the twin arginine translocase is a  membrane spanning protein exposing three periplasmic loops we have used tatc as a model system to examine how multispanning proteins insert into the membrane to assay translocation of each of the three loops of tatc across the membrane we used trypsin mapping proteinase k mapping and chemical modification methods here we show that the signal recognition particle is required for targeting tatc to the inner membrane of escherichia coli while translocation of loops  and  is strictly dependent on the sec translocase and the yidc insertase translocation of loop  does not depend on the translocase or insertase none of the periplasmic loops require seca or the proton motive force for membrane translocation this work demonstrates a strategy where all the loops of a multispanning membrane protein can be monitored individually the membrane translocation mechanism of each periplasmic loop can be complex with different energy and translocase requirements for a multispanning membrane protein
