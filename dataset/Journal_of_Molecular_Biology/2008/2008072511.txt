We report the discovery of a novel cyanobacteriochrome, the green/red photoreceptor AnPixJ (All1069), isolated from the heterocyst-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120. Cyanobacteriochromes are a recently emerging tetrapyrrole-based photoreceptor superfamily that are distantly related to the conventional red/far-red photoreceptor phytochromes (Phys). The chromophore-binding domains of AnPixJ produced in cyanobacterial and Escherichia coli cells both showed a reversible and full photoconversion between a green-absorbing form (λmax=543 nm) and a red-absorbing form (λmax=648 nm). Denaturation analysis revealed that the green-absorbing form and the red-absorbing form covalently ligated phycocyanobilin with E-configuration and Z-configuration at the C15C16 double bond, respectively. Time-resolved spectral analysis showed the formation of the first intermediate state peaking at 680 nm from the dark-stable red-absorbing form. This step resembles the first photoconversion step from the red-absorbing form to the red-shifted lumi-R intermediate state of the Phys. These results suggest that the Pr of AnPixJ is almost equivalent to that of the Phys and starts a primary photoreaction with Z-to-E isomerization in a mechanism similar to that in the Phys, but is finally photoconverted to the unique green-absorbing form.
