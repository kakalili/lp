revealing a concealed intermediate that forms after the rate limiting step of refolding of the sh domain of pi kinase
kinetic and equilibrium studies of the folding and unfolding of the sh domain of the pi kinase have been used to identify a folding intermediate that forms after the rate limiting step on the folding pathway folding and unfolding in urea as well as in guanidine hydrochloride gdnhcl  were studied by monitoring changes in the intrinsic fluorescence or in the far uv circular dichroism cd of the protein the two probes yield non coincident equilibrium transitions for unfolding in urea indicating that an intermediate i exists in equilibrium with native n and unfolded u protein during unfolding hence the equilibrium unfolding data were analyzed according to a three state n   i   u mechanism an intermediate is observed also in kinetic unfolding studies and its presence leads to the unfolding reaction in urea as well as in gdnhcl occurring in two steps the fast step is complete within the initial   ms of unfolding and manifests itself in a burst phase change in fluorescence at high concentrations of gdnhcl the entire change in fluorescence during unfolding occurs during the   ms burst phase cd measurements indicate however that i retains n like secondary structure an analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic data according to a minimal three state n   i   u mechanism positions i after the rate limiting transition state ts  of folding on the reaction coordinate of folding in gdnhcl hence i is not revealed when folding is commenced from u regardless of the nature of the probe used to follow the folding reaction interrupted unfolding experiments in which the protein is unfolded transiently in gdnhcl for various lengths of time before being refolded showed that i refolds to n much faster than does u confirms the analysis of the direct folding and unfolding experiments that i is formed after the rate limiting step of refolding in gdnhcl
