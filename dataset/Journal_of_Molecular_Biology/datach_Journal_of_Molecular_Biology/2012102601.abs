from a ratchet mechanism to random fluctuations evolution of hsp  s mechanochemical cycle
the   kda heat shock proteins heat shock protein   hsp   are a highly conserved atp dependent protein family which can be found from prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms in general hsp s are elongated dimers with n and c terminal dimerization sites in a series of publications we have recently shown that no successive mechanochemical cycle exists for yeast hsp  yhsp  in the absence of clients or cochaperones here we resolve the mechanochemical cycle of the bacterial homologue htpg by means of two  and three  color single  molecule fret f rster resonance energy transfer  unlike yhsp  the n terminal dynamics of htpg is strongly influenced by nucleotide binding and turnover  its reaction cycle is driven by a mechanical ratchet mechanism however the c terminal dimerization site is mainly closed and not influenced by nucleotides the direct comparison of both proteins shows that the hsp  machinery has developed to a more flexible and less nucleotide controlled system during evolution
