kinetic partitioning mechanism governs the folding of the third fniii domain of tenascin c evidence at the single molecule level
statistical mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations proposed that the folding of proteins can follow multiple parallel pathways on a rugged energy landscape from unfolded state en route to their folded native states kinetic partitioning mechanism is one of the possible mechanisms underlying such complex folding dynamics here we use single molecule atomic force microscopy technique to directly probe the multiplicity of the folding pathways of the third fibronectin type iii domain from the extracellular matrix protein tenascin c tnfn  by stretching individual tnfn  molecules we forced tnfn domains to undergo mechanical unfolding and refolding cycles allowing us to directly observe the folding pathways of tnfn  we found that after being mechanically unraveled and then relaxed to zero force tnfn follows multiple parallel pathways to fold into their native states the majority of tnfn fold into the native state in a simple two state fashion while a small percentage of tnfn were found to be trapped into kinetically stable folding intermediate states with well defined three dimensional structures furthermore the folding of tnfn was also influenced by its neighboring tnfn domains complex misfolded states of tnfn were observed possibly due to the formation of domain swapped dimeric structures our studies revealed the ruggedness of the folding energy landscape of tnfn and provided direct experimental evidence that the folding dynamics of tnfn are governed by the kinetic partitioning mechanism our results demonstrated the unique capability of single molecule afm to probe the folding dynamics of proteins at the single molecule level
