solution structure of the commd n terminal domain
commd is the prototype of a new protein family that plays a role in several important cellular processes including nf  b signaling sodium transport and copper metabolism the commd proteins interact with one another via a conserved c terminal domain whereas distinct functions are predicted to result from a variable n terminal domain the commd proteins have not been characterized biochemically or structurally here we present the solution structure of the n terminal domain of commd  n commd  residues      this domain adopts an  helical structure that bears little resemblance to any other helical protein the compact nature of n commd suggests that full length commd proteins are modular consistent with specific functional properties for each domain interactions between n commd and partner proteins may occur via complementary electrostatic surfaces these data provide a new foundation for biochemical characterization of commd proteins and for probing commd protein  protein interactions at the molecular level
