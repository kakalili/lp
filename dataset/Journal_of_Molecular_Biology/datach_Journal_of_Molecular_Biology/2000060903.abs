trading accuracy for speed a quantitative comparison of search algorithms in protein sequence design edited by j thornton
finding the minimum energy amino acid side chain conformation is a fundamental problem in both homology modeling and protein design to address this issue numerous computational algorithms have been proposed however there have been few quantitative comparisons between methods and there is very little general understanding of the types of problems that are appropriate for each algorithm here we study four common search techniques monte carlo mc and monte carlo plus quench mcq  genetic algorithms ga  self consistent mean field scmf  and dead end elimination dee  both scmf and dee are deterministic and if dee converges it is guaranteed that its solution is the global minimum energy conformation gmec  this provides a means to compare the accuracy of scmf and the stochastic methods for the side chain placement calculations we find that dee rapidly converges to the gmec in all the test cases the other algorithms converge on significantly incorrect solutions the average fraction of incorrect rotamers for scmf is    ga    and mcq    for the protein design calculations design positions are progressively added to the side chain placement calculation until the time required for dee diverges sharply as the complexity of the problem increases the accuracy of each method is determined so that the results can be extrapolated into the region where dee is no longer tractable we find that both scmf and mcq perform reasonably well on core calculations fraction amino acids incorrect is scmf    mcq    but fail considerably on the boundary scmf    mcq    and surface calculations scmf    mcq
