Lrp is a global regulatory protein in Escherichia coli that activates expression of more than a dozen operons and represses expression of another dozen. For some operons, exogenous leucine reduces the extent of Lrp action, for others it potentiates the effect of Lrp, and for yet other operons it has no effect. In an effort to understand how leucine affects Lrp-mediated expression, we examined Lrp self-association and the effect of leucine on self-association using light scattering, chemical cross-linking, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The following results were obtained. (i) Lrp self-associates to a hexadecamer and octamer with the predominant species being hexadecamer at Î¼M concentrations. (ii) Lrp undergoes a leucine-induced dissociation of hexadecamer to octamer. (iii) A mutant Lrp lacking 11 amino acid residues at the C terminus does not form higher-order oligomers, suggesting that the C terminus is involved in subunit association. (iv) At nM concentrations, Lrp dissociates to a dimer. It is proposed that leucine regulates the equilibrium between Lrp oligomers and thus Lrp occupancy of sites within different operons, leading to diverse regulatory patterns.
