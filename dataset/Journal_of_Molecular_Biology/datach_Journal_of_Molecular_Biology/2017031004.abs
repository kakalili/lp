isoform specific phosphorylation in human hsp   affects interaction with clients and the cochaperone cdc
the  kda heat shock proteins hsp s assist the maturation of many key regulators of signal transduction pathways and cellular control circuits like protein kinases and transcription factors and chaperone their stability and activity in this function hsp s cooperate with some  cochaperones and they are themselves subject to regulation by numerous post translational modifications in vertebrates two major isoforms exist in the cytosol hsp   and hsp   which share a high degree of sequence identity and are expressed in tissue and environmental condition dependent manner we identified an isoform specific phosphorylation site in human hsp   this phosphorylation site seems to be linked to vertebrate evolution since it is not found in invertebrata but in all tetrapoda and many but not all fish species we provide data suggesting that this phosphorylation is important for the activation of hsp  clients like glucocorticoid receptor and a protein kinase replacement of the phosphorylation site by glutamate affects the conformational dynamics of hsp  and interaction with the kinase specific cochaperone cdc
