the sacsin repeating region srr  a novel hsp  related supra domain associated with neurodegeneration
protein supra domains are defined as recurring arrangements of two or three domains present adjacent to each other along a polypeptide chain such combinations have novel functions beyond those of the individual partner domains that compose them which can exist in isolation here we describe a new type of large supra domain     residues in which one of the component partners     residues appears to be incapable of existing in a context other than immediately adjacent to the c terminus of the well characterized hsp  like atpase domain we found that this supra domain has a broad phylogenetic distribution with examples in archaea bacteria and eukarya there is strong selective pressure for this arrangement to occur as part of repeated regions of unprecedented length we identified multiple strategies of convergent evolution to attain such configurations in humans this supra domain is present in triplicate at the n terminus of the protein sacsin    residues  mutated in the neurodegenerative disorder known as spastic ataxia of charlevoix  saguenay and thus we termed it  sacsin repeating region   srr  biochemical characterization demonstrated that srrs possess atpase activity which appears to be a requirement for sacsin function as a disease causing mutation leads to an alternate conformation completely incapable of hydrolyzing atp we also found evidence of a convergent evolutionary strategy to place srrs in proteins containing c terminal j domains which we demonstrated here to be capable of stimulating the intrinsic atpase activity of hsp  our sequence and biochemical analyses indicate that srrs necessitate nucleotide hydrolysis for their function provided by the common hsp  atpase domain which when coupled to the unique adjacent sequence may give rise to a novel activity related to protein quality control
