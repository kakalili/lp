the mechanism of action of macrolides lincosamides and streptogramin b reveals the nascent peptide exit path in the ribosome
the macrolide  lincosamide  streptogramin b class mls of antibiotics contains structurally different but functionally similar drugs that all bind to the  s ribosomal subunit it has been suggested that these compounds block the path by which nascent peptides exit the ribosome we have studied the mechanisms of action of four macrolides erythromycin josamycin spiramycin and telithromycin  one lincosamide clindamycin and one streptogramin b pristinamycin ia  all these mls drugs cause dissociation of peptidyl trna from the ribosome josamycin spiramycin and clindamycin that extend to the peptidyl transferase center cause dissociation of peptidyl trnas containing two three or four amino acid residues erythromycin which does not reach the peptidyl transferase center induces dissociation of peptidyl trnas containing six seven or eight amino acid residues pristinamycin ia causes dissociation of peptidyl trnas with six amino acid residues and telithromycin allows polymerisation of nine or ten amino acid residues before peptidyl trna dissociates our data in combination with previous structural information suggest a common mode of action for all mls antibiotics which is modulated by the space available between the peptidyl transferase center and the drug
