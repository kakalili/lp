identification of the phospholipid binding site of human   glycoprotein i domain v by heteronuclear magnetic resonance
to understand the mechanism of the interaction between human   glycoprotein i   gpi and negatively charged phospholipids we determined the three dimensional solution structure of the fifth domain of   gpi by heteronuclear multidimensional nmr the results showed that the molecule is composed of well defined four anti parallel  strands and two short  helices as well as a long highly flexible loop backbone dynamic analysis demonstrated significant mobility of the flexible loop on a subnanosecond time scale structural modeling of the nicked fifth domain in which the lys  thr  peptide bond was specifically cleaved revealed the importance of this long c terminal loop for the interaction between   gpi and negatively charged phospholipids a titration experiment with the anionic surfactant sds showed that this highly mobile loop as well as the short  hairpin between  c and  d strands which is rich in positively charged residues specifically interact with the surfactant the mobile loop together with the surrounding positively charged residues probably construct the binding site for negatively charged phospholipids such as cardiolipin
