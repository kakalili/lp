metal ion binding in the active site of the junction resolving enzyme t endonuclease i in the presence and in the absence of dna
endonuclease i of bacteriophage t is a dna junction resolving enzyme we have previously used crystallography to demonstrate the binding of two manganese ions into the active site that is formed by three carboxylate glu   asp  and glu   and a lysine residue lys   endonuclease i is active in the presence of magnesium manganese iron ii and cobalt ii ions weakly active in the presence of nickel copper ii and zinc ions and completely inactive in the presence of calcium ions however using calorimetry we have observed the binding of two calcium ions to the free enzyme in a manner very similar to the binding of manganese ions in the presence of iron ii ions we have obtained a cleavage of the continuous strands of a junction bound by endonuclease i at sites close to but not identical with enzyme induced hydrolysis the results suggest that this arises from attack by locally generated hydroxyl radicals arising from iron ii ions bound into the active site this therefore provides an indirect way of examining metal ion binding in the enzyme  junction complex ion binding in free protein by calorimetry and the enzyme  junction complex iron induced cleavage have been studied in series of active site mutants both confirm the importance of the three carboxylate ligands and the lack of a requirement for lys  for the ion binding calorimetry points to particularly critical role of asp  as mutation completely abolishes all binding of both manganese and calcium ions
