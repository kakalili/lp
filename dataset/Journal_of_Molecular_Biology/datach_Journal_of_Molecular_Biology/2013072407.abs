the h d exchange kinetics of the escherichia coli co chaperonin groes studied by d nmr and dmso quenched exchange methods
we studied hydrogen deuterium exchange reactions of peptide amide protons of groes using two different techniques   two dimensional h   n transverse optimized nmr spectroscopy and   the dimethylsulfoxide quenched hydrogen exchange method combined with conventional h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy by using these techniques together with direct heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments we quantitatively evaluated the exchange rates for  out of the  peptide amide protons of groes and their protection factors and for the remaining  residues we obtained the lower limits of the exchange rates the protection factors of the most highly protected amide protons were on the order of      and the values were comparable in magnitude to those observed in typical small globular proteins but the number of the highly protected amide protons with a protection factor larger than   was only   significantly smaller than the numbers reported for the small globular proteins indicating that significant portions of free heptameric groes are flexible and natively unfolded the highly protected amino acid residues with a protection factor larger than   were mainly located in three  strands that form the hydrophobic core of groes while the residues in a mobile loop residues     were not highly protected the protection factors of the most highly protected amide protons were orders of magnitude larger than the value expected from the equilibrium unfolding parameters previously reported strongly suggesting that the equilibrium unfolding of groes is more complicated than a simple two state or three state mechanism and may involve more than a single intermediate
