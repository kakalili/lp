the a  loop is an important component of the active site of the vs ribozyme edited by j karn
the core of the vs ribozyme comprises five helices that act either in cis or in trans on a stem loop substrate to catalyse site specific cleavage the structure of the    helical junction indicates that a cleft is formed between helices ii and vi that is likely to serve as a receptor for the substrate detailed analysis of sequence variants suggests that the base bulges of helices ii and vi play an architectural role by contrast the identity of the nucleotides in the a  loop is very important for ribozyme activity the base of a  is particularly vital and substitution by any other nucleotide or ablation of the base leads to a major reduction in cleavage rate however variants of a  bind substrate efficiently and are not defective in global folding these results suggest that the a  loop is an important component of the active site of the ribozyme and that a  could play a key role in catalysis
