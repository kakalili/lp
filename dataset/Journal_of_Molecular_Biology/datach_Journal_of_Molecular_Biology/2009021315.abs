dynamic subcellular localization of the ewing sarcoma proto oncoprotein and its association with and stabilization of microtubules
the ewing sarcoma ews protein is a member of a large family of rna binding proteins chimeric ews oncoproteins generated by chromosomal translocations between the ews protein and several transcription factors cause various malignant tumors due to its multifunctional properties the ews protein is involved in such processes as meiotic dna pairing recombination cellular senescence gene expression rna processing and transport and cell signaling the ews protein is predominantly located in the nucleus it was found in the cytoplasm and associated with the cell membrane in this study analysis of the localization of endogenous and fluorescently labeled recombinant ews protein in different phases of the cell cycle in different cell lines revealed a very dynamic subcellular distribution of the ews protein in cos and hela cells an association of the ews protein with the centrosomal compartments was shown furthermore in hek human embryonic kidney    t cells an interaction of the overexpressed recombinant ews yellow fluorescent protein fusion protein with microtubules leading to their stabilization and cell cycle arrest was demonstrated as an outlook the present findings provide an important insight into temporally and spatially regulated functions of the ews protein and particularly into its role in the regulation of the cell cycle and possibly cell differentiation
