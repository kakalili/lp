Two-dimensional crystals of a membrane protein, the proton ATPase from plant plasma membranes, have been obtained by a new strategy based on the use of functionalized, fluorinated lipids spread at the air-water interface. Monolayers of the fluorinated lipids are stable even in the presence of high concentrations of various detergents as was established by ellipsometry measurements. A nickel functionalized fluorinated lipid was spread into a monolayer at the air-water interface. The overexpressed His-tagged ATPase solubilized by detergents was added to the subphase. 2D crystals of the membrane protein, embedded in a lipid bilayer, formed as the detergent was removed by adsorption. Electron microscopy indicated that the 2D crystals were single layers with dimensions of 10 μm or more. Image processing yielded a projection map at 9 Å resolution, showing three well-separated domains of the membrane-embedded proton ATPase.
