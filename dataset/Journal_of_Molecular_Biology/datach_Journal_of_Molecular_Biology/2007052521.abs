defining how ubiquitin receptors hhr a and s a bind polyubiquitin
ubiquitin receptors connect substrate ubiquitylation to proteasomal degradation hhr a binds proteasome subunit a s a through a surface that also binds ubiquitin we report that uim of s a binds preferentially to hhr a over polyubiquitin and we provide a model for the ternary complex that we expect represents one of the mechanisms used by the proteasome to capture ubiquitylated substrates furthermore we demonstrate that hhr a is surprisingly adept at sequestering the ubiquitin moieties of a polyubiquitin chain and provide evidence that it and the ubiquitylated substrate are committed to each other after binding
