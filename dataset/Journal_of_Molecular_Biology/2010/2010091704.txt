The crystal structure of the membrane-associated [NiFe] hydrogenase from Allochromatium vinosum has been determined to 2.1 Å resolution. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on dissolved crystals showed that it is present in the Ni-A state (&gt;90%). The structure of the A. vinosum [NiFe] hydrogenase shows significant similarities with [NiFe] hydrogenase structures derived from Desulfovibrio species. The amino acid sequence identity is ∼50%. The bimetallic [NiFe] active site is located in the large subunit of the heterodimer and possesses three diatomic non-protein ligands coordinated to the Fe (two CN− , one CO). Ni is bound to the protein backbone via four cysteine thiolates; two of them also bridge the two metals. One of the bridging cysteines (Cys64) exhibits a modified thiolate in part of the sample. A mono-oxo bridging ligand was assigned between the metal ions of the catalytic center. This is in contrast to a proposal for Desulfovibrio sp. hydrogenases that show a di-oxo species in this position for the Ni-A state. The additional metal site located in the large subunit appears to be a Mg2+ ion. Three iron–sulfur clusters were found in the small subunit that forms the electron transfer chain connecting the catalytic site with the molecular surface. The calculated anomalous Fourier map indicates a distorted proximal iron–sulfur cluster in part of the crystals. This altered proximal cluster is supposed to be paramagnetic and is exchange coupled to the Ni3+ ion and the medial [Fe3S4]+ cluster that are both EPR active (S=1/2 species). This finding of a modified proximal cluster in the [NiFe] hydrogenase might explain the observation of split EPR signals that are occasionally detected in the oxidized state of membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases as from A. vinosum.
