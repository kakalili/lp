crystal structure of the jacalin  t antigen complex and a comparative study of lectin  t antigen complexes
thomsen  friedenreich antigen gal    galnac  generally known as t antigen is expressed in more than   of human carcinomas therefore proteins which specifically bind t antigen have potential diagnostic value jacalin a lectin from jack fruit artocarpus integrifolia seeds is a tetramer of molecular mass  kda it is one of the very few proteins which are known to bind t antigen the crystal structure of the jacalin  t antigen complex has been determined at    resolution the interactions of the disaccharide at the binding site are predominantly through the galnac moiety with gal interacting only through water molecules they include a hydrogen bond between the anomeric oxygen of galnac and the  electrons of an aromatic side chain several intermolecular interactions involving the bound carbohydrate contribute to the stability of the crystal structure the present structure along with that of the me  gal complex provides a reasonable qualitative explanation for the known affinities of jacalin to different carbohydrate ligands and a plausible model of the binding of the lectin to t antigen o linked to seryl or threonyl residues including the present one the structures of five lectin  t antigen complexes are available galnac occupies the primary binding site in three of them while gal occupies the site in two the choice appears to be related to the ability of the lectin to bind sialylated sugars in either case most of the lectin  disaccharide interactions are at the primary binding site the conformation of t antigen in the five complexes is nearly the same
