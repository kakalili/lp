unusual diheme conformation of the heme degrading protein from mycobacterium tuberculosis
heme degradation plays a pivotal role in the availability of the essential nutrient iron in pathogenic bacteria a previously unannotated protein from mycobacterium tuberculosis rv   which shares homology to heme degrading enzymes has been identified biochemical analyses confirm that rv   which we have termed mhud mycobacterial heme utilization degrader  is able to bind and degrade heme interestingly contrary to previously reported stoichiometry for the staphylococcus aureus heme degraders iron regulated surface determinant isd g and isdi mhud has the ability to bind heme in a   protein to heme ratio although the mhud  diheme complex is inactive furthermore the     crystal structure of the mhud  diheme complex reveals two stacked hemes forming extensive contacts with residues in the active site in particular the solvent exposed heme is axially liganded by his  and is stacked planar upon the solvent protected heme the solvent protected heme is coordinated by a chloride ion which is in turn stabilized by asn  structural comparison between mhud  diheme and inactive isdg and isdi bound to only one highly distorted metalloporphyrin ring reveals that several residues located in  helix  and the subsequent loop appear to be responsible for heme stoichiometric differences and suggest open and closed conformations for substrate entry and product exit
