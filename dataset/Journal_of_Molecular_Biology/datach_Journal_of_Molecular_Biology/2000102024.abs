towards understanding a molecular switch mechanism thermodynamic and crystallographic studies of the signal transduction protein chey edited by r huber
the signal transduction protein chey displays an    parallel polypeptide folding including a highly unstable helix   and a strongly charged active site helix   has been shown to adopt various positions and conformations in different crystal structures suggesting that it is a mobile segment furthermore the instability of this helix is believed to have functional significance because it is involved in protein protein contacts with the transmitter protein kinase chea the target protein flim and the phosphatase chez the active site of chey comprises a cluster of three aspartic acid residues and a lysine residue all of which participate in the binding of the mg  needed for the protein activation two steps were followed to study the activation mechanism of chey upon phosphorylation first we independently substituted the three aspartic acid residues in the active site with alanine second several mutations were designed in helix   both to increase its level of stability and to improve its packing against the protein core the structural and thermodynamic analysis of these mutant proteins provides further evidence of the connection between the active site area and helix   and helps to understand how small movements at the active site are transmitted and amplified to the protein surface
