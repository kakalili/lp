structural insights into the association between bcar and cas family members an atypical complex implicated in anti oestrogen resistance
the association between novel src homology  containing protein nsp and crk associated substrate cas family members contributes to integrin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and is involved in conferring anti oestrogen resistance to human breast carcinomas the precise role of this association in tumorigenesis remains controversial and the molecular basis for the complex nsp and cas protein form is unknown here we present a pluridisciplinary approach including small angle x ray scattering that provides first insights into the structure of the complex formed between breast cancer anti oestrogen resistance  bcar  an nsp family member and human enhancer of filamentation  hef  also named nedd or cas l a cas family protein  our analysis corroborates a four helix bundle structure for the nsp binding domain of hef and a cdc  like guanine nucleotide exchange factor gef fold for the cas binding domain of bcar  using residues located on helix  of the four helix bundle hef binds very tightly to a site on bcar that is remote from the putative guanosine triphosphatase binding site of the gef domain but similar to a site implicated in allosteric regulation of the homologous sos son of sevenless gef domain thus the association between nsp and cas proteins might not only create a very stable link between these molecules co localising their cellular functions but also modulate the function of the nsp gef domains such modulation may explain at least in part the controversial results published for nsp gef function
