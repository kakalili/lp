a designed point mutant in fis disrupts dimerization and mitochondrial fission
mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission are essential processes with defects resulting in cardiomyopathy and neonatal lethality central to organelle fission is fis  a monomeric tetratricopeptide repeat tpr  like protein whose role in assembly of the fission machinery remains obscure two nonfunctional saccharomyces cerevisiae fis mutants l p or e d i t y h were previously identified in genetic screens here we find that these two variants in the cytosolic domain of fis  fis  tm are unexpectedly dimeric a truncation variant of fis  tm that lacks an n terminal regulatory domain is also found to be dimeric the ability to dimerize is a property innate to the native fis  tm amino acid sequence as we find this domain is dimeric after transient exposure to elevated temperature or chemical denaturants and is kinetically trapped at room temperature this is the first demonstration of a specific self association in solution for the fis cytoplasmic domain we propose a three dimensional domain swapped model for dimerization that is validated by a designed mutation a p which potently disrupts dimerization of wild  type fis  a p also disrupts dimerization of nonfunctional variants indicating a common structural basis for dimerization the obligate monomer variant a p like the dimer promoting variants is nonfunctional in fission consistent with a model in which fis activity depends on its ability to interconvert between monomer and dimer species these studies suggest a new functionally important manner in which tpr  containing proteins may reversibly self associate
