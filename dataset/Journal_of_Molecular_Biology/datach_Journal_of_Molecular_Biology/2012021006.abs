motifs a purely conformation based fine grained enumeration of protein parts at the two residue level
a deep understanding of protein structure benefits from the use of a variety of classification strategies that enhance our ability to effectively describe local patterns of conformation here we use a clustering algorithm to analyze    all trans segments from protein structures solved at     resolution or better to create a purely    based comprehensive empirical categorization of common conformations adopted by two adjacent    pairs i e      motifs  the clustering algorithm works in an origin shifted four dimensional space based on the two    pairs to yield a parameter dependent list of     motifs in order of their prominence the results are remarkably distinct from and complementary to the standard hydrogen bond centered view of secondary structure new insights include an unprecedented level of precision in describing the    angles of both previously known and novel motifs ordering of these motifs by their population density a data driven recommendation that the standard c i  c i  lt    criteria for defining turns be changed to     identification of  strand and turn capping motifs and identification of conformational capping by residues in polypeptide ii conformation we further document that the conformational preferences of a residue are substantially influenced by the conformation of its neighbors and we suggest that accounting for these dependencies will improve protein modeling accuracy although the cuevas d r      parts list  presented here is only an initial exploration of the complex     landscape of proteins it shows that there is value to be had from this approach and it opens the door to more in depth characterizations at the     level and at higher dimensions
