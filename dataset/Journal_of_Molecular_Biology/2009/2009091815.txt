Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-encoded Syncytin-1 has been suggested to play a major role in trophoblast cell fusion and thereby placenta development. However, recent studies have strongly suggested that other HERV envelope proteins could also be implicated in this process. Based on this premise, herein we compared the expression and functional implication of Syncytin-1 with the more recently described Syncytin-2 protein in various trophoblast cells. Real-time reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analyses in differentiating primary trophoblast cells first indicated a direct correlation between mRNA and protein levels of Syncytin-2 and cell fusion, while an inverse correlation for Syncytin-1 was noted. Similar reverse transcription PCR experiments and promoter studies showed that cell fusion-inducing agents in the trophoblastic BeWo cell line increased the expression of Syncytin-1 but, more importantly, augmented Syncytin-2 expression. Confocal microscopy experiments further revealed that in BeWo cells and in freshly isolated primary human trophoblast cells, Syncytin-1 was present as a cytoplasmic punctuated structure in proximity to regions of cell-to-cell contact. On the other hand, Syncytin-2 presented an inducible signal, which mainly localized to the cytoplasmic membrane. Experiments with siRNA (small interfering RNA)-transfected BeWo and primary human trophoblast cells demonstrated an important diminution in the number of cell fusion events upon repression of Syncytin-2 expression, whereas transfection experiments with Syncytin-1-specific siRNA resulted in a more modest effect. Overall, these results highlight the importance of Syncytin-2 in BeWo and primary human trophoblast cell fusion.
