the contribution of the zinc finger motif to the function of thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein s
in the crystal structure of the  s ribosomal subunit from thermus thermophilus cysteine  of ribosomal protein s  tths  occupies the first position in a cxxc x  cxxc motif that coordinates a zinc ion the structural and functional importance of cysteine   which is widely conserved from bacteria to humans was studied by its replacement with serine and by incorporating the resulting mutant into escherichia coli ribosomes the capability of such modified ribosomes in binding trna at the p and a sites was equal to that obtained with ribosomes incorporating wild type tths  in fact both chimeric ribosomal species exhibited   lower trna affinity compared with native e coli ribosomes in addition replacement of the native e coli s  by wild type and particularly by mutant tths  resulted in reduced capability of the  s subunit for association with  s subunits nevertheless ribosomes from transformed cells sedimented normally and had a full complement of proteins unexpectedly the peptidyl transferase activity in the chimeric ribosomes bearing mutant tths  was much lower than that measured in ribosomes incorporating wild type tths  the catalytic center of the ribosome is located within the  s subunit and therefore it is unlikely to be directly affected by changes in the structure of s  more probably the perturbing effects of s  mutation on the catalytic center seem to be propagated by adjacent intersubunit bridges or the p site trna molecule resulting in weak donor  substrate reactivity this hypothesis was verified by molecular dynamics simulation analysis
