the solution structure of ribosomal protein l  from bacillus stearothermophilus
a medium resolution solution structure has been obtained for l  from bacillus stearothermophilus bstl   a ribosomal protein that stabilizes the tertiary structure of s rrna and mediates its interaction with the rest of the large subunit the n terminal  amino acid residues of bstl  are unstructured in solution its remaining  residues form a globular domain that has the same topology as the globular domains of other l s but the orientation of helices is different this conformational peculiarity should not prevent bstl  from functioning in the ribosome the same way as other l s
