phosphorylation of the cyclin capcl modulates both cyclin stability and specific recognition of the substrate
the candida albicans cyclin capcl activates the cyclin dependent kinase pho  and induces phosphorylation of the transcription factor cagcn  leading to its degradation the high substrate specificity of the capcl pho  complex provides the opportunity to study the determinants of substrate selectivity of cyclins mutational analysis of capcl suggests that residues in a predicted  helix at the n terminal end of the cyclin box as well as in helix i of the cyclin box play a role in specific substrate recognition similar to saccharomyces cerevisiae pcl  we show here that capcl induces its own phosphorylation at two adjacent sites in the n terminal region of the protein and that this phosphorylation causes degradation of the cyclin in vivo via the scfcdc ubiquitin ligase remarkably however in vitro studies reveal that this phosphorylation also results in a loss of specific substrate recognition thereby providing an additional novel mechanism for limiting cyclin activity
