thermodynamic and structural basis for relaxation of specificity in protein  dna recognition
as a novel approach to the structural and functional properties that give rise to extremely stringent sequence specificity in protein  dna interactions we have exploited  promiscuous  mutants of ecori endonuclease to study the detailed mechanism by which changes in a protein can relax specificity the a  t promiscuous mutant protein binds more tightly to the cognate gaattc site than does wild type ecori yet displays relaxed specificity deriving from tighter binding and faster cleavage at ecori sites one incorrect base pair  aaattc ecori sites are cleaved by a  t up to   fold faster than by wild type enzyme if the site is abutted by a   purine pyrimidine    ry motif when wild type protein binds to an ecori site it forms structurally adapted complexes with thermodynamic parameters of binding that differ markedly from those of specific complexes by contrast we show that a  t complexes with   ry flanked aaattc sites are virtually indistinguishable from wild type specific complexes with respect to the heat capacity change upon binding   c p  the change in excluded macromolecular volume upon association and contacts to the phosphate backbone while the preference for the   ry motif implicates contacts to flanking bases as important for relaxed specificity local effects are not sufficient to explain the large differences in  c p and excluded volume as these parameters report on global features of the complex our findings therefore support the view that specificity does not derive from the additive effects of individual interactions but rather from a set of cooperative events that are uniquely associated with specific recognition
