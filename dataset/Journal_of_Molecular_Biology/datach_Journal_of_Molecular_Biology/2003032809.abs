motions and negative cooperativity between p  domains revealed by cryo electron microscopy and quantised elastic deformational model
p  a mg atpase belonging to the aaa atpase associated with various cellular activities super family of proteins has been proposed to function in two distinct cellular pathways namely homotypic membrane fusion and ubiquitin protein degradation by utilizing differing adaptor complexes we present the cryo electron microscopy three dimensional reconstruction of endogenous p  in an amp pnp bound state at   resolution it reveals clear nucleotide dependent differences when compared to our previously published  p  adp  reconstruction including a striking rearrangement of n domains and a positional change of the two atpase domains d and d  with respect to each other the docking of the x ray structure of n  d domains in an adp bound state indicates that an upward repositioning of n domain is necessary to accommodate the cryo em map of  p  amp pnp   suggesting a change in the orientation of n domains upon nucleotide hydrolysis furthermore computational analysis of the deformational motions of p  performed on the cryo em density map and the atomic structure of the n  d domains independently shows the existence of a negative cooperativity between the d and d rings and the flexibility of the n domains together these results allow the identification of functionally important features that offer molecular insights into the dynamics of the proposed p  chaperone function
