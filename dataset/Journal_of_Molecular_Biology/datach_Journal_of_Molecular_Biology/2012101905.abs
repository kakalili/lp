dj  protects dopaminergic neurons against rotenone induced apoptosis by enhancing erk dependent mitophagy
loss of function mutations in the gene encoding the multifunctional protein dj  have been implicated in the pathogenesis of early onset familial parkinson s disease pd  suggesting that dj  may act as a neuroprotectant for dopaminergic da neurons enhanced autophagy may benefit pd by clearing damaged organelles and protein aggregates thus we determined if dj  protects da neurons against mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress through an autophagic pathway cultured da cells mn d overexpressing dj  were treated with the mitochondrial complex i inhibitor rotenone in addition rotenone was injected into the left substantia nigra of rats weeks after injection with a dj  expression vector overexpression of dj  protected mn d cells against apoptosis significantly enhanced the survival of nigral da neurons after rotenone treatment in vivo and rescued rat behavioral abnormalities overexpression of dj  enhanced rotenone evoked expression of the autophagic markers beclin  and lc ii while transmission electron microscopy and confocal imaging revealed that the ultrastructural signs of autophagy were increased by dj  the neuroprotective effects of dj  were blocked by phosphoinositol   kinase and the autophagy inhibitor  methyladenine and by the erk pathway inhibitor u   confocal imaging revealed that the size of p  positive puncta decreased significantly in dj  overexpression of mn d cells  h after rotenone treatment suggesting that dj  reveals the ability to clear aggregated p  associated with pd factors that control autophagy including dj  may inhibit rotenone induced apoptosis and present novel targets for therapeutic intervention in pd
