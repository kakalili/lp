induced fit upon ligand binding revealed by crystal structures of the hot dog fold thioesterase in dynemicin biosynthesis
dynemicins are structurally related  membered enediyne natural products isolated from micromonospora chernisa with potent antitumor and antibiotic activity the early biosynthetic steps of the enediyne moiety of dynemicins are catalyzed by an iterative polyketide synthase dyne  and a thioesterase dyne  recent studies indicate that the function of dyne is to off load the linear biosynthetic intermediate assembled on dyne  here we report crystal structures of dyne in its free form at     resolution and of dyne in complex with the dyne produced all trans pentadecen  one at     resolution these crystal structures reveal that upon ligand binding significant conformational changes throughout the substrate binding tunnel result in an expanded tunnel that traverses an entire monomer of the tetrameric dyne protein the enlarged inner segment of the channel binds the carbonyl conjugated polyene mainly through hydrophobic interactions whereas the putative catalytic residues are located in the outer segment of the channel the crystallographic information reinforces an unusual catalytic mechanism that involves a strictly conserved arginine residue for this subfamily of hot dog fold thioesterases distinct from the typical mechanism for hot dog fold thioesterases that utilizes an acidic residue for catalysis
