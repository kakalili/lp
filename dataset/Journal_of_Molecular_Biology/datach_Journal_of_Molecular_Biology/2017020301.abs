intensification a resource for amplifying population genetic signals with protein repeats
large scale genome sequencing holds great promise for the interpretation of protein structures through the discovery of many rare functional variants in the human population however because protein coding regions are under high selective constraints these variants occur at low frequencies such that there is often insufficient statistics for downstream calculations to address this problem we develop the intensification approach which uses the modular structure of repeat protein domains to amplify signals of selection from population genetics and traditional interspecies conservation in particular we are able to aggregate variants at the codon level to identify important positions in repeat domains that show strong conservation signals this allows us to compare conservation over different evolutionary timescales it also enables us to visualize population genetic measures on protein structures we make available the intensification results as an online resource http  intensification gersteinlab org and illustrate the approach through a case study on the tetratricopeptide repeat
