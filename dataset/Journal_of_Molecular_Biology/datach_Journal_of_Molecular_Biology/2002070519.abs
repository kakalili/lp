solution structure of the single domain prolyl cis trans isomerase pin at from arabidopsis thaliana
the   amino acid residue prolyl cis trans isomerase from arabidopsis thaliana pin at is similar to the catalytic domain of the human hpin  however pin at lacks the n terminal ww domain that appears to be essential for the hpin function here the solution structure of pin at was determined by three dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the pin at fold could be superimposed on that of the catalytic domain of hpin and had a  residue flexible loop located between strand   and helix   the dynamical features of this     loop which are characteristic for a region involved in protein  protein interactions led to exchange broadening in the nmr spectra when sodium sulfate salt was added to the protein sample the     loop was stabilized and hence a complete backbone resonance assignment was obtained previously with a phospho cdc  peptide as substrate pin at had been shown to catalyze the phosphoserine phosphothreonine prolyl cis trans isomerization specifically to map the catalytic site of pin at the phospho cdc  peptide or sodium sulfate salt was added in excess to the protein and chemical shift changes in the backbone amide protons were monitored in the hn   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectrum the peptide caused perturbations in the loops between helix   and strand   between strands   and   in the   helix and in the     loop the amide groups of the residues arg  and arg  showed large chemical shift perturbations upon phospho cdc  peptide or sulfate addition we conclude that this basic cluster formed by arg  and arg  both located in the     loop is homologous to that found in the hpin crystal structure arg  and arg   which also is involved in sulfate ion binding we showed that the sulfate group competed for the interaction between pin at and the phospho cdc  peptide in the absence of the ww domain three hydrophobic residues ile  ile  and leu  located in the long flexible loop and specific for the plant pin type peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases ppiases could be an additional interaction site in pin at however phospho peptide addition did not affect the resonances of these residues significantly electrostatic potential calculations revealed a negatively charged area not found in hpin on the pin at molecular surface which corresponds to the surface shielded by the ww domain in hpin  based on our experimental results and the molecular specificities of the pin at enzyme functional implications of the lack of ww domains in this plant pin type ppiase will be discussed
