coarse  grained simulations of transitions in the e  to  e conformations for ca atpase serca show entropy  enthalpy compensation
serca is a membrane transport protein that has been extensively studied there are a large number of highly resolved x ray structures and several hundred mutations that have been characterized functionally despite this the molecular details of the catalytic cycle a cycle that includes large conformational changes is not fully understood in this computational study we provide molecular dynamics descriptions of conformational changes during the e  e transitions the motivating point for these calculations was a series of insertion mutants in the a m linker region that led to significant shifts in measured rates between the e and e states as shown by experimental characterization using coarse grained dynamic importance sampling within the context of a population shift framework we sample on the intermediates along the transition pathway to address the mechanism for the conformational changes and the effects of the insertion mutations on the kinetics of the transition the calculations define an approximation for the relative changes in entropy and enthalpy along the transition these are found to be important for understanding the experimentally observed differences in rates in particular the interactions between cytoplasmic domains water interactions and the shifts in protein degrees of freedom with the insertion mutations show mutual compensation for the e  e transitions in wild  type and mutant systems
