conformational spread in a ring of proteins a stochastic approach to allostery edited by j karn
we recently suggested that the sensitivity and range of a cluster of membrane receptors in bacteria would be enhanced by cooperative interactions between neighbouring proteins here we examine the consequences of this  conformational spread  mechanism for an idealised one dimensional system comprising a closed ring of identical allosteric protomers protein molecules or a group of protein domains operating as a unit  we show analytically and by means of monte carlo simulations that a ring of allosteric protomers can exhibit a switch like response to changes in ligand concentration we derive expressions for the sensitivity and cooperativity of switching and show that the maximum sensitivity is proportional to the number of protomers in the ring a ring of this kind can reproduce the sensitivity and kinetics of the switch complex of a bacterial flagellar motor for example which is based on a ring of  flim proteins we also compare smaller rings of conformationally coupled protomers to classical allosteric proteins such as haemoglobin and show that the canonical mwc and knf models arise naturally as limiting cases conformational spread appears to be a natural extension of the familiar mechanism of allostery a physically realistic mechanism that should apply widely to many structures built from protein molecules
