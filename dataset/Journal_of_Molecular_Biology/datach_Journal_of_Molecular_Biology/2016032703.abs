a disease causing variant in pcna disrupts a promiscuous protein binding site
the eukaryotic dna polymerase sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen or pcna is a ring shaped protein complex that surrounds dna to act as a sliding platform for increasing processivity of cellular replicases and for coordinating various cellular pathways with dna replication a single point mutation ser  ile in the human pcna gene was recently identified to cause a disease whose symptoms resemble those of dna damage and repair disorders the mutation lies near the binding site for most pcna interacting proteins however the structural consequences of the s  i mutation are unknown here we describe the structure of the disease causing variant which reveals a large conformational change that dramatically transforms the binding pocket for pcna client proteins we show that the mutation markedly alters the binding energetics for some client proteins while another p cip  is only mildly affected structures of the disease variant bound to peptides derived from two pcna partner proteins reveal that the binding pocket can adjust conformation to accommodate some ligands indicating that the binding site is dynamic and pliable our work has implications for the plasticity of the binding site in pcna and reveals how a disease mutation selectively alters interactions to a promiscuous binding site that is critical for dna metabolism
