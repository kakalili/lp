hydrogen bonding markedly reduces the pk of buried carboxyl groups in proteins
the ionizable groups in proteins with the lowest pks are the carboxyl groups of aspartic acid side chains one of the lowest pk   is observed for asp  in ribonuclease t  this low pk appeared to result from hydrogen bonds to a water molecule and to the side chains of asn  tyr  and thr  the results here confirm this by showing that the pk of asp  increases to   in n a to   in y f to   in t v to   in n a y f to   in n a t v to   in y f t v and to   in the triple mutant n a y f t v in ribonuclease sa the lowest pk   for asp  this pk increases to   in t a which removes the hydrogen bond to asp  and to   in t v which removes the hydrogen bond and replaces the  oh group with a  ch group it is clear that hydrogen bonds are able to markedly lower the pk values of carboxyl groups in proteins these same hydrogen bonds make large contributions to the conformational stability of the proteins at ph  the stability of d a ribonuclease t is   kcal mol   less than wild type and the stability of d a ribonuclease sa is   kcal mol   less than wild type there is a good correlation between the changes in the pk values and the changes in stability the results suggest that the pk values for these buried carboxyl groups would be greater than  in the absence of hydrogen bonds and that the hydrogen bonds and other interactions of the carboxyl groups contribute over  kcal mol   to the stability
