nmr structural characterization of substrates bound to n acetylglucosaminyltransferase v
n acetylglucosaminyltransferase v gnt v is an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of asparagine linked oligosaccharides it is responsible for the transfer of n acetylglucosamine glcnac from the nucleotide sugar donor uridine   diphospho n acetylglucosamine udp  glcnac  to the  position of the    linked man residue in n linked oligosaccharide core structures gnt v up regulation has been linked to increased cancer invasiveness and metastasis and appropriately targeted for drug development however drug design is impeded by the lack of structural information on the protein and the way in which substrates are bound even though the catalytic domain of this type ii membrane protein can be expressed in mammalian cell culture obtaining structural information has proved challenging due to the size of the catalytic domain   kda and its required glycosylation here we present an experimental approach to obtaining information on structural characteristics of the active site of gnt v through the investigation of the bound conformation and relative placement of its ligands udp  glcnac and  d glcpnac      d manp      d glcpooctyl nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy experiments inducing transferred nuclear overhauser effect trnoe and saturation transfer difference std experiments were used to characterize the ligand conformation and ligand  protein contact surfaces in addition a novel paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiment using a spin labeled ligand analogue    diphospho  o      tetramethylpiperidine  oxyl udp  tempo  was used to characterize the relative orientation of the two bound ligands the structural information obtained for the substrates in the active site of gnt v can be useful in the design of inhibitors for gnt v
