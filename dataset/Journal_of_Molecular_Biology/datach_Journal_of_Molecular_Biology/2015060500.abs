proteomic characterization of the nucleolar linker histone h interaction network
to investigate the relationship between linker histone h and protein  protein interactions in the nucleolus we used biochemical and proteomics approaches to characterize nucleoli purified from cultured human and mouse cells mass spectrometry identified   proteins in human t cell nucleolar extracts that bound to sepharose immobilized h in vitro gene ontology analysis found significant enrichment for h binding proteins with functions related to nucleolar chromatin structure and rna polymerase i transcription regulation rrna processing and mrna splicing consistent with the affinity binding results h existed in large   to gt  kda macromolecular complexes in human t cell nucleolar extracts to complement the biochemical experiments we investigated the effects of in vivo h depletion on protein content and structural integrity of the nucleolus using the h triple isoform knockout h  tko mouse embryonic stem cell mesc model system proteomic profiling of purified wild type mesc nucleoli identified a total of   proteins only   of which were detected in the h mutant nucleoli within the affected group spectral counting analysis quantitated   specific nucleolar proteins whose levels were significantly altered in h  tko mesc importantly the functions of the affected proteins in mesc closely overlapped with those of the human t cell nucleolar h binding proteins immunofluorescence microscopy of intact h  tko mesc demonstrated both a loss of nucleolar rna content and altered nucleolar morphology resulting from in vivo h depletion we conclude that h organizes and maintains an extensive protein  protein interaction network in the nucleolus required for nucleolar structure and integrity
