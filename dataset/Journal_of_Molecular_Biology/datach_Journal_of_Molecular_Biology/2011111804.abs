projection structure of channelrhodopsin  at    resolution by electron crystallography
channelrhodopsin  chr  is the prototype of a new class of light gated ion channels that is finding widespread applications in optogenetics and biomedical research we present a    projection map of chr  obtained by cryo electron microscopy of two dimensional crystals grown from pure heterologously expressed protein the map shows that chr is the same dimer with non crystallographic  fold symmetry in three different membrane crystals this is consistent with biochemical analysis which shows a stable dimer in detergent solution comparison to the projection map to bacteriorhodopsin indicates a similar structure of seven transmembrane alpha helices based on the projection map and sequence alignments we built a homology model of chr that potentially accounts for light induced channel gating although a monomeric channel is not ruled out comparison to other membrane channels and transporters suggests that the chr channel is located at the dimer interface on the  fold axis lined by transmembrane helices  and
