interpreting trends in the binding of cyclic ureas to hiv  protease edited by b honig
the design of new hiv protease inhibitors requires an improved understanding of the physical basis of inhibitor protein binding here the binding affinities of seven aliphatic cyclic ureas to hiv  protease are calculated using a predominant states method and an implicit solvent model based upon finite difference solutions of the poisson boltzmann equation the calculations are able to reproduce the observed u shaped trend of binding free energy as a function of aliphatic chain length interestingly the decrease in affinity for the longest chains is attributable primarily to the energy cost of partly desolvating charged aspartic and arginine groups at the mouths of the active site even aliphatic chains too short to contact these charged groups directly are subject to considerable desolvation penalties we are not aware of other systems where binding affinity trends have been attributed to long ranged electrostatic desolvation of ionized groups a generalized born surface area solvation model yields a much smaller change in desolvation energy with chain length and therefore does not reproduce the experimental binding affinity trends this result suggests that the generalized born model should be used with caution for complex partly desolvated systems like protein binding sites we also find that changing the assumed protonation state of the active site aspartyl dyad significantly affects the computed binding affinity trends the protonation state of the aspartyl dyad in the presence of cyclic ureas is discussed in light of the observation that the monoprotonated state reproduces the experimental results best
