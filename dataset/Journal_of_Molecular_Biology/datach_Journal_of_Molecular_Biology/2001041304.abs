structure and function of a novel purine specific nucleoside hydrolase from trypanosoma vivax edited by r huber
the purine salvage pathway of parasitic protozoa is currently considered as a target for drug development because these organisms cannot synthesize purines de novo insight into the structure and mechanism of the involved enzymes can aid in the development of potent inhibitors leading to new curative drugs nucleoside hydrolases are key enzymes in the purine salvage pathway of trypanosomatidae and they are especially attractive because they have no equivalent in mammalian cells we cloned expressed and purified a nucleoside hydrolase from trypanosoma vivax the substrate activity profile establishes the enzyme to be a member of the inosine adenosine guanosine preferring nucleoside hydrolases iag nh  we solved the crystal structure of the enzyme at    resolution using mad techniques the complex of the enzyme with the substrate analogue  deaza adenosine is presented these are the first structures of an iag nh reported in the literature the t vivax iag nh is a homodimer with each subunit consisting of ten  strands    helices and three small   helices six of the eight strands of the central  sheet form a motif resembling the rossmann fold superposition of the active sites of this iag nh and the inosine uridine preferring nucleoside hydrolase iu nh of crithidia fasciculata shows the molecular basis of the different substrate specificity distinguishing these two classes of nucleoside hydrolases an  aromatic stacking network  in the active site of the iag nh absent from the iu nh imposes the purine specificity asp  is the proposed general base in the reaction mechanism abstracting a proton from a nucleophilic water molecule asp  replaced by asn  in the iu nh is positioned appropriately to act as a general acid and to protonate the purine leaving group the second general acid needed for full enzymatic activity is probably part of a flexible loop located in the vicinity of the active site
