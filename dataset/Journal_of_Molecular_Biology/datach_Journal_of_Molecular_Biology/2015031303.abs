new insights into the mechanism of chloroplast protein import and its integration with protein quality control organelle biogenesis and development
the translocons at the outer toc and the inner tic envelope membranes of chloroplasts mediate the targeting and import of several thousand nucleus encoded preproteins that are required for organelle biogenesis and homeostasis the cytosolic events in preprotein targeting remain largely unknown although cytoplasmic chaperones have been proposed to facilitate delivery to the toc complex preprotein recognition is mediated by the toc gtpase receptors toc  and toc  the receptors constitute a gtp regulated switch which initiates membrane translocation via toc  a member of the omp  outer membrane protein   tpsb two partner secretion system b family of bacterial plastid and mitochondrial  barrel outer membrane proteins the toc receptor systems have diversified to recognize distinct sets of preproteins thereby maximizing the efficiency of targeting in response to changes in gene expression during developmental and physiological events that impact organelle function the toc complex interacts with the tic translocon to allow simultaneous translocation of preproteins across the envelope both the two inner membrane complexes the tic  and  mda complexes have been implicated as constituents of the tic translocon and it remains to be determined how they interact to form the tic channel and assemble the import associated chaperone network in the stroma that drives import across the envelope membranes this review will focus on recent developments in our understanding of the mechanisms and diversity of the toc  tic systems our goal is to incorporate these recent studies with previous work and present updated or revised models for the function of toc  tic in protein import
