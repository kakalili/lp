temporal development of protein structure during s  a  folding and dimerization probed by oxidative labeling and mass spectrometry
considerable progress in deciphering the mechanisms of protein folding has been made however most work in this area has focused on single chain systems whereas the majority of proteins are oligomers the spontaneous assembly of intact multi subunit systems from disordered building blocks encompasses the formation of intramolecular as well as intermolecular contacts both types of interaction affect the solvent accessibility of individual protein segments this work employs pulsed hydroxyl radical  oh labeling for tracking time dependent accessibility changes during folding and assembly of the s  a  homodimer  oh induces covalent modifications at exposed residues structural snapshots are obtained by combining  oh labeling with rapid mixing and mass spectrometry the free subunits are found to possess a partially non native hydrophobic core that prevents subunit association during the initial stages of the reaction instead the protein forms an early   ms monomeric intermediate that exhibits reduced solvent accessibility in regions distant from helices i and iv which constitute the dimerization interface subunit association is complete after   ms although the protein retains significant disorder in helices ii and iii at this point subsequent consolidation of these elements leads to the native state the experimental strategy used here could become a general tool for deciphering kinetic mechanisms of biomolecular self assembly processes
