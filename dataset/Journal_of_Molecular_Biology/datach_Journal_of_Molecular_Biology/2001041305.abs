the    fold explorations in sequence space edited by m f summers
the computational redesign of the second zinc finger of zif  to produce a  residue peptide fsd  that assumes a    fold without metal binding was recently reported in order to explore the tolerance of this metal free fold towards sequence variability six additional peptides resulting from the orbit computational protein design process were synthesized and characterized the experimental stabilities of five of these peptides are strongly correlated with the energies calculated by orbit however when a peptide with a mutation in the  turn is examined the calculated stability does not accurately predict the experimentally determined stability the nmr solution structure of a peptide incorporating this mutation fsd ey reveals that the register between the  strands is different from the model structure used to select and score the sequences fsd ey has a type i  turn instead of the target ebaaagbe turn rubredoxin knuckle  two additional peptides that have improved side chain to backbone hydrogen bonding and turn propensity for the target turn were characterized both are of stability comparable to that of fsd  these results demonstrate the robustness of the orbit protein design methods and underscore the need for continued improvements in negative design
