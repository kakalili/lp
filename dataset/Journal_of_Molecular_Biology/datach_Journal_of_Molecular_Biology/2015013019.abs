cooperative substrate binding by a diguanylate cyclase
xac   from xanthomonas citri subsp citri is a large multi domain protein containing one gaf cgmp specific phosphodiesterases adenylyl cyclases and fhla domain four pas per arnt sim domains and one ggdef domain this protein has a demonstrable in vivo and in vitro diguanylate cyclase dgc activity that leads to the production of cyclic di gmp c di gmp  a ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule analysis of a xac    knockout strain revealed that xac   plays a role in the regulation of xac motility and resistance to h o  site directed mutagenesis of a conserved dgc lysine residue lys  in xac   resulted in a severe reduction in xac   dgc activity furthermore experimental and in silico analyses suggest that xac   is not subject to allosteric product inhibition a common regulatory mechanism for dgc activity control instead steady state kinetics of xac   dgc activity revealed a positive cooperative effect of the gtp substrate with a dissociation constant for the binding of the first gtp molecule k  approximately   greater than the dissociation constant for the binding of the second gtp molecule k  we present a general kinetics scheme that should be used when analyzing dgc kinetics data and propose that cooperative gtp binding could be a common though up to now overlooked feature of these enzymes that may in some cases offer a physiologically relevant mechanism for regulation of dgc activity in vivo
