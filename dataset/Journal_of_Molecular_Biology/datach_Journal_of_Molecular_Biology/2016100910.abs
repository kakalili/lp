yeast rrna expansion segments folding and function
divergence between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal rna rrna and among eukaryotic ribosomal rnas is focused in expansion segments ess  eukaryotic ribosomes are significantly larger than prokaryotic ribosomes partly because of their ess we hypothesize that larger rrnas of complex organisms could confer increased functionality to the ribosome here we characterize the binding partners of saccharomyces cerevisiae expansion segment  es  which is the largest and most variable es of the eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit and is located at the surface of the ribosome in vitro rna  protein pull down experiments using es as a bait indicate that es is a binding hub for a variety of non ribosomal proteins essential to ribosomal function in eukaryotes es associated proteins observed here cluster into four groups based on biological process  i response to abiotic stimulus e g  response to external changes in temperature ph oxygen level etc   ii ribosomal large subunit biogenesis  iii protein transport and localization and iv transcription elongation seven synthetases ala  arg  asp  asn  leu  lys and tyrrs appear to associate with es  affinities of asprs tyrrs and lysrs for es were confirmed by in vitro binding assays the results suggest that es in s cerevisiae could play a role analogous to the multi synthetase complex present in higher order organisms and could be important for the appropriate function of the ribosome thermal denaturation studies and footprinting experiments confirm that isolated es is stable and maintains a near native secondary and tertiary structure
