a novel disulfide bond in the sh domain of the c terminal src kinase controls catalytic activity
the sh domain of the c terminal src kinase csk contains a unique disulfide bond that is not present in other known sh domains to investigate whether this unusual disulfide bond serves a novel function the effects of disulfide bond formation on catalytic activity of the full length protein and on the structure of the sh domain were investigated the kinase activity of full length csk decreases by an order of magnitude upon formation of the disulfide bond in the distal sh domain nmr spectra of the fully oxidized and fully reduced sh domains exhibit similar chemical shift patterns and are indicative of similar well defined tertiary structures the solvent accessible disulfide bond in the isolated sh domain is highly stable and far from the small lobe of the kinase domain however reduction of this bond results in chemical shift changes of resonances that map to a cluster of residues that extend from the disulfide bond across the molecule to a surface that is in direct contact with the small lobe of the kinase domain in the intact molecule normal mode analyses and molecular dynamics calculations suggest that disulfide bond formation has large effects on residues within the kinase domain most notably within the active site cleft overall the data indicate that reversible cross linking of two cysteine residues in the sh domain greatly impacts catalytic function and interdomain communication in csk
