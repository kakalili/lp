insights into the catalytic mechanism of human seh phosphatase by site directed mutagenesis and lc  ms ms analysis
we have recently reported that human soluble epoxide hydrolase seh is a bifunctional enzyme with a novel phosphatase enzymatic activity based on a structural relationship with other members of the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily the seh n terminal phosphatase domain revealed four conserved sequence motifs including the proposed catalytic nucleophile d  and several other residues potentially implicated in substrate turnover and or mg  binding to enlighten the catalytic mechanism of dephosphorylation we constructed seh phosphatase active site mutants by site directed mutagenesis a total of  mutants were constructed and recombinantly expressed in escherichia coli as soluble proteins purified to homogeneity and subsequently analysed for their kinetic parameters a replacement of residues d  k   d  or n  resulted in a complete loss of phosphatase activity consistent with an essential function for catalysis in contrast a substitution of d  t   n  and d  leads to seh mutant proteins with altered kinetic properties we further provide evidence of the formation of an acylphosphate intermediate on d by liquid chromatography  tandem mass spectrometry based on the detection of homoserine after nabh reduction of the phosphorylated enzyme which identifies d as the catalytic nucleophile surprisingly we could only show such homoserine formation using the d n mutant which strongly suggests d  to be involved in the acylphosphate hydrolysis in the d  mutant the second catalytic step becomes rate limiting which then allows trapping of the labile intermediate substrate turnover in the presence of  h o revealed that the nucleophilic attack during the second reaction step occurs at the acylphosphate phosphorous based on these findings we propose a two step catalytic mechanism of dephosphorylation that involves the phosphate substrate hydrolysis by nucleophilic attack by the catalytic nucleophile d followed by hydrolysis of the acylphosphate enzyme intermediate supported by d
