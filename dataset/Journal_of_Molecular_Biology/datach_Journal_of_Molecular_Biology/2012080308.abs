nmr and crystal structures of the pyrococcus horikoshii rada intein guide a strategy for engineering a highly efficient and promiscuous intein
in protein splicing an intervening protein sequence intein in the host protein excises itself out and ligates two split host protein sequences exteins to produce a mature host protein inteins require the involvement for the splicing of the first residue of the extein that follows the intein which is cys ser or thr  other extein residues near the splicing junctions could modulate splicing efficiency even when they are not directly involved in catalysis mutual interdependence between this molecular parasite intein and its host protein exteins is not beneficial for intein spread but could be advantageous for intein survival during evolution elucidating extein  intein dependency has increasingly become important since inteins are recognized as useful biotechnological tools for protein ligation we determined the structures of one of inteins with high splicing efficiency the rada intein from pyrococcus horikoshii phorada  the solution nmr structure and the crystal structures elucidated the structural basis for its high efficiency and directed our efforts of engineering that led to rational design of a functional minimized rada intein the crystal structure of the minimized rada intein also revealed the precise interactions between n extein and the intein we systematically analyzed the effects at the   position of n extein and were able to significantly improve the splicing efficiency of a less robust splicing variant by eliminating the unfavorable extein  intein interactions observed in the structure this work provides an example of how unveiling structure  function relationships of inteins offer a promising way of improving their properties as better tools for protein engineering
