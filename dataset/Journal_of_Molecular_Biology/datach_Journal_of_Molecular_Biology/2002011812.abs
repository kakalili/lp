crystal structure of the flavoprotein domain of the extracellular flavocytochrome cellobiose dehydrogenase edited by d rees
cellobiose dehydrogenase cdh participates in the degradation of cellulose and lignin the protein is an extracellular flavocytochrome with a b type cytochrome domain cytcdh connected to a flavodehydrogenase domain dhcdh  dhcdh catalyses a two electron oxidation at the anomeric c position of cellobiose to yield cellobiono   lactone and the electrons are subsequently transferred from dhcdh to an acceptor either directly or via cytcdh here we decribe the crystal structure of phanerochaete chrysosporium dhcdh determined at    resolution dhcdh belongs to the gmc family of oxidoreductases which includes glucose oxidase gox and cholesterol oxidase cox  however the sequence identity with members of the family is low the overall fold of dhcdh is p hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase like and is similar to but also different from that of gox and cox it is partitioned into an fad binding subdomain of    type and a substrate binding subdomain consisting of a seven stranded  sheet and six helices docking of cytcdh and dhcdh suggests that cytcdh covers the active site entrance in dhcdh and that the resulting distance between the cofactors is within acceptable limits for inter domain electron transfer based on docking of the substrate cellobiose in the active site of dhcdh we propose that the enzyme discriminates against glucose by favouring interaction with the non reducing end of cellobiose
