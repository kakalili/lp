crystal structure of the cct  apical domain implications for substrate binding to the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin
the chaperonin containing tcp  cct also known as tric is the only member of the chaperonin family found in the cytosol of eukaryotes like other chaperonins it assists the folding of newly synthesised proteins it is however unique in its specificity towards only a small subset of non native proteins we determined two crystal structures of mouse cct  apical domain at    and    resolution they reveal a surface patch facing the inside of the torus that is highly evolutionarily conserved and specific for the cct  apical domain this putative substrate binding region consists of predominantly positively charged side chains it suggests that the specificity of this apical domain towards its substrate partially folded tubulin is conferred by polar and electrostatic interactions the site and nature of substrate interaction are thus profoundly different between cct and its eubacterial homologue groel consistent with their different functions in general versus specific protein folding assistance
