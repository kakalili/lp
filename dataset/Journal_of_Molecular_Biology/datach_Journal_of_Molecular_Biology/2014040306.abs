prokaryotic ancestry of eukaryotic protein networks mediating innate immunity and apoptosis
protein domains characteristic of eukaryotic innate immunity and apoptosis have many prokaryotic counterparts of unknown function by reconstructing interactomes computationally we found that bacterial proteins containing these domains are part of a network that also includes other domains not hitherto associated with immunity this network is connected to the network of prokaryotic signal transduction proteins such as histidine kinases and chemoreceptors the network varies considerably in domain composition and degree of paralogy even between strains of the same species and its repetitive domains are often amplified recently with individual repeats sharing up to   sequence identity both phenomena are evidence of considerable evolutionary pressure and thus compatible with a role in the  arms race  between host and pathogen in order to investigate the relationship of this network to its eukaryotic counterparts we performed a cluster analysis of organisms based on a census of its constituent domains across all fully sequenced genomes we obtained a large central cluster of mainly unicellular organisms from which multicellular organisms radiate out in two main directions one is taken by multicellular bacteria primarily cyanobacteria and actinomycetes and plants form an extension of this direction connected via the basal unicellular cyanobacteria the second main direction is taken by animals and fungi which form separate branches with a common root in the  proteobacteria of the central cluster this analysis supports the notion that the innate immunity networks of eukaryotes originated from their endosymbionts and that increases in the complexity of these networks accompanied the emergence of multicellularity
