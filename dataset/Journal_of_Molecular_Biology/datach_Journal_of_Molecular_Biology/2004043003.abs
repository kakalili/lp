location of divergent region  on the three dimensional structure of cardiac muscle ryanodine receptor calcium release channel
ryanodine receptors ryrs are a family of calcium release channels found on intracellular calcium handing organelles molecular cloning studies have identified three different ryr isoforms which are     identical in amino acid sequence in mammals the three isoforms are encoded by three separate genes located on different chromosomes the major variations among the isoforms occur in three regions known as divergent regions    and  dr  dr  and dr  in the present study a modified ryr  cardiac isoform cdna was constructed into which was inserted a green fluorescent protein gfp encoding cdna within dr  specifically after amino acid residue thr   ryr t   gfp  hek  cells expressing ryr t   gfp cdnas showed caffeine sensitive and ryanodine sensitive calcium release demonstrating that ryr t   gfp forms functional calcium release channels cells expressing ryr t   gfp were identified readily by the characteristic fluorescence of gfp indicating that the overall structure of the inserted gfp was retained cryo electron microscopy cryo em of purified ryr t   gfp showed structurally intact receptors and a three dimensional reconstruction was obtained by single particle image processing the location of the inserted gfp was obtained by comparing this three dimensional reconstruction to one obtained for wild type ryr  the inserted gfp and consequently thr   within dr  was mapped on the three dimensional structure of ryr to domain  one of the characteristic cytoplasmic domains that form part of the multi domain  clamp  regions of ryr  the three dimensional location of dr suggests that it plays roles in the ryr conformational changes that occur during channel gating and possibly in ryr s interaction with the dihydropyridine receptor in excitation  contraction coupling this study further demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of the gfp insertion cryo em approach for correlating ryr s amino acid sequence with its three dimensional structure thereby enhancing our understanding of the structural basis of ryr function
