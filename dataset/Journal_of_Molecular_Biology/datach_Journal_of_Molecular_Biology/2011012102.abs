active site structure of class iv adenylyl cyclase and transphyletic mechanism
adenylyl cyclases acs belonging to three nonhomologous classes ii iii and iv have been structurally characterized enabling a comparison of the mechanisms of cyclic adenosine      monophosphate biosynthesis we report the crystal structures of three active site complexes for yersinia pestis class iv ac ac iv  two with substrate analogs and one with product mn  binds to all three phosphates and to glu  and glu   electropositive residues lys  arg  lys  lys   and arg  also form hydrogen bonds to phosphates the conformation of the analogs is suitable for in line nucleophilic attack by the ribose o   on  phosphate distance      in the product complex a second mn ion is observed to be coordinated to both ribose   oxygen and ribose   oxygen observation of both metal sites together with kinetic measurements provides strong support for a two cation mechanism eleven active site mutants were also made and kinetically characterized these findings and comparisons with class ii and class iii enzymes enable a detailed transphyletic analysis of the ac mechanism consistent with its lack of coordination to purine y pestis ac iv cyclizes both atp and gtp as in other classes of ac the ribose is loosely bound and as in class iii no base appears to ionize the o   nucleophile different syn anti conformations suggest that the mechanism involves a conformational transition and further evidence suggests a role for ribosyl pseudorotation with resolutions of        these are the most detailed active site ligand complexes for any class of this ubiquitous signaling enzyme
