determination of the pka of the four zn  coordinating residues of the distal finger motif of the hiv  nucleocapsid protein consequences on the binding of zn  edited by m f summers
the nucleocapsid protein ncp of human immunodeficiency virus type  is characterized by two highly conserved cchc motifs that bind zn  strongly to elucidate the striking ph dependence of the apparent zn  binding constants of these motifs further we investigated using h nmr potentiometry and fluorescence spectroscopy the acid base properties of the four zn  coordinating residues of    ncp  a peptide corresponding to the distal finger motif of ncp  with the exception of the h  proton of cys  the ph dependence of the h  proton resonances of the three cys residues and the h  and h  resonances of his  in the apopeptide could be fitted adequately with a single pka this suggests that the protonating groups are non interacting a feature that was confirmed by a potentiometric titration the pka of his  cys  cys  and cys  in the apopeptide were found to be        and   respectively accordingly the deprotonation is almost sequential and may thus induce a sequential binding of zn  to the four coordinating residues the high pka of cys  is probably related to the negative charge of the neighboring asp  such a high pka may be a general feature in nucleocapsid proteins ncs  since an acidic residue generally occupies the i    position of the c terminal cys residue of single finger ncs and distal finger motifs in two finger ncs molecular dynamics simulation suggested the formation of a hydrogen bonded network that weakly structured the cys  cys  segment in the apopeptide this network depends on the protonation state of cys  and may thus explain the biphasic behavior of the ph dependence of the cys  h  resonance finally the pka values were used to build up a model describing the coordination of zn  to    ncp at equilibrium it appears that each protonation step of the coordination complex decreases the zn  binding constant by about four orders of magnitude and that a significant dissociation of zn  from the holopeptide can be achieved in acidic cell compartments
