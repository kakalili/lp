catalytic mechanism of retaining  galactosidase belonging to glycoside hydrolase family
glycoside hydrolase family   gh   is a unique glycoside family that contains inverting and retaining glycosidases of these btgh a susb and btgh b uniprotkb trembl entry q a l  derived from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron have been characterized as an inverting  glucoside hydrolase and a retaining  galactosidase respectively previous studies on the three dimensional structures of btgh a and site directed mutagenesis indicated that glu  acts as an acid catalyst and that glu  and glu  function as the catalytic base in the inverting mechanism however btgh b lacks base catalysts but possesses a putative catalytic nucleophilic residue asp   here we report that asp  in btgh b is the nucleophilic catalyst based on the results of crystal structure analysis and site directed mutagenesis study structural comparison between btgh b and btgh a indicated that od of asp  in btgh b is located at a position spatially identical with the catalytic water molecule of btgh a which attacks on the anomeric carbon from the  face i e  asp  is poised for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon  site directed mutagenesis of asp  leads to inactivation of the enzyme and the activity is rescued by an external nucleophilic azide ion that is asp  functions as a nucleophilic catalyst the multiple amino acid sequence alignment of gh  members indicated that almost half of the gh  enzymes possess base catalyst residues at the end of  strands  and  while the other half of the family show a conserved nucleophilic residue at the end of  strand  the different positions of functional groups on the  face of the substrate which seem to be due to  hopping of the functional group  during evolution have led to divergence of catalytic mechanism within the same family
