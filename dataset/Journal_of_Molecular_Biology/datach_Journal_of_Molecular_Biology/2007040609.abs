role of multiple bonds between the single cell adhesion molecules nectin and cadherin revealed by high sensitive force measurements
nectins and cadherins members of cell adhesion molecules cams  are the primary mediators for various types of cell  cell junctions here intermolecular force microscopy ifm with force sensitivity at sub piconewtons is used to characterize the extracellular trans interactions between paired nectins and paired cadherins at the single molecule level three and four different bound states between paired nectins and paired cadherins are respectively identified and characterized based on bond strength distributions where each bound state has a unique lifetime and bond length the results indicate that multiple domains of nectins act uncooperatively as a zipper like multiply bonded system whereas those of cadherins act cooperatively as a parallel like multiply bonded system consistent with a  fork initiation and zipper  hypothesis for the formation of cell  cell adhesion the observed dynamic properties among multiple bonds are expected to be advantageous such that nectins search adaptively in the cell  cell exploratory recognition process while cadherins slowly stabilize in the cell  cell zippering process
