large scale expression purification and d crystallization of recombinant plant plasma membrane h atpase edited by r huber
p type atpases convert chemical energy into electrochemical gradients that are used to energize secondary active transport analysis of the structure and function of p type atpases has been limited by the lack of active recombinant atpases in quantities suitable for crystallographic studies aiming at solving their three dimensional structure we have expressed arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane h atpase isoform aha  equipped with a his tag in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the h atpase could be purified both in the presence and in the absence of regulatory    protein depending on the presence of the diterpene fusicoccin which specifically induces formation of the h atpase    protein complex amino acid analysis of the purified complex suggested a stoichiometry of two    proteins per h atpase polypeptide the purified h atpase readily formed two dimensional crystals following reconstitution into lipid vesicles electron cryo microscopy of the crystals yielded a projection map at     resolution the p   symmetry of which suggests a dimeric protein complex three distinct regions of density of approximately equal size are apparent and may reflect different domains in individual molecules of aha
