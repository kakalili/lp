The protein L2 is found in all ribosomes and is one of the best conserved proteins of this mega-dalton complex. The protein was localized within both the isolated 50 S subunit and the 70 S ribosome of the Escherichia coli bacteria with the neutron-scattering technique of spin-contrast variation. L2 is elongated, exposing one end of the protein to the surface of the intersubunit interface of the 50 S subunit. The protein changes its conformation slightly when the 50 S subunit reassociates with the 30 S subunit to form a 70 S ribosome, becoming more elongated and moving approximately 30 Ã… into the 50 S matrix. The results support a recent observation that L2 is essential for the association of the ribosomal subunits and might participate in the binding and translocation of the tRNAs.
