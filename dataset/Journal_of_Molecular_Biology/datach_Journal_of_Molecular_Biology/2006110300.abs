cryo electron microscopy reconstructions of the leviviridae unveil the densest icosahedral rna packing possible
we solved the structures of the single stranded rna bacteriophages q  pp and ap  by cryo electron microscopy on the outside the symmetrized electron density maps resemble the previously described cryo electron microscopy structure of ms  rna density is present inside the capsids suggesting that the genomic rna of q  pp and ap   analogous to ms  contains many coat protein binding sites in addition to the hairpin on which assembly and packaging are initiated all four bacteriophages harbour the same overall arrangement of the rna which is a unique combination of both triangles and pentagons this combination has not been found in other icosahedral viruses in which the rna structures are either triangular or pentagonal strikingly the unique rna packing of the leviviridae appears to deploy the most efficient method of rna storage by obeying icosahedral symmetry
