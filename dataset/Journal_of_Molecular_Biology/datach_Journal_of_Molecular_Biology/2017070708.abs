structural basis for asymmetric conductance of the influenza m proton channel investigated by solid state nmr spectroscopy
the influenza m protein forms an acid activated proton channel that is essential for virus replication the transmembrane h  selects for protons under low external ph while w  ensures proton conduction only from the n terminus to the c terminus and prevents reverse current under low internal ph here we address the molecular basis for this asymmetric conduction by investigating the structure and dynamics of a mutant channel w f which permits reverse current under low internal ph solid state nmr experiments show that w f m retains the ph dependent  helical conformations and tetrameric structure of the wild type wt channel but has significantly altered protonation and tautomeric equilibria at h  at high ph the h  structure is shifted toward the  tautomer and less cationic tetrads consistent with faster forward deprotonation to the c terminus at low ph the mutant channel contains more cationic tetrads than the wt channel consistent with faster reverse protonation from the c terminus  n nmr spectra allow the extraction of four h  pkas and show that the pkas are more clustered in the mutant channel compared to wt m  moreover binding of the antiviral drug amantadine at the n terminal pore at low ph did not convert all histidines to the neutral state as seen in wt m  but left half of all histidines cationic unambiguously demonstrating c terminal protonation of h  in the mutant these results indicate that asymmetric conduction in wt m is due to w  inhibition of c terminal acid activation by h  when trp is replaced by phe protons can be transferred to h  bidirectionally with distinct rate constants
