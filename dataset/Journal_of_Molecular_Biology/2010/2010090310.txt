Helicobacter pylori infection causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. A major toxin secreted by H. pylori is the bipartite vacuolating cytotoxin A, VacA. The toxin is believed to enter host cells as two subunits: the p55 subunit (55 kDa) and the p33 subunit (33 kDa). At the biochemical level, it has been shown that VacA forms through the assembly of large multimeric pores composed of both the p33 subunit and the p55 subunit in biological membranes. One of the major target organelles of VacA is the mitochondria. Since only the p33 subunit has been reported to be translocated into mitochondria and the p55 subunit is not imported, it has been contentious as to whether VacA assembles into pores in a mitochondrial membrane. Here we show the p55 protein is imported into the mitochondria along with the p33 protein subunit. The p33 subunit integrally associates with the mitochondrial inner membrane, and both the p33 subunit and the p55 subunit are exposed to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Their colocalization suggests that they could reassemble and form a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
