structure of the tubulin ftsz like protein tubz from pseudomonas bacteriophage  kz
pseudomonas  kz like bacteriophages encode a group of related tubulin ftsz like proteins believed to be essential for the correct centring of replicated bacteriophage virions within the bacterial host in this study we present crystal structures of the tubulin ftsz like protein tubz from pseudomonas bacteriophage  kz in both the monomeric and protofilament states revealing that  kz tubz undergoes structural changes required to polymerise forming a canonical tubulin ftsz like protofilament combining our structures with previous work we propose a polymerisation  depolymerisation cycle for the pseudomonas bacteriophage subgroup of tubulin ftsz like proteins electron cryo microscopy of  kz tubz filaments polymerised in vitro implies a long pitch helical arrangement for the constituent protofilaments intriguingly this feature is shared by the other known subgroup of bacteriophage tubulin ftsz like proteins from clostridium species which are thought to be involved in partitioning the genomes of bacteriophages adopting a pseudo lysogenic life cycle
