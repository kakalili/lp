disulfide biochemistry in  cys peroxiredoxin requirement of glu  and arg  for the reduction of yeast tsa by thioredoxin
cys peroxiredoxin prx enzymes are ubiquitously distributed peroxidases that make use of a peroxidatic cysteine cysp to decompose hydroperoxides a disulfide bond is generated as a consequence of the partial unfolding of the  helix that contains cysp therefore during its catalytic cycle  cys prx alternates between two states locally unfolded and fully folded tsa  thiol  specific antioxidant protein  from yeast is by far the most abundant cys based peroxidase in saccharomyces cerevisiae in this work we present the crystallographic structure at    resolution of tsa c s in the decameric form     with a dtt molecule bound to the active site representing one of the few available reports of a  cys prx ahpc prx subfamily  ahpc alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit c structure that incorporates a ligand the analysis of the tsa c s structure indicated that glu  and arg  participate in the stabilization of the cysp  helix as a consequence we raised the hypothesis that glu  and arg  might be relevant to the cysp reactivity therefore tsa e a and tsa r  q mutants were generated and were still able to decompose hydrogen peroxide presenting a second order rate constant in the range of  m  s   remarkably although tsa e a and tsa r  q were efficiently reduced by the low molecular weight reductant dtt these mutants displayed only marginal thioredoxin trx dependent peroxidase activity indicating that glu  and arg  are important for the tsa  trx interaction these results may impact the comprehension of downstream events of signaling pathways that are triggered by the oxidation of critical cys residues such as trx
