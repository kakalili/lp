long range recombination gradient between hiv  subtypes b and c variants caused by sequence differences in the dimerization initiation signal region
hiv  intersubtype recombinants have an increasingly important role in shaping the aids pandemic we sought to understand the molecular mechanisms that generate intersubtype hiv  recombinants we analyzed recombinants of hiv  subtypes b and c and identified their crossover junctions in the viral genome from the   long terminal repeat ltr to the end of pol we identified  recombination events in  proviruses the distribution of these events indicated an apparent recombination gradient there were significantly more crossover junctions in the   half than in the   half of the region analyzed hiv  subtypes b and c have different dimerization initiation signal dis  we hypothesized that the inability of subtype b and c rnas to form perfect base pairing of the dis affects the dimeric rna structure and causes a decrease in recombination events at the   end of the viral genome to test this hypothesis we examined recombinants generated from a subtype c virus and a modified subtype b virus containing a subtype c dis in the  proviruses analyzed we identified  recombination events which are significantly more frequent than in the b c recombinants furthermore these crossover junctions were distributed evenly throughout the region analyzed indicating that the recombination gradient was corrected by matching the dis therefore base pairing at the dis has an important function during hiv  reverse transcription most likely in maintaining nucleic acid structure in the complex these findings reveal elements important to retroviral recombination and provide insights into the generation of hiv  intersubtype recombinants that are important to the aids epidemic
