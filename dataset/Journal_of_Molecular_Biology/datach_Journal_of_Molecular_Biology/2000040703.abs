archaeal homologs of eukaryotic methylation guide small nucleolar rnas lessons from the pyrococcus genomes edited by m yaniv
ribose methylation is a prevalent type of nucleotide modification in rrna eukaryotic rrnas display a complex pattern of ribose methylations amounting to  in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and about   in vertebrates ribose methylations of eukaryotic rrnas are each guided by a cognate small rna belonging to the family of box c d antisense snornas through transient formation of a specific base pairing at the rrna modification site in prokaryotes the pattern of rrna ribose methylations has been fully characterized in a single species so far escherichia coli which contains only four ribose methylated rrna nucleotides however the hyperthermophile archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus contains like eukaryotes a large number of yet unmapped rrna ribose methylations and homologs of eukaryotic box c d small nucleolar ribonuclear proteins have been identified in archaeal genomes we have therefore searched archaeal genomes for potential homologs of eukaryotic methylation guide small nucleolar rnas by combining searches for structured motifs with homology searches we have identified a family of  small rnas conserved in the genomes of three hyperthermophile pyrococcus species which we have experimentally characterized in pyrococcus abyssi the pyrococcus small rnas the first reported homologs of methylation guide small nucleolar rnas in organisms devoid of a nucleus appear as a paradigm of minimalist box c d antisense rnas they differ from their eukaryotic homologs by their outstanding structural homogeneity extended consensus box motifs and the quasi systematic presence of two instead of one rrna antisense elements remarkably for each small rna the two antisense elements always match rrna sequences close to each other in rrna structure suggesting an important role in rrna folding only a few of the predicted p abyssi rrna ribose methylations have been detected so far further analysis of these archaeal small rnas could provide new insights into the origin and functions of methylation guide small nucleolar rnas and illuminate the still elusive role of rrna ribose methylations
