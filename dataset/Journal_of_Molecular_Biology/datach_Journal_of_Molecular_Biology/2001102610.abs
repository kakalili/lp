crystal structure of a novel mid gut procarboxypeptidase from the cotton pest helicoverpa armigera edited by d rees
the cotton bollworm helicoverpa armigera hubner  lepidoptera noctuidae is one of the most serious insect pests in australia india and china the larva causes substantial economical losses to legume fibre cereal oilseed and vegetable crops this pest has proven to be difficult to control by conventional means mainly due to the development of pesticide resistance we present here the    crystal structure from the novel procarboxypeptidase pcpaha found in the gut extracts from h armigera larvae the first one reported for an insect this metalloprotease is synthesized as a zymogen of   kda which upon in vitro activation with lys c endoproteinase yields a pro segment of  residues and an active carboxypeptidase moiety of   residues both regions show a three dimensional structure quite similar to the corresponding structures in mammalian digestive carboxypeptidases the most relevant structural differences being located in the loops between conserved secondary structure elements including the primary activation site this activation site contains the motif ala lys at the c terminus of the helix connecting the pro and the carboxypeptidase domains a remarkable feature of pcpaha is the occurrence of the same ala lys near the c terminus of the active enzyme the presence of ser  in pcpaha instead of ile and asp found in the pancreatic a and b forms respectively enlarges the s   specificity pocket and influences the substrate preferences of the enzyme the c terminal tail of the leech carboxypeptidase inhibitor has been modelled into the pcpaha active site to explore the substrate preferences and the enzymatic mechanism of this enzyme
