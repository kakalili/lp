binding of larp to the conserved   stem  loop regulates translation of mrnas encoding type i collagen
type i collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body produced by folding of two   i polypeptides and one   i polypeptide into the triple helix a conserved stem  loop structure is found in the   untranslated region of collagen mrnas encompassing the translation start codon we cloned la ribonucleoprotein domain family member  larp  as the protein that binds the collagen   stem  loop in a sequence specific manner larp has a distinctive bipartite rna binding domain not found in other members of the la superfamily larp interacts with the two single stranded regions of the   stem  loop the kd for binding of larp to the   stem  loop is   nm larp binds the   stem  loop in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the cytoplasm larp does not associate with polysomes however overexpression of larp blocks ribosomal loading on collagen mrnas knocking down larp by small interfering rna also decreased polysomal loading of collagen mrnas suggesting that it regulates translation collagen protein is synthesized at discrete regions of the endoplasmic reticulum using collagen  gfp green fluorescent protein reporter protein we could reproduce this focal pattern of synthesis but only when the reporter was encoded by mrna with the   stem  loop and in the presence of larp  when the reporter was encoded by mrna without the   stem  loop or in the absence of larp  it accumulated diffusely throughout the endoplasmic reticulum this indicates that larp activity is needed for focal synthesis of collagen polypeptides we postulate that the larp dependent mechanism increases local concentration of collagen polypeptides for more efficient folding of the collagen heterotrimer
