a base flipping mechanism for the t phage  glucosyltransferase and identification of a transition state analog
t phage  glucosyltransferase bgt modifies t dna we crystallized bgt with udp glucose and a  mer dna fragment containing an abasic site we obtained two crystal structures of a ternary complex bgt  udp  dna at    and    resolution one with a tris molecule and the other with a metal ion at the active site both structures reveal a large distortion in the bound dna bgt flips the deoxyribose moiety at the abasic site to an extra helical position and induces a   bend in the dna with a marked widening of the major groove the tris molecule mimics the glucose moiety in its transition state the base flipping mechanism which has so far been observed only for glycosylases methyltransferases and endonucleases is now reported for a glucosyltransferase bgt is unique in binding and inserting a loop into the dna duplex through the major groove only furthermore bgt compresses the backbone dna one base further than the target base on the   side
