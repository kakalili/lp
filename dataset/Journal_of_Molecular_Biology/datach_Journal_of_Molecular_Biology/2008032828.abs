single molecule atomic force spectroscopy reveals that dnad forms scaffolds and enhances duplex melting
the bacillus subtilis dnad is an essential dna binding protein implicated in replication and dna remodeling using single molecule atomic force spectroscopy we have studied the interaction of dnad and its domains with dna our data reveal that binding of dnad to immobilized single molecules of duplex dna causes a marked reduction in the  end to end  distance of the dna in a concentration dependent manner consistent with previously reported dnad induced looping by scaffold formation native dnad enhances partial melting of the dna strands the c terminal domain cd of dnad binds to dna and enhances partial duplex melting but does not cause dna looping the cd mediated melting is not as efficient as that caused by native dnad the n terminal domain nd does not affect significantly the dna a mixture of nd and cd fails to recreate the dna looping effect of native dnad but produces exactly the same effects as cd on its own consistent with the previously reported failure of the separated domains to form dna interacting scaffolds
