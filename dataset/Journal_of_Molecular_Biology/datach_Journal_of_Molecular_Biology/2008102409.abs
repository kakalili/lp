kinetic coupling of folding and prolyl isomerization of   microglobulin studied by mutational analysis
microglobulin   m  a protein responsible for dialysis related amyloidosis adopts a typical immunoglobulin domain fold with the n terminal peptide bond of pro  in a cis isomer the refolding of   m is limited by the slow trans to cis isomerization of pro  implying that intermediates with a non native trans pro  isomer are precursors for the formation of amyloid fibrils to obtain further insight into the pro limited folding of   m we studied the gdn hcl dependent unfolding refolding kinetics using two mutants w  and p v   ms as well as the wild type   m w    m is a triple mutant in which both of the authentic trp residues trp  and trp  are replaced by phe and a buried trp common to other immunoglobulin domains is introduced at the position of leu  i e  l w w f w f  w    m exhibits a dramatic quenching of fluorescence upon folding enabling a detailed analysis of pro limited unfolding refolding on the other hand p v   m is a mutant in which pro  is replaced by val useful for probing the kinetic role of the trans to cis isomerization of pro  a comparative analysis of the unfolding refolding kinetics of these mutants including three types of double jump experiments revealed the prolyl isomerization to be coupled with the conformational transitions leading to apparently unusual kinetics particularly for the unfolding we suggest that careful consideration of the kinetic coupling of unfolding refolding and prolyl isomerization which has tended to be neglected in recent studies is essential for clarifying the mechanism of protein folding and moreover its biological significance
