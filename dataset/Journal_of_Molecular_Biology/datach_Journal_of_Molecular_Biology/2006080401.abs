conformational transition between four and five stranded phenylalanine zippers determined by a local packing interaction
alpha helical coiled coils play a crucial role in mediating specific protein  protein interactions however the rules and mechanisms that govern helix  helix association in coiled coils remain incompletely understood here we have engineered a seven heptad  phe zipper  protein phe   with phenylalanine residues at all  hydrophobic a and d positions and generated a further variant phe  m in which a single core phe residue is substituted with met phe  forms a discrete  helical pentamer in aqueous solution while phe  m folds into a tetrameric helical structure x ray crystal structures reveal that in both the tetramer and the pentamer the a and d side chains interlock in a classical knobs into holes packing to produce parallel coiled coil structures enclosing large tubular cavities however the presence of the met residue in the apolar interface of the tetramer markedly alters its local coiled coil conformation and superhelical geometry thus short range interactions involving the met side chain serve to preferentially select for tetramer formation either by inhibiting a nucleation step essential for pentamer folding or by abrogating an intermediate required to form the pentamer although specific trigger sequences have not been clearly identified in dimeric coiled coils higher order coiled coils as well as other oligomeric multi protein complexes may require such sequences to nucleate and direct their assembly
