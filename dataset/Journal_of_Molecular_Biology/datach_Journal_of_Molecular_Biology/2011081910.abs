structure and organisation of sinr the master regulator of biofilm formation in bacillus subtilis
sinr encodes a tetrameric repressor of genes required for biofilm formation in bacillus subtilis sini which is transcribed under spo a control encodes a dimeric protein that binds to sinr to form a sinr  sini heterodimer in which the dna binding functions of sinr are abrogated and repression of biofilm genes is relieved the heterodimer forming surface comprises residues conserved between sinr and sini each forms a pair of  helices that hook together to form an intermolecular four helix bundle here we are interested in the assembly of the sinr tetramer and its binding to dna size exclusion chromatography with multi angle laser light scattering and crystallographic analysis reveal that a dna binding fragment of sinr residues     is a monomer while a sini binding fragment residues      is a tetramer arranged as a dimer of dimers the sinr      chain forms two  helices with the organisation of the dimer similar to that observed in the sinr  sini complex the tetramer is formed through interactions of residues at the c termini of the four chains a model of the intact sinr tetramer in which the dna binding domains surround the tetramerisation core was built fluorescence anisotropy and surface plasmon resonance experiments showed that sinr binds to an oligonucleotide duplex    tttgttctctaaagagaactta    containing a pair of sinr consensus sequences in inverted orientation with a kd of   nm the implications of these data for promoter binding and the curious quaternary structural transitions of sinr upon binding to i sini and ii the sinr like protein slrr which  repurposes  sinr as a repressor of autolysin and motility genes are discussed
