regulation of nucleosome stacking and chromatin compaction by the histone h n terminal tail  h a acidic patch interaction
chromatin folding and dynamics are critically dependent on nucleosome  nucleosome interactions with important contributions from internucleosome binding of the histone h n terminal tail k  r  domain to the surface of the h a h b dimer the h lys  plays a pivotal role in this regard using in vitro reconstituted  mer nucleosome arrays we have investigated the mechanism of the h n terminal tail in maintaining nucleosome  nucleosome stacking and mediating intra and inter array chromatin compaction with emphasis on the role of k  and the positive charge region r  r  analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity experiments and precipitation assays were employed to analyze effects on chromatin folding and self association respectively effects on chromatin folding caused by various mutations and modifications at position k  in the h histone were studied additionally using charge quenching mutations we characterized the importance of the interaction of the residues within the h positive charge region r  r  with the h a acidic patch of the adjacent nucleosome furthermore crosslinking experiments were conducted to establish the proximity of the basic tail region to the acidic patch our data indicate that the positive charge and length of the side chain of h k  are important for its access to the adjacent nucleosome in the process of nucleosome  nucleosome stacking and array folding the location and orientation of the h r  r  domain on the h a h b dimer surface of the neighboring nucleosome core particle ncp in the compacted chromatin fiber were established the dominance of electrostatic interactions in maintaining intra array interaction was demonstrated
