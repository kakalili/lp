structural basis of affinity maturation of the tepc  v    anti  phenyl  oxazolone antibodies
affinity maturation is a process that leads to the emergence of more efficient antibodies following initial antigen encounter and represents a key strategy of the adaptive immunity of vertebrate organisms earlier and detailed sequence studies of the antibody response to a model antigen the hapten  phenyl  oxazolone phox  define three different classes of antibodies class i antibodies use the vhox v ox gene pair and dominate the early stages of the anti phox response class ii antibodies use the v ox gene but a different vh segment and are common in the intermediate stages and class iii antibodies use the tepc  v    genes and play the greatest role in the late stages only the crystal structure of one anti phox antibody the class ii nq    fab fragment has been described here we report the crystal structures of the scfv form of the low and high affinity anti phox class iii antibodies nq    and nq     complexed with the hapten the two antibodies differ by nine amino acid substitutions all located in the vh domain analysis of the two structures shows that affinity maturation results from an increase in surface complementarity as a consequence of a finely tuned and highly concerted process chaperoned by the somatic mutations and implies a more efficient hapten induced fit in the mature antibody the data also demonstrate that class iii antibodies respond in a completely different way to the architectural problem of binding phox compared to the class ii antibody nq
