solution structure of aspp n terminal domain n aspp  reveals a ubiquitin like fold
proteins of the aspp family bind to p  and regulate p  mediated apoptosis two family members aspp and aspp  have pro apoptotic functions while iaspp shows anti apoptotic responses however both the mechanism of enhancement repression of apoptosis and the molecular basis for their different responses remain unknown to address the role of the n termini of pro apoptotic aspp proteins we solved the solution structure of n aspp      by nmr spectroscopy the structure of this domain reveals a  grasp ubiquitin like fold our findings suggest a possible role for the n termini of aspp proteins in binding to other proteins in the apoptotic response network and thus mediating their selective pro apoptotic function
