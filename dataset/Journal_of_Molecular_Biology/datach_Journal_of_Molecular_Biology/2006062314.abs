structural and genomic properties of the hyperthermophilic archaeal virus atv with an extracellular stage of the reproductive cycle
a novel virus atv of the hyperthermophilic archaeal genus acidianus has the unique property of undergoing a major morphological development outside of and independently of the host cell virions are extruded from host cells as lemon shaped tail less particles after which they develop long tails at each pointed end at temperatures close to that of the natural habitat    c the extracellularly developed tails constitute tubes which terminate in an anchor like structure that is not observed in the tail less particles a thin filament is located within the tube which exhibits a periodic structure tail development produces a one half reduction in the volume of the virion concurrent with a slight expansion of the virion surface the circular double stranded dna genome contains     bp and is exceptional for a crenarchaeal virus in that it carries four putative transposable elements as well as genes which previously have been associated only with archaeal self transmissable plasmids in total it encodes  predicted proteins including  structural proteins with molecular masses in the range of  to   kda several of the larger proteins are rich in coiled coil and or low complexity sequence domains which are unusual for archaea one protein in particular p   resembles an intermediate filament protein in its structural properties it is modified in the two tailed but not in the tail less virion particles and it may contribute to viral tail development exceptionally for a crenarchaeal virus infection with atv results either in viral replication and subsequent cell lysis or in conversion of the infected cell to a lysogen the lysogenic cycle involves integration of the viral genome into the host chromosome probably facilitated by the virus encoded integrase and this process can be interrupted by different stress factors
