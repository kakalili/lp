solution structure and self association properties of the p tfiih subunit responsible for trichothiodystrophy
trichothiodystrophy ttd is a rare hereditary multi system disorder associated with defects in nucleotide excision repair ner and transcription as consequences of mutations in xpb xpd and p ttd a subunits of transcription factor iih tfiih  here we report the solution structure of the p ttd a protein a small    protein built around an antiparallel  sheet that forms a homodimer with an extended interface in order to characterize the dimer interface we have introduced a mutation at position   which destabilizes the dimeric form of the protein we have shown that this mutation has no effect on the intrinsic ability of p ttd a to stimulate ner in vitro but affects the capacity of p ttd a to restore tfiih concentration in ttd a fibroblasts point mutations found in ttd a patients are discussed on the basis of the present structure
