dissecting the alternatively folded state of the antibody fab fragment
intact antibodies and antigen binding fragments fab have been previously shown to form an alternatively folded state afs at low ph this state consists primarily of secondary structure interactions with reduced tertiary structure content the afs can be distinguished from the molten globule state by the formation of nonnative structure and in particular its high stability in this study the isolated domains of the mak  murine monoclonal antibody of the subtype  igg  fab fragment were investigated under conditions that have been reported to induce the afs surprising differences in the ability of individual domains to form the afs were observed despite the similarities in their native structures all fab domains were able to adopt the afs but only for vh variable domain of the heavy chain could a significant amount of tertiary structure be detected and different conditions were needed to induce the afs vh the least stable of the domains under physiological conditions was the most stable in the afs yet all domains showed significant stability against thermal and chemical unfolding in their afs formation of the afs was found to generally proceed via the unfolded state with similar rates for most of the domains taken together our data reveal striking differences in the biophysical properties of the afs of individual antibody domains that reflect the variation possible for domains of highly homologous native structures furthermore they allow individual domain contributions to be dissected from specific oligomer effects in the afs of the antibody fab fragment
