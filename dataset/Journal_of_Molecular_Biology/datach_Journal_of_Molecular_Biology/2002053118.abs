the influence of sequence divergence between alleles of the human ms  minisatellite incorporated into the yeast genome on length mutation rates and lethal recombination events during meiosis
certain minisatellites exhibit hypervariability with respect to the number of repeat units and thus allele length such polymorphism is generated by germline specific recombinational events that occur at high frequencies and lead to the gain or loss of repeat units in order to elucidate the molecular details of mutagenesis in minisatellites we have integrated human minisatellites into the yeast genome in the vicinity of a hotspot for meiotic double strand breaks dsbs  here we describe the results of tetrad analyses of mutations in the human ms  minisatellite in yeast strains heterozygous for alleles composed of  and  repeat units as well as in a strain homozygous for the same  repeat unit allele the length mutation rate was twice as high in the heterozygous strain as in the homozygous strain suggesting that sequence divergence between alleles enhances the generation of length mutations in the case of heterozygotes the frequency of length mutants resulting from inter allelic exchange was significantly higher in tetrads with three viable spores than in tetrads with four viable spores indicating that there is a higher probability for spore mortality in tetrads originating from meioses during which inter allelic exchange of repeat units occurs in an attempt to explain these findings we propose a model for minisatellite mutation involving recombination in which sequence divergence between alleles results in a heteroduplex containing numerous mismatches we suggest that convergent mismatch repair tracts in this heteroduplex give rise to a dsb that may be repaired by an additional round of recombination resulting in mutation of a third allele or be lethal if such recombination fails it appears probable that the formation of such additional mutants is the major explanation for the difference in meiotic length mutation rates between the heterozygous and homozygous yeast strains and that this phenomenon contributes to high germline length mutation frequencies at minisatellites in humans
