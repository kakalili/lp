structure  based mechanism of ligand binding for periplasmic solute binding protein of the bug family
bug proteins form a large family of periplasmic solute binding proteins well represented in  proteobacteria they adopt a characteristic venus flytrap fold with two globular domains bisected by a ligand binding cleft the structures of two liganded bug proteins have revealed that the family is specific for carboxylated solutes with a characteristic mode of binding involving two highly conserved  strand  turn  helix motifs originating from each domain these two motifs form hydrogen bonds with a carboxylate group of the ligand both directly and via conserved water molecules and have thus been termed the carboxylate pincers in both crystallized bug proteins the ligands were found enclosed between the two domains and inaccessible to solvent suggesting an inter domain hinge bending motion upon ligand binding we report here the first structures of an open unliganded bug protein and of the same protein with a citrate ion bound in the open cavity one of the ligand carboxylate groups is bound to one half of the carboxylate pincers by the  strand  turn  helix motif from domain  and the citrate ion forms several additional interactions with domain  the ligand is accessible to solvent and has very few contacts with domain  in this open liganded structure the second part of the carboxylate pincers originating from domain  is not stabilized by ligand binding and a loop replaces the  turn in the unliganded structure both motifs of the carboxylate pincers are highly mobile and neither of the two  turns is formed thus ligand recognition is performed by domain  with the carboxylate group serving as an initial anchoring point stabilization of the closed conformation requires proper interactions to be established with domain  and thus domain  discriminates between productively and non productively bound ligands
