structure and thermodynamics of effector molecule binding to the nitrogen signal transduction pii protein glnz from azospirillum brasilense
the trimeric pii signal transduction proteins regulate the function of a variety of target proteins predominantly involved in nitrogen metabolism atp adp and  oxoglutarate  og are key effector molecules influencing pii binding to targets studies of pii proteins have established that the  residue t loop plays a central role in effector sensing and target binding however the specific effects of effector binding on t loop conformation have remained poorly documented we present eight crystal structures of the azospirillum brasilense pii protein glnz six of which are cocrystallized and liganded with adp or atp we find that interaction with the diphosphate moiety of bound adp constrains the n terminal part of the t loop in a characteristic way that is maintained in adp promoted complexes with target proteins in contrast the interactions with the triphosphate moiety in atp complexes are much more variable and no single predominant interaction mode is apparent except for the ternary mgatp  og complex these conclusions can be extended to most investigated pii proteins of the glnb glnk subfamily unlike reported for other pii proteins microcalorimetry reveals no cooperativity between the three binding sites of glnz trimers for any of the three effectors under carefully controlled experimental conditions
