rcc uses a conformationally diverse loop region to interact with the nucleosome a model for the rcc  nucleosome complex
the binding of rcc  regulator of chromosome condensation  to chromatin is critical for cellular processes such as mitosis nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear envelope formation because rcc recruits the small gtpase ran ras related nuclear protein to chromatin and sets up a ran gtp gradient around the chromosomes however the molecular mechanism by which rcc binds to nucleosomes the repeating unit of chromatin is not known we have used biochemical approaches to test structural models for how the rcc   propeller protein could bind to the nucleosome in contrast to the prevailing model rcc does not appear to use the  propeller face opposite to its ran binding face to interact with nucleosomes instead we find that rcc uses a conformationally flexible loop region we have termed the switchback loop in addition to its n terminal tail to bind to the nucleosome the juxtaposition of the rcc switchback loop to its ran binding surface suggests a novel mechanism for how nucleosome bound rcc recruits ran to chromatin furthermore this model accounts for previously unexplained observations for how ran can interact with the nucleosome both dependent and independent of rcc and how binding of the nucleosome can enhance rcc s ran nucleotide exchange activity
