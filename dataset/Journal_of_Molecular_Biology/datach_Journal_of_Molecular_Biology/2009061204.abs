traf suppresses basal ikk activity in resting cells and tnf  can activate ikk in traf and traf double knockout cells
tumor necrosis factor receptor tnfr associated factor  traf  and traf are adapter proteins involved in tnf  induced activation of the c jun n terminal kinase and nuclear factor  b nf  b pathways currently tnf  induced nf  b activation is believed to be impaired in traf and traf double knockout t  dko cells here we report instead that t  dko cells exhibit high basal i b kinase ikk activity and elevated expression of nf  b dependent genes in unstimulated conditions although tnf  induced receptor interacting protein  ubiquitination is indeed impaired in t  dko cells tnf  stimulation further increases ikk activity in these cells resulting in significantly elevated expression of nf  b target genes to a level higher than that in wild type cells inhibition of nik in t  dko cells attenuates basal ikk activity and restores robust tnf  induced ikk activation to a level comparable with that seen in wild type cells this suggests that tnf  can activate ikk in the absence of traf and traf expression and receptor interacting protein  ubiquitination in addition both the basal and tnf  induced expression of anti apoptotic proteins are normal in t  dko cells yet these dko cells remain sensitive to tnf  induced cell death due to the impaired recruitment of anti apoptotic proteins to the tnfr complex in the absence of traf  thus our data demonstrate that traf negatively regulates basal ikk activity in resting cells and inhibits tnf  induced cell death by recruiting anti apoptotic proteins to the tnfr complex rather than by activating the nf  b pathway
