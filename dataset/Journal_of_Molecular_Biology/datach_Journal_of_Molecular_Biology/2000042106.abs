the bacillus subtilis addab helicase nuclease is regulated by its cognate chi sequence in vitro edited by m gottesman
the addab enzyme is important to homologous dna recombination in bacillus subtilis where it is thought to be the functional counterpart of the recbcd enzyme of escherichia coli in vivo addab responds to a specific five nucleotide sequence    agcgg   or its complement in a manner analogous to the response of the recbcd enzyme to interaction with  sequences here we show that purified addab enzyme is able to load at a double stranded dna end and is both a dna helicase and nuclease whose combined action results in the degradation of both strands of the dna duplex during translocation recognition of the properly oriented sequence   agcgg   causes attenuation of the addab enzyme nuclease activity that is responsible for degradation of the strand   terminal at the entry site therefore we conclude that   agcgg   is the b subtilis chi site and it is hereafter referred to as  bs after encountering  bs both the degradation of the   terminal strand and the helicase activity persist thus processing of a double stranded dna end by the addab enzyme produces a duplex dna molecule with a protruding   terminated single stranded tail a universal intermediate of the recombination process
