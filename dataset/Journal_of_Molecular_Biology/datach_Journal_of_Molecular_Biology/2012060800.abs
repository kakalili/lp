an amino acid packing code for  helical structure and protein design
this work demonstrates that all packing in  helices can be simplified to repetitive patterns of a single motif the knob  socket using the precision of voronoi polyhedra delauney tessellations to identify contacts the knob  socket is a four residue tetrahedral motif a knob residue on one  helix packs into the three residue socket on another  helix the principle of the knob  socket model relates the packing between levels of protein structure the intra helical packing arrangements within secondary structure that permit inter helix tertiary packing interactions within an  helix the three residue sockets arrange residues into a uniform packing lattice inter helix packing results from a definable pattern of interdigitated knob  socket motifs between two  helices furthermore the knob  socket model classifies three types of sockets   free favoring only intra helical packing   filled favoring inter helical interactions and   non disfavoring  helical structure the amino acid propensities in these three socket classes essentially represent an amino acid code for structure in  helical packing using this code we used a novel yet straightforward approach for the design of  helical structure to validate the knob  socket model unique sequences for three peptides were created to produce a predicted amount of  helical structure mostly helical some helical and no helix these three peptides were synthesized and helical content was assessed using cd spectroscopy the measured  helicity of each peptide was consistent with the expected predictions these results and analysis demonstrate that the knob  socket motif functions as the basic unit of packing and presents an intuitive tool to decipher the rules governing packing in protein structure
