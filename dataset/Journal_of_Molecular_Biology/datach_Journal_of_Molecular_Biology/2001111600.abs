indirect readout of dna sequence at the primary kink site in the cap dna complex dna binding specificity based on energetics of dna kinking edited by i tinoco
the catabolite activator protein cap makes no direct contact with the consensus base pair t a at position  of the dna half site   a a a t g t g a t c t    but nevertheless exhibits strong specificity for t a at position  binding of cap results in formation of a sharp dna kink with a roll angle of     and a twist angle of     between positions  and  of the dna half site the consensus base pair t a at position  and the consensus base pair g c at position  form a t a g c step which is known to be associated with dna flexibility it has been proposed that specificity for t a at position  is a consequence of formation of the dna kink between positions  and  and of effects of the t a g c step on the geometry of dna kinking or the energetics of dna kinking in this work we determine crystallographic structures of cap dna complexes having the consensus base pair t a at position  or the non consensus base pair c g at position  we show that complexes containing t a or c g at position  exhibit similar overall dna bend angles and local geometries of dna kinking we infer that indirect readout in this system does not involve differences in the geometry of dna kinking but rather solely differences in the energetics of dna kinking we further infer that the main determinant of dna conformation in this system is protein dna interaction and not dna sequence
