how the n terminal domain of the oscp subunit of bovine f fo atp synthase interacts with the n terminal region of an alpha subunit
the peripheral stalk of atp synthase acts as a stator holding the    catalytic subcomplex and the membrane subunit a against the torque of the rotating central stalk and attached c ring in bovine mitochondria the n terminal domain of the oligomycin sensitivity conferral protein oscp nt residues     anchors one end of the peripheral stalk to the n terminal tails of one or more  subunits of the f subcomplex here we present an nmr characterisation of the interaction between oscp nt and a peptide corresponding to residues    of the  subunit of bovine f atpase the interaction site contains adjoining hydrophobic surfaces of helices  and  of oscp nt binding to hydrophobic side chains of the  peptide
