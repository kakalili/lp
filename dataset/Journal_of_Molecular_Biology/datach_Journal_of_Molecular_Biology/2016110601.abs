molecular dissection of the interface between the type vi secretion tssm cytoplasmic domain and the tssg baseplate component
the type vi secretion system t ss is a multiprotein complex that catalyses toxin secretion through the bacterial cell envelope of various gram negative bacteria including important human pathogens this machine uses a bacteriophage like contractile tail to puncture the prey cell and inject harmful toxins the t ss tail comprises an inner tube capped by the cell puncturing spike and wrapped by the contractile sheath this structure is built on an assembly platform the baseplate which is anchored to the bacterial cell envelope by the tssjlm membrane complex mc  this mc serves as both a tail docking station and a channel for the passage of the inner tube the tssm transmembrane protein is a key component of the mc as it connects the inner and outer membranes in this study we define the tssm topology highlighting a large but poorly studied  kda cytoplasmic domain tssmcyto located between two transmembrane segments protein  protein interaction assays further show that tssmcyto oligomerises and makes contacts with several baseplate components using computer predictions we delineate two subdomains in tssmcyto including a nucleotide triphosphatase ntpase domain followed by a   aa extension finally site directed mutagenesis coupled to functional assays reveals the contribution of these subdomains and conserved motifs to the interaction with t ss partners and to the function of the secretion apparatus
