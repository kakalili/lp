hiv  replication in monocyte derived dendritic cells is stimulated by melarsoprol one of the main drugs against human african trypanosomiasis
human african trypanosomiasis hat is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite trypanosoma brucei the causative agent of sleeping sickness that is still endemic in well defined regions of sub saharan africa co infections with this human pathogen and human immunodeficiency virus hiv are not uncommon but their potential interaction has been little studied the organo arsenical drug melarsoprol has been widely used for the treatment of late stage trypanosomiasis since the early   s and is still widely used despite very serious adverse effects because arsenic trioxide another trivalent arsenical structurally related to melarsoprol has been shown to markedly increase hiv replication in dendritic cells dcs  we tested the effect of melarsoprol on virus replication in various primary human immune cell types including dcs we show here that this medicinal drug stimulates the replication of several strains of hiv  specifically in monocyte derived dcs and also renders such cells susceptible to hiv  infection the drug acts mainly through an increase in the efficacy of the reverse transcription process and this effect is mediated at least partly by an inhibition of expression of the cellular restriction factor apobec g these observations raise concerns about the harmful effect that melarsoprol might exert on the natural history of hiv in co infected patients and on virus transmission
