visualizing side chains of invisible protein conformers by solution nmr
sparsely populated and transiently formed protein conformers can play key roles in many biochemical processes understanding the structure function paradigm requires therefore an atomic resolution description of these rare states however they are difficult to study because they cannot be observed using standard biophysical techniques in the past decade nmr methods have been developed for structural studies of these elusive conformers focusing primarily on backbone h  n and  c nuclei here we extend the methodology to include side chains by developing a  c based chemical exchange saturation transfer experiment for the assignment of side chain aliphatic  c chemical shifts in uniformly  c labeled proteins a pair of applications is provided involving the folding of  sheet fyn sh and  helical ff domains over   and   of the side chain  c chemical shifts for excited states corresponding to the unfolded conformation of the fyn sh domain and a folding intermediate of the ff domain respectively have been obtained providing insight into side chain packing and dynamics
