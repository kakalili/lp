shared protein components of sine rnps
the heterogeneous short rnas produced from the high copy short mobile elements sines interact with proteins to form rna  protein rnp complexes in particular the bc rna which is transcribed to high levels specifically in brain and testis from one locus of the id sine family exists as a discrete rnp complex we expressed a series of altered bc  and other sine related rnas in several cell lines and tested for the mobility of the resulting rnp complexes in a native page assay to determine which portions of these sine rnas contribute to protein binding when different sine rnas were substituted for the bc id sequence the resulting rnps exhibited the same mobility as bc  this indicates that the protein s binding to the id portion of bc is not sequence specific and may be more dependent upon the secondary structure of the rna it also suggests that all sine rnas may bind a similar set of cellular proteins deletion of the a rich region of bc rna has a marked effect on the mobility of the rnp rodent cell lines exhibit a slightly different mobility for this shifted complex when compared to human cell lines reflecting evolutionary differences in one or more of the protein components on the basis of mobility change observed in rnp complexes when the a rich region is removed we decided to examine poly a binding protein pabp as a candidate member of the rnp an antibody against the c terminus of pabp is able to immunoprecipitate bc rna confirming pabp s presence in the bc rnp given the ubiquitous role of poly a regions in the retrotransposition process these data suggest that pabp may contribute to the sine retrotransposition process
