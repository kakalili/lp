e  c cbl recognition is necessary but not sufficient for ubiquitination activity
the e ubiquitin conjugating enzymes ubch and ubch b both show specific binding to the ring really interesting new gene domain of the e ubiquitin protein ligase c cbl but ubch hardly supports ubiquitination of c cbl and substrate in a reconstituted system here we found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the e  e interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of ubch b and ubch in their interaction with c cbl the quick transfer of ubiquitin from the ubch b  ub thioester to c cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that ubch b might functionally be a relatively pliable e enzyme in contrast the ubch  ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions indicating that ubch might be a more specific e enzyme our results imply that the interaction specificity between c cbl and e is required but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets
