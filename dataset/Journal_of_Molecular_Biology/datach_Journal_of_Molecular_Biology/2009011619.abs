halogenated benzenes bound within a non polar cavity in t lysozyme provide examples of i  s and i  se halogen bonding
we showed earlier that the mutation of leu  to alanine in bacteriophage t lysozyme creates an internal cavity of volume       that binds benzene and a variety of other ligands as such this cavity provides an excellent target to study protein ligand interaction here we use low temperature crystallography and related techniques to analyze the binding of halogen incorporated benzenes typified by c f x where x h f cl br or i and c h x where x h or i was also studied because of the increased electron density of fluorine relative to hydrogen the geometry of binding of the fluoro compounds can often be determined more precisely than their hydrogen containing analogs all of the ligands bind in essentially the same plane but the center of the phenyl ring can translate by up to     in no case does the ligand rotate freely within the cavity the walls of the cavity consist predominantly of hydrocarbon atoms and in several cases it appears that van der waals interactions define the geometry of binding in comparing the smallest with the largest ligand the cavity volume increases from     to      this shows that the protein is flexible and adapts to the size and shape of the ligand there is a remarkably close contact of     between the iodine atom on c f i and the sulfur or selenium atom of met or semet   this interaction is     less than the sum of the van der waals radii and is a clear example of a so called halogen bond notwithstanding this close approach the increase in binding energy for the halogen bond relative to a van der waals contact is estimated to be only about      kcal mol
