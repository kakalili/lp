stability of a structural scaffold upon activity transfer x ray structure of a three fingers chimeric protein edited by r huber
fasciculin  and toxin  proteins belong to the same structural family of three fingered snake toxins they act on different targets but in each case the binding region involves residues from loops i and ii the superimposition of the two structures suggests that these functional regions correspond to structurally distinct zones loop i half of loop ii and the c terminal residue of fasciculin  were therefore transferred into the toxin   the inhibition constant of the resulting chimera is only  fold lower than that of fasciculin  and as expected the potency of binding to the toxin  target has been lost in order to understand the structure function relationship between the chimera and its  parent  molecules we solved its structure by x ray crystallography the protein crystallized in space group p   with a b     and c     the crystal structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to    resolution the structure belongs to the three fingered snake toxin family with a core of four disulphide bridges from which emerge the three loops i ii and iii superimposition of the chimera on fasciculin  or toxin  revealed an overall fold intermediate between those of the two parent molecules the regions corresponding to toxin  and to fasciculin  retained their respective geometries in addition the chimera protein displayed a structural behaviour similar to that of fasciculin  i e dimerization in the crystal structure of fasciculin  and the geometry of the region that binds to acetylcholinesterase in conclusion this structure shows that the chimera retains the general structural characteristics of three fingered toxins and the structural specificity of the transferred function
