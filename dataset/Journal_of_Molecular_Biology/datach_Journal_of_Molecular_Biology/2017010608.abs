a highly diverse and functional na ve ubiquitin variant library for generation of intracellular affinity reagents
we report the design construction and validation of a highly diverse phage displayed na ve ubiquitin variant ubv library we first conducted a mutation tolerance scan of  residues and confirmed that  of these could be substituted by chemically diverse amino acids without compromising the display of ubvs on phage subsequently we constructed a library containing      unique members in which these  positions were diversified with a degenerate codon that encodes for  aa that are prevalent in protein interaction sites to ensure the optimal structural stability of the ubvs we constructed the library in a two step process whereby  positions were randomized first and following the selection for displayed ubvs the resulting pool was further diversified at the other  positions the resulting library was validated by conducting binding selections against a panel of  diverse protein antigens and was found to be as functional as a highly validated synthetic antibody library yielding binders against  of the antigens detailed characterization of an ubv that bound to the cell surface receptor human epidermal growth factor receptor  revealed tight binding in the single digit nanomolar range moreover ubvs that bound to two distinct sites on the intracellular adapter grb could be combined to generate a potent inhibitor that functioned in cells these results validate ubiquitin as a robust scaffold for the construction of na ve libraries that can be used to generate ubvs that target signaling networks both outside and inside the cells
