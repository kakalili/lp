first inactive conformation of ck   the catalytic subunit of protein kinase ck
the ser thr kinase casein kinase  ck  is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic chains ck   catalytic subunit of ck  attached to a dimer of two noncatalytic subunits ck   noncatalytic subunit of ck  ck  belongs to the superfamily of eukaryotic protein kinases epks  to function as regulatory key components epks normally exist in inactive ground states and are activated only upon specific signals typically this activation is accompanied by large conformational changes in helix  c and in the activation segment leading to a characteristic arrangement of catalytic key elements for ck   however no strict physiological control of activity is known accordingly ck  was found so far exclusively in the characteristic conformation of active epks which is in this case additionally stabilized by a unique intramolecular contact between the n terminal segment on one side and helix  c and the activation segment on the other side we report here the structure of a c terminally truncated variant of human ck  in which the enzyme adopts a decidedly inactive conformation for the first time in this ck  structure those regulatory key regions still are in their active positions yet the glycine rich atp binding loop which is normally part of the canonical anti parallel  sheet has collapsed into the atp binding site so that atp is excluded from binding specifically the side chain of arg  occupies the ribose region of the atp site and tyr  the space required by the triphospho moiety we discuss some factors that may support or disfavor this inactive conformation among them coordination of small molecules at a remote cavity at the ck  ck  interaction region and binding of a ck  dimer the latter stabilizes the glycine rich loop in the extended active conformation known from the majority of ck  structures thus the novel inactive conformation for the first time provides a structural basis for the stimulatory impact of ck  on ck
