human cataract lens membrane at subnanometer resolution
human pathologies often originate from molecular disorders therefore imaging technology as one of the bases for the identification and understanding of pathologies must provide views of single molecules at subnanometer resolution membrane proteins mediate many of life s most important processes and their malfunction is often lethal or leads to severe disease the membrane proteins aquaporin  aqp  and connexons form junctional microdomains between healthy lens core cells in which aqp form square arrays surrounded by connexons malfunction of both proteins results in the formation of cataract we have used high resolution atomic force microscopy afm to image junctional microdomains in membranes from an individual human eye lens with senile cataract images at subnanometer resolution report individual helix connecting loops of four amino acid residues on the aqp surface we describe the supramolecular assembly and the conformational state of aqp in junctional microdomains where a mixture of truncated junctional and full length water channel aqp form square arrays imaging of microdomain borders revealed individual aqp tetramers and no associated connexon indicating a lack of metabolite transport waste accumulation and enlarged regions of non adhering membranes causing cataract in this individual this first high resolution view of the membrane of this pathological human tissue provides insights into cataract pathology at the single membrane protein level and indicates the power of the afm as a future tool in medical imaging at subnanometer resolution
