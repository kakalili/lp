calcitriol upregulates open chromatin and elongation markers at functional vitamin d response elements in the distal part of the  lipoxygenase gene
lipoxygenase  lo gene expression is strongly upregulated during induction of myeloid cell differentiation by    dihydroxyvitamin d  calcitriol and transforming growth factor   tgf  in a promoter independent manner in an activity guided approach using reporter gene assays where the distal part of the  lo gene was included in the reporter gene plasmid we localized vitamin d response elements vdres within exon   exon   and intron m we found that these newly identified vdre sites are bound by vitamin d receptor both in vitro by gel shift analysis and in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in reporter gene assays the distal part of the  lo gene has promoter like activity that is inducible by calcitriol in a vitamin d receptor dependent manner the vitamin d effects were attenuated when the vdres in exon   exon   and intron m were deleted or mutated when we analyzed the effects of calcitriol plus tgf  on chromatin modifications at exon   exon   and intron m of the  lo gene in mono mac  cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis we found an increase in histone h k  monomethylation and a prominent presence of histone h k  trimethylation combined treatment with calcitriol and tgf  also increased histone h acetylation a marker for open chromatin and the elongation form of rna polymerase ii at these sites whereas the transcription initiation marker histone h k trimethylation was almost undetectable the data suggest that calcitriol induces chromatin opening and transcript elongation via vdres located at the   end of the  lo gene
