the c terminal half of the colicin a pore forming domain is active in vivo and in vitro edited by i b holland
the pore forming domain of colicin a pfcola fused to a prokaryotic signal peptide sp pfcola is transported across and inserts into the inner membrane of escherichia coli from the periplasmic side and forms a functional channel the soluble structure of pfcola consists of a ten helix bundle containing a hydrophobic helical hairpin here we generated a series of mutants in which an increasing number of sp pfcola  helices was deleted these peptides were tested for their ability to form ion channels in vivo and in vitro we found that the shortest sp pfcola mutant protein that killed escherichia coli was composed of the five last  helices of sp pfcola whereas the shortest peptide that formed a channel in planar lipid bilayer membranes similar to that of intact pfcola was the protein composed of the last six  helices the peptide composed of the last five  helices of pfcola generated a voltage independent conductance in planar lipid bilayer with properties very different from that of intact pfcola thus helices  to  are unnecessary for channel formation while helix  or some part of it is important but not absolutely necessary voltage dependence of colicin is evidently controlled by the first four  helices of pfcola
