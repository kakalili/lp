conformational dynamics of the molecular chaperone hsp  in complexes with a co chaperone and anticancer drugs
the molecular chaperone hsp  is essential for the correct folding maturation and activation of a diverse array of client proteins including several key constituents of oncogenic processes hsp  has become a focus of cancer research since it represents a target for direct prophylaxis against multistep malignancy hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry was used to study the structural and conformational changes undergone by full length human hsp   in solution upon binding of the kinase specific co chaperone cdc  and two hsp  atpase inhibitors radicicol and the first generation anticancer drug dmag changes in hydrogen exchange pattern in the complexes in regions of hsp  remote to the ligand binding site were observed indicating long range effects in particular the interface between the n terminal domain and middle domains exhibited significant differences between the apo and complexed forms for the inhibitors differences in the interface between the middle domain and the c terminal domain were also observed these data provide important insight into the structure of the biologically active form of the protein
