charge detection mass spectrometry identifies preferred non icosahedral polymorphs in the self assembly of woodchuck hepatitis virus capsids
woodchuck hepatitis virus whv is prone to aberrant assembly in vitro and can form a broad distribution of oversized particles characterizing aberrant assembly products is challenging because they are both large and heterogeneous in this work charge detection mass spectrometry cdms is used to measure the distribution of whv assembly products cdms is a single particle technique where the masses of individual ions are determined from simultaneous measurement of each ion s charge and m z mass to charge ratio under relatively aggressive assembly promoting conditions roughly half of the whv assembly products are t  capsids composed of exactly   dimers while the other half are a broad distribution of larger species that extends to beyond   dimers there are prominent peaks at around   dimers and at   dimers in part the   dimer complex can be attributed to elongating a t  capsid along its  fold axis by adding a ring of hexamers however most of the other features cannot be explained by existing models for hexameric defects cryo electron microscopy provides evidence of elongated capsids however image analysis reveals that many of them are not closed but have  spiral like  morphologies the cdms data indicate that oversized capsids have a preference for growth by addition of  or  dimers probably by completion of hexameric vertices
