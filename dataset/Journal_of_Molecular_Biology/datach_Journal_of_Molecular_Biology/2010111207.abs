three dimensional structure of the m region bare zone of vertebrate striated muscle myosin filaments by single particle analysis
the rods of anti parallel myosin molecules overlap at the centre of bipolar myosin filaments to produce an m region bare zone that is free of myosin heads beyond the m region edges myosin molecules aggregate in a parallel fashion to yield the bridge regions of the myosin filaments adjacent myosin filaments in striated muscle a bands are cross linked by the m band vertebrate striated muscle myosin filaments have a  fold rotational symmetry around their long axes in addition at the centre of the m region there are three  fold axes perpendicular to the filament long axis giving the whole filament dihedral  point group symmetry here we describe the three dimensional structure obtained by a single particle analysis of the m region of myosin filaments from goldfish skeletal muscle under relaxing conditions and as viewed in negative stain this is the first single particle reconstruction of isolated m regions the resulting three dimensional reconstruction reveals details to about    resolution of the density distribution in the five main nonmyosin densities in the m band m   m   m  m and m  and in the myosin head crowns p  p and p  at the m region edges the outermost crowns in the reconstruction were identified specifically by their close similarity to the corresponding crown levels in our previously published bridge region reconstructions the packing of myosin molecules into the m region structure is discussed and some unidentified densities are highlighted
