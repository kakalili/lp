the structure of sox  bound to dna reveals a conserved bending topology but selective protein interaction platforms
sox  regulates endodermal lineage commitment and is thought to function antagonistically to the pluripotency determinant sox  to investigate the biochemical basis for the distinct functions of sox and sox  we solved the crystal structure of the high mobility group domain of sox  bound to a dna element derived from the lama enhancer using crystals diffracting to     resolution sox  targets the minor groove and bends the dna by approximately    the dna architecture closely resembles the one seen for sox dna structures suggesting that the degree of bending is conserved between both proteins and nucleotide substitutions have only marginal effects on the bending topology accordingly affinities of sox and sox  for the lama element were found to be identical however when the oct contact interface of sox is compared with the corresponding region of sox  a significantly altered charge distribution is observed suggesting differential co factor recruitment that may explain their biological distinctiveness
