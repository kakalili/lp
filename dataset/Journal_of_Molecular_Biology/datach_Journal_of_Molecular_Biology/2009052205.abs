different poses for ligand and chaperone in inhibitor bound hsp  and grp  implications for paralog specific drug design
hsp  chaperones contain an n terminal atp binding site that has been effectively targeted by competitive inhibitors despite the myriad of inhibitors none to date have been designed to bind specifically to just one of the four mammalian hsp  paralogs which are cytoplasmic hsp   and   endoplasmic reticulum grp  and mitochondrial trap  given that each of the hsp  paralogs is responsible for chaperoning a distinct set of client proteins specific targeting of one hsp  paralog may result in higher efficacy and therapeutic control specific inhibitors may also help elucidate the biochemical roles of each hsp  paralog here we present side by side comparisons of the structures of yeast hsp  and mammalian grp  bound to the pan hsp  inhibitors geldanamycin gdm and radamide these structures reveal paralog specific differences in the hsp  and grp  conformations in response to gdm binding we also report significant variation in the pose and disparate binding affinities for the gdm  radicicol chimera radamide when bound to the two paralogs which may be exploited in the design of paralog specific inhibitors
