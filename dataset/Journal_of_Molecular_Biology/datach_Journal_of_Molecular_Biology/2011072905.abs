hiv  integrase strand transfer inhibitors stabilize an integrase  single blunt ended dna complex
integration of human immunodeficiency virus cdna ends by integrase in into host chromosomes involves a concerted integration mechanism in juxtaposes two dna blunt ends to form the synaptic complex which is the intermediate in the concerted integration pathway the synaptic complex is inactivated by strand transfer inhibitors sti with ic  values of    nm for inhibition of concerted integration we detected a new nucleoprotein complex on a native agarose gel that was produced in the presence of gt   nm sti termed the in  single dna isd complex two in dimers appear to bind in a parallel fashion at the dna terminus producing an    bp dnase i protective footprint in the presence of raltegravir ral  mk    and l     in incorporated       of the input blunt ended dna substrate into the stabilized isd complex seven other sti also produced the isd complex    of input dna  the formation of the isd complex was not dependent on   oh processing and the dna was predominantly blunt ended in the complex the ral resistant in mutant n  h weakly forms the isd complex in the presence of ral at    level of wild type in in contrast mk   and l     produced   fold to  fold more isd than ral with n  h in which is susceptible to these two inhibitors the results suggest that sti are slow binding inhibitors and that the potency to form and stabilize the isd complex is not always related to inhibition of concerted integration rather the apparent binding and dissociation properties of each sti influenced the production of the isd complex
