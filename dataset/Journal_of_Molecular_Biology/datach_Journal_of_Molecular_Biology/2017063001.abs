structural insight into recognition of methylated histone h k by set
the plant homeodomain phd finger of set binds methylated lysine  of histone h in vitro and in vivo however precise selectivity of this domain has not been fully characterized here we explore the determinants of methyllysine recognition by the phd fingers of set and its orthologs we use x ray crystallographic and spectroscopic approaches to show that the set phd finger binds di and trimethylated states of h k with comparable affinities and employs similar molecular mechanisms to form complexes with either mark composition of the methyllysine binding pocket plays an essential role in determining the selectivity of the phd fingers the finding that the histone binding activity is not conserved in the phd finger of set suggests different functions for the set and set paralogs
