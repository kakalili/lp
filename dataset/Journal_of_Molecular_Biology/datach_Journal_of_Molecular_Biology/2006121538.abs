luman a new partner of hiv  tmgp  interferes with tat mediated transcription of the hiv  ltr
in our search for new partners of the hiv  envelope glycoprotein env  we found that the cytoplasmic domain of the tmgp  tmgp  cd subunit of hiv  env interacted with luman a transcription factor of the creb atf family luman is anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and subjected to activation by regulated intramembrane proteolysis rip  the rip process permits the release of the activated amino terminal fragment of luman into the cytoplasm and its import into the nucleus here we demonstrate that interaction between the tmgp  cd and luman requires a region encompassing the b zip and tm domains of luman and decreases the stability of this factor moreover we found that overexpression of a constitutively active form of luman in cells transfected with hxb r hiv  provirus decreased the intracellular expression of gag and env and led to a decrease in virion release this negative effect of activated luman on hiv  production was correlated to the inhibition of tat transactivation of the hiv  ltr which might be related to an interaction of activated luman with tat altogether these results show that luman acts as a partner of two major hiv  proteins the tmgp  env subunit and tat the interaction between the tmgp  subunit of env and luman affects the stability of the full length luman protein the precursor of the activated nuclear form of luman which acts negatively on tat mediated hiv  transactivation
