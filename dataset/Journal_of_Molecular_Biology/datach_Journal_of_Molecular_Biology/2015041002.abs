spatially organized aggregation of misfolded proteins as cellular stress defense strategy
an evolutionary conserved response of cells to proteotoxic stress is the organized sequestration of misfolded proteins into subcellular deposition sites in saccharomyces cerevisiae three major sequestration sites for misfolded proteins exist ipod insoluble protein deposit  inq intranuclear quality control compartment  former junq juxtanuclear quality control compartment  and cytoq ipod is perivacuolar and predominantly sequesters amyloidogenic proteins inq and cytoqs are stress induced deposits for misfolded proteins residing in the nucleus and the cytosol respectively and requiring cell compartment specific aggregases nuclear btn and cytosolic hsp  for formation the organized aggregation of misfolded proteins is proposed to serve several purposes collectively increasing cellular fitness and survival under proteotoxic stress these include i shielding of cellular processes from interference by toxic protein conformers  ii reducing the substrate burden for protein quality control systems upon immediate stress  iii orchestrating chaperone and protease functions for efficient repair or degradation of damaged proteins this involves initial extraction of aggregated molecules via the hsp  hsp  bi chaperone system followed by either refolding or proteasomal degradation or removal of entire aggregates by selective autophagy aggrephagy involving the adaptor protein cue  and iv enabling asymmetric retention of protein aggregates during cell division thereby allowing for damage clearance in daughter cells regulated protein aggregation thus serves cytoprotective functions vital for the maintenance of cell integrity and survival even under adverse stress conditions and during aging
