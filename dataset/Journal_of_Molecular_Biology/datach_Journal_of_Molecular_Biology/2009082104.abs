dissection of the dna mimicry of the bacteriophage t ocr protein using chemical modification
the homodimeric ocr overcome classical restriction protein of bacteriophage t is a molecular mimic of double stranded dna and a highly effective competitive inhibitor of the bacterial type i restriction modification system the surface of ocr is replete with acidic residues that mimic the phosphate backbone of dna in addition ocr also mimics the overall dimensions of a bent  bp dna molecule in this study we attempted to delineate these two mechanisms of dna mimicry by chemically modifying the negative charges on the ocr surface our analysis reveals that removal of about   of the carboxylate groups per ocr monomer results in an    fold reduction in binding affinity for a methyltransferase from a model type i restriction modification system the reduced affinity between ocr with this degree of modification and the methyltransferase is comparable with the affinity of dna for the methyltransferase additional modification to remove    of the carboxylate groups further reduces its binding affinity although the modified ocr still binds to the methyltransferase via a mechanism attributable to the shape mimicry of a bent dna molecule our results show that the electrostatic mimicry of ocr increases the binding affinity for its target enzyme by up to    fold
