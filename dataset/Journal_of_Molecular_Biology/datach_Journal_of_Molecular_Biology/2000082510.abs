combining phage display and screening of cdna expression libraries a new approach for identifying the target antigen of an scfv preselected by phage display edited by j wells
a potential method for identifying new tumor specific antibody structures as well as tumor associated antigens is by selecting scfv phage libraries on tumor cells this phage display technique involves multiple rounds of phage binding to target cells washing to remove non specific phage and elution to retrieve specific binding phage although the binding properties of an isolated tumor specific scfv can be evaluated by elisa facs and immunohistochemistry it still remains a challenge to define the corresponding antigen here we provide evidence that the target antigen of a given scfv displayed on phages can be detected in an immobilized  phage cdna expression library containing thousands of irrelevant clones the library contained cd  negative breast cancer specific cdna as well as human cd  receptor cdna the interaction of anti cd  scfv phages and their target antigen after blotting onto nitrocellulose filters was documented under defined conditions screening of different ratios between cd  receptor and breast cancer specific clones   and    revealed that the cd  antigen could be detected by anti cd  scfv phages using at least      plaque forming units of filamentous phages per blot these investigations demonstrate that it is possible to detect the target antigen of a preselected scfv displayed on filamentous phages in  phage cdna expression libraries
