a three dimensional fret analysis to construct an atomic model of the actin  tropomyosin complex on a reconstituted thin filament
fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret was used to construct an atomic model of the actin  tropomyosin tm complex on a reconstituted thin filament we generated five single cysteine mutants in the      region of rabbit skeletal muscle  tm an energy donor probe was attached to a single cysteine tm residue while an energy acceptor probe was located in actin gln  actin cys   or the actin nucleotide binding site from these donor  acceptor pairs fret efficiencies were determined with and without ca  using the atomic coordinates for f actin and tm we searched all possible arrangements for tm segment      on f actin to calculate the fret efficiency for each donor  acceptor pair in each arrangement by minimizing the squared sum of deviations for the calculated fret efficiencies from the observed fret efficiencies we determined the location of the tm segment on the f actin filament furthermore we generated a set of five single cysteine mutants in each of the four tm regions                and      using the same procedures we determined each segment s location on the f actin filament in the best fit model tm runs along actin residues      which were reported to compose the tm binding site electrostatic hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions are involved in actin and tm binding the c terminal region of tm was observed to contact actin more closely than did the n terminal region tm contacts more residues on actin without ca  than with it ca  induced changes on the actin  tm contact surface strongly affect the f actin structure which is important for muscle regulation
