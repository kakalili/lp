acetylation and accessibility of rdna chromatin in saccharomyces cerevisiae in  top and  sir mutants
the insertion of reporter genes in the ribosomal dna rdna locus of saccharomyces cerevisiae causes their transcriptional repression this kind of transcriptional silencing depends on proteins such as sir p and top p and has been shown to be mediated by chromatin while sir p modifies nucleosomes directly through its histone deacetylase activity little is known about changes in the chromatin structure that occur at the rdna locus when top is deleted here we show that the absence of top p causes increased histone acetylation at the rdna locus moreover rdna chromatin becomes more accessible in a similar manner in both top and sir mutant strains
