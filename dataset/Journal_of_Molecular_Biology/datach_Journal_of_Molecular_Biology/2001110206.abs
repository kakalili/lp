solid state nmr data support a helix loop helix structural model for the n terminal half of hiv  rev in fibrillar form edited by m f summers
rev is a   residue basic protein encoded by the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  that binds to multiple sites in the rev response element rre of viral mrna transcripts in nuclei of host cells leading to transport of incompletely spliced and unspliced viral mrna to the cytoplasm of host cells in the latter phases of the hiv  life cycle rev is absolutely required for viral replication because rev aggregates and fibrillizes in solution at concentrations required for crystal growth or liquid state nmr measurements high resolution structural characterization of full length rev has not been possible previously circular dichroism studies have shown that approximately   of the rev sequence adopts helical secondary structure predicted to correspond to a helix loop helix structural motif in the n terminal half of the protein we describe the application of solid state nmr techniques to rev fibrils as a means of obtaining site specific atomic level structural constraints without requiring a high degree of solubility or crystallinity solid state nmr measurements using the double quantum chemical shift anisotropy and constant time double quantum filtered dipolar recoupling techniques provide constraints on the  and  backbone dihedral angles at sites in which consecutive backbone carbonyl groups are labeled with  c quantitative analysis of the solid state nmr data by comparison with numerical simulations indicates helical  and  angles at residues leu  and val  in the predicted helix  segment and at residues arg  arg   arg  and arg  in the predicted helix  segment these data represent the first site specific structural constraints from nmr spectroscopy on full length rev and support the helix loop helix structural model for its n terminal half
