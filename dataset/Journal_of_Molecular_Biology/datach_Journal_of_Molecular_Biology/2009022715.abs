effect of mg  and na on the nucleic acid chaperone activity of hiv  nucleocapsid protein implications for reverse transcription
the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  nucleocapsid protein nc is an essential protein for retroviral replication among its numerous functions nc is a nucleic acid na chaperone protein that catalyzes na rearrangements leading to the formation of thermodynamically more stable conformations in vitro nc chaperone activity is typically assayed under conditions of low or no mg  even though reverse transcription requires the presence of divalent cations here the chaperone activity of hiv  nc was studied as a function of varying na and mg  concentrations by investigating the annealing of complementary dna and rna hairpins derived from the trans activation response domain of the hiv genome this reaction mimics the annealing step of the minus strand transfer process in reverse transcription gel shift annealing and sedimentation assays were used to monitor the annealing kinetics and aggregation activity of nc respectively in the absence of protein a limited ability of na and mg  cations to facilitate hairpin annealing was observed whereas nc stimulated the annealing   to   fold the major effect of either nc or the cations is on the rate of bimolecular association of the hairpins this effect is especially strong under conditions wherein nc induces na aggregation titration with nc and nc mg  competition studies showed that the annealing kinetics depends only on the level of na saturation with nc nc competes with mg  or na for sequence nonspecific na binding similar to a simple trivalent cation upon saturation nc induces attraction between na molecules corresponding to     kcal mol nucleotide in agreement with an electrostatic mechanism of nc induced na aggregation these data provide insights into the variable effects of nc s chaperone activity observed during in vitro studies of divalent metal dependent reverse transcription reactions and suggest the feasibility of nc facilitated proviral dna synthesis within the mature capsid core
