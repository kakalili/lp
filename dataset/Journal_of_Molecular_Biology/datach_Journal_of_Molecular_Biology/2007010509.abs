solution structure of nod card and mutational analysis of its interaction with the card of downstream kinase rick
nod is a cytosolic signalling host pattern recognition receptor composed of a caspase activating and recruitment domain card  a nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain nod and leucine rich repeats it plays a crucial role in innate immunity by activating the nf  b pathway via its downstream effector the kinase rick rip  following the recognition of a specific bacterial ligand rick is recruited by nod through interaction of their respective cards here we present the high resolution nmr structure of the nod card it is generally similar to other cards of known structure consisting of six tightly packed helices although the length and orientation of the last helix is unusual mutations in both the nod and rick card domains were assayed by immuno precipitation of cell lysates and in vivo nf  b activation in order to define residues important for card  card interaction and downstream signalling the results show that the interaction is critically dependent on three acidic residues on nod card and three basic residues on rick card and thus is likely to have a strong electrostatic component similar to other characterised card  card interactions
