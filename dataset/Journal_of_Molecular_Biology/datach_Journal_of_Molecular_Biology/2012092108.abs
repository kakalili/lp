get stabilizes an open dimer conformation of get atpase by binding two distinct interfaces
tail anchored ta proteins are integral membrane proteins that possess a single transmembrane domain near their carboxy terminus ta proteins play critical roles in many important cellular processes such as membrane trafficking protein translocation and apoptosis the get complex mediates posttranslational insertion of newly synthesized ta proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane the get complex is composed of the homodimeric get atpase and its heterooligomeric receptor get   during insertion the get dimer shuttles between open and closed conformational states coupled with atp hydrolysis and the binding release of ta proteins we report crystal structures of adp bound get in complex with the cytoplasmic domain of get  get cd in open and semi open conformations at    and     resolutions respectively our structures and biochemical data suggest that get uses two interfaces to stabilize the open dimer conformation of get  we propose that one interface is sufficient for binding of get by get  while the second interface stabilizes the open dimer conformation of get
