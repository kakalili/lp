the pdz domain of syntenin at ultra high resolution bridging the gap between macromolecular and small molecule crystallography
the crystal structure of the second pdz domain of the scaffolding protein syntenin was solved using data extending to    resolution the crystallographic model including the hydrogen atoms and the anisotropic displacement parameters was refined to a conventional r factor of   and rfree of    making it the most precise crystallographic model of a protein molecule to date the model reveals discrete disorder in several places in the molecule and significant plasticity of the peptide bond with some  angles deviating by nearly   from planarity most hydrogen atoms are easily identifiable in the electron density and weak hydrogen bonds of the c  h  o type are clearly visible between the  strands the study sets a new standard for high resolution protein crystallography
