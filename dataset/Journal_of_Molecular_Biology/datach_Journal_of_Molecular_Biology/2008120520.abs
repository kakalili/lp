the antitermin ation activity of bacteriophage  n protein is controlled by the kinetics of an rna looping facilitated interaction with the transcription complex
protein n of bacteriophage  activates the lytic phase of phage development in infected escherichia coli cells by suppressing the activity of transcriptional terminators that prevent the synthesis of essential phage proteins n binds tightly to the boxb rna hairpin located near the   end of the nascent pl and pr transcripts and induces an antitermination response in the rna polymerase rnap of elongation complexes located at terminators far downstream here we test an rna looping model for this n dependent  action at a distance  by cleaving the nascent transcript between boxb and rnap during transcript elongation cleavage decreases antitermination showing that an intact rna transcript is required to stabilize the interaction of boxb bound n with rnap during transcription in contrast an antitermination complex that also contains nus factors retains n dependent activity after transcript cleavage suggesting that these host factors further stabilize the n  rnap interaction thus the binding of n alone to rnap is controlled by an rna looping equilibrium but after formation of the initial rna loop and in the presence of nus factors the system no longer equilibrates on the transcription time scale meaning that the  range  of antitermination activity along the template in the full antitermination system is kinetically controlled by the dissociation rate of the stabilized n  rnap complex theoretical calculations of nucleic acid end to end contact probabilities are used to estimate the local concentrations of boxb bound n at elongation complexes poised at terminators and are combined with n activity measurements at various boxb to terminator distances to obtain an intrinsic affinity kd of        m for the n  rnap interaction this rna looping approach is extended to include the effects of n binding at nonspecific rna sites on the transcript and the implications for transcription control in other regulatory systems are discussed
