Evidence that in vivo bacteriophage T3 DNA packaging includes capsid hyper-expansion that is triggered by lengthening of incompletely packaged DNA (ipDNA) is presented here. This evidence includes observation that some of the longer ipDNAs in T3-infected cells are packaged in ipDNA-containing capsids with hyper-expanded outer shells (HE ipDNA-capsids). In addition, artificially induced hyper-expansion is observed for the outer shell of a DNA-free capsid. Detection and characterization of HE ipDNA-capsids are based on two-dimensional, non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by structure determination with electron microscopy and protein identification with SDS-PAGE/mass spectrometry. After expulsion from HE ipDNA-capsids, ipDNA forms sharp bands during gel electrophoresis. The following hypotheses are presented: (1) T3 has evolved feedback-initiated, ATP-driven capsid contraction/hyper-expansion cycles that accelerate DNA packaging when packaging is slowed by increase in the packaging-resisting force of the ipDNA and (2) each gel electrophoretic ipDNA band reflects a contraction/hyper-expansion cycle.
