In addition to their natural substrates GDP and GTP, the bacterial translational GTPases initiation factor (IF) 2 and elongation factor G (EF-G) interact with the alarmone molecule guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which leads to GTPase inhibition. We have used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the affinities of ppGpp for IF2 and EF-G at a temperature interval of 5–25 °C. We find that ppGpp has a higher affinity for IF2 than for EF-G (1.7–2.8 μM Kd versus 9.1–13.9 μM Kd at 10–25 °C), suggesting that during stringent response in vivo, IF2 is more responsive to ppGpp than to EF-G. We investigated the effects of ppGpp, GDP, and GTP on IF2 interactions with fMet-tRNAfMet demonstrating that IF2 binds to initiator tRNA with submicromolar Kd and that affinity is altered by the G nucleotides only slightly. This—in conjunction with earlier reports on IF2 interactions with fMet-tRNAfMet in the context of the 30S initiation complex, where ppGpp was suggested to strongly inhibit fMet-tRNAfMet binding and GTP was suggested to strongly promote fMet-tRNAfMet binding—sheds new light on the mechanisms of the G-nucleotide-regulated fMet-tRNAfMet selection.
