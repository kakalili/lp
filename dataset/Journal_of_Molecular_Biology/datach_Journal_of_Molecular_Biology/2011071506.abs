targeting capacity and conservation of prep homologues localization in mitochondria of different species
mitochondrial presequences and other unstructured peptides are degraded inside mitochondria by presequence proteases preps identified in arabidopsis thaliana atprep  humans hprep  and yeast cym mop   the presequences of a thaliana and human prep are predicted to consist of  and  amino acids respectively whereas the saccharomyces cerevisiae cym mop  presequence contains only  residues these differences may explain the reported targeting of homologous proteins to different mitochondrial subcompartments here we have investigated the targeting capacity of the prep homologues presequences we have produced fusion constructs containing n terminal portions of atprep      hprep     and cym     coupled to green fluorescent protein gfp and studied their import into isolated plant mammalian and yeast mitochondria followed by mitochondrial subfractionation whereas the atprep presequence has the capacity to target gfp into the mitochondrial matrix of all three species the hprep presequence only targets gfp to the matrix of mammalian and yeast mitochondria the cym mop  presequence has an overall much weaker targeting capacity and only ensures mitochondrial sorting in its host species yeast revisiting the submitochondrial localization of cym revealed that endogenous cym mop  is localized to the matrix space as has been previously reported for the plant and human homologues moreover complementation studies in yeast show that native atprep restores the growth phenotype of yeast cells lacking cym  demonstrating functional conservation
