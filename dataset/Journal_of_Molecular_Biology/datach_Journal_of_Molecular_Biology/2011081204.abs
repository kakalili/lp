cooperative rnp assembly complementary rescue of structural defects by protein and rna subunits of archaeal rnase p
ribonuclease p rnase p is a ribonucleoprotein complex that utilizes a mg  dependent rna catalyst to cleave the   leader of precursor trnas pre trnas and generate mature trnas the bacterial rnase p protein rpp aids rnase p rna rpr catalysis by promoting substrate binding mg  coordination and product release archaeal rnase p comprises an rpr and at least four rpps which have eukaryal homologs and function as two binary complexes pop  rpp  and rpp  rpp   here we employed a previously characterized substrate  enzyme conjugate pre trnatyr  methanocaldococcus jannaschii mja rpr to investigate the functional role of a universally conserved uridine in a bulge  helix structure in archaeal rprs deletion of this bulged uridine resulted in an  fold decrease in the self cleavage rate of pre trnatyr  mja u rpr compared to the wild type and this defect was partially ameliorated upon addition of either rpp pair the catalytic defect in the archaeal mutant rpr mirrors that reported in a bacterial rpr and highlights a parallel in their active sites furthermore an n terminal deletion mutant of pyrococcus furiosus pfu rpp  that is defective in assembling with its binary partner rpp  as assessed by isothermal titration calorimetry and nmr spectroscopy is functional when reconstituted with the cognate pfu rpr collectively these results indicate that archaeal rpps are able to compensate for structural defects in their cognate rpr and vice versa and provide striking examples of the cooperative subunit interactions critical for driving archaeal rnase p toward its functional conformation
