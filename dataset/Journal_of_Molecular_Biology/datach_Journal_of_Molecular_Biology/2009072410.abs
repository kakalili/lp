reversing evolution re establishing obligate metal ion dependence in a metal independent kdo p synthase
two distinct groups of  deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase kdo ps  a key enzyme of cell wall biosynthesis differ by their requirement for a divalent metal ion for enzymatic activity the unique difference between these groups is the replacement of the metal binding cys by asn substitution of just this asn for a cys in metal independent kdo ps does not create the obligate metal ion dependency of natural metal dependent enzymes we describe how three or four mutations of the metal independent kdo ps from neisseria meningitidis produce a fully functional obligately metal dependent kdo ps for the substitutions asn cys asp  glu this asp binds to the metal ion in all metal dependent kdo ps and pro  ala and for double and triple combinations mutant enzymes that contained cys in place of asn showed an increase in activity in the presence of divalent metal ions however combining these mutations with substitution by ser of the cys residue in the conserved  cysaspglypro  motif of metal independent kdo ps created enzymes with obligate metal dependency the quadruple mutant asn cys cys  ser asp  glu pro  ala showed comparable activity to wild type enzymes only in the presence of metal ions with maximum activity with cd  the metal ion that is strongly inhibitory at micromolar concentrations for the wild type enzyme in the absence of metal ions activity was barely detectable for this quadruple mutant or for triple mutants bearing both cys  ser and asn cys mutations the structures of nmekdo ps and its asn cys asp  glu pro  ala and quadruple mutants at ph   were characterized at resolutions better than     aged crystals of the asn cys asp  glu pro  ala mutant featured a cys  cys  disulfide linkage explaining the spectral bleaching observed when this mutant was incubated with cu  such bleaching was not observed for the quadruple mutant reverse evolution to a fully functional obligately metal dependent kdo ps has been achieved with just three directed mutations for enzymes that have at best   identity between metal dependent and metal independent pairs
