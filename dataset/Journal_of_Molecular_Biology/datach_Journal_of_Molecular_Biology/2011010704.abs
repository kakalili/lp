crystal structure of the phage t recombinase uvsx and its functional interaction with the t sf helicase uvsw
bacteriophage t provides an important model system for studying the mechanism of homologous recombination we have determined the crystal structure of the t uvsx recombinase and the overall architecture and fold closely resemble those of reca including a highly conserved atp binding site based on this new structure we reanalyzed electron microscopy reconstructions of uvsx  dna filaments and docked the uvsx crystal structure into two different filament forms a compressed filament generated in the presence of adp and an elongated filament generated in the presence of atp and aluminum fluoride in these reconstructions the atp binding site sits at the protomer interface as in the reca filament crystal structure however the environment of the atp binding site is altered in the two filament reconstructions suggesting that nucleotide cannot be as easily accommodated at the protomer interface of the compressed filament finally we show that the phage helicase uvsw completes the uvsx promoted strand exchange reaction allowing the generation of a simple nicked circular product rather than complex networks of partially exchanged substrates
