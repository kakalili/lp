tmdock an energy based method for modeling  helical dimers in membranes
tmdock is a novel computational method for the modeling of parallel homodimers formed by transmembrane tm   helices three dimensional  d models of dimers are generated by threading a target amino acid sequence through several structural templates followed by local energy minimization this is the first method that identifies helix dimerization modes and ranks them based on the calculated free energy of  helix association free energy components include van der waals hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions side chain conformational entropy and solvation energy in the anisotropic lipid environment tmdock reproduced  experimental dimeric structures formed by tm  helices of  single pass membrane proteins including  mutants with c  atom rmsd from   to    assessment of dimerization heterogeneity of these tm domains demonstrated that  of them have a unique dimer structure   have at least  alternative conformations and  have a large number of different association modes all unique experimental structures of proteins from the first group and eight structures from the second group were reproduced in computations as top ranked models a fast version of the method is available through the web server http  membranome org tm server php
