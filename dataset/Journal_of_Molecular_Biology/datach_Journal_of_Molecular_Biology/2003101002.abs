functional characterization of a promoter region in the human men tumor suppressor gene
our previous studies on the human men  multiple endocrine neoplasia type  gene revealed heterogeneity of men   kb transcripts related to variation in their   utr only six distinct exons  e a  e f were isolated that suggested the existence of multiple but not already identified transcriptional start sites tss and of a complex transcriptional control identification of a minimal promoter region and its adjacent regulatory regions appears an inescapable step to the understanding of men gene transcriptional regulation in normal and pathological situations for this purpose we subcloned the     bp region situated directly upstream of the exon  in front of a luciferase reporter gene and we analyzed functional consequences of   and   serial deletions comparatively in a series of endocrine versus non endocrine cell lines primer extension and rpa experiments demonstrate that in hek  cells transcription initiated simultaneously at several points in endogenous men promoter as well as in transfected promoter fragments in reporter plasmids mainly in inr elements that are efficiently employed to synthetize previously described exons e a  e d functional consequences of tss deletion are directly related to cellular context the minimal promoter region is localized between    and    five large adjacent cis regulatory regions ur  ur  exist upstream of this minimal promoter region whose activity depend not only on the cellular context but also on the presence of a downstream sequence dr  five small cis regulatory elements c  c  are localized between    and     overexpression of exogenous menin the men gene s product in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from men     knock out mice dose dependently decreases men promoter activity through sequences surrounding the minimal promoter our data highlight the existence of a complex transcriptional regulation of the men gene whose activity is clearly modulated depending not only on the cellular context but also on menin intracellular levels they are the molecular bases required for a future understanding of a potential specific transcription control in endocrine cells
