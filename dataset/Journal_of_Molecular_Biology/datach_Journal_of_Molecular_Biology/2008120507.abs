structure of bacterial glutathione s transferase maleyl pyruvate isomerase and implications for mechanism of isomerisation
maleyl pyruvate isomerase mpi is a bacterial glutathione s transferase gst from the pathway for degradation of naphthalene via gentisate that enables the bacterium ralstonia to use polyaromatic hydrocarbons as a sole carbon source genome sequencing projects have revealed the presence of large numbers of gsts in bacterial genomes often located within gene clusters encoding the degradation of different aromatic compounds this structure is therefore an example of this under represented class of enzymes unlike many glutathione transferases the reaction catalysed by mpi is an isomerisation of an aromatic ring breakdown product and glutathione is a true cofactor rather than a substrate in the reaction we have solved the structure of the enzyme in complex with dicarboxyethyl glutathione an analogue of a proposed reaction intermediate at a resolution of     the structure provides direct evidence that the glutathione thiolate attacks the substrate in the c position with the terminal carboxylate buried at the base of the active site cleft our structures suggest that the c  c bond remains fixed so when rotation occurs around the c  c bond the atoms from c onwards actually move we identified a conserved arginine that is likely to stabilize the enolate form of the substrate during the isomerisation arginines at either side of the active site cleft can interact with the end of the substrate product and preferentially stabilise the product mpi has significant sequence similarity to maleylacetoacetate isomerase maai  which performs an analogous reaction in the catabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine the proposed mechanism therefore has relevance to the maais significantly whilst the overall sequence identity is   only one of the five residues from the zeta motif in the active site is conserved we re examined the roles of the residues in the active site of both enzymes and the zeta motif itself
