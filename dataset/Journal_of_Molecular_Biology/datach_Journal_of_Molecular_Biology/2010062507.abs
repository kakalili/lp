a bacterial gap like protein yihi regulating the gtpase of der an essential gtp binding protein in escherichia coli
der double era like gtpase is an essential gtpase consisting of two gtp binding motifs in tandem followed by a kh like domain der plays a critical role in  s ribosome maturation at a later biogenesis step here we attempted to identify a protein interacting with der that modulates its function and regulation using a yeast two hybrid we discovered that der interacts with yihi which activates the gtpase activity of der its overexpression affected cell growth causing accumulation of rrna precursors and an aberrant ribosome profile that was similar to that of der depleted cells suggesting that der and yihi are involved in the  s ribosome assembly the yihi deletion strain showed a shorter lag phase than wild type strain suggesting that yihi may be a negative regulator for ribosome assembly we propose that yihi is a gap gtpase activating protein like protein that modulates der function to negatively regulate cell growth at the beginning of exponential growth
