regulatory implications of non trivial splicing isoform  of rab a shows enhanced basal activity and is not controlled by accessory proteins
alternative splicing often affects structured and highly conserved regions of proteins generating so called non trivial splicing variants of unknown structure and cellular function the human small g protein rab a is involved in the regulation of the vesicle transfer from the er to golgi a conserved non trivial splice variant lacks nearly   of the sequence of the native rab a including most of the regulatory interaction sites we show that this variant of rab a represents a stable and folded protein which is still able to bind nucleotides and co localizes with membranes nevertheless it should be mentioned that compared to other wild typerabgtpases the measured nucleotide binding affinities are dramatically reduced in the variant studied furthermore the rab a variant forms hetero dimers with wild type rab a and its presence in the cell enhances the efficiency of alkaline phosphatase secretion however this variant shows no specificity for gxp nucleotides a constantly enhanced gtp hydrolysis activity and is no longer controlled by gef or gap proteins indicating a new regulatory mechanism for the rab a cycle via alternative non trivial splicing
