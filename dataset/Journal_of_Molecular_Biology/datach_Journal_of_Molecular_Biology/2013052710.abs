novel mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of amyloid polymorphism and secondary nucleation during amyloid formation
the formation of amyloid   a  fibrils is crucial in initiating the cascade of pathological events that culminates in alzheimer s disease in this study we investigated the mechanism of a  fibril formation from hydrodynamically well defined species under controlled aggregation conditions we present a detailed mechanistic model that furnishes a novel insight into the process of a   fibril formation and the molecular basis for the different structural transitions in the amyloid pathway our data reveal the structure and polymorphism of a  fibrils to be critically influenced by the oligomeric state of the starting materials the ratio of monomeric to aggregated forms of a   oligomers and protofibrils  and the occurrence of secondary nucleation we demonstrate that monomeric a   plays an important role in mediating structural transitions in the amyloid pathway and for the first time we provide evidences that a   fibrillization occurs via a combined mechanism of nucleated polymerization and secondary nucleation these findings will have significant implications to our understanding of the molecular basis of amyloid formation in vivo of the heterogeneity of a  pathology e g  diffuse versus amyloid plaques  and of the structural basis of a  toxicity
