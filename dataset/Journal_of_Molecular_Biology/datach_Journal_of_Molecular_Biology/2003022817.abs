the fission yeast spset p is a histone h k methyltransferase that functions in telomere maintenance and dna repair in an atm kinase rad dependent pathway
we have characterized spset p the schizosaccharomyces pombe ortholog of the budding yeast histone h methyltransferase set p spset p catalyzes methylation of h at k  in vivo and in vitro deleting spset partially affects telomeric and centromeric silencing strikingly lack of spset p causes elongation of telomeres in wild type cells and in most dna damage checkpoint rad mutant cells but not in cells lacking the atm kinase rad or its associated protein rad  interestingly spset deletion specifically causes a reduction in sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation of the pcna like checkpoint mutants hus and rad  but not of cells devoid of rad  this partial suppression was not due to restoration of checkpoint function or to transcriptional induction of dna repair genes moreover spset allows recovery specifically of the crb checkpoint mutant upon treatment with the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea but not upon uv irradiation nevertheless the pathway induced in spset cells cannot substitute for the mus  rqh dna damage tolerance pathway our results suggest that spset p and the atm kinase rad function in a common genetic pathway linking chromatin to telomere length regulation and dna repair
