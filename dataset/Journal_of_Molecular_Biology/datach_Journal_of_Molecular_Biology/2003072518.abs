effects of domain dissection on the folding and stability of the  kda protein pgk probed by nmr
the characterization of early folding intermediates is key to understanding the protein folding process previous studies of the n domain of phosphoglycerate kinase pgk from bacillus stearothermophilus combined equilibrium amide exchange data with a kinetic model derived from stopped flow kinetics together these implied the rapid formation of an intermediate with extensive native like hydrogen bonding however there was an absence of protection in the region proximal to the c domain in the intact protein we now report data for the intact pgk molecule which at   residues constitutes a major extension to the protein size for which such data can be acquired the methods utilised to achieve the backbone assignment are described in detail including a semi automated protocol based on a simulated annealing monte carlo technique a substantial increase in the stability of the contact region is observed allowing protection to be inferred on both faces of the  sheet in the intermediate thus the entire n domain acts concertedly in the formation of the kinetic refolding intermediate rather than there existing a distinct local folding nucleus
