In order to identify new transmembrane helix packing motifs in naturally occurring proteins, we have selected transmembrane domains from a library of random Escherichia coli genomic DNA fragments and screened them for homomultimerization via their abilities to dimerize the bacteriophage λ cI repressor DNA-binding domain. Sequences were isolated using a modified λ cI headpiece dimerization assay system, which was shown previously to measure transmembrane helix-helix association in the E. coli inner membrane. Screening resulted in the identification of several novel sequences that appear to mediate helix-helix interactions. One sequence, representing the predicted sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) of the E. coli protein YjiO, was chosen for further analysis. Using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics, a small set of models for YjiO TM6 multimerization interface interactions were generated. This work demonstrates the utility of combining in vivo genetic tools with computational systems for understanding membrane protein structure and assembly.
