insights into the distinct mechanisms of action of taxane and non taxane microtubule stabilizers from cryo em structures
a number of microtubule mt stabilizing agents msas have demonstrated or predicted potential as anticancer agents but a detailed structural basis for their mechanism of action is still lacking we have obtained high resolution        cryo electron microscopy cryo em reconstructions of mts stabilized by the taxane site binders taxol and zampanolide and by peloruside which targets a distinct non taxoid pocket on  tubulin we find that each molecule has unique distinct structural effects on the mt lattice structure peloruside acts primarily at lateral contacts and has an effect on the  seam  of heterologous interactions enforcing a conformation more similar to that of homologous i e  non seam contacts by which it regularizes the mt lattice in contrast binding of either taxol or zampanolide induces mt heterogeneity in doubly bound mts peloruside overrides the heterogeneity induced by taxol binding our structural analysis illustrates distinct mechanisms of these drugs for stabilizing the mt lattice and is of relevance to the possible use of combinations of msas to regulate mt activity and improve therapeutic potential
