Sequences from the 5′ region of R2 retrotransposons of four species of silk moth are reported. In Bombyx mori, this region of the R2 messenger RNA contains a binding site for R2 protein and mediates interactions critical to R2 element insertion into the host genome. A model of secondary structure for a segment of this RNA is proposed on the basis of binding to oligonucleotide microarrays, chemical mapping, and comparative sequence analysis. Five conserved secondary structures are identified, including a novel pseudoknot. There is an apparent transition from an entirely RNA structure coding function in most of the 5′ segment to a protein coding function near the 3′ end. This suggests that local regions evolved under separate functional constraints (structural, coding, or both).
