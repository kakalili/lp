Escherichia coli cyclophilin A, a 164 residue globular protein, shows fast and slow phases of refolding kinetics from the urea-induced unfolded state at pH 7.0. Given that the slow phases are independent of the denaturant concentration and may be rate-limited by cis/trans isomerizations of prolyl peptide bonds, the fast phase represents the true folding reaction. The extrapolation of the fast-phase rate constant to 0 M urea indicates that the folding reaction of cyclophilin A is extraordinarily fast and has about 700 sâˆ’1 of the rate constant. Interrupted refolding experiments showed that the protein molecules formed in the fast phase had already been fully folded to the native state. This finding overthrows the accepted view that the fast folding is observed only in small proteins of fewer than 100 amino acid residues. Examination of the X-ray structure of cyclophilin A has shown that this protein has only one unique hydrophobic core (phenylalanine cluster) formed by evolutionarily conserved phenylalanine residues, and suggests that this architecture of the molecule may be responsible for the fast folding behavior.
