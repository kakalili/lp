resolution of specific nucleotide mismatches by wild type and azt resistant reverse transcriptases during hiv  replication
a key contributor to hiv  genetic variation is reverse transcriptase errors some mutations result because reverse transcriptase rt lacks   to   proofreading exonuclease and can extend mismatches however rt also excises terminal nucleotides to a limited extent and this activity contributes to azt resistance because hiv  mismatch resolution has been studied in vitro but only indirectly during replication we developed a novel system to study mismatched base pair resolution during hiv  replication in cultured cells using vectors that force template switching at defined locations these vectors generated mismatched reverse transcription intermediates with proviral products diagnostic of mismatch resolution mechanisms outcomes for wild type wt rt and an azt resistant aztr rt containing a thymidine analog mutation set  d n k r d  f and k  q  were compared aztr rt did not excise terminal nucleotides more frequently than wt and for the majority of tested mismatches both wt and aztr rts extended mismatches in more than   of proviruses however striking enzyme specific differences were observed for one mispair with wt rt preferentially resolving dc  rc pairs either by excising the mismatched base or switching templates prematurely while aztr rt primarily misaligned the primer strand causing deletions via dislocation mutagenesis overall the results confirmed hiv  rt  s high capacity for mismatch extension during virus replication and revealed dramatic differences in aberrant intermediate resolution repertoires between wt and aztr rts on one mismatched replication intermediate correlating mismatch extension frequencies observed here with reported viral mutation rates suggests a complex interplay of nucleotide discrimination and mismatch extension drives hiv  mutagenesis
