quantifying interactions of  synuclein and  synuclein with model membranes
the synucleins are a family of proteins involved in numerous neurodegenerative pathologies   synuclein and  synuclein  s  as well as in various types of cancers   synuclein  s  while the connection between  synuclein and parkinson s disease is well established recent evidence links point mutants of  s to dementia with lewy bodies overexpression of  s has been associated with enhanced metastasis and cancer drug resistance despite their prevalence in such a variety of diseases the native functions of the synucleins remain unclear they have a lipid binding motif in their n terminal region which suggests interactions with biological membranes in vivo in this study we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to monitor the binding properties of  s and  s to model membranes and to determine the free energy of the interactions our results show that the interactions are most strongly affected by the presence of both anionic lipids and bilayer curvature while membrane fluidity plays a very minor role quantifying the lipid binding properties of  s and  s provides additional insights into the underlying factors governing the protein  membrane interactions such insights not only are relevant to the native functions of these proteins but also highlight their contributions to pathological conditions that are either mediated or characterized by perturbations of these interactions
