energetic frustration of apomyoglobin folding role of the b helix
apomyoglobin folds by a sequential mechanism in which the a g and h helix regions undergo rapid collapse to form a compact intermediate onto which the central portion of the b helix subsequently docks to investigate the factors that frustrate folding we have made mutations in the n terminus of the b helix to stabilize helical structure in the mutant g a g a and to promote native like hydrophobic packing interactions with helix g in the mutant h l h  f  the kinetic and equilibrium intermediates of g a g a and h l h  f were studied by hydrogen exchange pulse labeling and interrupted hydrogen deuterium exchange combined with nmr for both mutants stabilization of helical structure in the n terminal region of the b helix is confirmed by increased exchange protection in the equilibrium molten globule states near ph   increased protection is also observed in the gh turn region in the g a g a mutant suggesting that stabilization of the b helix facilitates native like interactions with the c terminal region of helix g these interactions are further enhanced in h l h  f the kinetic burst phase intermediates of both mutants show increased protection relative to wild type protein of amides in the n terminus of the b helix and in part of the e helix stabilization of the e helix in the intermediate is attributed to direct interactions between e helix residues and the newly stabilized n terminus of helix b stabilization of native packing between the b and g helices in h l h  f also favors formation of native like interactions in the gh turn and between the g and h helices in the ensemble of burst phase intermediates we conclude that instability at the n terminus of the b helix of apomyoglobin contributes to the energetic frustration of folding by preventing docking and stabilization of the e helix
