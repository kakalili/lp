in vitro evolution of a hyperstable g  variant
an in vitro selection strategy was used to obtain strongly stabilized variants of the   domain of protein g g   in a two step approach first candidate positions with a high potential for stabilization were identified in g  libraries that were created by error prone pcr and then after randomization of these positions by saturation mutagenesis strongly stabilized variants were selected for both steps the in vitro selection method proside was employed proside links the stability of a protein with the infectivity of a filamentous phage ultimately residues from the two best selected variants were combined in a single g  molecule this variant with the four mutations e v t l t i and n l showed an increase of     c in the transition midpoint and of    kj mol   at    c in the gibbs free energy of stabilization it was considerably more stable than the best variant from a previous proside selection in which positions were randomized that had originally been identified by computational design only a single substitution t i was found in both selections the best variants from the present selection showed a higher cooperativity of thermal unfolding as indicated by an increase in the enthalpy of unfolding by about   kj mol   this increase is apparently correlated with the presence of leu residues that were selected at the positions  and
