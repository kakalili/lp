rapid induction of nuclear transcripts and inhibition of intron decay in response to the polymerase ii inhibitor drb edited by m yaniv
the transcriptional inhibitor   dichloro   d ribofuranosylbenzimidazole drb is an adenosine analog that has been shown to cause premature transcriptional termination and thus has been a useful tool to identify factors important for transcriptional elongation here we establish an efficient system for studying drb sensitive steps of transcriptional elongation in addition we establish two novel effects of drb not previously reported intron stabilization and the induction of long transcripts by a mechanism other than premature termination we found that drb had a biphasic effect on t cell receptor   tcr  transcripts driven by a tetracycline tet responsive promoter in transfected hela cells in the first phase drb caused a rapid decrease within five minutes of pre mrna and its spliced intron ivs c   consistent with the known ability of drb to inhibit transcription in the second phase which began ten minutes to two hours after treatment depending on the dose  drb dramatically increased the levels of ivs c  containing transcripts by a mechanism requiring de novo rna synthesis drb induced the appearance of short   to   kb tcr  transcripts in vivo indicating drb enhances premature transcriptional termination a    nt prematurely terminated transcript pt was characterized that terminated at an internal poly a tract in the intron ivs c   we identified three other effects of drb first we observed that drb induced the appearance of heterodisperse tcr  transcripts that were too long    kb to gt  kb to result from the type of premature termination events previously described their production was not promoter specific as we found that long transcripts were induced by drb from both the tet responsive and  actin promoters second drb upregulated full length normal sized c myc mrna which provided further evidence that drb has effects besides regulation of premature termination third drb stabilized lariat forms of the intron ivs c   indicating that drb exerts post transcriptional actions we propose that our model system will be useful for elucidating the factors that regulate rna decay and transcriptional elongation in vivo
