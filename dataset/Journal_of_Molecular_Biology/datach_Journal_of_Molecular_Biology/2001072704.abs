structural conversion between open and closed forms of radixin low angle shadowing electron microscopy edited by m moody
the function of erm ezrin radixin moesin proteins as general cross linkers between actin filaments and plasma membranes is regulated downstream of rho through the transition between active and inactive forms to directly examine the conformational change between the active and inactive forms of erm proteins we applied low angle rotary shadowing electron microscopy to the radixin molecules wild type t  a non phosphorylated type and t  e phosphorylated type since most of the active forms are reportedly stabilized in cells by the c terminal threonine phosphorylation as a result the t  a and wild type radixin molecules yielded the globular closed forms     nm in diameter with some striations on their surfaces in contrast the t  e radixin molecules tended to take elongated open forms in which two globular structures measuring   nm and   nm in diameter were associated with both ends of the filamentous structures the filamentous structure took either a     nm long straight course or a folded course taken together with the biochemical and the crystal structural results obtained to date the closed and open forms represent the inactive and active forms of radixin as cross linkers between actin filaments and plasma membranes
