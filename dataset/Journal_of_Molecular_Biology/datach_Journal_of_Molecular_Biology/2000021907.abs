salmonella enteritidis fimbriae displaying a heterologous epitope reveal a uniquely flexible structure and assembly mechanism edited by w baumeister
two distinct salmonella fimbrins agfa and sefa comprising thin aggregative fimbriae sef  and sef  respectively were each genetically engineered to carry pt  an  helical  amino acid leishmania t cell epitope derived from the metalloprotease gp  to identify regions within agfa and sefa fimbrins amenable to replacement with this epitope pcr generated chimeric fimbrin genes were constructed and used to replace the native chromosomal agfa and sefa genes in salmonella enteritidis immunoblot analysis using anti sef  and anti pt sera demonstrated that all ten agfa chimeric fimbrin proteins were expressed by s enteritidis under normal growth conditions immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that eight of the agfa pt proteins were effectively assembled into cell surface exposed fimbriae the pt replacements in agfa altered congo red cr binding cell cell adhesion and cell surface properties of s enteritidis to varying degrees however these chimeric fimbriae were still highly stable being resistant to proteinase k digestion and requiring harsh formic acid treatment for depolymerization in marked contrast to agfa none of the chimeric sefa proteins were expressed or assembled into fimbriae since each pt replacement constituted over   of the agfa amino acid sequence and all ten replacements collectively represented greater than   of the entire agfa primary sequence the ability of agfa to accept large sequence substitutions and still assemble into fibers is unique among fimbriae and other structural proteins this structural flexibility may be related to the novel fivefold repeating sequence of agfa and its recently proposed structure proper formation of chimeric fimbrial fibers suggests an unusual assembly mechanism for thin aggregative fimbriae which tolerates aberrant structures this study opens a range of possibilities for salmonella thin aggregative fimbriae as a carrier of heterologous epitopes and as an experimental model for studies of protein structure
