multichromatic control of gene expression in escherichia coli
light is a powerful tool for manipulating living cells because it can be applied with high resolution across space and over time we previously constructed a red light sensitive escherichia coli transcription system based on a chimera between the red far red switchable cyanobacterial phytochrome cph and the e coli envz ompr two component signaling pathway here we report the development of a green light inducible transcription system in e coli based on a recently discovered green red photoswitchable two component system from cyanobacteria we demonstrate that the transcriptional output is proportional to the intensity of green light applied and that the green sensor is orthogonal to the red sensor at intensities of   nm light less than    w m  expression of both sensors in a single cell allows two color optical control of transcription both in batch culture and in patterns across a lawn of engineered cells because each sensor functions as a photoreversible switch this system should allow the spatial and temporal control of the expression of multiple genes through different combinations of light wavelengths this feature aids precision single cell and population level studies in systems and synthetic biology
