the regulation of myosin binding to actin filaments by lethocerus troponin
lethocerus indirect flight muscle has two isoforms of troponin c tnc f and f  which are unusual in having only a single c terminal calcium binding site site iv isoform f  or one c terminal and one n terminal site sites iv and ii isoform f  we show here that thin filaments assembled from rabbit actin and lethocerus tropomyosin tm and troponin tn regulate the binding of rabbit myosin to rabbit actin in much the same way as the mammalian regulatory proteins the removal of calcium reduces the rate constant for s binding to regulated actin about threefold independent of which tmtn is used this is consistent with calcium removal causing the tmtn to occupy the b or blocked state to about   of the total the mid point pca for the switch differed for tnc f and f  pca   and   respectively consistent with the reported calcium affinities for the two tncs equilibrium titration of s binding to regulated actin filaments confirms calcium regulated binding of s to actin and shows that in the absence of calcium the three actin filaments tnc f  tnc f and mammalian control are almost indistinguishable in terms of occupancy of the b and c states of the filament in the presence of calcium tnc f is very similar to the control with    of the filament in the c state and     in the fully on m state while tnc f has almost   in each of the c and m states this higher occupancy of the m state for tnc f  which occurs above pca   is consistent with this isoform being involved in the calcium activation of stretch activation however it leaves unanswered how a c terminal calcium binding site of tnc can activate the thin filament
