conformational flexibility in recombinant measles virus nucleocapsids visualised by cryo negative stain electron microscopy and real space helical reconstruction
measles virus is a highly contagious virus that despite the existence of an effective vaccine is a major cause of illness and mortality worldwide the virus has a negative sense single stranded rna genome that is encapsidated by the nucleocapsid protein n to form a helical ribonucleoprotein complex known as the nucleocapsid this structure serves as the template for both transcription and replication paramyxovirus nucleocapsids are flexible structures a trait that has hitherto hampered structural analysis even at low resolution we have investigated the extent of this structural plasticity using real space methods to calculate three dimensional reconstructions of recombinant nucleocapsids from cryo negative stain transmission electron micrographs images of short sections of helix were sorted according to both pitch the axial rise per turn and twist the number of subunits per turn  our analysis indicates that there is extensive conformational flexibility within these structures ranging in pitch from   to    while twist varies from at least    to    with a greater number of helices comprising around   subunits per turn we have also investigated the influence of the c terminus of n on helix conformation analysing nucleocapsids after having removed this domain by trypsin digestion we have found that this causes a marked change in both pitch and twist such that the pitch becomes shorter ranging from   to    while more helices have a twist of approximately   subunits per turn our findings lead us to propose a mechanism whereby changes in conformation influenced by interactions between viral or host proteins and the c terminus of n might have a role in regulating the balance of transcription and replication during virus infection
