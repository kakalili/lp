transcription inhibition induced by modified triple helix forming oligonucleotides a quantitative assay for evaluation in cells edited by m yaniv
oligonucleotides can bind to double stranded dna in a sequence specific manner to form triple helices uniformly modified pyrimidine rich oligodeoxyribonuclotides containing internucleosidic n   p   phosphoramidate linkages are known to form very stable triplexes with their dna target psoralen conjugated triple helix forming oligonucleotides pso tfos can additionally be photo induced to become irreversibly bound to their targeted dna sequence here we have examined the ability of various  mer phosphoramidate tfos targeted to the hiv  polypurine tract ppt sequence to prevent transcription elongation in cell cultures the ppt sequence has been cloned in the transcribed region of a reporter firefly luciferase gene luc and transient expression experiments performed we show that the level of transcription inhibition of the reporter gene in cells perfectly correlates with the amount of covalent triplex at the ppt site the efficacy of non covalent triplexes either omitting the irradiation step with the psoralen conjugate or using the unsubstituted oligonucleotide has been studied in our expression system the oligonucleotides were introduced into living cells by cationic lipid mediated delivery or directly into the cell nucleus by microinjection this experimental approach allowed us to evaluate the intrinsic activity of triplexes as transcriptional inhibitors transcription elongation was inhibited in cells in a sequence dependent and concentration dependent manner this experimental system is convenient for quantitative and fast evaluation of new chemistries of antigene oligonucleotides as inhibitors of gene expression in cells and in vivo
