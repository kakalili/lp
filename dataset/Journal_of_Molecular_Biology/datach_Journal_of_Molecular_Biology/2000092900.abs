viral escape at the molecular level explained by quantitative t cell receptor peptide mhc interactions and the crystal structure of a peptide mhc complex edited by i wilson
viral escape first characterized for the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv in a mouse transgenic for the p  t cell receptor tcr  can be due to mutations in t cell epitopes we have measured the affinity between the h db containing the wild type and two of its  viral escape  epitopes as well as other altered peptide ligands apl  by using biacore analysis and solved the crystal structure of h db in complex with the wild type peptide at     resolution we show that viral escape is due to a  to   fold reduction in the level of affinity between the p  tcr and the binary complexes of the mhc molecule with the different peptides structurally one of the mutations alters a tcr contact residue while the effect of the other on the binding of the tcr must be indirect through structural rearrangements the former is a null ligand while the latter still leads to some central tolerance this work defines the structural and energetic threshold for viral escape
