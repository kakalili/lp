an insertion in the catalytic trigger loop gates the secondary channel of rna polymerase
escherichia coli dksa and greb bind to rna polymerase rnap  reaching inside the secondary channel with similar affinities but have different cellular functions dksa destabilizes promoter complexes whereas greb facilitates rna cleavage in arrested elongation complexes ecs  although the less abundant greb may not interfere with dksa regulation during initiation reports that dksa acts during elongation and termination suggest that it may exclude greb from arrested complexes potentially triggering genome instability here we show that greb does not compete with dksa during termination whereas dksa even when present in several hundredfold molar excess does not inhibit greb mediated cleavage of the nascent rna our findings that dksa does not bind to backtracked or active ecs provide an explanation for the lack of dksa activity on most ecs that we reported previously raising a question of what makes a transcription complex susceptible to dksa structural modeling suggests that i  an insertion in the catalytic trigger loop hinders dksa access into the channel restricting dksa action to a subset of transcription complexes in support of this hypothesis we demonstrate that deletion of i permits dksa binding to ecs and that the distribution of dksa and i in bacterial genomes is strongly concordant we hypothesize that dksa binds to transcription complexes in which i becomes mobile for example as a consequence of weakened rnap interactions with the downstream duplex dna
