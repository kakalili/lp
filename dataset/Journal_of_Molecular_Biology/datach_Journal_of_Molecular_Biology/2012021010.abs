an exclusive    code directs allostery in tetr  peptide complexes
the allosteric mechanism of one of the best characterized bacterial transcription regulators tetracycline repressor tetr  has recently been questioned tetracycline binding induces cooperative folding of tetr as suggested by recent unfolding studies rather than switching between two defined conformational states namely a dna binding competent conformation and a non dna binding conformation upon ligand binding a host of near native multiconformational structures collapse into a single highly stabilized protein conformation that is no longer able to bind dna here structure  function studies performed with four synthetic peptides that bind to tetr and mimic the function of low molecular weight effectors such as tetracyclines provide new means to discriminate between different allosteric models whereas two inducing peptides bind in an extended  like conformation two anti inducing peptides form an  helix in the effector binding site of tetr this exclusive bimodal interaction mode coincides with two distinct overall conformations of tetr namely one that is identical with induced tetr and one that mirrors the dna bound state of tetr urea induced unfolding studies show no increase in thermodynamic stability for any of the peptide complexes although fluorescence measurements demonstrate peptide binding to tetr this strongly suggests that at least for these peptide effectors a classical two state allosteric model best describes tetr function
