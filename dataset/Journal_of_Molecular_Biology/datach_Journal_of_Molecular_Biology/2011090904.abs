the determinants that govern microtubule assembly from the atomic structure of gtp tubulin
tubulin alternates between a soluble curved structure and a microtubule straight conformation gtp binding to   tubulin is required for microtubule assembly but whether this triggers conversion into a straighter structure is still debated this is due at least in part to the lack of structural data for gtp tubulin before assembly here we report atomic resolution crystal structures of soluble tubulin in the gdp and gtp nucleotide states in a complex with a stathmin like domain the structures differ locally in the neighborhood of the nucleotide a loop movement in gtp bound tubulin favors its recruitment to the ends of growing microtubules and facilitates its curved to straight transition but this conversion has not proceeded yet the data therefore argue for the conformational change toward the straight structure occurring as microtubule specific contacts are established they also suggest a model for the way the tubulin structure is modified in relation to microtubule assembly
