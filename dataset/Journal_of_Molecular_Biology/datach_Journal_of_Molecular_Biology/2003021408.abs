dna target site requirements for homing in vivo of a bacterial group ii intron encoding a protein lacking the dna endonuclease domain
group ii intron encoded proteins ieps  which have maturase and reverse transcriptase activities form a ribonucleoprotein rnp complex with the intron rna some ieps also have a c terminal dna binding region and conserved dna endonuclease domain involved in the recognition and cleavage of specific dna target sites used for intron homing rmint is a mobile group ii intron of sinorhizobium meliloti the iep of which lacks the endonuclease domain as do over half of their bacterial counterparts here we analyzed the dna target sequence requirements for homing in vivo of intron rmint and compared these requirements to those established for the lactococcus lactis ll ltrb intron a representative of mobile subgroup iia introns encoding proteins with functional c terminal dna endonuclease domains as for ll ltrb rmint homing requires modifiable base pairing interactions between the intron rna and the dna target involving  nucleotides however instead of the      interaction typical of subgroup iia introns we demonstrate that rmint recognizes the first nucleotide within the   exon of the target site by a new ebs ibs pairing predicted for subgroup iib self splicing introns unlike ll ltrb there are less stringent requirements for rmint recognition of distal   and   exon regions where only single nucleotide positions are fixed constraints for intron homing our results predict differences in the dna target site requirements among group ii introns which may have mechanistic and evolutionary implications
