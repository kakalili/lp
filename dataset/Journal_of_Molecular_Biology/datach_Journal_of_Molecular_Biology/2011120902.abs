molecular dynamics simulations of the effect of the g protein and diffusible ligands on the   adrenergic receptor
g protein coupled receptors have extraordinary therapeutic potential as targets for a broad spectrum of diseases understanding their function at the molecular level is therefore essential a variety of crystal structures have made the investigation of the inactive receptor state possible recently released x ray structures of opsin and the   adrenergic receptor   ar have provided insight into the active receptor state in addition we have contributed to the crystal structure of an irreversible agonist    adrenoceptor complex these extensive studies and biophysical investigations have revealed that agonist binding leads to a low affinity conformation of the active state that is suggested to facilitate g protein binding the high affinity receptor state which promotes signal transduction is only formed in the presence of both agonist and g protein despite numerous crystal structures it is not yet clear how ligands tune receptor dynamics and g protein binding we have now used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the distinct impact of agonist and inverse agonist on receptor conformation and g protein binding by investigating the influence of the ligands on the structure and dynamics of a complex composed of  ar and the c terminal end of the g s subunit g ct  the simulations clearly showed that the agonist isoprenaline and the inverse agonist carazolol influence the ligand binding site and the interaction between  ar and g ct differently isoprenaline induced an inward motion of helix  whereas carazolol blocked the rearrangement of the extracellular part of the receptor moreover in the presence of isoprenaline   ar and g ct form a stable interaction that is destabilized by carazolol
