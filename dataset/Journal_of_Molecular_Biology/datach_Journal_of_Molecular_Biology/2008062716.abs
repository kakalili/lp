new features of the ribosome and ribosomal inhibitors non enzymatic recycling misreading and back translocation
we describe the optimization of a poly phe synthesis system the conditions of which have been applied for efficient translation of heteropolymeric mrnas here we identify two parameters that are essential to obtain translation at efficiency and accuracy levels equivalent to those in vivo viz  the fine tuning of the energy rich components with an acetyl  phosphate substrate for energy regeneration as well as the ionic conditions applying this system revealed a number of new features  i  s ribosomes are able to recycle within   s in a non enzymatic fashion in the absence of tmrna this observation might explain the fact that a knockout of the tmrna gene ssra is not lethal for escherichia coli cells in contrast to other bacterial strains such as bacillus subtilis  ii the high efficiency of the system was exploited to analyze the misincorporation of various amino acids resolution limit      no misreading was observed at the middle codon position and only marginal effects were observed at the first one even when misreading was artificially stimulated   to  fold  yielding an improved definition of the near cognate and non cognate aminoacyl trnas  iii aminoglycosides increase phe and lys incorporation about  fold in the presence of poly u or poly uuc and poly a  respectively and induce a back translocation except hygromycin b exclusively in the absence of ef g  gtp as do the non related drugs viomycin and edeine
