structure of the base of the l l  stalk of the haloarcula marismortui large ribosomal subunit analysis of l  movements
initiation factors elongation factors and release factors all interact with the l l  stalk of the large ribosomal subunit during their respective gtp dependent cycles on the ribosome electron density corresponding to the stalk is not present in previous crystal structures of either  s subunits or  s ribosomes we have now discovered conditions that result in a more ordered factor binding center in the haloarcula marismortui h ma large ribosomal subunit crystals and consequently allows the visualization of the full length l  the n terminal domain ntd of l  and helices  and  of  s rrna the resulting model is currently the most complete reported structure of a l l  stalk in the context of a ribosome this region contains a series of intermolecular interfaces that are smaller than those typically seen in other ribonucleoprotein interactions within the  s subunit comparisons of the l  ntd position between the current structure which is has an ntd splayed out with respect to previous structures and other structures of ribosomes in different functional states demonstrates a dynamic range of l  ntd movements we propose that the l  ntd moves through three different relative positions during the translational cycle apo ribosome factor bound pre gtp hydrolysis and post gtp hydrolysis these positions outline a pathway for l  ntd movements that are dependent on the specific nucleotide state of the bound ligand these three states are represented by the orientations of the l  ntd relative to the ribosome and suggest that l  may play a more specialized role in the factor binding cycle than previously appreciated
