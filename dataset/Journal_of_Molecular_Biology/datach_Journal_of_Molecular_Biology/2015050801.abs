cancer associated mutants of rna helicase ddx x are defective in rna stimulated atp hydrolysis
the dead box rna helicase ddx x is frequently mutated in pediatric medulloblastoma we dissect how these mutants affect ddx x function with structural biochemical and genetic experiments we identify an n terminal extension   atp binding loop   abl that is critical for the stimulation of atp hydrolysis by rna we present crystal structures suggesting that the abl interacts dynamically with atp and confirming that the interaction occurs in solution by nmr chemical shift perturbation and isothermal titration calorimetry dead box helicases require interaction between two conserved reca like helicase domains d and d for function we use nmr chemical shift perturbation to show that ddx x interacts specifically with double stranded rna through its d domain with contact mediated by residues g  and g   mutants of these residues g  v and g  e are associated with pediatric medulloblastoma these mutants are defective in rna stimulated atp hydrolysis we show that ddx x complements the growth defect in a ded temperature sensitive strain of schizosaccharomyces pombe but the cancer associated mutants g  v and g  e do not complement and exhibit protein expression defects taken together our results suggest that impaired translation of important mrna targets by mutant ddx x represents a key step in the development of medulloblastoma
