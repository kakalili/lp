evidence for proton shuffling in a thioredoxin like protein during catalysis
proteins of the thioredoxin trx superfamily catalyze disulfide bond formation reduction and isomerization in substrate proteins both in prokaryotic and in eukaryotic cells all members of the trx family with thiol  disulfide oxidoreductase activity contain the characteristic cys x x cys motif in their active site here using poisson  boltzmann based protonation state calculations based on   ns molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the catalytic mechanism of dsbl the most oxidizing trx like protein known to date we observed several correlated transitions in the protonation states of the buried active site cysteine and a neighboring lysine coupled to the exposure of the active site thiolate these results support the view of an internal proton shuffling mechanism during oxidation crucial for the uptake of two electrons from the substrate protein intramolecular disulfide bond formation is probably steered by the conformational switch facilitating interaction with the active site thiolate a consistent catalytic mechanism for dsbl probably conferrable to other proteins of the same class is presented our results suggest a functional role of hydration entropy of active site groups
