crystal structures of the glutamate receptor ion channel gluk and gluk amino terminal domains
ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic neurotransmission in the central nervous system the selective assembly of iglurs into ampa kainate and n methyl d aspartic acid nmda receptor subtypes is regulated by their extracellular amino terminal domains atds  kainate receptors are further classified into low affinity receptor families gluk  gluk  and high affinity receptor families gluk  gluk  based on their affinity for the neurotoxin kainic acid these two families share a   sequence identity for the intact receptor but only a   sequence identity at the level of atd we have determined for the first time the high resolution crystal structures of gluk and gluk atds both of which crystallize as dimers but with a strikingly different dimer assembly at the r interface by contrast for both gluk and gluk  the r domain dimer assembly is similar to those reported previously for other non nmda iglurs this observation is consistent with the reports that gluk  gluk cannot form functional homomeric ion channels and require obligate coassembly with gluk  gluk  our analysis also reveals that the relative orientation of domains r and r in individual non nmda receptor atds varies by up to    in contrast to the   difference reported for the nmda receptor glun b subunit this restricted domain movement in non nmda receptor atds seems to result both from extensive intramolecular contacts between domain r and domain r and from their assembly as dimers which interact at both r and r domains our results provide the first insights into the structure and function of gluk  gluk  the least understood family of iglurs
