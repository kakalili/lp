distinct embryonic expression and localization of cbp and p  histone acetyltransferases at the mouse  a crystallin locus in lens
mouse  a crystallin gene encodes the most abundant protein of the mammalian lens expression of  a crystallin is regulated temporally and spatially during lens development with initial expression in the lens vesicle followed by strong upregulation in the differentiating primary lens fibers lens specific expression of  a crystallin is mediated by dna binding transcription factors pax  c maf and creb bound to its promoter region its   distal enhancer dcr  mediates regulation of  a crystallin via fgf signaling while its   distal enhancer dcr  functions only in elongated primary lens fibers via other lens differentiation pathways dcr and dcr establish outside borders of a lens specific chromatin region marked by histone h k acetylation here we identified creb binding protein cbp and p  as major histone acetyltransferases hats associated in vivo with the mouse  a crystallin locus both hats are expressed in embryonic lens expression of cbp in primary lens fiber cells coincides with  a crystallin in the chromatin of lens epithelial cells chromatin immunoprecipitations chips show that the  a crystallin promoter is notably devoid of any significant presence of cbp and p   though dcr and a few other regions show the presence of these hats in the chromatin obtained from newborn lens cbp was localized specifically at the promoter region with about ten times higher abundance compared to the entire  a crystallin locus in contrast p  is distributed more evenly across the entire locus analysis of total histone h and h k acetylation revealed potential lower density of nucleosomes  kb upstream from the promoter region collectively our data suggest that moderate level of  a crystallin gene expression in lens epithelial cells does not require the presence of cbp and p  in the promoter however the lens specific chromatin domain contains both promoter localized cbp on the  background  of locus spread presence of cbp and p
