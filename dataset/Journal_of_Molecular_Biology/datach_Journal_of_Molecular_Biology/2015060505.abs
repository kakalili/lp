genome wide localization study of yeast pex  identifies peroxisome  mitochondria interactions through the ermes complex
pex  is a peroxin that regulates the number of peroxisomes in eukaryotic cells recently it was found that a mutation in one of the three mammalian paralogs pex   results in a neurological disorder the molecular function of pex  however is not known saccharomyces cerevisiae pex  has been shown to recruit to peroxisomes the mitochondrial fission machinery thus enabling proliferation of peroxisomes this process is essential for efficient fatty acid  oxidation in this study we used high content microscopy on a genome wide scale to determine the subcellular localization pattern of yeast pex  in all non essential gene deletion mutants as well as in temperature sensitive essential gene mutants pex  localization and morphology of peroxisomes was profoundly affected by mutations in   different genes that were functionally classified a group of genes encompassing mdm  mdm  and mdm  that encode the mitochondrial and cytosolic components of the ermes complex was analyzed in greater detail deletion of these genes caused a specifically altered pex  localization pattern whereas deletion of mmm  the gene encoding the fourth endoplasmic reticulum associated component of the complex did not result in an altered pex  localization or peroxisome morphology phenotype moreover we found that pex  and mdm  physically interact and that pex  plays a role in establishing the contact sites between peroxisomes and mitochondria through the ermes complex based on these results we propose that the mitochondrial cytosolic components of the ermes complex establish a direct interaction between mitochondria and peroxisomes through pex
