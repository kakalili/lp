fab  induced folding of antigenic n terminal peptides from intrinsically disordered hiv  tat revealed by x ray crystallography
tat the transcriptional activator protein of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   is critical for viral replication and is a potential hiv  vaccine candidate this intrinsically disordered protein is present in the extracellular medium and is involved in the pathogenicity of hiv through its interaction with different cellular and viral biological partners a monoclonal antibody termed  h h  which is specific for the n terminal region of tat was selected for a functional and structural study of the hiv  tat protein the equilibrium dissociation constants kd of tat and tat fragments complexed with  h h were estimated by competitive elisa tat contains a single tryptophan residue trp  located in the n terminal region we show that the substitution of trp  by a phenylalanine completely abolishes the binding of  h h  whereas the transactivating activity of tat is preserved the epitope recognized by  h h was restricted to the  mer peptide p klepwkhp  centered on trp  the crystal structures of this  mer peptide and of an overlapping  mer peptide were determined in complex with fab   h h at     and     resolution respectively tat is intrinsically disordered and can undergo induced folding upon association with a biological partner our crystallographic study reveals that the two tat peptides which are lodged in the u shaped groove of the fab  antigen binding site adopt a standard type i  turn conformation the central trp  that is critical for fab  recognition is further stabilized by  stacking interactions the structural and biological consequences of this induced folding in hiv pathogenesis are discussed
