domain swapping in p suc results in formation of native like cytotoxic aggregates
the field of protein aggregation has been occupied mainly with the study of  strand self association that occurs as a result of misfolding and leads to the formation of toxic protein aggregates and amyloid fibers however some of these aggregates retain native like structural and enzymatic properties suggesting mechanisms other than  strand assembly p suc is a small protein that can exist as a monomer or a domain swapped dimer here we show that under native conditions p suc forms three dimensional domain swapped aggregates and that these aggregates are cytotoxic thus toxicity of protein aggregates is not only associated with  rich assemblies and amyloid fibers involving non native interactions but it can be induced by oligomeric misassembly that maintains predominantly native like interactions
