Site-specific mutagenesis of the hmfB gene cloned from the archaeon Methanothermus fervidus, followed by expression in Escherichia coli, has been used to generate ∼90 recombinant (r) variants of the archaeal histone HMfB. The abilities of these variants to form stable archaeal nucleosome-containing complexes with linear pBR322 DNA, and with an 89 bp restriction fragment of this DNA have been determined. Variants that failed to form such complexes, based on negative gel-shift assays, had substitutions at the N terminus or within the α1, L1 and L2 regions of the rHMfB histone fold, at sites predicted to be homologous to eucaryal histone fold residues that contact the DNA in the eucaryal nucleosome. Variants that failed to give gel shifts were further assayed for their abilities to facilitate ligase-catalyzed circularization of a linear 88 bp DNA molecule, and to reduce the ellipticity of a DNA solution at 275 nm (θ275). Consistent with cooperative but independent sites of DNA binding, a combination of three residue substitutions, one each in α1, L1 and L2, was required to generate a rHMfB variant with no detectable DNA binding based on gel shift, circularization and θ275 reduction assays.
