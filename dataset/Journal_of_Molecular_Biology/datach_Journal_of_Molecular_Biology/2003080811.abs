yeast aspartyl trna synthetase binds specifically its own mrna
dimeric class ii aspartyl trna synthetase asprs from yeast has a modular architecture and includes an n terminal appendix of  amino acid residues that protrudes from the anticodon binding module this extension of predicted helical structure is not essential for aminoacylation but contains an rna binding motif that promotes non specific interactions with trnas as shown here this protein extension can also interact with the   end of the asprs mrna in vitro optimal binding occurs on an mrna domain comprising part of the  nucleotide long   utr and the sequence encoding the n terminal appendix at the protein side only the appendix and the anticodon binding module participate in the interaction between asprs and the mrna domain binding is specific since only trnaasp can dissociate the complex in vivo asprs also binds specifically this mrna domain and in doing so triggers a reduced translation of a fused gfp mrna from that a mechanism for the regulation of this eukaryotic aminoacyl trna synthetase is proposed implications for aspartylation accuracy in yeast are given
