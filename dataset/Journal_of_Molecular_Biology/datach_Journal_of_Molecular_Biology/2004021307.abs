rna interactions in the   region of the hiv  genome
the untranslated leader of the dimeric hiv  rna genome is folded into a complex structure that plays multiple and essential roles in the viral replication cycle here we have investigated secondary and tertiary structural elements within the     nucleotides of the hiv  genome using a combination of bioinformatics enzymatic probing native gel electrophoresis and uv crosslinking experiments we used a recently developed rna folding algorithm pfold to predict the common secondary structure of an alignment of  divergent hiv  sequences combining this analysis with biochemical data we present a secondary structure model for the entire   nucleotide fragment which incorporates previously recognized and novel structural elements in particular our data provided strong evidence for a long distance interaction between the region encompassing the aug gag initiation codon and an upstream region and we demonstrate that this feature is highly conserved in distantly related human and animal retroviruses to obtain information about tertiary interactions we applied an intramolecular uv crosslinking strategy and identified a novel tertiary interaction within the pbs hairpin structure
