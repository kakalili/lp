analysing six types of protein  protein interfaces
non covalent residue side chain interactions occur in many different types of proteins and facilitate many biological functions are these differences manifested in the sequence compositions and or the residue  residue contact preferences of the interfaces previous studies analysed small data sets and gave contradictory answers here we introduced a new data mining method that yielded the largest high resolution data set of interactions analysed we introduced an information theory based analysis method on the basis of sequence features we were able to differentiate six types of protein interfaces each corresponding to a different functional or structural association between residues particularly we found significant differences in amino acid composition and residue  residue preferences between interactions of residues within the same structural domain and between different domains between permanent and transient interfaces and between interactions associating homo oligomers and hetero oligomers the differences between the six types were so substantial that using amino acid composition alone we could predict statistically to which of the six types of interfaces a pool of   residues belongs at      accuracy all interfaces differed significantly from the background of all residues in swiss prot from the group of surface residues and from internal residues that were not involved in non trivial interactions overall our results suggest that the interface type could be predicted from sequence and that interface type specific mean field potentials may be adequate for certain applications
