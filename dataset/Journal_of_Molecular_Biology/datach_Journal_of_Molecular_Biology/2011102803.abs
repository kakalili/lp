on unsatisfied hydrogen bonds in the n terminal subdomain of villin headpiece
villin headpiece is a small autonomously folding protein that has emerged as a model system for understanding the fundamental tenets governing protein folding in this communication we employ nmr and x ray crystallography to characterize a point mutant h f which retains actin binding activity is more thermostable but interestingly does not exhibit the partially folded intermediate observed of either wild type or other similar point mutants
