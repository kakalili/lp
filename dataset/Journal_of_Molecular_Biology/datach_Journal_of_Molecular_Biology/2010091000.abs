the role of the t gp inhibitor of host rna polymerase in phage development
bacteriophage t relies on its own rna polymerase rnap to transcribe its middle and late genes early genes which include the viral rnap gene are transcribed by the host rnap from three closely spaced strong promoters  a  a  and a  one middle t gene product gp  is a strong inhibitor of the host rnap gp is essential and is required late in infection during phage dna packaging here we explore the role of gp in controlling host rnap transcription during t infection we demonstrate that in the absence of gp  early viral transcripts continue to accumulate throughout the infection decreasing transcription from early promoter a is sufficient to make gp dispensable for phage infection gp also becomes dispensable when an antiterminating element boxa located downstream of early promoters is deleted the results thus suggest that antiterminated transcription by host rnap from the a promoter is interfering with phage development and that the only essential role for gp is to prevent this transcription
