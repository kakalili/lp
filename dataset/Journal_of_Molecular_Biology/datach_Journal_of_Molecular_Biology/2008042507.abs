high resolution structure of a self assembly competent form of a hydrophobic peptide captured in a soluble  sheet scaffold
rich self assembly is a major structural class of polypeptides but still little is known about its atomic structures and biophysical properties major impediments for structural and biophysical studies of peptide self assemblies include their insolubility and heterogeneous composition we have developed a model system termed peptide self assembly mimic psam  based on the single layer  sheet of borrelia outer surface protein a psam allows for the capture of a defined number of self assembly like peptide repeats within a water soluble protein making structural and energetic studies possible in this work we extend our psam approach to a highly hydrophobic peptide sequence we show that a penta ile peptide ile  which is insoluble and forms  rich self assemblies in aqueous solution can be captured within the psam scaffold in a form capable of self assembly the    crystal structure revealed that the ile stretch forms a highly regular  strand within this flat  sheet self assembly models built with multiple copies of the crystal structure of the ile peptide segment showed no steric conflict indicating that this conformation represents an assembly competent form the psam retained high conformational stability suggesting that the flat  strand of the ile stretch primed for self assembly is a low energy conformation of the ile stretch and rationalizing its high propensity for self assembly the ability of the psam to  solubilize  an otherwise insoluble peptide stretch suggests the potential of the psam approach to the characterization of self assembling peptides
