Collapse of unfolded protein chains is an early event in folding. It affects structural properties of intrinsically disordered proteins, which take a considerable fraction of the human proteome. Collapse is generally believed to be driven by hydrophobic forces imposed by the presence of nonpolar amino acid side chains. Contributions from backbone hydrogen bonds to protein folding and stability, however, are controversial. To date, the experimental dissection of side-chain and backbone contributions has not yet been achieved because both types of interactions are integral parts of protein structure. Here, we realized this goal by applying mutagenesis and chemical modification on a set of disordered peptides and proteins. We measured the protein dimensions and kinetics of intra-chain diffusion of modified polypeptides at the level of individual molecules using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, thereby avoiding artifacts commonly caused by aggregation of unfolded protein material in bulk. We found no contributions from side chains to collapse but, instead, identified backbone interactions as a source sufficient to form globules of native-like dimensions. The presence of backbone hydrogen bonds decreased polypeptide water solubility dramatically and accelerated the nanosecond kinetics of loop closure, in agreement with recent predictions from computer simulation. The presence of side chains, instead, slowed loop closure and modulated the dimensions of intrinsically disordered domains. It appeared that the transient formation of backbone interactions facilitates the diffusive search for productive conformations at the early stage of folding and within intrinsically disordered proteins.
