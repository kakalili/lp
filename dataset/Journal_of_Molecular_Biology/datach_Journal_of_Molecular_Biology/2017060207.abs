blatm   a genetic tool revealing preferred antiparallel interaction of transmembrane helix  of the dual topology protein emre
parallel and antiparallel transmembrane helix  helix interactions support the folding and non covalent assembly of many integral membrane proteins while several genetic tools are currently in use to study parallel transmembrane helix  helix interactions antiparallel associations have been difficult to determine here we present a novel genetic approach termed blatm   which can be used in combination with the recently presented blatm   to compare the efficiency of antiparallel and parallel transmembrane domain tmd interactions in a natural membrane in a practical application of the blatm system we find that the antiparallel interaction of tmd  the known dimerization domain of the dual topology small multidrug transporter emre is sequence specific and much stronger than the parallel one this suggests that tmd has evolved to favor the formation of dual topology emre dimers over single topology dimers
