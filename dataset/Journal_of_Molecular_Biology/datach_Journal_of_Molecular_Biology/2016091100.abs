the termination phase in protein synthesis is not obligatorily followed by the rrf ef g dependent recycling phase
it is general wisdom that termination of bacterial protein synthesis is obligatorily followed by recycling governed by the factors ribosomal recycling factor rrf  ef g and if  where the ribosome dissociates into its subunits in contrast a recently described  s scanning mode of initiation holds that after termination scanning of  s can be triggered by fmet trna to the initiation site of a downstream cistron here we analyze the apparent conflict we constructed a bicistronic mrna coding for luciferases and showed with a highly resolved in vitro system that the expression of the second cistron did not at all depend on the presence of active rrf an in vivo analysis cannot be performed in a straightforward way since rrf is essential for viability and therefore the rrf gene cannot be knocked out however we found an experimental window where the rrf amount could be reduced to below    and in this situation the expression of the second cistron of a bicistronic luciferase mrna was only moderately reduced both in vitro and in vivo results suggested that rrf dependent recycling is not an obligatory step after termination in agreement with the previous findings concerning  s scanning initiation in this view recycling after termination is a special case of the general rrf function which happens whenever fmet trna is not available for triggering  s scanning
