assembly of the archaeal box c d srnp can occur via alternative pathways and requires temperature facilitated srna remodeling
archaeal dual guide box c d small nucleolar rna like rnas srnas bind three core proteins in sequential order at both terminal box c d and internal c  d  motifs to assemble two ribonuclear protein rnp complexes active in guiding nucleotide methylation experiments have investigated the process of box c d srnp assembly and the resultant changes in srna structure or  remodeling  as a consequence of srnp core protein binding hierarchical assembly of the methanocaldococcus jannaschii sr box c d srnp is a temperature dependent process with binding of l and nop   core proteins to the srna requiring elevated temperature to facilitate necessary rna structural dynamics circular dichroism cd spectroscopy and rna thermal denaturation revealed an increased order and stability of srna folded structure as a result of l binding subsequent binding of the nop   and fibrillarin core proteins to the l  srna complex further remodeled srna structure assessment of sr guide region accessibility using complementary rna oligonucleotide probes revealed significant changes in guide region structure during srnp assembly a second dual guide box c d srna from m jannaschii sr  also exhibited rna remodeling during temperature dependent srnp assembly although core protein binding was affected by sr  s distinct folded structure interestingly the sr srnp followed an alternative assembly pathway with both guide regions being continuously exposed during srnp assembly further experiments using sr mutants possessing alternative guide regions demonstrated that srna folded structure induced by specific guide sequences impacted the srnp assembly pathway nevertheless assembled srnps were active for srna guided methylation independent of the pathway followed thus rna remodeling appears to be a common and requisite feature of archaeal dual guide box c d srnp assembly and formation of the mature srnp can follow different assembly pathways in generating catalytically active complexes
