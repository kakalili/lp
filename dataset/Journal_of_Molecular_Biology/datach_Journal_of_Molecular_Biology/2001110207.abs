biological significance of a small highly conserved region in the n terminus of the p  tumour suppressor protein edited by j karn
the p  tumour suppressor protein plays a central role in maintaining genomic integrity in eukaryotic cells the most significant biological function of p  is to act as a sequence specific dna binding transcription factor which can induce the expression of a variety of target genes in response to diverse stress stimuli the p  protein contains six highly conserved regions one of which termed box i is located in the n terminal transactivation domain amino acid residues  and   the second half of the box i region is crucial for the interaction with the basal transcription machinery and is thus required for p   s activity as a transcription factor the same region also binds to mdm  since p  is targeted by mdm for ubiquitin mediated proteasome dependent degradation this region is also essential for the regulation of p   s stability in response to stress signals although the first half of box i is highly conserved its biological function is not clearly defined the aim of this study was to characterise this conserved region and investigate its role in the biological functions of p  we have generated short deletions and point mutations within this region and analysed their effect on p  function and regulation biochemical analyses demonstrate that deletion of residues  to  significantly increases both the transcriptional transactivation and g arrest inducing activities of murine p  residues  to  appear to function as a regulatory element in p  modulating p  dependent transcriptional transactivation and cell cycle arrest possibly by affecting the structural stability of the core domain of the protein in support of this the deletion was found to induce second site reversion of the val  temperature sensitive mutant of murine p
