differential stability of high density lipoprotein subclasses effects of particle size and protein composition
high density lipoproteins hdls are complexes of proteins mainly apoa i and apoa ii and lipids that remove cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis understanding the distinct properties of the heterogeneous hdl population may aid the development of new diagnostic tools and therapies for atherosclerosis mature human hdls form two major subclasses differing in particle diameter and metabolic properties hdl  large and hdl  small  these subclasses are comprised of hdl a i containing only apoa i and hdl a i a ii containing apoa i and apoa ii apoa i is strongly cardioprotective but the function of the smaller more hydrophobic apoa ii is unclear apoa ii is thought to counteract the cardioprotective action of apoa i by stabilizing hdl particles and inhibiting their remodeling to test this notion we performed the first kinetic stability study of human hdl subclasses the results revealed that the stability of plasma spherical hdl decreases with increasing particle diameter which may facilitate preferential cholesterol ester uptake from large lipid loaded hdl  surprisingly size matched plasma hdl a i a ii showed comparable or slightly lower stability than hdl a i  this is consistent with the destabilization of model discoidal hdl observed upon increasing the a ii to a i ratio these results clarify the roles of the particle size and protein composition in hdl remodeling and help reconcile conflicting reports regarding the role of apoa ii in this remodeling
