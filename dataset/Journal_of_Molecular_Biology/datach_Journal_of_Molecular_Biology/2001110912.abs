both the environment and somatic mutations govern the aggregation pathway of pathogenic immunoglobulin light chain edited by a fersht
deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain lc aggregates in tissues is the hallmark of a class of fatal diseases with no effective treatment in the most prevalent diseases two different types of lc aggregates are observed fibrillar deposits in lc amyloidosis al and granular aggregates in lc deposition disease lcdd  the mechanisms by which a given lc forms either type of aggregate are not understood although some lcs are more aggregation prone than others this does not appear to be due to specific sequence determinants but more likely from global properties that can be introduced by multiple somatic mutations moreover a single lc isotype can sometimes form both fibrillar and granular aggregates within the same patient to better understand how the different aggregation pathways arise we developed a series of in vitro assays to analyze the formation of distinct aggregate types the recombinant  iv lc sma assembles into fibrils when agitated we now show that sma can also form granular aggregates upon exposure to copper and that this aggregation can occur not only in vitro but also in cells a constellation of somatic mutations consisting of his  his  gln  is sufficient to confer sensitivity to copper on wild type  iv proteins the formation of both types of aggregates is inhibited by synthetic peptides derived from the lc variable domain however the peptide that inhibits fibrillar aggregation is different from the peptide that inhibits copper induced aggregation thus distinct molecular surfaces of the lc underly each type of aggregate we conclude that both the intrinsic properties of the sequence and extrinsic conditions govern the aggregation pathway of a lc
