nmr structures of  and  residue fragments of the calreticulin p domain
calreticulin crt is an abundant soluble molecular chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum similar to its membrane bound homolog calnexin cnx  it is a lectin that promotes the folding of proteins carrying n linked glycans both proteins cooperate with an associated co chaperone the thiol disulfide oxidoreductase erp  this enzyme catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds in cnx and crt bound glycoprotein substrates previously we solved the nmr structure of the central proline rich p domain of crt comprising residues      this structure shows an extended hairpin topology with three short anti parallel  sheets three small hydrophobic clusters and one helical turn at the tip of the hairpin we further demonstrated that the residues      at the tip of the crt p domain are involved in direct contacts with erp  here we show that the crt p domain fragment crt      constitutes an autonomous folding unit and has a structure highly similar to that of the corresponding region in crt       of the  residues present in crt        form a well structured core making this fragment one of the smallest known natural sequences to form a stable non helical fold in the absence of disulfide bonds or tightly bound metal ions crt      comprises all the residues of the intact p domain that were shown to interact with erp  isothermal titration microcalorimetry itc now showed affinity of this fragment for erp  similar to that of the intact p domain demonstrating that crt      may be used as a low molecular mass mimic of crt for further investigations of the interaction with erp  we also solved the nmr structure of the  residue fragment crt       in which the tip of the hairpin and the first  sheet are well structured but the residues      are disordered presumably due to lack of stabilizing interactions across the hairpin
