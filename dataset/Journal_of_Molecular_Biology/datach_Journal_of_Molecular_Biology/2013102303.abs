eukaryotic mrna decay methodologies pathways and links to other stages of gene expression
mrna concentration depends on the balance between transcription and degradation rates on both sides of the equilibrium synthesis and degradation show however interesting differences that have conditioned the evolution of gene regulatory mechanisms here we discuss recent genome wide methods for determining mrna half lives in eukaryotes we also review pre and posttranscriptional regulons that coordinate the fate of functionally related mrnas by using protein or rna based trans factors some of these factors can regulate both transcription and decay rates thereby maintaining proper mrna homeostasis during eukaryotic cell life
