nedd overexpression results in neddylation of ubiquitin substrates by the ubiquitin pathway
ubiquitin and ubiquitin like proteins use unique e  e  and e enzymes for conjugation to their substrates we and others have recently reported that increases in the relative concentration of the ubiquitin like protein nedd over ubiquitin lead to activation of nedd by the ubiquitin e enzyme we now show that this results in erroneous conjugation of nedd to ubiquitin substrates such as p  caspase  and hif   demonstrating that overexpression of nedd is not appropriate for identification of substrates of the nedd pathway
