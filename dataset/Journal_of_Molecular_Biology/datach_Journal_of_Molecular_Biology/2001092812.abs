the ring domains of the promyelocytic leukemia protein pml and the arenaviral protein z repress translation by directly inhibiting translation initiation factor eif e edited by d draper
the promyelocytic leukemia protein pml is a mammalian regulator of cell growth which is characteristically disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia and by a variety of viruses pml contains a ring domain which is required for its growth suppressive and antiviral properties although normally nuclear in certain pathogenic conditions including arenaviral infection pml is relocated to the cytoplasm where its functions are poorly understood here we observe that pml and arenavirus protein z use regions around the first zinc binding site of their respective ring domains to directly interact with sub micromolar affinity with the dorsal surface of translation initiation factor eif e representing a novel mode of eif e recognition pml and z profoundly reduce the affinity of eif e for its substrate the    methyl guanosine cap of mrna by over   fold association with the dorsal surface of eif e and direct antagonism of mrna cap binding by pml and z lead to direct inhibition of translation these activities of the ring domains of pml and z do not involve ubiquitin mediated protein degradation in contrast to many rings which have been observed to do so although pml and z have well characterized physiological functions in regulation of growth and apoptosis this work establishes the first discrete biochemical mechanism which underlies the biological activities of their ring domains thus we establish pml and z as translational repressors with potential contributions to the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and variety of viral infections
