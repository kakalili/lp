The crystallographic structure of salicylate 1,2-dioxygenase (SDO), a new ring fission dioxygenase from the naphthalenesulfonate-degrading strain Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans BN12, which oxidizes salicylate to 2-oxohepta-3,5-dienedioic acid by a novel ring fission mechanism, has been solved by molecular replacement techniques and refined at 2.9 Å resolution (Rfree 26.1%; R-factor 19.3%). SDO is a homo-tetramer member of type III extradiol-type dioxygenases with a subunit topology characteristic of the bicupin β-barrel folds. The catalytic center contains a mononuclear iron(II) ion coordinated to three histidine residues (His119, His121, and His160), located within the N-terminal domain in a solvent-accessible pocket. SDO is markedly different from the known gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases (GDO) or 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate dioxygenase because of its unique ability to oxidatively cleave numerous salicylates, gentisates and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate with high catalytic efficiency. The comparison of the structure and substrate specificity for a series of different substrates with the corresponding data for several GDOs and the docking of salicylates/gentisates in the active site of SDO, allowed the identification of several active site residues responsible for differences of substrate specificity. In particular, a more defined electron density of the N-terminal region allowed the discovery of a novel structure fragment in SDO previously unobserved in GDO. This region contributes several residues to the active site that influence substrate specificity for both of these enzymes. Implications on the catalytic mechanism are discussed.
