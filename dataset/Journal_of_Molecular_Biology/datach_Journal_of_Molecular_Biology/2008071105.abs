autophosphorylated residues involved in the regulation of human chk in vitro
human checkpoint kinase  is a major actor in checkpoint activation through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated in response to dna double strand breaks in the absence of de novo dna damage its autoactivation reported in the event of increased cds checkpoint kinase  chk  expression has been attributed to oligomerization here we report a study performed on autoactivated recombinant chk proteins that aims to correlate kinase activity and phosphorylation status using a fluorescence based technique to assay human checkpoint kinase  catalytic activity slight differences in the ability to phosphorylate cdc c were observed depending on the recombinant system used using mass spectrometry the phosphorylation sites were mapped to identify sites potentially involved in the kinase activity five phosphorylated positions at ser   ser   thr   ser  and ser   were found to be common to bacteria and insect cells expression systems they were present in addition to the six known phosphorylation sites induced by ionizing radiation thr  thr   thr   ser   ser   and ser  detected by immunoblotting after phosphatase treatment chk regained activity via autorephosphorylation the determination of the five common sites and ionizing radiation inducible positions as rephosphorylated confirms that they are potential positive regulators of chk kinase activity for escherichia coli s most highly phosphorylated his chk   additional phosphorylation sites were assigned including  novel sites on top of recently reported phosphorylation sites
