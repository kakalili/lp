modified nucleotides in trnalys and trnaval are important for translocation
ribosomes translate genetic information encoded by messenger rnas mrnas into proteins accurate decoding by the ribosome depends on the proper interaction between the mrna codon and the anticodon of transfer rna trna  trnas from all kingdoms of life are enzymatically modified at distinct sites particularly in and near the anticodon yet the role of these naturally occurring trna modifications in translation is not fully understood here we show that modified nucleosides at the first or wobble position of the anticodon and   adjacent to the anticodon are important for translocation of trna from the ribosome s aminoacyl site a site to the peptidyl site p site  thus naturally occurring modifications in trna contribute functional groups and conformational dynamics that are critical for accurate decoding of mrna and for translocation to the p site during protein synthesis
