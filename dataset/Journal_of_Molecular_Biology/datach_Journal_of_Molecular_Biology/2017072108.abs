leveraging reciprocity to identify and characterize unknown allosteric sites in protein tyrosine phosphatases
drug like molecules targeting allosteric sites in proteins are of great therapeutic interest however identification of potential sites is not trivial a straightforward approach to identify hidden allosteric sites is demonstrated in protein tyrosine phosphatases ptp by creation of single alanine mutations in the catalytic acid loop of ptp b and vhr this approach relies on the reciprocal interactions between an allosteric site and its coupled orthosteric site the resulting nmr chemical shift perturbations csps of each mutant reveal clusters of distal residues affected by acid loop mutation in ptp b and vhr two new allosteric clusters were identified in each enzyme mutations in these allosteric clusters altered phosphatase activity with changes in kcat km ranging from   to nearly   fold this work outlines a simple method for identification of new allosteric sites in ptp and given the basis of this method in thermodynamics it is expected to be generally useful in other systems
