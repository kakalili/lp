Astacin (EC 3.4.24.21) is a prototype for the astacin family and for the metzincin superfamily of zinc peptidases, which comprise membrane-bound and secreted enzymes involved in extracellular proteolysis during tissue development and remodelling. Generally, metzincins are translated as pro-enzymes (zymogens), which are activated by removal of an N-terminal pro-peptide. In astacin, however, the mode of zymogen activation has been obscured, since the pro-form does not accumulate in vivo. Here we report the detection of pro-astacin in midgut glands of brefeldin A-treated crayfish (Astacus astacus) by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. We demonstrate that the pro-peptide is able to shield the active site of mature astacin as a transient inhibitor, which is degraded slowly. In vitro studies with recombinant pro-astacin in the absence of another protease reveal a potential of auto-proteolytic activation. The initial cleavage in this autoactivation appears to be an intramolecular event. This is supported by the fact that the mutant E93A-pro-astacin is incapable of autoactivation, and completely resistant to cleavage by mature astacin. However, this mutant is cleaved by Astacus trypsin within the pro-peptide. This probably reflects the in vivo situation, where Astacus trypsin and astacin work together during pro-astacin activation. In a first step, trypsin produces amino-terminally truncated pro-astacin derivatives. These are trimmed subsequently by each other and by astacin to yield the mature amino terminus, which forms a salt-bridge with Glu103 in the active site. The disruption of this salt-bridge in the mutants E103A and E103Q results in extremely heat labile proteins, whose catalytic activities are not altered drastically, however. This supports a concept according to which the linkage of Glu103 to the precisely trimmed amino terminus is a crucial structural prerequisite throughout the astacin family.
