synthetic ecology of microbes mathematical models and applications
as the indispensable role of natural microbial communities in many aspects of life on earth is uncovered the bottom up engineering of synthetic microbial consortia with novel functions is becoming an attractive alternative to engineering single species systems here we summarize recent work on synthetic microbial communities with a particular emphasis on open challenges and opportunities in environmental sustainability and human health we next provide a critical overview of mathematical approaches ranging from phenomenological to mechanistic to decipher the principles that govern the function dynamics and evolution of microbial ecosystems finally we present our outlook on key aspects of microbial ecosystems and synthetic ecology that require further developments including the need for more efficient computational algorithms a better integration of empirical methods and model driven analysis the importance of improving gene function annotation and the value of a standardized library of well characterized organisms to be used as building blocks of synthetic communities
