vimentin coil a  a molecular switch involved in the initiation of filament elongation
interestingly our previously published structure of the coil a fragment of the human intermediate filament protein vimentin turned out to be a monomeric  helical coil instead of the expected dimeric coiled coil however the  amino acid long helix had an intrinsic curvature compatible with a coiled coil we have now designed four mutants of vimentin coil a modifying key a and d positions in the heptad repeat pattern with the aim of investigating the molecular criteria that are needed to stabilize a dimeric coiled coil structure we have analysed the biophysical properties of the mutants by circular dichroism spectroscopy analytical ultracentrifugation and x ray crystallography all four mutants exhibited an increased stability over the wild type as indicated by a rise in the melting temperature tm  at a concentration of   mg ml the tm of the peptide with the single point mutation y  l increased dramatically by    c compared with the wild type peptide in general the introduction of a single stabilizing point mutation at an a or a d position did induce the formation of a stable dimer as demonstrated by sedimentation equilibrium experiments the dimeric oligomerisation state of the y  l peptide was furthermore confirmed by x ray crystallography which yielded a structure with a genuine coiled coil geometry most notably when this mutation was introduced into full length vimentin filament assembly was completely arrested at the unit length filament ulf level both in vitro and in cdna transfected cultured cells therefore the low propensity of the wild type coil a to form a stable two stranded coiled coil is most likely a prerequisite for the end to end annealing of ulfs into filaments accordingly the coil a domains might  switch  from a dimeric  helical coiled coil into a more open structure thus mediating within the ulfs the conformational rearrangements of the tetrameric subunits that are needed for the intermediate filament elongation reaction
