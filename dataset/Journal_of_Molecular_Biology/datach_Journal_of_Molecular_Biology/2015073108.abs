crystal structure of human dna methyltransferase
dnmt  dna methyltransferase  is responsible for propagating the dna methylation patterns during dna replication dnmt contains in addition to a c terminal methyltransferase domain a large n terminal regulatory region that is composed of an rfts replication foci targeting sequence domain a cxxc zinc finger domain and a pair of bah bromo adjacent homology domains the regulatory domains of dnmt mediate a network of protein  protein and protein  dna interactions to control the recruitment and enzymatic activity of dnmt  here we report the crystal structure of human dnmt with all the structural domains hdnmt  residues       in complex with s adenosyl l homocysteine at    resolution the rfts domain directly associates with the methyltransferase domain thereby inhibiting the substrate binding of hdnmt  through structural analysis mutational biochemical and enzymatic studies we further identify that a linker sequence between the cxxc and bah domains aside from its role in the cxxc domain mediated dnmt autoinhibition serves as an important regulatory element in the rfts domain mediated autoinhibition in comparison with the previously determined structure of mouse dnmt  this study also reveals a number of distinct structural features that may underlie subtle functional diversity observed for the two orthologues in addition this structure provides a framework for understanding the functional consequence of disease related hdnmt mutations
