cullin e ligase activity is required for myoblast differentiation
the role of cullin e ubiquitin ligases for muscle homeostasis is best known during muscle atrophy as the cullin  substrate adaptor atrogin  is among the most well characterized muscle atrogins we investigated whether cullin activity was also crucial during terminal myoblast differentiation and aggregation of acetylcholine receptors for the establishment of neuromuscular junctions in vitro the activity of cullin e ligases is modulated through post translational modification with the small ubiquitin like modifier nedd  using either the nae inhibitor mln   pevonedistat or sirna against nedd in early or late stages of differentiation on c c  myoblasts and primary satellite cells from mouse and human we show that cullin e ligase activity is necessary for each step of the muscle cell differentiation program in vitro we further investigate known transcriptional repressors for terminal muscle differentiation namely zbtb  bhlhe  and id  due to their identified roles for terminal muscle differentiation we hypothesize that the accumulation of these potential cullin e ligase substrates may be partially responsible for the observed phenotype mln   is currently undergoing clinical trials in cancer patients and our experiments highlight concerns on the homeostasis and regenerative capacity of muscles in these patients who often experience cachexia
