the em structure of a type i interferon  receptor complex reveals a novel mechanism for cytokine signaling
type i interferons ifns have pleiotropic effects including antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory responses all type i ifns bind to a shared receptor consisting of the two transmembrane proteins ifnar and ifnar  we used negative stain electron microscopy to calculate a three dimensional reconstruction of the ternary complex formed by a triple mutant ifn   with the ectodomains of ifnar and ifnar  we present a model of the complex obtained by placing atomic models of subunits into the density map of the complex the complex of ifn   with its receptor a class ii cytokine receptor shows structural similarities to the complexes formed by growth hormone and erythropoietin with their receptors members of the class i cytokine receptor family  despite different assembly mechanisms class i and class ii cytokine receptors thus appear to initiate signaling through similar arrangements of the receptors induced by the binding of their respective ligands
