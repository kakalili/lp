synapsis of tn recombination sites unpaired sites destabilize synapses by a partner exchange mechanism
catalysis of site specific recombination is preceded by the formation of a synapse comprising two dna sites and multiple subunits of the recombinase together with other  accessory  proteins in some cases we investigated the stability of synapses of tn resolvase bound res recombination sites in plasmids containing either two or three res sites although synapses are long lived in plasmids with just two res sites persisting for tens of minutes a synapse of any two sites is relatively short lived in plasmids with three res sites the three alternative pairwise synapses that can be formed in three res plasmids re assort rapidly relative to the rate of recombination we propose a  partner exchange  mechanism for this re assortment involving direct attack on a synapse by an unpaired res site this mechanism reconciles studies on selective synapsis in multi res substrates which imply rapid interchange of synaptic pairings with studies indicating that synapses of two tn res sites are stable
