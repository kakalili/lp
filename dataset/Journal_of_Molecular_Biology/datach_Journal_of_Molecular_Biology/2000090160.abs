selection of tumor specific internalizing human antibodies from phage libraries edited by j karn
antibody internalization into the cell is required for many targeted therapeutics such as immunotoxins immunoliposomes antibody drug conjugates and for targeted delivery of genes or viral dna into cells to generate directly tumor specific internalizing antibodies a non immune single chain fv scfv phage antibody library was selected on the breast tumor cell line skbr  internalized phage were recovered from within the cell and used for the next round of selection after three rounds of selection    of clones analyzed bound skbr and other tumor cells but did not bind normal human cells of the internalizing scfv identified two f and c  were identified as binding to erbb  and one h  to the transferrin receptor both f and h scfv were efficiently endocytosed into skbr cells both as phage antibodies and as native monomeric scfv both antibodies were able to induce additional functional effects besides triggering endocytosis f scfv induces downstream signaling through the erbb receptor and h prevents transferrin binding to the transferrin receptor and inhibits cell growth the results demonstrate the feasibility of selecting internalizing receptor specific antibodies directly from phage libraries by panning on cells such antibodies can be used to target a variety of molecules into the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect furthermore in some instances endocytosis serves as a surrogate marker for other therapeutic biologic effects such as growth inhibition thus a subset of selected antibodies will have a direct therapeutic effect
