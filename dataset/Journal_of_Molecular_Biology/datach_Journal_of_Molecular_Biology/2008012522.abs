structure of antibody f  b e in complex with a v peptide reveals a new binding mode for hiv  neutralization
f  b e  b e  is a monoclonal antibody isolated from a human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  infected individual that recognizes the v variable loop on the gp  subunit of the viral envelope spike b e neutralizes a subset of hiv  primary isolates from subtypes b c and d which places this antibody among the very few human anti v antibodies with notable cross neutralizing activity here the crystal structure of the b e fab  fragment in complex with a  mer v peptide rp   at     resolution is described the complex structure reveals that the antibody recognizes a novel v loop conformation featuring a five residue  turn around the conserved gpgra apex of the  hairpin loop in agreement with previous mutagenesis analyses the fab  interacts primarily with v through side chain contacts with just two residues ilep  and argp   while the remaining contacts are to the main chain the structure helps explain how b e can tolerate a certain degree of sequence variation within v and hence is able to neutralize an appreciable number of different hiv  isolates
