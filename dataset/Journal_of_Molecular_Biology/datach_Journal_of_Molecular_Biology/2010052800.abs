lim domain binding proteins  and  have different oligomeric states
lim domain binding ldb proteins are important regulators of lim homeodomain and lim only proteins that specify cell fate in many different tissues an essential feature of these proteins is the ability to self associate but there have been no studies that characterise the nature of this self association we have used deletion mutagenesis with yeast two hybrid analysis to define the minimal self association domains of ldb and ldb as residues     and      respectively we then used a range of different biophysical methods including sedimentation equilibrium and small angle x ray scattering to show that ldb     forms a trimer and ldb     undergoes a monomer  tetramer  octamer equilibrium where the association in each case is of moderate affinity     m    these modes of association represent a clear physical difference between these two proteins that otherwise appear to have very similar properties the levels of association are more complex than previously assumed and emphasise roles of avidity and dna looping in transcriptional regulation by ldb lim protein complexes the abilities of ldb and ldb to form trimers and higher oligomers respectively should be considered in models of transcriptional regulation by ldb containing complexes in a wide range of biological processes
