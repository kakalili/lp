architecture of the streptomyces lividans dnaa protein replication origin complexes edited by j karn
the streptomyces oric region contains two clusters of  dnaa boxes separated by a spacer   bp  the streptomyces dnaa protein consists like all other dnaa proteins of four domains domain iii and the carboxyterminal part domain iv are responsible for binding of atp and dna respectively binding of the dnaa protein to the entire oric region analysed by electron microscopy showed that the dnaa protein forms separate complexes at each of the clusters of dnaa boxes but not at the spacer separating them in vivo mutational analysis revealed that the number of dnaa boxes and the presence of the spacer linking both groups of dnaa boxes seem to be important for a functional streptomyces origin we suggest that the arrangement of dnaa boxes allows the dna bound dnaa protein to induce bending and looping of the oric region as it was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and  one hybrid system   two domains i and iii facilitate interactions between dnaa molecules we postulate that domain i and domain iii could be involved in cooperativity at distant and at closely spaced dnaa boxes respectively the long domain ii extends the range over which n termini domain i of dna bound dnaa protein can form dimers thus interactions between dnaa molecules may bring two clusters of dnaa boxes separated by the spacer into functional contact by loop formation removal of the spacer region or deletion of domains i and ii resulted respectively in nucleoprotein complexes which are not fully developed or huge nucleoprotein aggregates
