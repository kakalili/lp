the extended multidomain solution structures of the complement protein crry and its chimeric conjugate crry ig by scattering analytical ultracentrifugation and constrained modelling implications for function and therapy
complement receptor related gene protein y crry is a cell membrane bound regulator of complement activation found in mouse and rat crry contains only short complement consensus repeat scr domains x ray and neutron scattering was performed on recombinant rat crry containing the first five scr domains rcrry and mouse crry with five scr domains conjugated to the fc fragment of mouse igg  mcrry ig in order to determine their solution structures at medium resolution the radius of gyration rg of rcrry was determined to be      nm and the rg of the cross section was      nm as determined by x ray and neutron scattering the rg of mcrry ig was      nm and the rg of the cross section were      nm and   nm the maximum dimension of rcrry was  nm and that for mcrry ig was  nm the neutron data indicated that rcrry and mcrry ig have molecular mass values of    da and    da respectively in agreement with their sequences and sedimentation equilibrium data supported these determinations time derivative velocity experiments gave sedimentation coefficients of  s for rcrry and  s for mcrry ig a medium resolution model of rcrry was determined using homology models that were constructed for the first five scr domains of crry from known crystal and nmr structures and linked by randomly generated linker peptide conformations these trial and error calculations revealed a small family of extended rcrry structures that best accounted for the scattering and ultracentrifugation data these were shorter than the most extended rcrry models as the result of minor bends in the inter scr orientations the mcrry ig solution data were modelled starting from a fixed structure for rcrry and the crystal structure of mouse igg  and was based on conformational searches of the hinge peptide joining the mcrry and fc fragments the best fit models showed that the two mcrry antennae in mcrry ig were extended from the fc fragment no preferred orientation of the antennae was identified and this indicated that the accessibility of the antennae for the molecular targets c b and c b was not affected by the covalent link to fc a structural comparison between crry and complement receptor type  indicated that the domain arrangement of crry scr   is as extended as that of the cr scr    nmr structure
