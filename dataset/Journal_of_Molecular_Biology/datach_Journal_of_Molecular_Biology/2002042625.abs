crystal structure of the alcohol dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus at    resolution
the crystal structure of a medium chain nad h dependent alcohol dehydrogenase adh from an archaeon has been solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction using a selenomethionine substituted enzyme the protein ssadh  extracted from the hyperthermophilic organism sulfolobus solfataricus is a homo tetramer with a crystallographic   symmetry despite the low level of sequence identity the overall fold of the monomer is similar to that of the other homologous adhs of known structure however a significant difference is the orientation of the catalytic domain relative to the coenzyme binding domain that results in a larger interdomain cleft at the bottom of this cleft the catalytic zinc ion is coordinated tetrahedrally and lacks the zinc bound water molecule that is usually found in adh apoform structures the fourth coordination position is indeed occupied by a glu residue as found in bacterial tetrameric adhs other differences are found in the architecture of the substrate pocket whose entrance is more restricted than in other adhs ssadh is the first tetrameric adh x ray structure containing a second zinc ion playing a structural role this latter metal ion shows a peculiar coordination with a glutamic acid residue replacing one of the four cysteine ligands that are highly conserved throughout the structural zinc containing dimeric adhs
