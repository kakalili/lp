sensory mechanism of oxygen sensor fixl from rhizobium meliloti crystallographic mutagenesis and resonance raman spectroscopic studies edited by k nagai
fixl of rhizobium meliloti rmfixl is a sensor histidine kinase of the two component system which regulates the expression of the genes related to nitrogen fixation in the root nodule in response to the o levels the crystal structure of the sensor domain of fixl rmfixlh  which contains a heme fe porphyrin as a sensing site was determined at    resolution based on the structural and spectroscopic analyses we propose the o sensing mechanism that differs from the case proposed in bjfixlh as follows conformational changes in the f g loop which are induced by steric repulsion between the bent bound o and the ile  side chain would be transmitted to the histidine kinase domain interaction between the iron bound o and ile  was also observed in the resonance raman spectra of rmfixlh as evidenced by the fact that the fe o and fe cn stretching frequencies were shifted from   to   cm   fe o  and   to   cm   respectively as the result of the replacement of ile  with an ala residue in the i  a mutant of rmfixl the o sensing activity was destroyed thus confirming our proposed mechanism
