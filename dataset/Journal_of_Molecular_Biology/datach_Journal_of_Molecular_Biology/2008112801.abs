mechanism of copper activated transcription activation of ap  and the jnk sapk and p  signal transduction pathways
copper is an essential metal that is able to produce reactive oxygen species and to induce intracellular oxidative stress several studies have examined the effects of excessive copper and oxidative stress on various organisms and tissues but few have addressed the molecular mechanisms by which copper affects transcription our results demonstrated that in cos  cells copper treatment caused an increase in the binding of nuclear proteins to activating protein  and antioxidant response elements the level of copper inducible nuclear protein binding was modulated by increasing or decreasing the level of intracellular oxidative stress copper exposure also led to an increase in the steady state levels of c fos c jun and c myc mrnas exposure to copper resulted in an increase in the levels of phosphorylation and activation of the c jun n terminal kinase stress activated protein kinase and p  pathways the activation of these pathways resulted in a concomitant increase in c jun phosphorylation we investigated the hypothesis that copper induced oxidative stress leads to the formation of stable lipid peroxidation by products that activate mitogen activated protein kinase mapk pathways ultimately affecting transcription while exposure did result in the production of  hydroxynonenal the timing of the increased levels of proto oncogene mrna phosphorylation of c jun and phosphorylation and activation of mapks as well as the inability of the lipophilic antioxidant vitamin e to abrogate mapk phosphorylation suggest that the formation of stable lipid peroxidation by products may not be the primary mechanism by which copper activates mapks these results further elucidate the effects of copper on signal transduction pathways to alter gene expression
