redor nmr characterization of dna packaging in bacteriophage t
bacteriophage t is a large tailed escherichia coli virus whose capsid is     nm atp driven dna packaging of the t capsid results in the loading of a   kb genome in less than  min during viral infection we have isolated  mg quantities of uniform  n and    n lysine labeled bacteriophage t  we have also introduced  nh  into filled unlabeled capsids from synthetic medium by exchange we have examined lyo and cryoprotected lyophilized t using  n  p and  p  n rotational echo double resonance the results of these experiments have shown that i packaged dna is in an unperturbed duplex b form conformation  ii the dna phosphate negative charge is balanced by lysyl amines     polyamines     and monovalent cations    and iii   of lysyl amines   of  nh groups of polyamines and   of monovalent cations within the lyophilized t capsid are involved in the dna charge balance the nmr evidence suggests that dna enters the t capsid in a charge unbalanced state we propose that electrostatic interactions may provide free energy to supplement the nanomotor driven t dna packaging
