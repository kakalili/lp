base flipping by mterf can accommodate multiple conformations and occurs in a stepwise fashion
human mitochondrial transcription termination occurs within the leu trna gene and is mediated by the dna binding protein mterf  the crystal structure of mterf bound to the canonical termination sequence reveals a rare base flipping event that involves the eversion of three nucleotides these nucleotides are stabilized by stacking interactions with three mterf residues which are essential not only for base flipping but also for termination activity to further understand the mechanism of base flipping we examined each of the individual stacking interactions in structural energetic and functional detail individual substitutions of arg   tyr  and phe  have revealed unequal contributions to overall termination activity furthermore our work identifies an important role for phe  in the base flipping mechanism and we demonstrate how phe  and phe  are important for coupling base flipping between the heavy and light strand dna chains we propose a stepwise model for the base flipping process that recapitulates our observations finally we show that mterf has the ability to accommodate alternate active conformations the adaptability of base flipping has implications for mterf function and for the putative function of mterf at alternative binding sites in human mitochondria
