glucose and type a protein phosphatase regulate the interaction between catalytic and regulatory subunits of amp activated protein kinase
we have expressed in yeast the different subunits of amp activated protein kinase ampk and by using the two hybrid system we have found a glucose regulated interaction between   catalytic and   regulatory subunits this regulation was not affected by known regulators of the corresponding yeast orthologue the snf complex such as reg or hxk  but it was affected by deletion of regulatory subunits of yeast type a protein phosphatase pp a complex we have also found that tpd and pr   the corresponding yeast and mammalian a subunits of pp a interacted with ampk  both in yeast and mammals respectively this interaction occurred only through the regulatory domain of this subunit these results suggested a direct involvement of pp a complex in regulating the interaction between ampk   and   in a glucose dependent manner
