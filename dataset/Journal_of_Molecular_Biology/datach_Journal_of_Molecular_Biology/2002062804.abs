production of functional single chain fv antibodies in the cytoplasm of escherichia coli
production of intracellular antibodies in escherichia coli has been thought unlikely owing to an inability to form stable disulfide bonds in the cytoplasm a necessary step in the folding of most immunoglobulin ig domains this work investigates whether e coli strains carrying mutations in the major intracellular disulfide bond reduction systems i e the thioredoxin and the glutathione glutaredoxin pathways allow the oxidation and folding of single chain variable fragment scfv antibodies in the cytoplasm the effect of the co expression of disulfide bond chaperones in these cells was also examined an scfv that recognizes the alternative sigma factor   was used as a model to investigate disulfide bond formation and the folding of ig domains in e coli the results demonstrate that functional intrabodies with oxidized disulfide bonds in their ig domains are produced efficiently in e coli cells carrying mutations in the glutathione oxidoreductase gor and the thioredoxin reductase trxb genes and co expressing a signal sequence less derivative of the disulfide bond isomerase dsbc  ssdsbc  we obtained evidence indicating that  ssdsbc acts as a chaperone promoting the correct folding and oxidation of scfvs
