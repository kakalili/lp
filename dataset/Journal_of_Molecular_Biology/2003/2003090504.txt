An in vitro enzyme selection that can, in principle, be generalised to most chemical reactions, is described. It makes use of filamentous phage display and of a tailor-made antibody fragment directed against the reaction product. The conversion of ATP into 3′,5′-cyclic AMP catalysed by Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase is taken as an example.
