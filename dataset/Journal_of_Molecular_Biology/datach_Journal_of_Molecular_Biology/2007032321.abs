dynamics of conformational changes of arabidopsis phototropin  lov with the linker domain
conformational changes of arabidopsis phot lov with the linker phot lov linker were investigated from the viewpoint of the changes in molecular volume and molecular diffusion coefficient d by time resolved transient grating tg and transient lens trl methods although the absorption spectrum change completes within a few microseconds the d value detected by the tg method decreased drastically with a time constant of   ms from           m s to           m s this time dependent d was interpreted in terms of the unfolding of  helices in the linker region the change of the  helices was confirmed by observing the recovery of the circular dichroism intensity the trl signal showed that the molecular volume decreases with two time constants     s and   ms the former time constant is close to the previously observed photo dissociation reaction rate of the phot lov  without the linker dimer and the latter one agrees well with the rate of the d change considering a similar time constant of the dissociation reaction of the lov dimer we interpreted these kinetics in terms of the dissociation step of the linker region from the lov domain t  pre state  after this step the protein volume and d are decreased significantly with the lifetime of   ms the d decrease indicates the increase of the intermolecular interaction between the protein and water molecules on the basis of these observations a two step mechanism of the linker unfolding is proposed
