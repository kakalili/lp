rigidification of a flexible protease inhibitor variant upon binding to trypsin
the tyr   gly replacement in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti has previously been shown to dramatically enhance the flexibility of the trypsin binding region of the free inhibitor and to destabilize the interaction with the protease by about  kcal mol the effects of this replacement on the enzyme inhibitor interaction were further studied here by x ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry itc  the co crystal structure of y g bpti bound to trypsin was determined using     resolution x ray diffraction data collected from cryopreserved crystals and a new structure of the complex with wild type bpti under the same conditions was determined using     data these structures reveal that in contrast to the free protein y g bpti adopts a conformation nearly identical with that of the wild type protein with a water filled cavity in place of the missing tyr side chain the crystallographic temperature factors for the two complexes indicate that the mutant inhibitor is nearly as rigid as the wild type protein when bound to trypsin calorimetric measurements show that the change in enthalpy upon dissociation of the complex is   kcal mol less favorable for the complex containing y g bpti than for the complex with the wild type inhibitor thus the destabilization of the complex resulting from the y g replacement is due to a more favorable change in entropy upon dissociation the heat capacity changes for dissociation of the mutant and wild type complexes were very similar suggesting that the entropic effects probably do not arise from solvation effects but are more likely due to an increase in protein conformational entropy upon dissociation of the mutant inhibitor these results define the biophysical role of a highly conserved core residue located outside of a protein binding interface demonstrating that tyr  has little impact on the trypsin bound bpti structure and acts primarily to define the structure of the free protein so as to maximize binding affinity
