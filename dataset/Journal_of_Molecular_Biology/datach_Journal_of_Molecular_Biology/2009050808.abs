hiv  reverse transcriptase can simultaneously engage its dna rna substrate at both dna polymerase and rnase h active sites implications for rnase h inhibition
reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus possesses dna polymerase and ribonuclease rnase h activities although the nucleic acid binding cleft separating these domains can accommodate structurally diverse duplexes it is currently unknown whether regular dna rna hybrids can simultaneously contact both active sites in this study we demonstrate that ligands capable of trapping the   end of the primer at the polymerase active site affect the specificity of rnase h cleavage without altering the efficiency of the reaction experiments under single turnover conditions reveal that complexes with a bound nucleotide substrate show specific rnase h cleavage at template position    while complexes with the pyrophosphate analogue foscarnet show a specific cut at position    this pattern is indicative of post translocated and pre translocated conformations the data are inconsistent with models postulating that the substrate toggles between both active sites such that the primer   terminus is disengaged from the polymerase active site when the template is in contact with the rnase h active site in contrast our findings provide strong evidence to suggest that the nucleic acid substrate can engage both active sites at the same time as a consequence the bound and intact dna rna hybrid can restrict access of rnase h active site inhibitors we have mapped the binding site of the recently discovered inhibitor  thujaplicinol between the rnase h active site and y  of the rnase h primer grip and have shown that the inhibitor is unable to bind to a preformed reverse transcriptase dna rna complex in conclusion the bound nucleic acid substrate and in turn active dna synthesis can represent an obstacle to rnase h inhibition with compounds that bind to the rnase h active site
