non enveloped virus entry structural determinants and mechanism of functioning of a viral lytic peptide
in the absence of lipid envelopes and associated fusion proteins non enveloped viruses employ membrane lytic peptides to breach the limiting membranes of host cells although several of these lytic peptides have been identified and characterized their manner of deployment and interaction with host membranes remains unclear in most cases we are using the gamma peptide of flock house virus fhv  a model non enveloped virus to understand the mechanistic details of non enveloped virus interaction with host cell membranes we utilized a combination of biophysical assays molecular dynamics simulation studies and single particle cryo electron microscopy to elucidate the functional and structural determinants for membrane penetration by gamma in context of the fhv capsid although the amphipathic helical n terminal region of gamma    was previously thought to be the membrane penetrating module with the c terminal region having a supporting role in correct structural positioning of   we demonstrate that the c terminus of gamma directly participates in membrane penetration our studies suggest that full length gamma including the hydrophobic c terminus forms an alpha helical hairpin motif and any disruption in this motif drastically reduces its functionality in spite of the correct positioning of amphipathic   in the virus capsid taken together our data suggest that the most effective module for membrane disruption is a pentameric unit of full length gamma released from the virus which associates with membranes via both n and c terminal ends
