synuclein selectively binds to anionic phospholipids embedded in liquid disordered domains
previous studies indicate that binding of  synuclein to membranes is critical for its physiological function and the development of parkinson s disease pd  here we have investigated the association of fluorescence labeled  synuclein variants with different types of giant unilamellar vesicles using confocal microscopy we found that  synuclein binds with high affinity to anionic phospholipids when they are embedded in a liquid disordered as opposed to a liquid ordered environment this indicates that not only electrostatic forces but also lipid packing and hydrophobic interactions are critical for the association of  synuclein with membranes in vitro when compared to wild type  synuclein the disease causing  synuclein variant a p bound less efficiently to anionic phospholipids while the variant e k showed enhanced binding this suggests that the natural association of  synuclein with membranes is altered in the inherited forms of parkinson s disease
