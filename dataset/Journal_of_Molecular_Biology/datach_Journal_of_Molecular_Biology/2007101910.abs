a conformational unfolding reaction activates phage fd for the infection of escherichia coli
unfolding usually leads to the loss of the biological function of a protein here we show that an unfolding reaction activates the gene  protein of the filamentous phage fd for its function during the infection of escherichia coli before infection the gene  protein is in a fully folded locked form in which the binding site for the phage receptor tola is buried at the domain interface to expose this binding site the gene  protein must be activated and previously we identified the cis to trans isomerization at pro  in the hinge region between the two domains as a key step of activation we now report that pro  isomerization destabilizes the protein and leads to a loss of folded structure presumably in the hinge region the partially unfolded form of the gene  protein is metastable and trans pro  arrests the protein in this activated form for an extended time long enough to find the receptor tola the partial unfolding and its timing by prolyl isomerization are essential for the biological function
