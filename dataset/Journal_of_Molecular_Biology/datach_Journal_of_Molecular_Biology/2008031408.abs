the catalytic subunit of human protein kinase ck structurally deviates from its maize homologue in complex with the nucleotide competitive inhibitor emodin
the ser thr kinase ck  former name casein kinase  is a heterotetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic chains ck   attached to a dimer of noncatalytic subunits together with the cyclin dependent kinases and the mitogen activated protein kinases ck  belongs to the cmgc family of the eukaryotic protein kinases ck is an important survival and stability factor in eukaryotic cells its catalytic activity is elevated in a wide variety of tumors while its down regulation can lead to apoptosis thus ck is a valuable target for drug development and for chemical biology approaches of cell biological research and small organic inhibitors addressing ck are of considerable interest we describe here the complex structure between a c terminal deletion mutant of human ck  and the atp competitive inhibitor emodin    trihydroxy  methylanthraquinone international union of pure and applied chemistry name    trihydroxy  methylanthracene   dione and compare it with a previously published complex structure of emodin and maize ck   with a resolution of     the human ck  emodin structure has a much better resolution than its maize counterpart      even more important in spite of a sequence identity of more than   between human and maize ck   the two structures deviate significantly in the orientation in which emodin is trapped by the enzyme and in the local conformations around the ligand binding site maize ck  shows its largest adaptations in the atp binding loop whereas human ck  shows its largest adaptations in the hinge region connecting the two main domains of the protein kinase core these observations emphasize the importance of local plasticity for ligand binding and demonstrate that two orthologues of an enzyme can behave quite different in this respect
