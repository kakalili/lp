binding hot spots in the tem  blip interface in light of its modular architecture
proteins bind one another in aqua  s solution to form tight and specific complexes previously we have shown that this is achieved through the modular architecture of the interaction network formed by the interface residues where tight cooperative interactions are found within modules but not between them here we extend this study to cover the entire interface of tem   lactamase and its protein inhibitor blip using an improved method for deriving interaction maps based on reduce to add hydrogen atoms and then by evaluating the interactions using modifications of the programs probe nci and pare an extensive mutagenesis study of the interface residues indeed showed that each module is energetically independent on other modules and that cooperativity is found only within a module by solving the x ray structure of two interface mutations affecting two different modules we demonstrated that protein protein binding occur via the structural reorganization of the binding modules either by a  lock and key  or an induced fit mechanism to explain the cooperativity within a module we performed multiple mutant cycle analysis of cluster  resulting in a high resolution energy map of this module mutant studies are usually done in reference to alanine which can be regarded as a deletion of a side chain however from a biological perspective there is a major interest to understand non ala substitutions as they are most common using x ray crystallography and multiple mutant cycle analysis we demonstrated the added complexity in understanding non ala mutations here a double mutation replacing the wild type glu tyr to tyr asn on tem  res id     caused a major backbone structural rearrangement of blip changing the composition of two modules but not of other modules within the interface this shows the robustness of the modular approach yet demonstrates the complexity of in silico protein design
