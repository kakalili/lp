the tropomyosin binding region of cardiac troponin t modulates crossbridge recruitment dynamics in rat cardiac muscle fibers
the cardiac muscle comprises dynamically interacting components that use allosteric cooperative mechanisms to yield unique heart specific properties an essential protein in this allosteric cooperative mechanism is cardiac muscle troponin t ctnt  the central region cr and the t region of which differ significantly from those of fast skeletal muscle troponin t fstnt  to understand the biological significance of such sequence heterogeneity we replaced the t or t domain of rat ctnt rct or rct  with its counterpart from rat fstnt rfst or rfst  to generate rfst rct and rct rfst recombinant proteins in addition to contractile function measurements dynamic features of rfst rct  and rct rfst reconstituted rat cardiac muscle fibers were captured by fitting the recruitment  distortion model to the force response of small amplitude    muscle length changes rfst rct fibers showed a   decrease in tension and a   decrease in atpase activity but rct rfst fibers were unaffected the magnitude of length mediated increase in crossbridge xb recruitment e  decreased by   and the speed of xb recruitment b increased by    in rfst rct fibers our data suggest the following   the cr of ctnt modulates xb recruitment dynamics   the n terminal end region of ctnt has a synergistic effect on the ability of the cr to modulate xb recruitment dynamics   the t region is important for tuning the ca  regulation of cardiac thin filaments the combined effects of cr  tropomyosin interactions and the modulating effect of the n terminal end of ctnt on cr  tropomyosin interactions may lead to the emergence of a unique property that tunes contractile dynamics to heart rates
