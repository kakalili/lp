structure of rhamnose binding lectin csl  unique pseudo tetrameric architecture of a pattern recognition protein
the crystal structure of the l rhamnose binding lectin csl was determined to    resolution this protein is a component of the germline encoded pattern recognition proteins in innate immunity csl is a homodimer of two   kda subunits with a dumbbell like shape overall in which the n and c terminal domains of different subunits form lobe structures connected with flexible linker peptides the complex structures of the protein with specific carbohydrates demonstrated the importance of the most variable loop region among homologues for the specificity toward oligosaccharides csl and shiga like toxin both use gb as a cellular receptor to evoke apoptosis they have very different overall architecture but share the separation distance between carbohydrate binding sites an inspection of the structure database suggested that the pseudo tetrameric structure of csl was unique among the known lectins this architecture implies this protein might provide a unique tool for further investigations into the relationships between architecture and function of pattern recognition proteins
