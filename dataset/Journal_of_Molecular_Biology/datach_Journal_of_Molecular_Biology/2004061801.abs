compensatory energetic mechanisms mediating the assembly of signaling complexes between interleukin  and its     and  c receptors
interleukin  is a key immuno regulatory cytokine whose actions are mediated by three different cell surface receptors the    and the  common     c chains we have undertaken a complete thermodynamic characterization of the stepwise assembly cycle for multiple possible combinations of the receptor  ligand and receptor  receptor interactions that are necessary for formation of the high affinity il     c signaling complex we find an entropically favorable high affinity interaction between il  and its  receptor a moderately entropically favorable low affinity interaction between il  and its  receptor and no interaction between il  and the shared receptor  c formation of the stable intermediate trimolecular complexes of il  with  and  receptors as well as il  with  and  c receptors proceeds through enthalpy  entropy compensation mechanisms surprisingly we see a moderate affinity interaction between the unliganded receptor  and  chains suggesting that a preformed   complex may serve as the initial interaction complex for il  reconstitution of the il  r   c high affinity quaternary signaling complex shows it to be assembled through cooperative energetics to form a     assembly collectively the favorable entropy of the bimolecular interactions appears to be offset by the loss in rigid body entropy of the receptor components in the higher order complexes but overcome by the formation of increasingly enthalpically favorable composite interfaces this enthalpic mechanism utilized by  c contrasts with the favorable entropic mechanism utilized by gp  for degenerate cytokine interaction in conclusion we find that several energetically redundant pathways exist for formation of il  receptor signaling complexes suggesting a more complex equilibrium on the cell surface than has been previously appreciated
