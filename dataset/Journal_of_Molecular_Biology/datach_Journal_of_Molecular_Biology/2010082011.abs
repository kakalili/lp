interactions of the melanocortin  receptor with the peptide agonist ndp msh
melanocortin  receptor mc r has an important regulatory role in energy homeostasis and food intake peptide agonists of the mc r are characterized by the conserved sequence his phe arg trp  which is crucial for their interaction with the receptor this investigation utilized the covalent attachment approach to identify receptor residues in close proximity to the bound ligand nle d phe melanocyte stimulating hormone ndp msh  thereby differentiating between residues directly involved in ligand binding and those mutations that compromise ligand binding by inducing conformational changes in the receptor also recent x ray structures of g protein coupled receptors were utilized to refine a model of human mc r in the active state r   which was used to generate a better understanding of the binding mode of the ligand ndp msh at the atomic level the mutation of residues in the human mc r  such as leu  of extracellular loop  and asp   ile   and asp  of transmembrane tm helix  his   tm  and met   tm   to cys residues produced definitive indications of proximity to the side chains of residues in the core region of the peptide ligand of particular interest was the contact between d phe on the ligand and ile  of tm on the mc r additionally met   tm  equivalent to lys    ballesteros numbering scheme involved in covalently attaching retinal in rhodopsin is shown to be in close proximity to trp for the first time the interactions between the terminal regions of ndp msh and the receptor are described the amino terminus appears to be adjacent to a series of hydrophilic residues with novel interactions at cys   tm  and asp   extracellular loop   these interactions are reminiscent of sequential ligand binding exhibited by the   adrenergic receptor with the former interaction being equivalent to the known interaction involving ser  of the   adrenergic receptor
