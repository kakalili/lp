in meso structure of the cobalamin transporter btub at     resolution
crystals of the apo form of the vitamin b  and colicin receptor btub that diffract to     have been grown by the membrane based in meso technique the structure of the protein differs in several details from that of its counterpart grown by the more traditional detergent based in surfo method some of these differences include i the five n terminal residues are resolved in meso  ii residues     in the hatch domain and residues      in loop     are disordered in meso and are ordered in surfo  iii residues      in loop    are resolved in meso  iv residues      in loop          in loop          in loop     and      in loop     have large differences in position between the two crystal forms as have residues     in the hatch domain and v the conformation of residues  and  in the ton box considered critical to signal transduction and substrate transport are entirely different in the two structures importantly the in meso orientation of residues  and  is similar to that of the vitamin b  charged state these data suggest that the  substrate induced      rotation of residues  and  reported in the literature may not be a unique signalling event the extent to which these findings agree with structural dynamic and functional insights gleaned from site directed spin labelling and electron paramagnetic resonance measurements is evaluated packing in in meso grown crystals is dense and layered consistent with the current model for crystallogenesis of membrane proteins in lipidic mesophases layered packing has been used to locate the transmembrane hydrophobic surface of the protein generally this is consistent with tryptophan tyrosine lipid and c  b factor distributions in the protein and with predictions based on transfer free energy calculations
