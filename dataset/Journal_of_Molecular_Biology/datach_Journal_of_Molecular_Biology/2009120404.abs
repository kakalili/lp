single molecule force spectroscopy measures structural changes induced by light activation and transducer binding in sensory rhodopsin ii
microbial rhodopsins are a family of seven helical transmembrane proteins containing retinal as chromophore sensory rhodopsin ii srii triggers two very different responses upon light excitation depending on the presence or the absence of its cognate transducer htrii whereas light activation of the npsrii nphtrii complex activates a signalling cascade that initiates the photophobic response npsrii alone acts as a proton pump using single molecule force spectroscopy we analysed the stability of npsrii and its complex with the transducer in the dark and under illumination by improving force spectroscopic data analysis we were able to reveal the localisation of occurring forces within the protein chain with a resolution of about six amino acids distinct regions in helices g and f were affected differently depending on the experimental conditions the results are generally in line with previous data on the molecular stability of npsrii interestingly new interaction sites were identified upon light activation whose functional importance is discussed in detail
