beyond synexpression relationships local clustering of time shifted and inverted gene expression profiles identifies new biologically relevant interactions edited by f cohen
the complexity of biological systems provides for a great diversity of relationships between genes the current analysis of whole genome expression data focuses on relationships based on global correlation over a whole time course identifying clusters of genes whose expression levels simultaneously rise and fall there are of course other potential relationships between genes which are missed by such global clustering these include activation where one expects a time delay between related expression profiles and inhibition where one expects an inverted relationship here we propose a new method which we call local clustering for identifying these time delayed and inverted relationships it is related to conventional gene expression clustering in a fashion analogous to the way local sequence alignment the smith waterman algorithm is derived from global alignment needleman wunsch  an integral part of our method is the use of random score distributions to assess the statistical significance of each cluster we applied our method to the yeast cell cycle expression dataset and were able to detect a considerable number of additional biological relationships between genes beyond those resulting from conventional correlation we related these new relationships between genes to their similarity in function as determined from the mips scheme or their having known protein protein interactions as determined from the large scale two hybrid experiment  we found that genes strongly related by local clustering were considerably more likely than random to have a known interaction or a similar cellular role this suggests that local clustering may be useful in functional annotation of uncharacterized genes we examined many of the new relationships in detail some of them were already well documented examples of inhibition or activation which provide corroboration for our results for instance we found an inverted expression profile relationship between genes yme and ynt  where the latter has been experimentally documented as a bypass suppressor of the former we also found new relationships involving uncharacterized yeast genes and were able to suggest functions for many of them in particular we found a time delayed expression relationship between j   which has not yet been functionally characterized and four genes associated with the mitochondria this suggests that j   may be involved in the control or activation of mitochondrial genes we have also looked at other less extensive datasets than the yeast cell cycle and found further interesting relationships our clustering program and a detailed website of clustering results is available at http  www bioinfo mbb yale edu expression cluster or http  www genecensus org expression cluster
