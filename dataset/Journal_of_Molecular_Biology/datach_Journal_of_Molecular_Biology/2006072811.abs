adrm  a putative cell adhesion regulating protein is a novel proteasome associated factor
we have identified adrm as a novel component of the regulatory atpase complex of the  s proteasome adrm was precipitated with an antibody to proteasomes and vice versa adrm co migrated with proteasomes on gel filtration chromatography and non denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis adrm has been described as an interferon  inducible heavily glycosylated membrane protein of   kda however we found adrm in mouse tissues only as a   kda peptide corresponding to the mass of the non glycosylated peptide chain and it could not be induced in hela cells with interferon adrm was present almost exclusively in soluble  s proteasomes albeit a small fraction was membrane associated like proteasomes adrm was found in cells in amounts equimolar with s a a  s proteasome subunit hela cells contain no pool of free adrm but recombinant adrm could bind to pre existing  s proteasomes in cell extracts adrm may be distantly related to the yeast proteasome subunit rpn  mutants of which are reported to display no obvious phenotype accordingly knock down of adrm in hela cells had no effect on the amount of proteasomes or on degradation of bulk cell protein or accumulation of polyubiquitinylated proteins this indicates that adrm has a specialised role in proteasome function
