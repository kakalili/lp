crystal structures of the appa bluf domain photoreceptor provide insights into blue light mediated signal transduction
proteins containing a sensor of blue light using fad bluf domain control diverse cellular processes such as gene expression nucleotide metabolism and motility by relaying blue light signals to distinct output units despite its crucial and widespread functions the mechanism of bluf signal transduction has remained elusive we determined crystal structures of the dark adapted state and of a photo excited red shifted photocycle intermediate of the bluf unit of appa a purple bacterial photoreceptor involved in the light dependent regulation of photosynthesis gene expression in contrast to a recently published crystal structure of the appa bluf domain determined in the presence of detergent molecules our structural model of the dark state corresponds well to those reported for the bluf domains of tll   and blrb this establishes that a highly conserved methionine met  in appa is next to the active site glutamine gln  in appa  which is of relevance for the latter  s orientation in the dark state and for the mechanism of the photoreaction the comparison of the dark adapted and photointermediate state structures shows light induced conformational alterations which suggest a path for signal propagation in particular we observe a significant movement of the met  side chain met  thereby changes its mode of interaction with gln  which supports a light dependent rotation of the latter in view of other bluf structures available our data further suggest that the hydrogen bond between asn  and the backbone carbonyl of his  breaks upon illumination the ensuing extensive structural rearrangement of  strand  is predicted to involve a flip of met  out of the flavin binding pocket and trp  moving in to fill the void we propose that the blue light signal is transmitted towards the surface of the bluf domain via his  which serves as a reporter of active site changes
