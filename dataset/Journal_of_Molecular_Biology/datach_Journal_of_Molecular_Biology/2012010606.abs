transcription factor gata  recruits ppar  to cooperatively activate glut gene expression
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor   ppar  is a nuclear hormone receptor that regulates energy metabolism but its precise mechanisms remain unknown here we demonstrate that the ppar  agonist fenofibrate activated expression of the glucose transporter glut  moreover ppar  was associated with the glut promoter through gata sites upon fenofibrate stimulation in cardiomyocytes this occupancy is achieved through an interaction between amino acids     of ppar  with amino acids      of the cardiac transcription factor gata  in addition the interaction of ppar  with gata  activated glut gene expression improved glucose consumption and enhanced activity of mitochondrial citrate synthase in c c  myoblasts both mutants of ppar       aa and gata        aa were unable to cooperate in glut activation thus gata  is an important component of the transcription network required for energy metabolism mediated by ppar  and these findings provide a molecular basis for understanding the role of gata  proteins in muscle development and disease
