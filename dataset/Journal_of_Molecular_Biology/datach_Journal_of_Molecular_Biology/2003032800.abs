bivalent binding of iga to fc ri suggests a mechanism for cytokine activation of iga phagocytosis
fc ri the receptor specific for the fc region of immunoglobulin a iga  is responsible for iga mediated phagocytosis oxidative burst and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity using the techniques of analytical ultracentrifugation and equilibrium gel filtration we show that two fc ri molecules bind to a single fc  homodimer surface plasmon resonance studies confirm the   stoichiometry of binding with equilibrium dissociation constants of  nm and  nm for the first and second binding events respectively the binding affinity decreases at acidic ph in a manner consistent with protonation of a single histidine residue in the binding site a thermodynamic analysis indicates that the histidine residue does not participate in a salt bridge in the complex in fact less than   of the free energy of binding was contributed by electrostatic interactions the bivalent ph dependent interaction between fc ri and iga has important implications for cytokine dependent phagocytosis of iga and the fc ri mediated degradation or recycling of iga
