relibase design and development of a database for comprehensive analysis of protein  ligand interactions   we dedicate this paper to professor j d dunitz
knowledge discovery from the exponentially growing body of structurally characterised protein  ligand complexes as a source of information in structure based drug design is a major challenge in contemporary drug research given the need for powerful data retrieval integration and analysis tools relibase was developed as a database system particularly designed to handle protein  ligand related problems and tasks here we describe the design and functionality of the relibase core database system features of relibase include e g the detailed analysis of superimposed ligand binding sites ligand similarity and substructure searches and d searches for protein  ligand and protein  protein interaction patterns the broad range of functions provided in relibase and its high level of data integration along with its flexible and intuitive interface makes relibase an invaluable data mining tool which can significantly enhance the drug development process an example illustrating a d query for quarternary ligand nitrogen atoms interacting with aromatic ring systems in proteins a pattern found in pharmaceutically relevant target proteins such as e g acetylcholine esterase is discussed
