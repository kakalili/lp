A double lipid bilayer structure containing opposing tetramers of AQP0 aquaporin, in contact through extracellular face loop regions, was recently modeled using an intermediate-resolution map obtained by electron crystallographic methods. The pores of these water channels were found to be critically narrow in three regions and subsequently interpreted to be those of a closed state of the channel. The subsequent determination of a high-resolution AQP0 tetramer structure by X-ray crystallographic methods yielded a pore model featuring two of the three constrictions as noted in the EM work and water molecules within the channel pore. The extracellular-side constriction region of this AQP0 structure was significantly larger than that of the EM-based model and similar to that of the highly water permeable AQP1. The X-ray-based study of AQP0 however could not ascertain if the water molecules found in the pore were the result of water entering from one or both ends of the channel, nor whether water could freely pass through all constriction points. Additionally, this X-ray-based structure could not provide an answer to the question of whether the double lipid bilayer configuration of AQP0 could functionally maintain a water impermeable state of the channel. To address these questions we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to compare the time-dependent behavior of the AQP0 and AQP1 channels within lipid bilayers. The simulations demonstrate that AQP0, in single or double lipid bilayers, is not closed to water transport and that thermal motions of critical side-chains are sufficient to facilitate the movement of water past any of its constriction regions. These motional requirements do however lead to significant free energy barriers and help explain physiological observations that found water permeability in AQP0 to be substantially lower than in the AQP1 pore.
