the vd neutralizing antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor d binding epitope and relationship to receptor binding
vascular endothelial growth factor d vegf d is a secreted protein that promotes tumor growth and metastatic spread in animal models of cancer expression of vegf d in prevalent human cancers was reported to correlate with lymph node metastasis and patient outcome  hence this protein is a potential target for novel anticancer therapeutics designed to restrict tumor growth and spread here we define the binding site in vegf d of a neutralizing antibody designated vd  which blocks the interaction of vegf d with its cell surface receptors vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr  and vegfr  and is being used for the development of therapeutic antibodies we show by peptide based mapping and site directed mutagenesis that the vd binding site includes the five residues  neesl  and that immunization with a synthetic peptide containing this motif generates antibodies that neutralize vegf d the tertiary structure of vegf d indicates that the  neesl  epitope is located in the l loop of the growth factor which is important for receptor binding mutation of any of these five residues influences receptor binding for example mutations to e   which abolished binding to vd  impaired the interaction with vegfr  but enhanced binding to vegfr  this structure function study indicates that the vd binding epitope is part of the receptor binding site of vegf d identifies a region of vegf d critical for binding of receptors and explains why vd does not bind other members of the vegf family of growth factors
