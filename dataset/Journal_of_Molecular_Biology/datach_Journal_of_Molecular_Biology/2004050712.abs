domain insertions in protein structures
domains are the structural functional or evolutionary units of proteins proteins can comprise a single domain or a combination of domains in multi domain proteins the domains almost always occur end to end i e  one domain follows the c terminal end of another domain however there are exceptions to this common pattern where multi domain proteins are formed by insertion of one domain insert into another domain parent  here we provide a quantitative description of known insertions in the protein data bank pdb  we found that  of domain combinations observed in non redundant pdb are insertions although   of all insertions involve only one insert proteins can clearly have multiple nested two domain and three domain inserts we also observed correlations between the structure and function of a domain and its tendency to be found as a parent or an insert there is a bias in insert position towards the c terminus of parents we observed that the atomic distance between the n and c terminus of an insert is significantly smaller when compared to the n to c distance in a parent context or a single domain context insertions are found always to occur in loop regions of parent domains our observations regarding the relationship between domain insertions and the structure function and evolution of proteins have implications for protein engineering
