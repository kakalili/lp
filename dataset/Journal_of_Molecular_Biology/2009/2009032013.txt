Chlorite dismutase (Cld) is a key enzyme of perchlorate and chlorate respiration. This heme-based protein reduces the toxic compound chlorite into the innocuous chloride anion in a very efficient way while producing molecular oxygen. A sequence comparison between Cld homologues shows a highly conserved family. The crystal structure of Azospira oryzae strain GR-1 Cld is reported to 2.1 Å resolution. The structure reveals a hexameric organization of the Cld, while each monomer exhibits a ferredoxin-like fold. The six subunits are organized in a ring structure with a maximal diameter of 9 nm and an inner diameter of 2 nm. The heme active-site pocket is solvent accessible both from the inside and the outside of the ring. Moreover, a second anion binding site that could accommodate the assumed reaction intermediate ClO‾ for further transformation has been identified near the active site.The environment of the heme cofactor was investigated with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Apart from the high-spin ferric signal of the five-coordinate resting-state enzyme, two low-spin signals were found corresponding to six-coordinate species. The current crystal structure confirms and complements a recently proposed catalytic mechanism that proceeds via a ferryl species and a ClO‾ anion. Our structural data exclude cooperativity between the iron centers.
