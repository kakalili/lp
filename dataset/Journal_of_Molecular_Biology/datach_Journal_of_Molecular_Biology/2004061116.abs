new carbohydrate specificity and hiv  fusion blocking activity of the cyanobacterial protein mvl nmr itc and sedimentation equilibrium studies
carbohydrate binding proteins that bind their carbohydrate ligands with high affinity are rare and therefore of interest because they expand our understanding of carbohydrate specificity and the structural requirements that lead to high affinity interactions here we use nmr and isothermal titration calorimetry techniques to determine carbohydrate specificity and affinities for a novel cyanobacterial protein mvl and show that mvl binds oligomannosides such as man glcnac with sub micromolar affinities the amino acid sequence of mvl contains two homologous repeats each comprising  amino acid residues using multi dimensional nmr techniques we show that mvl contains two novel carbohydrate recognition domains composed of four non contiguous regions comprising    amino acid residues each and that these residues make numerous intermolecular contacts with their carbohydrate ligands nmr screening of a comprehensive panel of di  tri  and high mannose oligosaccharides establish that high affinity binding requires at least the presence of a discrete conformation presented by man     glcnac in the context of larger oligomannosides as shown by sedimentation equilibrium and gel filtration experiments mvl is a monodisperse dimer in solution and nmr data establish that the three dimensional structure must be symmetric mvl inhibits hiv  envelope mediated cell fusion with an ic  value of   nm
