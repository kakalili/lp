termination structures in the escherichia coli chromosome replication fork trap
the escherichia coli chromosome contains two opposed sets of unidirectional dna replication pause ter sites that according to the replication fork trap theory control the termination of chromosome replication by restricting replication fork fusion to the terminus region in contrast a recent hypothesis suggested that termination occurs at the dif locus instead using two dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis we examined dna replication intermediates at the ter sites and at dif in wild type cells two definitive signatures of site specific termination  specific replication fork arrest and converging replication forks  were clearly detected at ter sites but not at dif we also detected a significant pause during the latter stages of replication fork convergence at ter sites quantification of fork pausing at the ter sites in both their native chromosomal context and the plasmid context further supported the fork trap model
