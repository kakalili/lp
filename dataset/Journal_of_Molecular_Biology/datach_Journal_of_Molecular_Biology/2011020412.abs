active mutants of the tcr mediated p   alternative activation site show changes in the phosphorylation lip and def site formation
the p   mitogen activated protein kinase is commonly activated by dual thr and tyr phosphorylation catalyzed by mitogen activated protein kinase kinases however in t cells upon stimulation of the t cell receptor p   is activated via an alternative pathway involving its phosphorylation by zeta chain associated protein kinase  on tyr   distal from the phosphorylation lip tyr  phosphorylated p   is autoactivated resulting in monophosphorylation of thr   the conformational changes induced by ptyr  mediating autoactivation are not known the lack of ptyr  p   for structural studies promoted the search for tyr  mutations that may functionally emulate its effect when phosphorylated via a comprehensive mutagenesis of tyr   we identified mutations that rendered the kinase intrinsically active and others that displayed no activity crystallographic studies of selected active p  y  q p  y  t and p  y  r and inactive p  y  f mutants revealed that substantial changes in interlobe orientation extended conformation of the activation loop and formation of substrate docking def site docking site for extracellular signal regulated kinase fxf interaction pocket are associated with p   activation
