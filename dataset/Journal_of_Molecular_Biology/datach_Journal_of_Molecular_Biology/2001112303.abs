characterization of aloi a restriction modification system of a new type edited by j karn
we report the properties of the new aloi restriction and modification enzyme from acinetobacter lwoffi ks    that recognizes the dna target   gga n gttc   complementary strand   gaac n tcc    and the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this enzyme aloi is a bifunctional large polypeptide deduced mr   kda revealing both dna endonuclease and methyltransferase activities depending on reaction cofactors aloi cleaves double stranded dna on both strands seven bases on the   side and     bases on the   side of its recognition sequence and modifies adenine residues in both dna strands in the target sequence yielding n methyladenine for cleavage activity aloi maintains an absolute requirement for mg  and does not depend on or is stimulated by either atp or s adenosyl l methionine modification function requires the presence of s adenosyl l methionine and is stimulated by metal ions ca   the c terminal and central parts of the protein were found to be homologous to certain specificity hsds and modification hsdm subunits of type i r m systems respectively the n terminal part of the protein possesses the putative endonucleolytic motif dxnexk of restriction endonucleases the deduced amino acid sequence of aloi shares significant homology with polypeptides encoding hae iv and cje i restriction modification proteins at the n terminal and central but not at the c terminal domains the organization of aloi implies that its evolution involved fusion of an endonuclease and the two subunits hsdm and hsds of type i restriction enzymes according to the structure and function properties aloi may be regarded as one more representative of a newly emerging group of hae iv like restriction endonucleases discovery of these enzymes opens new opportunities for constructing restriction endonucleases with a new specificity
