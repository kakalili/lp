cystatin forms a tetramer through structural rearrangement of domain swapped dimers prior to amyloidogenesis
the cystatins were the first amyloidogenic proteins to be shown to oligomerize through a d domain swapping mechanism here we show that under conditions leading to the formation of amyloid deposits the domain swapped dimer of chicken cystatin further oligomerizes to a tetramer prior to fibrillization the tetramer has a very similar circular dichroism and fluorescence signature to the folded monomer and dimer structures but exhibits some loss of dispersion in the h nmr spectrum  anilino  naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence enhancement indicates an increase in the degree of disorder while the dimerization reaction is bimolecular and most likely limited by the availability of a predominantly unfolded form of the monomer the tetramerization reaction is first order the tetramer is formed slowly t  six days at   c  dimeric cystatin is the precursor to tetramer formation and thus the rate is limited by structural rearrangement within the dimer some higher order oligomerization events parallel tetramer formation while others follow from the tetrameric form thus the tetramer is a transient intermediate within the pathway of large scale oligomerization
