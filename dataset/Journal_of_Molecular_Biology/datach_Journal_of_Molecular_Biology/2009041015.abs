the mouse thymosin beta  gene family displays unique complexity and encodes a functional thymosin repeat
we showed earlier that human beta thymosin   tb  is up regulated in prostate cancer confirming studies from others that propagated tb  as a prostate cancer biomarker in this first report on mouse tb  we show that unlike in humans four tb  like isoforms are present in mouse we used phylogenetic analysis of deuterostome beta thymosins to show that these four new isoforms cluster within the vertebrate tb  clade intriguingly one of these mouse beta thymosins tb r consists of two beta thymosin domains the existence of such a repeat beta thymosin is so far unique in vertebrates though common in lower eukaryotes biochemical data indicate that tb r potently sequesters actin in a cellular context tb r behaves as a bona fide beta thymosin lowering central stress fibre content we reveal that a complex genomic organization underlies tb r expression tb r results from read through transcription and alternative splicing of two tandem duplicated mouse tb  genes transcript profiling of all mouse beta thymosin isoforms tb s tb and tb  reveals that two isoform switches occur between embryonic and adult tissues and indicates tb r as the major mouse tb  isoform in adult cells tb r is present also in mouse prostate cancer cell lines this insight into the mouse tb  family is fundamental for future studies on tb  in mouse prostate cancer models
