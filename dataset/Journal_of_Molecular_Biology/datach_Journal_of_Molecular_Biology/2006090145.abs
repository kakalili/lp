topological analysis of plasmid chromatin from yeast and mammalian cells
yeast has proven to be a powerful system for investigation of chromatin structure however the extent to which yeast chromatin can serve as a model for mammalian chromatin is limited by the significant number of differences that have been reported to further investigate the structural relationship between the two chromatins we have performed a dna topological analysis of prssvo a   base pair plasmid that can replicate in either yeast or mammalian cells when grown in mammalian cells prssvo contains an average of  negative supercoils consistent with one nucleosome per   bp this is close to the measured nucleosome repeat length of   bp however when grown in yeast cells prssvo contains an average of only  negative supercoils which is indicative of only one nucleosome per   bp this is dramatically different from the measured nucleosome repeat length of   bp to account for these observations we suggest that yeast chromatin is composed of relatively short ordered arrays of nucleosomes with a repeat of   bp separated by substantial gaps possibly corresponding to regulatory regions
