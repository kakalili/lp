recognition and positioning of mrna in the ribosome by trnas with expanded anticodons
mutant trnas containing an extra nucleotide in the anticodon loop are known to suppress  frameshift mutations but in no case has the molecular mechanism been clarified it has been proposed that the expanded anticodon pairs with a complementary mrna sequence the frameshift sequence in the a site and this quadruplet  codon anticodon  helix is translocated to the p site to restore the correct reading frame here we analyze the ability of trna analogs containing expanded anticodons to recognize and position mrna in ribosomal complexes in vitro in all cases tested  nt anticodon loops position the   three quarters of the frameshift sequence in the p site indicating that the   bases of the expanded anticodon nucleotides      and   pair with mrna in the p site we also provide evidence that four base pairs can form between the p site trna and mrna and the fourth base pair involves nucleotide  of the trna and lies toward or in the  s e site in the a site trna analogs with the expanded anticodon accg are able to recognize either cgg or ggu these data imply a flexibility of the expanded anticodon in the a site recognition of the   three quarters of the frameshift sequence in the a site and subsequent translocation of the expanded anticodon to the p site results in movement of mrna by four nucleotides explaining how these trnas can change the mrna register in the ribosome to restore the correct reading frame
