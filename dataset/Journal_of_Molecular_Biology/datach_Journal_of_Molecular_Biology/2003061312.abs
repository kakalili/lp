protein feature based identification of cell cycle regulated proteins in yeast
dna microarrays have been used extensively to identify cell cycle regulated genes in yeast however the overlap in the genes identified is surprisingly small we show that certain protein features can be used to distinguish cell cycle regulated genes from other genes with high confidence features include protein phosphorylation glycosylation subcellular location and instability degradation  we demonstrate that co expressed periodic genes encode proteins which share combinations of features and provide an overview of the proteome dynamics during the cycle a large set of novel putative cell cycle regulated proteins were identified many of which have no known function
