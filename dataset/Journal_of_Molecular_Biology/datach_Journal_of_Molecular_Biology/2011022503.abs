crystal structure of arrestin  reveals the basis of the difference in receptor binding between two non visual subtypes
arrestins are multi functional proteins that regulate signaling and trafficking of the majority of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs  as well as sub cellular localization and activity of many other signaling proteins we report the first crystal structure of arrestin  solved at     resolution arrestin  is an elongated two domain molecule with overall fold and key inter domain interactions that hold the free protein in the basal conformation similar to the other subtypes arrestin  is the least selective member of the family binding a wide variety of gpcrs with high affinity and demonstrating lower preference for active phosphorylated forms of the receptors in contrast to the other three arrestins part of the receptor binding surface in the arrestin  c domain does not form a contiguous  sheet which is consistent with increased flexibility by swapping the corresponding elements between arrestin  and arrestin  we show that the presence of this loose structure is correlated with reduced arrestin selectivity for activated receptors consistent with a conformational change in this  sheet upon receptor binding
