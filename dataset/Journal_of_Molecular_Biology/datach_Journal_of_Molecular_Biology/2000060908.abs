the proteasome activator  s reg or pa  chimeras implicate carboxyl terminal sequences in oligomerization and proteasome binding but not in the activation of specific proteasome catalytic subunits edited by w baumeister
the reg homologs     and   activate mammalian proteasomes in distinct ways reg  and reg  activate the trypsin like chymotrypsin like and peptidylglutamyl preferring active sites whereas reg  only activates the proteasome  s trypsin like subunit the three reg homologs differ in carboxyl terminal sequences that are located next to activation loops on their proteasome binding surface to assess the importance of these carboxyl terminal sequences in the activation of specific proteasome  catalytic subunits we characterized chimeras in which  or  residues were exchanged among the three proteins like the wild type molecule reg  chimeras activated all three proteasome catalytic subunits regardless of the carboxyl terminal sequence however reg   chimeras activated the proteasome at lower concentrations than wild type reg  and higher levels of reg   chimeras were needed for maximal activation because exchanged carboxyl terminal sequences can stabilize reg    or destabilize reg    the reg  heptamer reg  chimeras were equivalent to reg  in their activation properties but they bound the proteasome less tightly than the wild type molecule reg  chimeras also bound the proteasome more weakly than wild type reg  and were virtually unable to activate it our findings demonstrate that the carboxyl terminal sequences of reg subunits can affect heptamer stability and proteasome affinity but they do not determine which proteasome  subunits become activated
