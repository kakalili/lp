three dimensional structure by cryo electron microscopy of yvcc an homodimeric atp binding cassette transporter from bacillus subtilis edited by w baumeister
yvcc a multidrug transporter from bacillus subtilis is a member of the atp binding cassette superfamily highly homologous to each half of human multidrug resistance p glycoprotein and to several other bacterial half abc transporters here the purified recombinant histidine tagged yvcc has been reconstituted into a lipid bilayer controlled and partial detergent removal from yvcc lipid micelles allowed the production of particularly interesting lipid detergent yvcc ring shaped particles about  nm in diameter well suited for single particle analysis by cryo electron microscopy furthermore binding of these histidine tagged ring shaped particles to lipid layers functionalized with a ni  chelating head group generated a preferential perpendicular orientation eliminating the missing cone in the final three dimensional reconstruction from such analysis a computed volume has been determined to   nm resolution giving a detailed insight into the structural organization of this half abc transporter within a membrane the repetitive unit in the ring shaped particles is consistent with a homodimeric organization of yvcc each subunit was composed of three domains a  nm height transmembrane region a stalk of about  nm in height and  nm in diameter and a cytoplasmic lobe of about    nm in diameter the latest domain which fitted with the reported x ray structure of hisp was identified as the nucleotide binding domain nbd  the d reconstruction of the yvcc homodimer well compared with the very recent x ray crystallographic data on the msba homodimer from escherichia coli supporting the existence of a central open chamber between the two subunits constituting the homodimer in addition the d reconstruction of yvcc embedded in a membrane revealed an asymmetric organization of the two nbds sites within the homodimer as well as a dimeric interaction between two homodimers
