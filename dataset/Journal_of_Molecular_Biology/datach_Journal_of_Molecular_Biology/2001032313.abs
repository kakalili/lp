structural biochemistry of a type  rnase h rna primer recognition and removal during dna replication edited by k morikawa
dna replication and cellular survival requires efficient removal of rna primers during lagging strand dna synthesis in eukaryotes rna primer removal is initiated by type  rnase h which specifically cleaves the rna portion of an rna dna dna hybrid duplex this conserved type  rnase h family of replicative enzymes shares little sequence similarity with the well characterized prokaryotic type  rnase h enzymes yet both possess similar enzymatic properties crystal structures and structure based mutational analysis of rnase hii from archaeoglobus fulgidus both with and without a bound metal ion identify the active site for type  rnase h enzymes that provides the general nuclease activity necessary for catalysis the two domain architecture of type  rnase h creates a positively charged binding groove and links the unique c terminal helix loop helix cap domain to the active site catalytic domain this architectural arrangement apparently couples directional a form duplex binding by a hydrogen bonding arg lys phosphate ruler motif to substrate discrimination by a tyrosine finger motif thereby providing substrate specific catalytic activity combined kinetic and mutational analyses of structurally implicated substrate binding residues validate this binding mode these structural and mutational results together suggest a molecular mechanism for type  rnase h enzymes for the specific recognition and cleavage of rna in the rna dna junction within hybrid duplexes which reconciles the broad substrate binding affinity with the catalytic specificity observed in biochemical assays in combination with a recent independent structural analysis these results furthermore identify testable molecular hypotheses for the activity and function of the type  rnase h family of enzymes including structural complementarity substrate mediated conformational changes and coordination with subsequent fen  activity
