bcl  and porin follow different pathways of tom dependent insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane
the bcl  gene encodes a  kda protein which functions as a central regulator of apoptosis here we investigated the pathway of bcl   into the mitochondrial outer membrane using the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism we found that interactions of bcl   with the mitochondrial import receptor tom  are dependent on two positively charged lysine residues in the immediate vicinity of the carboxy terminal hydrophobic membrane anchor the targeting function of these residues is independent of tom  subsequent insertion of bcl   into the mitochondrial outer membrane does not require tom or tom  indicating that bcl   bypasses the general import pore gip  bcl   shows a unique pattern of interactions with the components of the mitochondrial tom complex demonstrating that at least two different pathways lead from the import receptor tom  into the mitochondrial outer membrane
