structural basis for oligosaccharide recognition by pyrococcus furiosus maltodextrin binding protein edited by d rees
a maltodextrin binding protein from pyrococcus furiosus pfumbp has been overproduced in escherichia coli purified and crystallized the crystal structure of the protein bound to an oligosaccharide ligand was determined to     resolution the fold of pfumbp is very similar to that of the orthologous mbp from e coli ecombp  despite the moderate level of sequence identity between the two proteins    identity    similarity  pfumbp is extremely resistant to heat and chemical denaturation which may be attributed to a number of factors such as a tightly packed hydrophobic core clusters of isoleucine residues salt bridges and the presence of proline residues in key positions surprisingly an attempt to crystallize the complex of pfumbp with maltose resulted in a structure that contained maltotriose in the ligand binding site the structure of the complex suggests that there is a considerable energy gain upon binding of maltotriose in comparison to maltose moreover isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated that the binding of maltotriose to the protein is exothermic and tight whereas no thermal effect was observed upon addition of maltose at three temperatures therefore pfumbp evidently is designed to bind oligosaccharides composed of three or more glucopyranose units
