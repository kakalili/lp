dna binding of phenylalanyl trna synthetase is accompanied by loop formation of the double stranded dna edited by a r fersht
the phenylalanyl trna synthetase frs from thermus thermophilus has previously been shown to bind dna we demonstrate that the  winged  helix turn helix motifs in the duplicate domains b are the relevant structural elements for this dna binding property by altering particular amino acids in the  wing   the affinity of the frs to dna was significantly reduced based on experimental data which indicate that the frs prefers a certain dna structure rather than a particular consensus sequence we propose a novel loop model for the dna binding mode of the frs in our model we assume that two segments of the same dna molecule are bound simultaneously by both b domains and are aligned in parallel while the intervening dna forms a loop due to the limited flexibility of the dna loop formation is only possible if the respective intervening dna stretch exceeds a certain length several lines of evidence support this model   we demonstrate by gel retardation assays that the dna requires a minimal number of ca  base pairs to be bound by the frs   in the presence of the frs dna longer than ca  base pairs has a significantly increased dnase i accessibility this agrees well with its known preferential cleavage at positions where the minor grove is on the outside of looped out dna molecules   the initial cleavage by dnase i of gt  bp long dna occurs in the middle of the fragment in a looped molecule this is the position with the highest accessibility to dnase i the function of the frs related to dna binding is still unknown since the frs exists in the nucleus of rapidly growing mammalian cells and protein induced dna bending or looping contributes to several transcription replication and recombination systems in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes it is likely that the frs in addition to its aminoacylation function influences common cellular processes via dna binding
