The PWWP domain is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein module characterised by a region of sequence similarity of approximately 80 amino acids containing a highly conserved PWWP motif. It is frequently found in proteins associated with chromatin. We have determined the structure of a PWWP domain from the S.pombe protein SPBC215.07c using NMR spectroscopy. The structure is composed of a five stranded beta barrel followed by two alpha helices. Comparison to the recently reported structure of a homologous domain from the mammalian DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b reveals substantial differences both in the C-terminal helical region and in the PWWP motif.
