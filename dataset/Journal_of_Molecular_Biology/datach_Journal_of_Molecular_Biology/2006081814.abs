unbound and acylated structures of the mecr extracellular antibiotic sensor domain provide insights into the signal transduction system that triggers methicillin resistance
methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa strains are responsible for most hospital onset bacterial infections lately they have become a major threat to the community through infections of skin soft tissue and respiratory tract and subsequent septicaemia or septic shock mrsa strains are resistant to most  lactam antibiotics blas as a result of the biosynthesis of a penicillin binding protein with low affinity for blas called pbp a pbp   or meca this response is regulated by the chromosomal mec divergon which encodes a signal transduction system including a transcriptional repressor meci and a sensor transducer mecr  as well as the structural meca gene this system is similar to those encoded by bla divergons in s aureus and bacillus licheniformis mecr comprises an integral membrane latent metalloprotease domain facing the cytosol and an extracellular sensor domain the latter binds blas and transmits a signal through the membrane that eventually triggers activation of the metalloprotease moiety which in turn switches off meci induced repression of meca transcription the mecr sensor domain mecr pbd reveals a two domain structure of    type fold reminiscent of penicillin binding proteins and  lactamases and a catalytic serine residue as the ultimate cause for bla binding covalent complexes with benzylpenicillin and oxacillin provide evidence that serine acylation does not entail significant structural changes thus supporting the hypothesis that additional extracellular segments of mecr are involved in signal transmission the chemical nature of the residues shaping the active site cleft favours stabilisation of the acyl enzyme complexes in mecr pbd in contrast to the closely related oxa  lactamases where the cleft is more likely to promote subsequent hydrolysis the present structural data provide insights into the mec encoded bla response mechanism and an explanation for kinetic differences in signal transmission with the related bla encoded systems
