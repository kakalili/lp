the bacterial dna binding protein h ns represses ribosomal rna transcription by trapping rna polymerase in the initiation complex edited by m yaniv
the interaction of the bacterial regulatory protein h ns with rna polymerase and the ribosomal rna p promoter was analyzed to better understand the mechanism of h ns dependent transcriptional repression we could show that initial binding of rna polymerase to the promoter was not inhibited by the simultaneous interaction of h ns although h ns binding sites extend into the core promoter region binding of   saturated rna polymerase and h ns to the promoter dna occurs cooperatively and results in a stable complex of slower gel electrophoretic mobility as compared to complexes formed with the single proteins the presence of the upstream curved h ns binding site contributes strongly to the cooperative rna polymerase promoter interaction by kmno modification of single stranded template nucleotides we could show that open complex formation at the rrnb p promoter was not inhibited by h ns binding an increased kmno reactivity of several positions within the open complex rather supports the view that open complex formation is stimulated in presence of h ns moreover subtle changes in the modification pattern indicate that the open complex formed in the presence of h ns are structurally distinct from the h ns free complex in vitro transcriptional analysis of the abortive and productive yields revealed that the formation of transcription products longer than three nucleotides is dramatically reduced in the presence of h ns while the amount of shorter abortive products remained unaffected together the results demonstrate that h ns inhibits transcription at the rrnb p promoter not by interfering with initial rna polymerase binding but by blocking chain elongation steps subsequent to the first two phosphodiester bond formations the mechanism of h ns dependent repression at rrna promoters can thus be explained as a trap which inhibits substrate ntp incorporation beyond template position  into the initial transcribing complex
