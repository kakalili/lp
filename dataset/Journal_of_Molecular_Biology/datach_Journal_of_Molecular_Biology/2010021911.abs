ionic interactions promote transmembrane helix  helix association depending on sequence context
folding and oligomerization of integral membrane proteins frequently depend on specific interactions of transmembrane helices interacting amino acids of helix  helix interfaces may form complex motifs and exert different types of molecular forces here a set of strongly self interacting transmembrane domains tmds  as isolated from a combinatorial library was found to contain basic and acidic residues in combination with polar nonionizable amino acids and c terminal gxxxg motifs mutational analyses of selected sequences and reconstruction of high affinity interfaces confirmed the cooperation of these residues in homotypic interactions probing heterotypic interaction indicated the presence of interhelical charge  charge interactions furthermore simple motifs of an ionizable residue and gxxxg are significantly overrepresented in natural tmds and a specific combination of these motifs exhibits high affinity heterotypic interaction we conclude that intramembrane charge  charge interactions depend on sequence context moreover they appear important for homotypic and heterotypic interactions of numerous natural tmds
