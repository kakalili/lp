structure guided identification of a laminin binding site on the laminin receptor precursor
the     kda human laminin receptor lamr is a cell surface receptor for laminin prion protein and a variety of viruses because of its wide range of ligands lamr plays a role in numerous pathologies lamr overexpression correlates with a highly invasive cell phenotype and increased metastatic ability mediated by interactions between lamr and laminin in addition the specific targeting of lamr with small interfering rnas blocking antibodies and sindbis viral vectors confers anti tumor effects we adopted a structure based approach to map a laminin binding site on human lamr by comparing the sequences and crystal structures of lamr and archaeoglobus fulgidus s p a non laminin binding ortholog here we identify a laminin binding site on lamr comprising residues phe  glu  and arg   which are conserved among mammalian species mutation of these residues results in a significant loss of laminin binding further recombinant wild type lamr is able to act as a soluble decoy to inhibit cellular migration towards laminin mutation of this laminin binding site results in loss of migration inhibition which demonstrates the physiological role of phe  glu  and arg  for laminin binding activity mapping of the lamr binding site should contribute to the development of therapeutics that inhibit lamr interactions with laminin and may aid in the prevention of tumor growth and metastasis
