Activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is generally believed to induce dissociation of Gα and Gβγ subunits, which are then free to bind to and change the catalytic activity of a variety of intracellular enzymes. We have previously found that in cells, Gαq subunits remain complexed with its major effector, phospholipase Cβ1, through the activation cycle. To determine whether this behavior may be operative in other systems, we carried out Förster resonance energy transfer studies and found that eYFP-Gαi and eCFP-Gβγ remain associated after stimulation in HEK293 cells. We also found that the level of Forster resonance energy transfer between Alexa546-phospholipase Cβ2 and eGFP-Gβγ is significant and unchanged upon activation in HEK293 cells, thus showing that these proteins can localize into stable signaling complexes. To understand the basis for this stabilization, we carried out in vitro studies using a series of single-Cys mutants labeled with fluorescence tags and monitored their interaction with Gβγ subunits and changes in their fluorescence properties and accessibility upon activation and Gβγ binding. Our studies suggest a significant change in the orientation between G protein subunits upon activation that allows the G proteins to remain complexed while activating effectors.
