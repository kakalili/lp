the transcriptional repression activity of kyot on the notch rbp j pathway is regulated by pias catalyzed sumoylation
the lim domain protein kyot negatively regulates the notch signaling pathway through interaction with rbp j the core element of the notch signaling pathway in the nucleus here we show that pias  the protein inhibitor of activated stat  interacts with kyot directly and attenuates kyot mediated transcriptional repression we demonstrate that kyot is modified by sumoylation at two lysine residues k  and k   sumoylation of the transfected kyot is enhanced by pias but not hpc  another kyot interacting protein with sumo e ligase activity and is repressed by a pias mutant that is deficient of e ligase activity using mutants disrupting either or both of the sumo sites we show that sumoylation of kyot does not influence its expression intracellular localization or interaction with known partners however disruption of the k  sumoylation site does reinforce the transcriptional repression activity of kyot  suggesting that sumoylation of this site counters the repression activity of kyot  finally we show that pias fails to attenuate the repression activity of the k  r mutant of kyot  suggesting that pias may potentially antagonize the transcriptional repression activity of kyot through catalyzing its sumoylation at k   these results suggest that kyot is a substrate of sumo modification catalyzed by pias  and that sumoylation may modulate the transcriptional repression effect of kyot on the notch rbp j signaling pathway
