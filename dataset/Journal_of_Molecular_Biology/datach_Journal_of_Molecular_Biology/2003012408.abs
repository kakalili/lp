homoassociation of ve cadherin follows a mechanism common to  classical  cadherins
vascular endothelial cadherin ve cadherin cadherin  is specifically expressed in adherens junctions of endothelial cells and exerts important functions in cell  cell adhesion as well as signal transduction to analyze the mechanism of ve cadherin homoassociation the ectodomains cad  were connected by linker sequences to the n terminus of the coiled coil domain of cartilage matrix protein cmp  the chimera vecadcmp were expressed in mammalian cells the trimeric coiled coil domain leads to high intrinsic domain concentrations and multivalency promoting self association ca  dependent homophilic association of vecadcmp was detected in solid phase assays and cross linking experiments a striking analogy to homoassociation of type i   classical   cadherins like e n or p cadherin was observed when interactions in vecadcmp and between these trimeric proteins were analyzed by electron microscopy ca  dependent ring like and double ring like arrangements suggest interactions between domains  and  of the ectodomains which may be correlated with lateral and adhesive contacts in the adhesion process association to complexes composed of two vecadcmp molecules was also demonstrated by chemical cross linking no indication for an antiparallel association of vecad ectodomains to hexameric complexes as proposed by legrand et al was found instead the data suggest that homoassociation of ve cadherin follows the conserved mechanism of type i cadherins
