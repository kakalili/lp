ubiquitin is a novel substrate for human insulin degrading enzyme
insulin degrading enzyme ide can degrade insulin and amyloid   peptides involved in diabetes and alzheimer s disease respectively ide selects its substrates based on size charge and flexibility from these criteria we predict that ide can cleave and inactivate ubiquitin ub  here we show that ide cleaves ub in a biphasic manner first by rapidly removing the two c terminal glycines kcat  s   followed by a slow cleavage between residues  and   kcat    s    thereby producing the inactive    fragment of ub ub   and    fragment of ub ub     ide is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic protein where monomeric ub is also present thus ub degradation by ide should be regulated ide is known to bind the cytoplasmic intermediate filament protein nestin with high affinity we found that nestin potently inhibits the cleavage of ub by ide in addition ub    has a markedly increased affinity for ide    fold  thus the association of ide with cellular regulators and product inhibition by ub    can prevent inadvertent proteolysis of cellular ub by ide ub is a highly stable protein however ide instead prefers to degrade peptides with high intrinsic flexibility indeed we demonstrate that ide is exquisitely sensitive to ub stability mutations that only mildly destabilize ub   g lt   kcal mol render ide hypersensitive to ub with rate enhancements greater than  fold the ub bound ide structure and ide mutants reveal that the interaction of the exosite with the n terminus of ub guides the unfolding of ub allowing its sequential cleavages together our studies link the control of ub clearance with ide
