three dimensional structure of a human pancreatic ribonuclease variant a step forward in the design of cytotoxic ribonucleases edited by r huber
we have determined the crystal structure of a human pancreatic ribonuclease or rnase  variant at     resolution five residues in the n terminal region were substituted by the corresponding amino acids of the bovine seminal rnase in addition a pro to ser mutation was present at position   the substitution of part of the n terminus has been critical both in improving the expression of this enzyme as a recombinant protein and in achieving its crystallisation the determination of the crystal structure revealed the characteristic rnase fold including a v shaped  sheet and three  helices it differs from its bovine rnase orthologue mainly in the loop regions the active site cleft shows a similar architecture to that of its bovine counterpart with the essential residues occupying equivalent positions in the present structure however his  is displaced as it is in the structure of rnase a at high ph an interaction model of human ribonuclease with the ribonuclease inhibitor together with inhibition assays indicate that in contrast to rnase a the modification of the loop    is not enough to avoid inhibition this study represents the first crystallographic approach to the human enzyme and should constitute an invaluable tool for the design of ribonuclease variants with acquired cytotoxic properties
