donor strand exchange in chaperone assisted pilus assembly revealed in atomic detail by molecular dynamics
adhesive multi subunit fibres are assembled on the surface of many pathogenic bacteria via the chaperone  usher pathway in the periplasm a chaperone donates a  strand to a pilus subunit to complement its incomplete immunoglobulin like fold at the outer membrane this is replaced with a  strand formed from the n terminal extension nte of an incoming pilus subunit by a donor strand exchange dse mechanism this reaction has previously been shown to proceed via a concerted mechanism in which the nte interacts with the chaperone subunit complex before the chaperone has been displaced forming a ternary intermediate thereafter the pilus and chaperone  strands have been postulated to undergo a strand swap by a  zip in  zip out  mechanism whereby the chaperone strand zips out residue by residue as the nte simultaneously zips in although direct experimental evidence for a zippering mechanism is still lacking here molecular dynamics simulations have been used to probe the dse mechanism during formation of the saf pilus from salmonella enterica at the atomic level allowing the direct investigation of the zip in  zip out hypothesis the simulations provide an explanation of how the incoming nte is able to dock and initiate dse due to inherent dynamic fluctuations within the chaperone subunit complex in the simulations the chaperone donor strand was seen to unbind from the pilus subunit residue by residue in direct support of the zip in  zip out hypothesis in addition an interaction of a residue towards the n terminus of the nte with a specific binding pocket p  on the adjacent pilus subunit was seen to stabilise the dse product against unbinding which also proceeded in the simulations by a zippering mechanism together the study provides an in depth picture of dse including the first atomistic insights into the molecular events occurring during the zip in  zip out mechanism
