mechanistic studies on hsp  inhibition by ansamycin derivatives
heat shock protein   hsp  is a molecular chaperone that is required for the maturation and activation of a number of client proteins many of which are involved in cancer development the ansamycin family of natural products and their derivatives such as geldanamycin ga  are well known inhibitors of the essential atpase activity of hsp  despite structural studies on the complexes of ansamycin derivatives with the atpase domain of hsp  certain aspects of their inhibitory mechanism remain unresolved for example it is known that ga in solution exists in an extended conformation with a trans amide bond however it binds to hsp  in a significantly more compact conformation with a cis amide bond ga and its derivatives have been shown to bind to hsp  with low micromolar affinity in vitro in contrast to the low nanomolar anti proliferative activity that these drugs exhibit in vivo in addition they show selectivity towards tumour cells we have studied both the equilibrium binding and the association and dissociation kinetics of ga derivative   dmag and the fluorescently labelled analogue bdga to both wild type and mutant hsp  the mutants were made in order to test the hypothesis that conserved residues near the atp binding site may catalyse the trans cis isomerisation of ga our results show that hsp  does not catalyse the trans cis isomerisation of ga and suggests that there is no isomerisation step before binding to hsp  experiments with bdga measured over a wide range of conditions in the absence and in the presence of reducing agents confirm recent studies that have suggested that the reduced dihydroquinone form of the drug binds to hsp  considerably more tightly than the non reduced quinone species
