sequence  structure  function classification of a catalytically diverse oxidoreductase superfamily in mycobacteria
the deazaflavin cofactor f  enhances the persistence of mycobacteria during hypoxia oxidative stress and antibiotic treatment however the identities and functions of the mycobacterial enzymes that utilize f  under these conditions have yet to be resolved in this work we used sequence similarity networks to analyze the distribution of the largest f  dependent protein family in mycobacteria we show that these enzymes are part of a larger split  barrel enzyme superfamily flavin deazaflavin oxidoreductases fdors that include previously characterized pyridoxamine pyridoxine   phosphate oxidases and heme oxygenases we show that these proteins variously utilize f   flavin mononucleotide flavin adenine dinucleotide and heme cofactors functional annotation using phylogenetic structural and spectroscopic methods revealed their involvement in heme degradation biliverdin reduction fatty acid modification and quinone reduction four novel crystal structures show that plasticity in substrate binding pockets and modifications to cofactor binding motifs enabled fdors to carry out a variety of functions this systematic classification and analysis provides a framework for further functional analysis of the roles of fdors in mycobacterial pathogenesis and persistence
