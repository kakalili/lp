c abl binding protein interacts with p  activated kinase  pak  to regulate pdgf induced membrane ruffles
p  activated kinases paks are serine threonine kinases involved in multiple cellular functions including cytoskeleton regulation proliferation and apoptosis we performed a screen for proteins interacting with pak  a ubiquitously expressed kinase involved in apoptotic signaling among the pak  interacting proteins were different members of the abl binding protein family abl binding proteins bound to a proline rich region of pak  located in the regulatory n terminus moreover active pak  phosphorylated abl binding proteins in vitro interestingly we show that pak  also interacted with c abl but via a different domain than with the abl binding proteins pak  and abi  co localized in the cytoplasm and to membrane dorsal ruffles induced by pdgf treatment expression of mutant pak  deficient in binding to abl binding proteins or silencing of pak  expression prevented the formation of membrane dorsal ruffles in response to pdgf our findings define a new class of pak interacting proteins which play an important role in actin cytoskeletal reorganization
