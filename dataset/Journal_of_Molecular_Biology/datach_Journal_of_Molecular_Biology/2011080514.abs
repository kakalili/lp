folding of acrb subunit precedes trimerization
acrb and its homologues are major players in the efflux of anti microbials out of gram negative bacteria the structural and functional unit of acrb is a homo trimer the assembly process of obligate membrane protein oligomers including acrb remains elusive it is not clear if an individual subunit folds into a monomeric form first followed by association three stage pathway or if association occurs simultaneously with subunit folding two stage pathway  to answer this question we investigated the feasibility of creating a folded monomeric acrb mutant the existence of well folded monomers in the cell membrane would be an evidence of a three stage pathway a monomeric acrb mutant acrb loop was created through the truncation of a protruding loop that appeared to contribute to the stability of an acrb trimer acrb loop expressed at a level similar to that of wild type acrb the secondary structure content and tertiary conformation of acrb loop were very similar to those of wild type acrb however when expressed in an acrb deficient strain acrb loop failed to complement its defect in drug efflux results from blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and chemical cross linking experiments suggested that acrb loop existed as a monomer the expression of this monomeric mutant in a wild type escherichia coli strain did not have a significant dominant negative effect suggesting that the mutant could not effectively co assemble with genomic acrb acrb loop is the first monomeric mutant reported for the intrinsically trimeric acrb the structural characterization results of this mutant suggest that the oligomerization of acrb occurs through a three stage pathway involving folded monomers
