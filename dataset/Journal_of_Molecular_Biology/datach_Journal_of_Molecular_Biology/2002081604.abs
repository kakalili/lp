solution structure of  grammotoxin sia a gating modifier of p q and n type ca  channel
grammotoxin sia grtx is a  amino acid residue protein toxin from spider venom that inhibits p q and n type voltage gated ca  channels by modifying voltage dependent gating we determined the three dimensional structure of grtx using nmr spectroscopy the toxin adopts an  inhibitor cystine knot  motif composed of two  strands leu  cys  and cys  trp  and a  bulge trp  gly cys  with a  x    topology which are connected by four chain reversals although grtx was originally identified as an inhibitor of voltage gated ca  channel it also binds to k channels with lower affinity a similar cross reaction was observed for hanatoxin  hatx  which binds to the voltage sensing domains of k and ca  channels with different affinities a detailed comparison of the grtx and hatx structures identifies a conserved face containing a large hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged residues the slight differences in the surface shape which result from the orientation of the surface aromatic residues and or the distribution of the charged residues may explain the differences in the binding affinity of these gating modifiers with different voltage gated ion channels
