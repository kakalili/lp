structural and functional analysis of c type ketoreductases from modular polyketide synthases
the process by which  stereocenters of polyketide intermediates are set by modular polyketide synthases pkss when condensation is not immediately followed by reduction is mysterious however the reductase incompetent ketoreductase kr from the third module of  deoxyerythronolide b synthase has been proposed to operate as a racemase aiding in the epimerization process that reverses the orientation of the  methyl group of the polyketide intermediate generated by the ketosynthase to the configuration observed in the  deoxyerythronolide b final product to learn more about the epimerization process the structure of the c type kr from the third module of the pikromycin synthase analogous to the kr from the third module of  deoxyerythronolide b synthase was determined to     resolution this first structural analysis of this kr type reveals differences from reductase competent krs such as that the site nadph binds to reductase competent krs is occluded by side chains and the putative catalytic tyrosine possesses more degrees of freedom the active site geometry may enable c type krs to align the thioester and  keto groups of a polyketide intermediate to reduce the pka of the  proton and accelerate its abstraction results from in vivo assays of engineered pkss support that c type krs cooperate with epimer specific ketosynthases to set the configurations of substituent bearing  carbons
