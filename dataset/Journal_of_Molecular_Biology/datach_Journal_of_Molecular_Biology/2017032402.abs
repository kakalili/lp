optogenetic control of ca  and voltage dependent large conductance bk potassium channels
ca  concentration jumps for the activation of ca  dependent ion channels or transporters can be obtained either by fast solution exchange or by the use of caged ca  here we report on an alternate optogenetic method for the activation of ca  and voltage dependent large conductance bk potassium channels this was achieved through the use of the light gated channelrhodopsin  variant catch calcium translocating channelrhodopsin with enhanced ca which produces locally ca  in the  m range on the inner side of the membrane without significant ca  increase in the cytosol bk channel subunits  and   were expressed together with catch in hek  cells and voltage and ca  dependence were analyzed light activation of endogenous bk channels under native conditions in astrocytes and glioma cells was also investigated additionally bk channels were used as sensors for the calibration of the ca  on the inner surface of the cell membrane
