identification of a b cell epitope of hyaluronidase a major bee venom allergen from its crystal structure in complex with a specific fab
the major allergens of honeybee venom hyaluronidase hyal and phospholipase a  can induce life threatening ige mediated allergic reactions in humans although conventional immunotherapy is effective up to   of patients develop allergic side effects including anaphylaxis and thus there is a need for an improved immunotherapy a murine monoclonal anti hyal igg antibody mab  e   that competed for hyal binding with iges from sera of bee venom allergic patients was raised the fragment of these igg antibodies which bind to antigen fab was produced and complexed    with hyal the crystal structure determination of hyal fab  e  complex     enabled the identification of the hyal  igg interface which provides indirect information on the hyal  ige interaction b cell epitope  the epitope is composed of a linear array of nine residues arg   his   arg   located at the tip of a helix  turn  helix motive which protrudes away from the globular core and fits tightly into the deep surface pocket formed by the residues from the six complementarity determining regions cdrs of the fab the epitope is continuous and yet its conformation appears to be essential for ab recognition since the synthetic  mer peptide comprising the entire epitope arg   glu   is neither recognized by mab  e  nor by human iges the structure of the complex provides the basis for the rational design of hyal derivatives with reduced allergenic activity which could be used in the development of safer allergen specific immunotherapy
