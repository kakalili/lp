differential recognition of staphylococcus aureus quorum sensing signals depends on both extracellular loops  and  of the transmembrane sensor agrc
virulence in staphylococcus aureus is regulated via agr dependent quorum sensing in which an autoinducing peptide aip activates agrc a histidine protein kinase aips are usually thiolactones containing seven to nine amino acid residues in which the thiol of the central cysteine is linked to the  carboxyl of the c terminal amino acid residue the staphylococcal agr locus has diverged such that the aips of the four different s aureus agr groups self activate but cross inhibit consequently although the agr system is conserved among the staphylococci it has undergone significant evolutionary divergence whereby to retain functionality any changes in the aip encoding gene agrd that modifies aip structure must be accompanied by corresponding changes in the agrc receptor since aip  and aip  only differ by a single amino acid we compared the transmembrane topology of agrc and agrc to identify amino acid residues involved in aip recognition as only two of the three predicted extracellular loops exhibited amino acid differences site specific mutagenesis was used to exchange the key agrc and agrc amino acid residues in each loop either singly or in combination a novel lux based agrp reporter gene fusion was constructed to evaluate the response of the mutated agrc receptors the data obtained revealed that while differential recognition of aip  and aip  depends primarily on three amino acid residues in loop  loop  is essential for receptor activation by the cognate aip furthermore a single mutation in the agrc loop  resulted in conversion of ala aip  from a potent antagonist to an activator essentially resulting in the forced evolution of a new aip group taken together our data indicate that loop  constitutes the predicted hydrophobic pocket that binds the aip thiolactone ring while the exocyclic amino acid tail interacts with loop  to facilitate receptor activation
