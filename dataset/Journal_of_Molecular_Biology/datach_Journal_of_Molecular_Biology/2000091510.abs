mass spectral analysis of a protein complex using single chain antibodies selected on a peptide target applications to functional genomics edited by i wilson
genome projects are identifying an ever increasing number of genes accelerating the need for reagents to study the expression of these genes and elucidate the function and cellular location of the gene products our goal was to develop a strategy to allow human single chain variable fragment scfv antibodies to be used for these endeavors a library containing    individual variants was displayed by bacteriophage and selected against a biotinylated peptide corresponding to the c terminal  amino acid residues of ku  one component of a heterodimer involved in double stranded dna break repair four unique scfv antibodies were recovered that not only recognized the selected peptide but also the intact protein three of the scfv antibodies were expressed in soluble form and recognized ku  by western analysis the affinity of one of the scfv antibodies for ku  was  nm as measured by biacore analysis scfv immunoprecipitation of ku  also isolated the other component of the heterodimer ku  as determined by western analysis and mass spectrometry these results demonstrate the utility of scfv antibodies as invaluable reagents for functional genomics
