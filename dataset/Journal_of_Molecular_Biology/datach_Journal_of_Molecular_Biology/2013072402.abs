reconstitution of selenocysteine incorporation reveals intrinsic regulation by secis elements
selenoproteins are present in all three domains of life and are responsible for a major part of a cell s antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen species synthesis of selenoproteins requires the decoding of a uga codon as selenocysteine sec instead of translation termination sec is incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain during translation elongation and is known to require a set of highly specific factors the sec insertion sequence secis element in the   untranslated region sec trnasec the sec specific elongation factor eefsec and secis binding protein  since reconstitution has not been reported whether these factors are sufficient is unknown here we report a novel in vitro translation system in which sec incorporation has been reconstituted from purified components introduced into a sec naive system in addition we developed a novel method to purify sec trnasec and active eefsec gtp trna ternary complex we found that the known basal factors are sufficient for sec incorporation in vitro using this highly manipulable system we have also found that ribosomes from non sec utilizing organisms cannot support sec incorporation and that some secis elements are intrinsically less efficient than others having identified the essential set of factors this work removes a significant barrier to our understanding of the mechanism of sec incorporation
