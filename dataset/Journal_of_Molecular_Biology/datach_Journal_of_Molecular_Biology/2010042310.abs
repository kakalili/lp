regions outside the  crystallin domain of the small heat shock protein hsp  are required for its dimerization
small heat shock proteins shsps are a ubiquitous family of molecular chaperones they form homo oligomers composed of mostly  subunits the immunoglobulin like  crystallin domain which is flanked by n and c terminal extensions is the most conserved element in shsps it is assumed to be the dimeric building block from which the shsp oligomers are assembled hsp  from saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well characterized member of this family with a view to study the structural stability and oligomerization properties of its  crystallin domain we produced a series of  crystallin domain constructs we show that a minimal  crystallin domain can against common belief be monomeric and stably folded elongating either the n or the c terminus of this minimal  crystallin domain with the authentic extensions leads to the formation of dimeric species in the case of n terminal extensions their population is dependent on the presence of the complete so called hsp   middle domain   for the c terminal extensions the presence of the conserved ixi motif of shsps is necessary and sufficient to induce dimerization which can be inhibited by increasing ionic strength dimerization does not induce major changes in secondary structure of the hsp   crystallin domain a thermodynamic analysis of the monomeric and dimeric constructs revealed that dimers are not significantly stabilized against thermal and chemical denaturation in comparison to monomers supporting our notion that dimerization is not a prerequisite for the formation of a well folded hsp   crystallin domain
