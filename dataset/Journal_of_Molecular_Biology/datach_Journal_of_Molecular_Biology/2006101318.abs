mechanism by which the amyloid like fibrils of a   microglobulin fragment are induced by fluorine substituted alcohols
although the formation of an  helix or partial unfolding of proteins has been suggested to be important for amyloid fibrils to form in alcohols the exact mechanism involved remains elusive to obtain further insight into the development of amyloid fibrils we used a  residue peptide k  corresponding to ser  to lys  of intact   microglobulin although k formed an  helix at high concentrations of    trifluoroethanol tfe and       hexafluoroisopropanol hfip in   mm hcl ph    the helical content was not high indicating a low preference to do so the partly  helical conformation was converted with time into a highly ordered  sheet with a fibrillar morphology as revealed by atomic force microscopy importantly the tfe and hfip induced fibrillation exhibited a concentration dependence with a maximum at    and     v v  respectively slightly below the concentrations at which these alcohols form dynamic clusters focusing on the similarity of the effects of alcohol on proteins with those of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds  we examined the effects of sds on k  sds also induced fibrils to form with a maximum at approximately  mm slightly below the critical micelle concentration these results indicate that with an increase in the concentration of hydrophobic cosolvent tfe hfip or sds  a delicate balance of decreasing hydrophobic interactions and increasing polar interactions i e h bonds in and between peptides leads to the formation of ordered fibrils with a bell shaped concentration dependence
