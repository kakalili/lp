the glutamate effect on dna binding by pol i dna polymerases osmotic stress and the effective reversal of salt linkage
the significant enhancing effect of glutamate on dna binding by escherichia coli nucleic acid binding proteins has been extensively documented glutamate has also often been observed to reduce the apparent linked ion release  nions upon dna binding in this study it is shown that the klenow and klentaq large fragments of the type i dna polymerases from e coli and thermus aquaticus both display enhanced dna binding affinity in the presence of glutamate versus chloride across the relatively narrow salt concentration ranges often used to obtain salt linkage data klenow displays an apparently decreased  nions in the presence of kglutamate while klentaq appears not to display an anion specific effect on  nions osmotic stress experiments reveal that dna binding by klenow and klentaq is associated with the release of    to   waters in the presence of kcl for both proteins replacing chloride with glutamate results in a   reduction in the osmotic stress measured hydration change associated with dna binding to       waters released  suggesting that glutamate plays a significant osmotic role measurements of the salt  dna binding linkages were extended up to   m kglutamate to further examine this osmotic effect of glutamate and it is observed that a reversal of the salt linkage occurs above   mm for both klenow and klentaq salt addition titrations confirm that an increase of kglutamate beyond  m results in rebinding of salt displaced polymerase to dna these data represent a rare documentation of a reversed ion linkage for a protein  dna interaction i e  enhanced binding as salt concentration increases  nonlinear linkage analysis indicates that this unusual behavior can be quantitatively accounted for by a shifting balance of ionic and osmotic effects as kglutamate is increased these results are predicted to be general for protein  dna interactions in glutamate salts
