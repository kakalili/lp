recognition templates for predicting adenylate binding sites in proteins edited by g van heijne
recognition templates encapsulate the structural and energetic features for the specific recognition of a given ligand by a protein active site these templates identify the major interactions used for specific recognition and may be used to find specific binding sites in proteins of unknown function we present a grid based method for deriving recognition templates for adenylate groups from a set of diverse nucleotide binding proteins the templates reveal the basis of specific binding of adenylate including tight shape complementarity specific hydrogen bonds and underscoring the importance of a key steric contact for excluding guanylate from adenylate specific sites we demonstrate the utility of recognition templates in identifying specific adenylate binding sites in a diverse set of dinucleotide binding proteins
