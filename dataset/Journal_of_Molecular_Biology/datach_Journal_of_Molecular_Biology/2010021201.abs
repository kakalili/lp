the recombinant amyloid  peptide a     aggregates faster and is more neurotoxic than synthetic a
aggregation of the amyloid   a  peptide is considered a central event in the pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease ad  in order to bypass methodological bias related to a variety of impurities commonly present in typical preparations of synthetic a  we developed a simple generally applicable method for recombinant production of human a  and a  variants in escherichia coli that provides milligram quantities of a  in very high purity and yield amyloid fibril formation in vitro by human a     the key amyloidogenic a  species in ad was completed threefold faster with recombinant a     compared to synthetic preparations in addition recombinant a     was significantly more toxic to cultured rat primary cortical neurons and it was more toxic in vivo as shown by strongly increased induction of abnormal phosphorylation of tau and tau aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles in brains of p  l tau transgenic mice we conclude that even small amounts of impurities in synthetic a   including a significant fraction of racemized peptides that cannot be avoided due to the technical limitations of peptide synthesis  prevent or slow a  incorporation into the regular quaternary structure of growing  amyloid fibrils the results validate the use of recombinant a     for both in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the mechanisms underlying a  aggregation and its related biological consequences for the pathophysiology therapy and prevention of ad
