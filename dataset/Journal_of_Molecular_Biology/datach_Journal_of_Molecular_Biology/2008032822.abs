cooperative binding mode of the inhibitors of r k replication   dimers
the replication initiator protein   plays an essential role in the initiation of plasmid r k replication both monomers and dimers of  bind to iterons in the  origin of plasmid r k yet monomers facilitate open complex formation while dimers the predominant form in the cell do not consequently   monomers activate replication while  dimers inhibit replication recently it was shown that the monomeric form of  binds multiple tandem iterons in a strongly cooperative fashion which might explain how monomers outcompete dimers for replication initiation when plasmid copy number and  supply are low here we examine cooperative binding of  dimers and explore the role that these interactions may have in the inactivation of  origin to examine  dimer iteron interactions in the absence of competing  monomer iteron interactions using wild type   constructs were made with key base changes to each iteron that eliminate  monomer binding yet have no impact on  dimer binding our results indicate that in the absence of  monomers   dimers bind with greater cooperativity to alternate iterons than to adjacent iterons thus preferentially leaving intervening iterons unbound and the origin unsaturated we discuss new insights into plasmid replication control by  dimers
