solution structures of the inactive and bef activated response regulator chey
the chemotactic signalling chain to the flagellar motor of sinorhizobium meliloti features a new type of response regulator chey  chey activated by phosphorylation chey p controls the rotary speed of the flagellar motor instead of reversing the sense of rotation  and it is efficiently dephosphorylated by phospho retrotransfer to the cognate kinase chea here we report the nmr solution structures of the mg  complex of inactive chey  and of activated chey bef  a stable analogue of chey p to an overall root mean square deviation of    nm and    nm respectively the  kda chey protein exhibits a characteristic open     conformation modification of chey by bef   leads to large conformational changes of the protein which are in the limits of error identical with those observed by phosphorylation of the active centre residue asp  in bef activated chey  the position of thr  oh favours the formation of a hydrogen bond with the active site asp  bef  similar to bef activated chey from escherichia coli in contrast to e coli this reorientation is not involved in a tyr thr coupling mechanism that propagates the signal from the incoming phosphoryl group to the c terminally located flim binding surface rather a rearrangement of the phe  side chain to interact with ile  leu  val  along with a displacement of   towards   is stabilised in s meliloti the resulting activation induced compact       surface forms a unique binding domain suited for specific interaction with and signalling to a rotary motor that requires a gradual speed control we propose that these new features of response regulator activation compared to other two component systems are the key for the observed unique phosphorylation dephosphorylation and motor control mechanisms in s meliloti
