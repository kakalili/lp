structure analysis of archaeal amp phosphorylase reveals two unique modes of dimerization
amp phosphorylase amppase catalyzes the initial reaction in a novel amp metabolic pathway recently found in archaea converting amp and phosphate into adenine and ribose   bisphosphate gel filtration chromatography revealed that amppase from thermococcus kodakarensis tk amppase forms an exceptionally large macromolecular structure  gt  mers in solution to investigate its unique multimerization feature we determined the first crystal structures of tk amppase in the apo form and in complex with substrates structures of two truncated forms of tk amppase tk amppase n  and tk amppase c  clarified that this multimerization is achieved by two dimer interfaces within a single molecule one by the central domain and the other by the c terminal domain which consists of an unexpected domain swapping interaction the n terminal domain characteristic of archaeal enzymes is essential for enzymatic activity participating in multimerization as well as domain closure of the active site upon substrate binding moreover biochemical analysis demonstrated that the macromolecular assembly of tk amppase contributes to its high thermostability essential for an enzyme from a hyperthermophile our findings unveil a unique archaeal nucleotide phosphorylase that is distinct in both function and structure from previously known members of the nucleoside phosphorylase ii family
