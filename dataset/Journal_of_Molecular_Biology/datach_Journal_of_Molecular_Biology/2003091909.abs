alternative splicing as a mechanism for regulating    binding interactions between hd  tpd l  and    proteins
d  tpd  like proteins are coiled coil motif bearing proteins first identified through their expression in human breast carcinoma which have been proposed to represent signalling intermediates and regulators of vesicle trafficking d  like gene transcripts are subject to alternative splicing with sequences encoding a region termed insert  being affected in all three d  like genes we have now identified a    binding motif within one of two alternatively spliced exons encoding insert  as predicted from the distribution of    binding motifs in four hd  like bait proteins tested only a hd  isoform encoding a    binding motif bound both     and     preys in the yeast two hybrid system since d  proteins carrying    binding motifs are predicted to be widely expressed polyclonal antisera were derived to specifically detect these isoforms using soluble protein extracts from breast carcinoma cell lines pull down assays replicated interactions between recombinant     and     isoforms and exogenously expressed hd  and co immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrated interactions between endogenous    and both endogenously and exogenously expressed hd  protein co expressed hd  and    proteins were similarly demonstrated to co localise within the cytoplasm of breast carcinoma cell lines these results identify    proteins as partners for hd  and alternative splicing as a mechanism for regulating    binding
