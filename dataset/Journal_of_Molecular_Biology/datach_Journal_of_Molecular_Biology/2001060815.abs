the basal transcription factors tbp and tfb from the mesophilic archaeon methanosarcina mazeii structure and conformational changes upon interaction with stress gene promoters
transcription of archaeal non stress genes involves the basal factors tbp and tfb homologs of the eucaryal tata binding protein and transcription factor iib respectively no comparable information exists for the archaeal molecular chaperone stress genes hsp  dnak  hsp  dnaj  and grpe these do not occur in some archaeal species but are present in others possibly due to lateral transfer from bacteria which provides a unique opportunity to study regulation of stress inducible bacterial genes in organisms with eukaryotic like transcription machinery among the archaea with the genes those from the mesophilic methanogen methanosarcina mazeii are the only ones whose basal constitutive and stress induced transcription patterns have been determined to continue this work tbp and tfb were cloned from m mazeii sequenced and the encoded recombinant proteins characterized in solution separately and in complex with each other and with dna m mazeii tbp ranks among the shortest within archaea and contrary to other archaeal tbps it lacks tryptophan or an acidic tail at the c terminus and has a basic n terminal third m mazeii tfb is similar in length to archaeal and eucaryal homologs and all have a zinc finger and hth motifs phylogenetically the archaeal and eucaryal proteins form separate clusters and the m mazeii molecules are closer to the homologs from archaeoglobus fulgidus than to any other antigenically m mazeii tbp and tfb are close to archaeal homologs within each factor family but the two families are unrelated the purified recombinant factors were functionally active in a cell free in vitro transcription system and were interchangeable with the homologs from methanococcus thermolithotrophicus the m mazeii factors have a similar secondary structure by circular dichroism cd  the cd spectra changed upon binding to the promoters of the stress genes grpe dnak and dnaj with the changes being distinctive for each promoter in contrast no effect was produced by the promoter of a non stress gene factor s dna modeling predicted that modifications of h bonds are caused by tbp binding and that these modifications are distinctive for each promoter it also showed which amino acid residues would contact an extended tata box with a b recognition element and evolutionary conservation of the tbp tfb dna complex orientation between two archaeal organisms with widely different optimal temperature for growth   and   c
