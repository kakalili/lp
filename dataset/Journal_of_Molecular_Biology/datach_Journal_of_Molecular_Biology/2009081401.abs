ligand binding and substrate discrimination by udp galactopyranose mutase
galactofuranose galf residues are present in cell wall glycoconjugates of numerous pathogenic microbes uridine  diphosphate udp galf the biosynthetic precursor of galf containing glycoconjugates is produced from udp galactopyranose udp galp by the flavoenzyme udp galactopyranose mutase ugm  the gene encoding ugm glf is essential for the viability of pathogens including mycobacterium tuberculosis and this finding underscores the need to understand how ugm functions considerable effort has been devoted to elucidating the catalytic mechanism of ugm but progress has been hindered by a lack of structural data for an enzyme  substrate complex such data could reveal not only substrate binding interactions but how ugm can act preferentially on two very different substrates udp galp and udp galf yet avoid other structurally related udp sugars present in the cell herein we describe the first structure of a ugm  ligand complex which provides insight into the catalytic mechanism and molecular basis for substrate selectivity the structure of ugm from klebsiella pneumoniae bound to the substrate analog udp glucose udp glc was solved by x ray crystallographic methods and refined to     resolution the ligand is proximal to the cofactor a finding that is consistent with a proposed mechanism in which the reduced flavin engages in covalent catalysis despite this proximity the glucose ring of the substrate analog is positioned such that it disfavors covalent catalysis this orientation is consistent with data indicating that udp glc is not a substrate for ugm the relative binding orientations of udp galp and udp glc were compared using saturation transfer difference nmr the results indicate that the uridine moiety occupies a similar location in both ligand complexes and this relevant binding mode is defined by our structural data in contrast the orientations of the glucose and galactose sugar moieties differ to understand the consequences of these differences we derived a model for the productive ugm  substrate complex that highlights interactions that can contribute to catalysis and substrate discrimination
