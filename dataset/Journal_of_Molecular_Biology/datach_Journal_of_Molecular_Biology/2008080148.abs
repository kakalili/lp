modulation of the packaging reaction of bacteriophage t terminase by dna structure
bacteriophage terminases package dna through the portal ring of a procapsid during phage maturation we have probed the mechanism of the phage t large terminase subunit gp  by analyzing linear dnas that are translocated in vitro duplex dnas of random sequence from  to   bp were efficiently packaged dye and short single stranded end extensions were tolerated whereas  base extensions hairpin ends   bp dna  rna hybrid and  kb dsrna substrates were not packaged molecules   bp long with  mismatched bases were translocated substrates with  mismatched bases a related d loop structure or ones with  base single strand regions were not a single nick in   or   bp duplexes irrespective of location reduced translocation efficiency but a singly nicked   bp molecule was packaged as effectively as an unnicked control a fluorescence correlation spectroscopy based assay further showed that a   bp nicked substrate did not remain stably bound by the terminase  prohead taken together two unbroken dna strands seem important for packaging consistent with a proposed torsional compression translocation mechanism
