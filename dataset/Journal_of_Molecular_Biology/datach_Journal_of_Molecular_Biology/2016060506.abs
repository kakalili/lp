tonic pka activity regulates sk channel nanoclustering and somatodendritic distribution
small conductance calcium activated potassium sk channels mediate a potassium conductance in the brain and are involved in synaptic plasticity learning and memory sk channels show a distinct subcellular localization that is crucial for their neuronal functions however the mechanisms that control this spatial distribution are unknown we imaged sk channels labeled with fluorophore tagged apamin and monitored sk channel nanoclustering at the single molecule level by combining atomic force microscopy and toxin i e  apamin pharmacology using these two complementary approaches we found that native sk channel distribution in pyramidal neurons across the somatodendritic domain depends on ongoing cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp protein kinase a pka levels strongly limiting sk channel expression at the pyramidal neuron soma furthermore tonic camp pka levels also controlled whether sk channels were expressed in nanodomains as single entities or as a group of multiple channels our study reveals a new level of regulation of sk channels by camp pka and suggests that ion channel topography and nanoclustering might be under the control of second messenger cascades
