solution structure determination of monomeric human iga by x ray and neutron scattering analytical ultracentrifugation and constrained modelling a comparison with monomeric human iga
immunoglobulin a iga  the most abundant human immunoglobulin mediates immune protection at mucosal surfaces as well as in plasma it exists as two subclasses iga and iga  and iga is found in at least two allotypic forms iga m  or iga m   compared to iga  iga has a much shorter hinge region which joins the two fab and one fc fragments in order to assess its solution structure monomeric recombinant iga m  was studied by x ray and neutron scattering its guinier x ray radius of gyration rg is   nm and its neutron rg is   nm both of which are significantly smaller than those for monomeric iga at      nm the distance distribution function p r for iga m  showed a broad peak with a subpeak and gave a maximum dimension of  nm in contrast to the p r curve for iga  which showed two distinct peaks and a maximum dimension of  nm the sedimentation coefficients of iga and iga m  were  s and  s respectively these data show that the solution structure of iga m  is significantly more compact than iga  the complete monomeric iga m  structure was modelled using molecular dynamics to generate random iga hinge structures to which homology models for the fab and fc fragments were connected to generate    full models a total of   compact best fit iga m  models gave good curve fits these best fit models were modified by linking the two fab light chains with a disulphide bridge that is found in iga m   and subjecting these to energy refinement to optimise this linkage the averaged solution structure of the arrangement of the fab and fc fragments in iga m  was found to be predominantly t shaped and flexible but also included y shaped structures the iga models show full steric access to the two fc ri binding sites at the c   c  interdomain region in the fc fragment since previous scattering modelling had shown that iga also possessed a flexible t shaped solution structure such a t shape may be common to both iga and iga  the final models suggest that the combination of the more compact iga m  and the more extended iga structures will enable human iga to access a broader range of antigens than either acting alone the hinges of both iga subclasses appear to show reduced flexibility when compared to their equivalents in igg and this may be important for maintaining an extended iga structure
