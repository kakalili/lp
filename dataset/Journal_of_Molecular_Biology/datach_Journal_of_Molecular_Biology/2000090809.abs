the three dimensional solution structure and dynamic properties of the human fadd death domain edited by a fersht
fadd also known as mort  is an essential adapter protein that couples the transmembrane receptors fas cd  and tumor necrosis factor receptor  tnf r  to intracellular cysteine proteases known as caspases which propagate and execute the programmed cell death inducing signal triggered by fas ligand fasl cd l and tnf fadd contains   amino acid residues and comprises two functionally and structurally distinct domains an n terminal death effector domain ded that promotes activation of the downstream proteolytic cascade through binding of the ded domains of procaspase  and a c terminal death domain dd  fadd dd provides the site of fadd recruitment to death receptor complexes at the plasma membrane by for example interaction with the fas receptor cytoplasmic death domain fas dd  or binding of the tnf r adapter molecule tradd we have determined the three dimensional solution structure and characterised the internal polypeptide dynamics of human fadd dd using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy of  n and  c  n labelled samples the structure comprises six  helices joined by short loops and displays overall similarity to the death domain of the fas receptor the analysis of the dynamic properties reveals no evidence of contiguous stretches of polypeptide chain with increased internal motion except at the extreme chain termini a pattern of increased rates of amide proton solvent exchange in the   helix correlates with a higher degree of solvent exposure for this secondary structure element the properties of the fadd dd structure are discussed with respect to previously reported mutagenesis data and emerging models for fasl induced fadd recruitment to fas and caspase  activation
