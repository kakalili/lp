ligand mediated dimerization of a carbohydrate binding module reveals a novel mechanism for protein  carbohydrate recognition
the structural and thermodynamic basis for carbohydrate  protein recognition is of considerable importance ncp  which is a component of the piromyces equi cellulase hemicellulase complex presents a provocative model for analyzing how structural and mutational changes can influence the ligand specificity of carbohydrate binding proteins ncp  contains two  family    carbohydrate binding modules designated cbm   and cbm   respectively that display unusually broad specificity the proteins interact weakly with xylan exhibit moderate affinity for cellulose and mannan and bind tightly to the    linked glucose mannose heteropolymer glucomannan the crystal structure of cbm   in complex with cellohexaose and mannohexaose identified key residues involved in ligand recognition by exploiting this structural information and the broad specificity of cbm   we have used this protein as a template to explore the evolutionary mechanisms that can lead to significant changes in ligand specificity here we report the properties of the e r mutant of cbm   which displays ligand specificity that is different from that of wild type cbm   the protein retains significant affinity for cellulose but does not bind to mannan or glucomannan significantly e r exhibits a stoichiometry of   when binding to cellohexaose and both calorimetry and ultracentrifugation show that the mutant protein displays ligand mediated dimerization in solution the three dimensional structure of e r in complex with cellohexaose reveals the intriguing molecular basis for this  dimeric  binding mode that involves the lamination of the oligosaccharide between two cbm molecules the  fold screw axis of the ligand is mirrored in the orientation of the two protein domains with adjacent sugar rings stacking against the equivalent aromatic residues in the binding site of each protein molecule of the molecular sandwich the sandwiching of an oligosaccharide chain between two protein modules leading to ligand induced formation of the binding site represents a completely novel mechanism for protein  carbohydrate recognition that may mimic that displayed by naturally dimeric protein  carbohydrate interactions
