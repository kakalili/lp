environmental stress induces trinucleotide repeat mutagenesis in human cells by alt nonhomologous end joining repair
multiple pathways modulate the dynamic mutability of trinucleotide repeats tnrs  which are implicated in neurodegenerative disease and evolution recently we reported that environmental stresses induce tnr mutagenesis via stress responses and rereplication with more than   of mutants carrying deletions or insertions  molecular signatures of dna double strand break repair we now show that knockdown of alt nonhomologous end joining alt nhej components  xrcc  lig  and parp  suppresses stress induced tnr mutagenesis in contrast to the components of homologous recombination and nhej which have no effect thus alt nhej which contributes to genetic mutability in cancer cells also plays a novel role in environmental stress induced tnr mutagenesis
