The motif1-hairpin (M1H), located on (−)-strands of Turnip Crinkle Virus (TCV)-associated satellite RNA C (satC), is a replication enhancer and recombination hotspot. Results of in vivo genetic selection (SELEX: systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment), where 28 bases of the M1H were randomized and then subjected to selection in plants, revealed that most winners contained one to three short motifs, many of which in their (−)-sense orientation are found in TCV and satC (−)-strand promoter elements. Ability to replicate in protoplasts correlated with fitness to accumulate in plants with one significant exception. Winner UC, containing only a seven-base replacement sequence, was the second most fit winner, yet replicated no better than a 28-base random replacement sequence. Fitness of satC containing different M1H replacement sequences could be due to enhanced satC replication or enhanced ability to affect TCV movement, since satC interferes with TCV virion accumulation, which is correlated with enhanced movement to younger tissue. Cells inoculated with TCV and UC accumulated fewer virions when compared to other winners that replicated better in protoplasts but were less fit in plants. UC, and other first and second round winners, contained structures that were on average 33% more stable in their (+)-strand orientation, and most formed hairpins with a A-rich sequence at the base. These results suggest that M1H replacement sequences contribute to the fitness of satC by either containing (−)-strand elements that enhance satRNA replication and/or a (+)-strand hairpin flanked with single-stranded sequence that enhances TCV movement.
