sh spot an algorithm to predict preferred ligands to different members of the sh gene family edited by j thornton
we have developed a procedure to predict the peptide binding specificity of an sh domain from its sequence the procedure utilizes information extracted from position specific contacts derived from six sh peptide or sh protein complexes of known structure the framework of sh peptide contacts defined on the structure of the complexes is used to build a residue residue interaction database derived from ligands obtained by panning peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage the sh specific interaction database is a multidimensional array containing frequencies of position specific contacts as input sh spot requires the sequence of an sh domain and of a query decapeptide ligand the array that we call the sh specific matrix is then used to evaluate the probability that the peptide would bind the given sh domain this procedure is fast enough to be applied to the entire protein sequence database panning experiments were performed to search putative specific ligands of different sh domains in a database of decapeptides or in a database of protein sequences the procedure ranked some of the natural partners of interaction of a number of sh domains among the best ligands of the        different decapeptides in the swissprot database we expect the predictive power of the method to increase with the enrichment of the sh specific matrix by interaction data derived from new complex structures or from the characterization of new ligands the procedure was developed using the sh domain family as test case but its application can easily be extended to other families of protein domains such as sh  mhc eh pdz etc
