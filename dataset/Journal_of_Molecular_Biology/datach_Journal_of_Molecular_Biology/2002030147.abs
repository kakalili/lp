long range correlations between dna bending sites relation to the structure and dynamics of nucleosomes
it has been established that the precise positioning of nucleosomes on genomic dna can be achieved at least for a minority of them through sequence dependent processes however to what extent dna sequences play a role in the positioning of the major part of nucleosomes is still debated the aim of the present study is to examine to what extent long range correlations lrc are related to the presence of nucleosomes using the wavelet transform technique we perform a comparative analysis of the dna text and of the corresponding bending profiles generated with curvature tables based on nucleosome positioning data the exploration of a number of eukaryotic and bacterial genomes through the optics of the so called  wavelet transform microscope  reveals a characteristic scale of    bp that separates two regimes of different lrc here we focus on the existence of lrc in the small scale regime    bp which are actually observed in eukaryotic genomes in contrast to their absence in eubacterial genomes analysis of viral dna genomes shows that like their host s genomes eukaryotic viruses present lrc but eubacterial viruses do not there is one exception for genomes of poxviruses vaccinia and melamoplus sanguinipes which do not replicate in the cell nucleus and do not exhibit lrc no small scale lrc are detected in the genomes of all examined rna viruses with the exception of retroviruses these results together with the observation of lrc between particular sequence motifs known to participate in the formation of nucleosomes e g aa dinucleotides strongly suggest that the    bp lrc are a signature of the sequence dependence of nucleosome positioning finally we discuss possible interpretations of these lrc in terms of the physical mechanisms that might govern the positioning and the dynamics of the nucleosomes along the dna chain through cooperative processes
