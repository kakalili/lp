progesterone receptor signaling mechanisms
progesterone receptor pr is a master regulator in female reproductive tissues that controls developmental processes and proliferation and differentiation during the reproductive cycle and pregnancy pr also plays a role in progression of endocrine dependent breast cancer as a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand dependent transcription factors the main action of pr is to regulate networks of target gene expression in response to binding its cognate steroid hormone progesterone this paper summarizes recent advances in understanding the structure  function properties of the receptor protein and the tissue cell type specific pr signaling pathways that contribute to the biological actions of progesterone in the normal breast and in breast cancer
