structural basis for stabilization of the hypervariable d domain of salmonella flagellin upon filament formation
the hypervariable d domain of salmonella flagellin composed of residues      is situated at the outer surface of flagellar filaments a flagellin mutant deprived of the complete d domain  d flic exhibited a significantly decreased thermal stability tm     c as compared to intact flagellin tm     c  however the stability of filaments formed from  d flic subunits was virtually identical with that of native flagellar filaments while d comprises the most stable part of monomeric flagellin playing an important role in the stabilization of the other two d and d  domains the situation is reversed in the polymeric state upon filament formation ordering of the disordered terminal regions of flagellin in the core part of the filament results in the stabilization of the radially arranged d and d domains and there is a substantial increase of stability even in the distant outermost d domain which is connected to d via a pair of short antiparallel  strands our experiments revealed that crosslinking the ends of the isolated d domain through a disulfide bridge gives rise to a stabilization effect reminiscent of that observed upon polymerization it appears that the short interdomain linker between domains d and d serves as a stabilization center that facilitates propagation of the conformational signal from the filament core to the outer part of filament because d is a largely independent part of flagellin its replacement by heterologous proteins or domains might offer a promising approach for creation of various fusion proteins possessing polymerization ability
