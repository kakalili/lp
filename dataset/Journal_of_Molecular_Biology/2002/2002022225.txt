Transfer RNA can play a role in amino acid activation by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. For the prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) of Methanococcus jannaschii, which activates both proline and cysteine, the role of tRNA in amino acid selection and activation is of interest in the effort to understand the mechanism of the dual-specificity. While activation of proline does not require tRNA, whether or not tRNA is required in the activation of cysteine has been a matter of debate. Here, investigation of a series of buffer conditions shows that activation of cysteine occurs without tRNA in a wide-range of buffers. However, the extent of cysteine activation is strongly buffer-dependent, varying over a 180-fold range. In contrast, the extent of proline activation is much less sensitive to buffer conditions, varying over only a 36-fold range. We also find that addition of tRNA has a small threefold stimulatory effect on cysteine activation. The lack of a major role of tRNA in activation of cysteine suggests that the dual-specificity enzyme must distinguish cysteine from proline directly, without the assistance of each cognate tRNA, to achieve the necessary specificity required for protein synthesis.
