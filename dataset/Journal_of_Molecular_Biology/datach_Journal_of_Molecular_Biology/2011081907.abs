rotations of the b sub domain of e coli uvrd helicase translocase coupled to nucleotide and dna binding
escherichia coli uvrd is a superfamily  dna helicase and single stranded dna ssdna translocase that functions in dna repair and plasmid replication and as an anti recombinase by removing reca protein from ssdna uvrd couples atp binding and hydrolysis to unwind double stranded dna and translocate along ssdna with   to   directionality although a uvrd monomer is able to translocate along ssdna rapidly and processively dna helicase activity in vitro requires a minimum of a uvrd dimer previous crystal structures of uvrd bound to a ssdna duplex dna junction show that its b sub domain exists in a  closed  state and interacts with the duplex dna here we report a crystal structure of an apo form of uvrd in which the b sub domain is in an  open  state that differs by an     rotation of the b sub domain to study the rotational conformational states of the b sub domain in various ligation states we constructed a series of double cysteine uvrd mutants and labeled them with fluorophores such that rotation of the b sub domain results in changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer these studies show that the open and closed forms can interconvert in solution with low salt favoring the closed conformation and high salt favoring the open conformation in the absence of dna binding of uvrd to dna and atp binding and hydrolysis also affect the rotational conformational state of the b sub domain suggesting that b sub domain rotation is coupled to the function of this nucleic acid motor enzyme
