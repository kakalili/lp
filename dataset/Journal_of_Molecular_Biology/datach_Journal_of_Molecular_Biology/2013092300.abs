nucleotide specific recognition of iron responsive elements by iron regulatory protein
irp  iron regulatory protein irp   is a bifunctional protein with mutually exclusive end states in one mode of operation irp binds iron responsive element ire stem  loops in messenger rnas encoding proteins of iron metabolism to control their rate of translation in its other mode irp serves as cytoplasmic aconitase to correlate iron availability with the energy and oxidative stress status of the cell irp ire binding occurs through two separate interfaces which together contribute about two dozen hydrogen bonds five amino acids make base specific contacts and are expected to contribute significantly to binding affinity and specificity of this protein rna interaction in this mutagenesis study each of the five base specific amino acids was changed to alter binding at each site analysis of ire binding affinity and translational repression activity of the resulting irp mutants showed that four of the five contact points contribute uniquely to the overall binding affinity of the irp ire interaction while one site was found to be unimportant the stronger than expected effect on binding affinity of mutations at lys  and ser   residues that make contact with the conserved nucleotides g  and c  respectively identified them as particularly critical for providing specificity and stability to irp ire complex formation we also show that even though the base specific rna binding residues are not part of the aconitase active site their substitutions can affect the aconitase activity of holo irp  positively or negatively
