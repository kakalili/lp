interaction of the c terminal domain of the e coli rna polymerase  subunit with the up element recognizing the backbone structure in the minor groove surface edited by r ebright
the c terminal domain of the  subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase  ctd is responsible for transcriptional activation through interaction with both activator proteins and up element dna previously we determined the solution structure of  ctd here we investigated the interaction between  ctd and up element dna by nmr dna titration curves and intermolecular noe measurements indicate that  ctd can bind to multiple sites on the up element dna unlike many transcription factors  ctd does not have a strict base sequence requirement for binding there is a good correlation between the strength of the interaction and the extent of intrinsic bending of the dna oligomer estimated from the gel retardation assay we propose that  ctd recognizes the backbone structure of dna oligomers responsible for the intrinsic bending moreover nmr studies and drug competition experiments indicated that  ctd interacts with the up element on the minor groove side of the dna the c terminal end of helix  the n terminal end of helix  and the loop between helices  and  are used for the interaction based on these observations we propose a model for the up element  ctd complex
