crystal structure of the nadp h dependent ketose reductase from bemisia argentifolii at    resolution edited by r huber
polyhydric alcohols are widely found in nature and can be accumulated to high concentrations as a protection against a variety of environmental stresses it is only recently however that these molecules have been shown to be active in protection against heat stress specifically in the use of sorbitol by the silverleaf whitefly bemisia argentifolii we have determined the structure of the enzyme responsible for production of sorbitol in bemisia argentifolii nadp h dependent ketose reductase bakr  to    resolution the structure was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction mad using the anomalous scattering from two zinc atoms bound in the structure and was refined to an r factor of     rfree     bakr belongs to the medium chain dehydrogenase family and its structure is the first for the sorbitol dehydrogenase branch of this family the enzyme is tetrameric with the monomer having a very similar fold to the alcohol dehydrogenases adhs  although the structure determined is for the apo form a phosphate ion in the active site marks the likely position for the adenyl phosphate of nadp h  the catalytic zinc ion is tetrahedrally coordinated to cys  his  glu  and a water molecule in a modification of the zinc site usually found in adhs this modified zinc site seems likely to be a conserved feature of the sorbitol dehydrogenase sub family comparisons with other members of the adh family have also enabled us to model a ternary complex of the enzyme and suggest how structural differences may influence coenzyme binding and substrate specificity in the reduction of fructose to sorbitol
