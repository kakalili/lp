temporal regulation of gene expression of the thermus thermophilus bacteriophage p
regulation of gene expression during infection of the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus hb with the bacteriophage p   was investigated macroarray analysis revealed host transcription shut off and identified three temporal classes of phage genes early middle and late primer extension experiments revealed that the   ends of p   early transcripts are preceded by a common sequence motif that likely defines early viral promoters t thermophilus hb rna polymerase rnap recognizes middle and late phage promoters in vitro but does not recognize early promoters in vivo experiments revealed the presence of rifampicin resistant rna polymerizing activity in infected cells responsible for early transcription the product of the p   early gene  shows a distant sequence similarity with the largest catalytic subunits of multisubunit rnaps and contains the conserved metal binding motif that is diagnostic of these proteins we hypothesize that orf  encodes rifampicin resistant phage rnap that recognizes early phage promoters affinity isolation of t thermophilus hb rnap from p   infected cells identified two phage encoded proteins gp  and gp  that bind the host rnap and inhibit in vitro transcription from host promoters but not from middle or late phage promoters and may thus control the shift from host to viral gene expression during infection to our knowledge gp  and gp  are the first characterized bacterial rnap binding proteins encoded by a thermophilic phage
