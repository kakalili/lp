crystal structure of cardiac troponin c regulatory domain in complex with cadmium and deoxycholic acid reveals novel conformation
the amino terminal regulatory domain of cardiac troponin c cntnc plays an important role as the calcium sensor for the troponin complex calcium binding to cntnc results in conformational changes that trigger a cascade of events that lead to cardiac muscle contraction the cardiac n terminal domain of tnc consists of two ef hand calcium binding motifs one of which is dysfunctional in binding calcium nevertheless the defunct ef hand still maintains a role in cntnc function for its structural analysis by x ray crystallography human cntnc with the wild type primary sequence was crystallized under a novel crystallization condition the crystal structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined to     resolution the structure displays several novel features firstly both ef hand motifs coordinate cadmium ions derived from the crystallization milieu secondly the ion coordination in the defunct ef hand motif accompanies unusual changes in the protein conformation thirdly deoxycholic acid also derived from the crystallization milieu is bound in the central hydrophobic cavity this is reminiscent of the interactions observed for cardiac calcium sensitizer drugs that bind to the same core region and maintain the  open  conformational state of calcium bound cntnc the cadmium ion coordination in the defunct ef hand indicates that this vestigial calcium binding site retains the structural and functional elements that allow it to coordinate a cadmium ion however it is a result of or concomitant with large and unusual structural changes in cntnc
