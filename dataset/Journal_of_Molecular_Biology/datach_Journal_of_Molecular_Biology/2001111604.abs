quadruple intercalated g  stack a possible motif in the fold back structure of the drosophila centromeric dodeca satellite  edited by i tinoco
the purine rich strand d gtacgggaccga n of the drosophila centromeric dodeca satellite sequence is highly conserved and was found to form stable fold back structures in which the homopurine   ggga   sequence was determined to play a crucial role here we report the stable formation of the d ggga  motif in the stem of a dna hairpin closed by a single residue d acc loop similar to the zipper like d gga  motif observed in the human centromeric tggaa n sequence the central four guanosine bases in the d ggga  motif do not pair but interdigitate to form an elongated zipper like quadruple intercalated g  stack bracketed by sheared g a base pairs comparison between the current d ggga  structure and the published crystal d gaaa  structure implies that the alignment of the unpaired purine bases plays an important role in determining the minor groove width of the purine rich d gpupua  motif similarity between the zipper like motifs possibly present in the drosophila centromeric dodeca satellite sequence and in the human centromeric tggaa n sequence led us to propose that these special zipper like motifs may constitute common cores in organizing eukaryotic centromeres
