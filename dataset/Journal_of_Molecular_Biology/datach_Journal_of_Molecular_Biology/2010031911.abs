regulation of oscillatory contraction in insect flight muscle by troponin
insect indirect flight muscle is activated by sinusoidal length change which enables the muscle to work at high frequencies and contracts isometrically in response to ca  indirect flight muscle has two tnc isoforms f binding a single ca  in the c domain and f binding ca  in the n and c domains fibres substituted with f produce delayed force in response to a single rapid stretch and those with f produce isometric force in response to ca  we have studied the effect of tnc isoforms on oscillatory work in native lethocerus indicus fibres oscillatory work was superimposed on a level of isometric force that depended on ca  concentration maximum work was produced at pca   at higher concentrations work decreased as isometric force increased in fibres substituted with f alone work continued to rise as ca  was increased up to pca   fibres substituted with various f f ratios produced maximal work at a ratio of    or    a higher proportion of f increased isometric force at the expense of oscillatory work the f f ratio was    in native fibres as measured by immunofluorescence using isoform specific antibodies the small amount of f needed to restore work to levels obtained for the native fibre is likely to be due to the relative affinity of f and f for tnh the lethocerus homologue of tni affinity of tnc isoforms for a tni fragment of tnh was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry the kd was     m for f binding and    nm for f  the higher affinity of f can be attributed to two tnh binding sites on f and a single site on f  stretch may be sensed by an extended c terminal domain of tnh resulting in reversible dissociation of the inhibitory sequence from actin during the oscillatory cycle
