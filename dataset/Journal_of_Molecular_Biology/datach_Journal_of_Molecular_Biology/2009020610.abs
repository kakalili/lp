structure of west nile virus ns protease ligand stabilization of the catalytic conformation
over the last decade west nile virus has spread rapidly via mosquito transmission from infected migratory birds to humans one potential therapeutic approach to treating infection is to inhibit the virally encoded serine protease that is essential for viral replication here we report the crystal structure of the viral ns protease tethered to its essential ns b cofactor and bound to a potent substrate based tripeptide inhibitor  naphthoyl lys lys arg h ki   nm  capped at the n terminus by  naphthoyl and capped at the c terminus by aldehyde an important and unexpected feature of this structure is the presence of two conformations of the catalytic histidine suggesting a role for ligand stabilization of the catalytically competent his conformation analysis of other west nile virus ns protease structures and related serine proteases supports this hypothesis suggesting that the common catalytic mechanism involves an induced fit mechanism
