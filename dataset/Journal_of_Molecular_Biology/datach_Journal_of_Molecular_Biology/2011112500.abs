ledgf p  tata less promoter is driven by the transcription factor sp
psip  pc and sfrs interacting protein  encodes two splice variants lens epithelium derived growth factor or p  ledgf p  and p  psip gene products were shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation affecting a plethora of cellular processes including cell proliferation cell survival and stress response furthermore ledgf p  has implications for various diseases and infections including autoimmunity leukemia embryo development psoriasis and human immunodeficiency virus integration here we reported the first characterization of the psip promoter using   rna ligase mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends we identified novel transcription start sites in different cell types using a luciferase reporter system we identified regulatory elements controlling the expression of ledgf p  and p  these include i minimal promoters       and      that drive the basal expression of ledgf p  and of the shorter splice variant p  respectively  ii a sequence       that may control the ratio of ledgf p  expression to p  expression and iii a strong enhancer         implicated in the modulation of ledgf p  transcriptional activity computational biochemical and genetic approaches enabled us to identify the transcription factor sp as a key modulator of the psip promoter controlling ledgf p  transcription through two binding sites at       and       overall our results provide initial data concerning ledgf p  promoter regulation giving new insights to further understand its biological function and opening the door for new therapeutic strategies in which ledgf p  is involved
