binding of two pria  prib complexes to the primosome assembly site initiates primosome formation
a direct quantitative analysis of the initial steps in primosome assembly involving pria and prib proteins and the minimal primosome assembly site pas of phage  x   has been performed using fluorescence intensity fluorescence anisotropy titration and fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques we show that two pria molecules bind to the pas at both strong and weak binding sites on the dna respectively without detectable cooperative interactions binding of the prib dimer to the pria  pas complex dramatically increases pria s affinity for the strong site but only slightly affects its affinity for the weak site associations with the strong and weak sites are driven by apparent entropy changes with binding to the strong site accompanied by a large unfavorable enthalpy change the pria  prib complex formed independently of the dna is able to directly recognize the pas without the preceding the binding of pria to the pas thus the high affinity state of pria for pas is generated through pria  prib interactions the effect of prib is specific for pria  pas association but not for pria  double stranded dna or pria  single stranded dna interactions only complexes containing two pria molecules can generate a profound change in the pas structure in the presence of atp the obtained results provide a quantitative framework for the elucidation of further steps in primosome assembly and for quantitative analyses of other molecular machines of cellular metabolism
