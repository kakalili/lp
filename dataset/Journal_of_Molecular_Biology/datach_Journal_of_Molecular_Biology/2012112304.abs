directed evolution of the forkhead associated domain to generate anti phosphospecific reagents by phage display
while affinity reagents are valuable tools for monitoring protein phosphorylation and studying signaling events in cells generating them through immunization of animals with phosphopeptides is expensive laborious and time consuming an attractive alternative is to use protein evolution techniques and isolate new anti phosphopeptide binding specificities from a library of variants of a phosphopeptide binding domain to explore this strategy we attempted to display on the surface of bacteriophage m  the n terminal forkhead associated fha  domain of yeast rad p which is a naturally occurring phosphothreonine pt binding domain and found it to be nonfunctional due to misfolding in the bacterial periplasm to overcome this limitation we constructed a library of fha variants by mutagenic pcr and isolated functional variants after three rounds of affinity selection with its pt peptide ligand a hydrophobic residue at position  in the   strand was discovered to be essential for phage display of a functional fha domain additionally by heating the phage library to   c prior to affinity selection with its cognate pt peptide we identified a variant g  that was   c more thermally stable than the wild type domain using g as a scaffold we constructed phage displayed libraries of fha variants and affinity selected for variants that bound selectively to five pt peptides these reagents are renewable and have high protein yields     mg l  when expressed in escherichia coli thus we have changed the specificity of the fha domain and demonstrated that engineering phosphopeptide binding domains is an attractive avenue for generating new anti phosphopeptide binding specificities in vitro by phage display
