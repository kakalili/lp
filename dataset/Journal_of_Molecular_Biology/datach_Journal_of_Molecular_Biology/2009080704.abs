an evolutionarily conserved family of virion tail needles related to bacteriophage p  gp  correlation between structural stability and length of the  helical trimeric coiled coil
bacteriophages of the podoviridae family use short noncontractile tails to inject their genetic material into gram negative bacteria in phage p  the tail contains a thin needle encoded by the phage gene   which is essential both for stabilization and for ejection of the packaged viral genome bioinformatic analysis of the n terminal domain of gp  residues     led us to identify a family of genes encoding putative homologues of the tail needle gp  to validate this idea experimentally and to explore their diversity we cloned the gp  like gene from phages hk   sf and hs  and characterized these gene products in solution all gp  like factors contain an elongated  helical coiled coil core consisting of repeating adjacent trimerization heptads and form trimeric fibers with length ranging between about   to     gp  tail needles display a high level of structural stability in solution with tm temperature of melting between  and    c to determine how the structural stability of these phage fibers correlates with the length of the  helical core we investigated the effect of insertions and deletions in the helical core in the p  tail needle we identified an  residue long helical domain termed micru minimal coiled coil repeat unit  that can be inserted in frame inside the gp  helical core preserving the straight morphology of the fiber likewise we were able to remove three quarters of the helical core of the hs tail needle minimally decreasing the stability of the fiber we conclude that in the gp  family of tail needles structural stability increases nonlinearly with the length of the  helical core thus the overall stability of these bacteriophage fibers is not solely dependent on the number of trimerization repeats in the  helical core
