the    resolution crystal structure of prostaglandin h synthase  structural insights into an unusual peroxidase
prostaglandin h synthase ec      is an integral membrane enzyme containing a cyclooxygenase site which is the target for the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and a spatially distinct peroxidase site previous crystallographic studies of this clinically important drug target have been hindered by low resolution we present here the    resolution x ray crystal structure of ovine prostaglandin h synthase  in complex with  methyl  biphenylacetic acid a defluorinated analog of the non steroidal anti inflammatory drug flurbiprofen detergent molecules are seen to bind to the protein s membrane binding domain and their positions suggest the depth to which this domain is likely to penetrate into the lipid bilayer the relation of the enzyme s proximal heme ligand his  to the heme iron is atypical for a peroxidase the iron  histidine bond is unusually long and a substantial tilt angle is observed between the heme and imidazole planes a molecule of glycerol used as a cryoprotectant during diffraction experiments is seen to bind in the peroxidase site offering the first view of any ligand in this active site insights gained from glycerol binding may prove useful in the design of a peroxidase specific ligand
