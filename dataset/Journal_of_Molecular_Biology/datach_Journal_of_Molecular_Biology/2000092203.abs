two proteins with the same structure respond very differently to mutation the role of plasticity in protein stability edited by j thornton
as part of a systematic study of the folding of protein structural families we compare the effect of mutation in two closely related fibronectin type iii fniii domains the tenth fniii domain of human fibronectin fnfn  and the third fniii domain of human tenascin tnfn  this comparison of the two related proteins allows us to distinguish any anomalous response to mutation although they have very similar structures the effect of mutation is very different tnfn behaves like a  typical  protein with changes in free energy correlated to the number of contacts lost on mutation the loss of free energy upon mutation is significantly lower for fnfn  particularly mutations of residues in the a b and g strands remarkably some of the residues involved are completely buried and closely packed in the core in fnfn  the regions of the protein that can accommodate mutation have previously been shown to be mobile we propose that there is a  plasticity  in the peripheral regions of fnfn  that allows it to rearrange to minimise the effect of mutations this study emphasises the difficulties that might arise when making generalisations from a single member of a protein family
