The gene encoding brain-specific dendritic BC200 small non-messenger RNA is limited to the primate order and arose from a monomeric Alu element. It is present and neuronally expressed in all Anthropoidea examined. By comparing the human sequence of about 13.2 kb with each of the prosimian (lemur 14.6 kb, galago 12 kb, and tarsier 13.8 kb) orthologous loci, we could establish that the BC200 RNA gene is absent from the prosimian lineages. In Strepsirhini (lemurs and lorises), a dimeric AluJ-like element integrated very close to the BC200 insertion point, while the corresponding tarsier region is devoid of any repetitive element. Consequently, insertion of the Alu monomer that gave rise to the BC200 RNA gene must have occurred after the anthropoid lineage diverged from the prosimian lineage(s). Shared insertions of other repetitive elements favor proximity of simians and tarsiers in support of their grouping into Haplorhini and the omomyid hypothesis. On the other hand, the nucleotide sequences in the segment that is available for comparison in all four species reveal less exchanges between Strepsirhini (lemur and galago) and human than between tarsier and human. Our data imply that the early activity of dimeric Alu sequences must have been concurrent with the activity of monomeric Alu elements thapt persisted longer than is usually thought. As BC200 RNA gave rise to more than 200 pseudogenes, we used their consensus sequence variations as a molecular archive recording the BC200 RNA sequence changes in the anthropoid lineage leading to Homo sapiens and timed these alterations over the past 35â€“55 million years.
