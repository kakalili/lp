bacteriophage  dna packaging dna site requirements for termination and processivity edited by m gottesman
bacteriophage  chromosomes are processively packaged into preformed shells using end to end multimers of intracellular viral dna as the packaging substate a   bp long dna segment cos contains all the sequences needed for dna packaging the work reported here shows that efficient dna packaging termination requires cos  s i segment in addition to the required termination subsite cosq and the nicking site cosn efficient processivity requires cosb in addition to cosqand cosn an initiation defective mutant form of cosbsponsored efficient processivity indicating that the terminase cosb interactions required for termination are less stringent than those required at initiation the finding that an initiation defective form of cosb is functional for processivity allows a re interpretation of a similar finding obtained previously that the initiation defective cosb of phage  is functional for processivity by the  packaging machinery the cosb   result can now be interpreted as indicating that interactions between cosb   and  terminase while insufficient for initiation function for processivity
