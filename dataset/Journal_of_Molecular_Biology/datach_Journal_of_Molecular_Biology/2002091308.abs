a comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis of the escherichia coli transcriptional activator soxs identifying amino acids important for dna binding and transcription activation
soxs is the direct transcriptional activator of the superoxide regulon soxs recognizes a highly degenerate  soxbox  dna sequence and activates transcription from class i and class ii promoters soxs is the smallest member of the arac xyls family of transcription regulators whose hallmark is dual helix turn helix hth dna binding motifs evidence suggests that the n terminal hth motif of soxs interacts with a highly conserved region of the soxbox termed recognition element  re  while the c terminal hth motif interacts with the less conserved recognition element  re  in the work described here we prepared a complete library of   soxs mutants containing single alanine substitutions of soxs and we characterized the mutant proteins in vivo and in vitro with soxs being closely related to mara we analyzed the effects of the soxs mutations in the context of the mara  mar crystal structure and with respect to the nmr study of mara  dna complexes in solution from the properties of the alanine substitutions we conclude the following   surface exposed residues of helix  and helix  the recognition helices of the dual hth motifs are important to dna binding and transcription activation however substitutions of residues predicted from the mara  mar crystal structure to make contact with the sugar  phosphate backbone are more detrimental to dna binding than mutations predicted to make base specific contacts   substitution of several residues within the recognition helix predicted to make base specific contacts with re have relatively little effect on dna binding suggesting the possibility of alternative protein  dna interactions than those inferred from the mara  mar crystal structure   dna binding and transcription activation were reduced by substitution of conserved amino acid residues comprising the hydrophobic core presumably because they disrupt the structural integrity of soxs   mutant k a appears to be a positive control mutant defective in a protein  protein interaction with rna polymerase that is required for transcription activation at all soxs dependent promoters because it binds and bends dna normally but fails to activate transcription from both classes of promoters alanine substitutions of surface exposed residues h  k  d  s  and v  confer a similar phenotype since these residues are near k  on the surface of the protein the surface formed by the six residues may be used to make protein  protein interactions with rna polymerase that are required for transcription activation at both class i and class ii soxs dependent promoters   mutants f a d a m a d a and q a appear to define a surface required for protein  protein interaction with rna polymerase specifically at class ii promoters because these positive control mutants bind and bend dna normally but are defective in activation of class ii promoters but not class i promoters these soxs mutants that bind and bend dna normally but are defective in transcription activation represent the first positive control mutants with putative defects in protein  protein interactions with rna polymerase among the soxs mara rob subset of the arac xyls family of transcription regulators
