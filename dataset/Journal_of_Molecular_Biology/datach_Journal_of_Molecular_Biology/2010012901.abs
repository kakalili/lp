rational design and biophysical characterization of thioredoxin based aptamers insights into peptide grafting
peptide aptamers are simple structures often made up of a single variable peptide loop constrained within a constant scaffold protein aptamers were rationally designed by inserting peptides into a solvent exposed loop on thioredoxin trx  they were designed to interact with the proteins elongation initiation factor e eif e and mouse double minute  mdm  and were then validated by competitive fluorescence anisotropy experiments the constructed aptamers interacted with eif e and mdm with apparent kd values of        m and        m respectively as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry itc  the mdm aptamer supertip interacted   fold more tightly with mdm than the free linear peptide    peptide  while the eif e aptamer elongation initiation factor gi sg interacted   fold less strongly than the free linear peptide elongation initiation factor gi  these differences in binding with respect to each aptamer s free peptide reveal that there are more factors involved than just constraining a peptide in a scaffold that lead to tighter binding itc studies of aptamer interactions reveal an enthalpic component more favorable than that for the free linear peptides as well as a larger unfavorable entropic component these results indicated that stapling of the free peptide in the scaffold increases the favorable enthalpy of the interaction with the target protein thermostability studies also revealed that peptide insertion significantly destabilized the trx scaffold by     c it is this destabilization that leads to an increase in the flexibility of the trx scaffold which presumably is lost upon the aptamer s interaction with the target protein and is the cause of the increase in unfavorable entropy in the itc studies the precise origin of the enthalpic effect was further studied using molecular dynamics for the mdm  supertip system which revealed that there were also favorable electrostatic interactions between the trx scaffold and the mdm protein itself as well as with the inserted peptide this work reveals that any increase in the binding affinity of an aptamer over a free peptide is dependent on the increase in the favorable enthalpy of binding which is ideally caused by stapling of the peptide or by additional interactions between the aptamer protein and its target these need to be sufficient to compensate for the destabilization of the scaffold by peptide insertion these observations will be useful in future aptamer designs
