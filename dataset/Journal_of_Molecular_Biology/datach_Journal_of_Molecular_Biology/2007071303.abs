substrate and product complexes of escherichia coli adenylosuccinate lyase provide new insights into the enzymatic mechanism
adenylosuccinate lyase adl catalyzes the breakdown of  aminoimidazole  n succinylocarboxamide ribotide saicar to  aminoimidazole  carboxamide ribotide aicar and fumarate and of adenylosuccinate ads to adenosine monophosphate amp and fumarate in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway adl belongs to the argininosuccinate lyase asl fumarase c superfamily of enzymes members of this family share several common features including a mainly  helical homotetrameric structure three regions of highly conserved amino acid residues and a general acid base catalytic mechanism with the overall  elimination of fumarate as a product the crystal structures of wild type escherichia coli adl ec adl  and mutant substrate h  a ads and product h  n amp  fum complexes have been determined to      and     resolution respectively the h  a ads and h  n amp  fum structures provide the first detailed picture of the adl active site and have enabled the precise identification of substrate binding and putative catalytic residues contrary to previous suggestions the ec adl structures implicate s  and h  in base and acid catalysis respectively furthermore structural alignments of ec adl with other superfamily members suggest for the first time a large conformational movement of the flexible c loop residues      in ec adl upon substrate binding and catalysis resulting in its closure over the active site this loop movement has been observed in other superfamily enzymes and has been proposed to be essential for catalysis the adl catalytic mechanism is re examined in light of the results presented here
