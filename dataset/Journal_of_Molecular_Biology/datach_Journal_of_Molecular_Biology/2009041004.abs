protein design through systematic catalytic loop exchange in the     fold
protein engineering by directed evolution has proven effective in achieving various functional modifications but the well established protocols for the introduction of variability typically limited to random point mutations seriously restrict the scope of the approach in an attempt to overcome this limitation we sought to explore variant libraries with richer diversity at regions recognized as functionally important through an exchange of natural components thus combining design with combinatorial diversity with this approach we expected to maintain interactions important for protein stability while directing the introduction of variability to areas important for catalysis our strategy consisted in loop exchange over a     fold phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase was chosen as scaffold and we investigated its tolerance to loop exchange by fusing variant libraries to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding gene as an in vivo folding reporter we replaced loops    and  of phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase with loops of varied types and sizes from enzymes sharing the same fold to allow for a better structural fit saturation mutagenesis was adopted at two amino acid positions preceding the exchanged loop our results showed that   to   of the generated mutants in the different libraries were folded some variants were selected for further characterization after removal of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene and their stability was studied by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy the sequences of   clones show that the introduction of variability at  hinges  connecting the loops with the scaffold exhibited a noticeable effect on the appearance of folded proteins also we observed that each position accepted foreign loops of different sizes and sequences we believe our work provides the basis of a general method of exchanging variably sized loops within the     fold affording a novel starting point for the screening of novel activities as well as modest diversions from an original activity
