native state energetics of a thermostabilized variant of ribonuclease hi edited by p e wright
escherichia coli rnase hi is a well characterized model system for protein folding and stability controlling protein stability is critical for both natural proteins and for the development of engineered proteins that function under extreme conditions we have used native state hydrogen exchange on a variant containing the stabilizing mutation asp  to alanine in order to determine its residue specific stabilities on average the  gunf value for each residue was increased by   kcal mol resulting in a lower relative population of partially unfolded forms though increased in stability by a uniform factor d a shows a distribution of stabilities in its secondary structural units that is similar to that of e coli rnase h but not the closely related protein from thermus thermophilus hence the simple mutation used to stabilize the enzyme does not recreate the balance of conformational flexibility evolved in the thermophilic protein
