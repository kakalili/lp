gene specific methylation control of h k and h k  on neurotrophic bdnf versus astroglial gfap genes by kdm a c regulates neural stem cell differentiation
neural stem cell nsc state and fate depend on spatially and temporally synchronized transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the expression of extrinsic signaling factors and intrinsic cell specific genes but the functional roles for chromatin modifying enzymes in neural differentiation remain poorly understood here we show that the histone demethylases kdm a jmjd a and kdm c jmjd c are essential for proper differentiation of nscs in vitro and in vivo kdm a c were required for neuronal differentiation survival and expression of the neurotrophic signaling factor bdnf in association with promoter h k demethylation and rna polymerase ii recruitment unexpectedly kdm a c were essential for selective h k  demethylation and loss of rna polymerase ii recruitment in transcribed regions of the astrocyte characteristic gene gfap thereby in parallel repressing astrocytic differentiation by control of elongation we propose that gene and lysine specific kdm a c mediated control of histone methylation and thereby regulation of intrinsic factors and signaling factors such as bdnf provide a novel control mechanism of lineage decision
