mechanical probes of sod predict systematic trends in metal and dimer affinity of als associated mutants
mutations and oxidative modification in the protein cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  have been implicated in the death of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  a presently incurable invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease here we employ steered all atom molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent to investigate the significance of either mutations or post translational modifications ptms to sod on metal affinity dimer stability and mechanical malleability the work required to induce moderate structural deformations as a function of sequence index constitutes a  mechanical fingerprint  measuring structural rigidity in the native basin from which we are able to unambiguously distinguish wild type sod from ptm variants and measure the severity of a given ptm on structural integrity the cumulative distribution of work values provided a way to cleanly discriminate between sod variants disulfide reduction destabilizes dimer stability more than the removal of either metal but not moreso than the removal of both metals intriguingly we found that disulfide reduction mechanically stabilizes apo sod monomer underscoring the differences between native basin mechanical properties and equilibrium thermodynamic stabilities and elucidating the presence of internal stress in the apo state all ptms and als associated mutants studied showed an increased tendency to lose either cu or zn and to monomerize  processes known to be critical in the progression of als the valence of cu strongly modulates its binding free energy as well several mutants were more susceptible to loss of metals and monomerization than the disulfide reduced or apo forms of sod  distance constraints are required to calculate free energies for metal binding and dimer separation which are validated using thermodynamic cycles when distance constraints are removed the results agree with those obtained from direct application of the jarzynski equality
