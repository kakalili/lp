structural basis for a disfavored elimination reaction in catalytic antibody d  edited by d rees
murine antibody d selectively catalyzes a highly disfavored  elimination reaction crystal structures of unliganded d and d in complex with a transition state analog tsa have elucidated a possible general base mode of catalysis the structures of the unliganded and liganded fabs were determined to   and     resolution respectively the structure of the complex reveals a binding pocket with high shape complementarity to the tsa which is recruited to coerce the substrate into the sterically demanding eclipsed conformation that is required for catalysis a histidine residue and two water molecules are likely involved in the catalysis the structure supports either a concerted e or stepwise e cb like mechanism for elimination finally the liganded d structure shows minor conformational rearrangements in cdr h  indicative of induced fit binding of the hapten  d has pushed the boundaries of antibody mediated catalysis into the realm of disfavored reactions and hence represents an important milestone in the development of this technology
