orientation of myosin binding protein c in the cardiac muscle sarcomere determined by domain specific immuno em
myosin binding protein c is a thick filament protein of vertebrate striated muscle the cardiac isoform cardiac myosin binding protein c cmybp c  is essential for normal cardiac function and mutations in cmybp c cause cardiac muscle disease the rod shaped molecule is composed primarily of  immunoglobulin or fibronectin like domains and is located at nine sites  nm apart in each half of the a band to understand how cmybp c functions it is important to know its structural organization in the sarcomere as this will affect its ability to interact with other sarcomeric proteins several models in which cmybp c wraps around extends radially from or runs axially along the thick filament have been proposed our goal was to define cmybp c orientation by determining the relative axial positions of different cmybp c domains immuno electron microscopy was performed using mouse cardiac myofibrils labeled with antibodies specific to the n and c terminal domains and to the middle of cmybp c antibodies to all regions of the molecule except the c terminus labeled at the same nine axial positions in each half a band consistent with a circumferential and or radial rather than an axial orientation of the bulk of the molecule the c terminal antibody stripes were slightly displaced axially demonstrating an axial orientation of the c terminal three domains with the c terminus closer to the m line these results combined with previous studies suggest that the c terminal domains of cmybp c run along the thick filament surface while the n terminus extends toward neighboring thin filaments this organization provides a structural framework for understanding cmybp c s modulation of cardiac muscle contraction
