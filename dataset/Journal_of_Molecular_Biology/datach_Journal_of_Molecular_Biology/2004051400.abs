the n terminal propeptide of lung surfactant protein c is necessary for biosynthesis and prevents unfolding of a metastable  helix
the lung surfactant associated protein c sp c consists mainly of a polyvaline  helix which is stable in a lipid membrane however in agreement with the predicted  strand conformation of a polyvaline segment helical sp c unfolds and transforms into  sheet aggregates and amyloid fibrils within a few days in aqueous organic solvents sp c fibril formation and aggregation have been associated with lung disease here we show that in a recently isolated biosynthetic precursor of sp c sp ci  a  residue n terminal propeptide locks the metastable polyvaline part in a helical conformation the sp ci helix does not aggregate or unfold during several weeks of incubation as judged by hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments further indicate that the propeptide reduces exchange in parts corresponding to mature sp c finally in an acidic environment sp ci unfolds and aggregates into amyloid fibrils like sp c these data suggest a direct role of the n terminal propeptide in sp c biosynthesis
