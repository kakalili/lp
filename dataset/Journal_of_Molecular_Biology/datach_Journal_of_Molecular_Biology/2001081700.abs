high resolution crystal structures of t phage  glucosyltransferase induced fit and effect of substrate and metal binding edited by r huber
glucosyltransferase bgt is a dna modifying enzyme encoded by bacteriophage t that transfers glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to  hydroxymethyl cytosine bases of phage t dna we report six x ray structures of the substrate free and the udp bound enzyme four also contain metal ions which activate the enzyme including mg  in forms  and  and mn  or ca  the substrate free bgt structure differs by a domain movement from one previously determined in another space group further domain movements are seen in the complex with udp and the four udp metal complexes mg  mn  and ca  bind near the  phosphate of the nucleotide but they occupy slightly different positions and have different ligands depending on the metal and the crystal form whilst the metal site observed in these complexes with the product udp is not compatible with a role in activating glucose transfer it approximates the position of the positive charge in the oxocarbonium ion thought to form on the glucose moiety of the substrate during catalysis
