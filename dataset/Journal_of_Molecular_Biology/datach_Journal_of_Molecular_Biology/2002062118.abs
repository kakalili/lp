the escherichia coli dam dna methyltransferase modifies dna in a highly processive reaction
the escherichia coli dam adenine n methyltransferase modifies dna at gatc sequences it is involved in post replicative mismatch repair control of dna replication and gene regulation we show that e coli dam acts as a functional monomer and methylates only one strand of the dna in each binding event the preferred way of ternary complex assembly is that the enzyme first binds to dna and then to s adenosylmethionine the enzyme methylates an oligonucleotide containing two dam sites and a  bp pcr product with four sites in a fully processive reaction on  dna comprising    bp and   dam sites e coli dam scans   dam sites per binding event in a random walk that on average leads to a processive methylation of  sites processive methylation of dna considerably accelerates dna methylation the highly processive mechanism of e coli dam could explain why small amounts of e coli dam are able to maintain the methylation state of dam sites during dna replication furthermore our data support the general rule that solitary dna methyltransferase modify dna processively whereas methyltransferases belonging to a restriction modification system show a distributive mechanism because processive methylation of dna would interfere with the biological function of restriction modification systems
