characterisation of bombyx mori odorant binding proteins reveals that a general odorant binding protein discriminates between sex pheromone components
in many insect species odorant binding proteins obps are thought to be responsible for the transport of pheromones and other semiochemicals across the sensillum lymph to the olfactory receptors ors within the antennal sensilla in the silkworm bombyx mori the obps are subdivided into three main subfamilies pheromone binding proteins pbps  general odorant binding proteins gobps and antennal binding proteins abps  we used the motifsearch algorithm to search for genes encoding putative obps in b mori and found   many fewer than are found in the genomes of fruit flies and mosquitoes the  genes include seven new abp like obps as well as the previously identified pbps three  gobps two and abpx quantitative examination of transcript levels showed that bmorpbp  bmorgobp  bmorgobp and bmorabpx are expressed at very high levels in the antennae and so could be involved in olfaction a new two phase binding assay along with other established assays showed that bmorpbp  bmorpbp  bmorgobp and bmorabpx all bind to the b mori sex pheromone component  e  z hexadecadien  ol bombykol  bmorpbp  bmorpbp and bmorabpx also bind the pheromone component  e  z hexadecadienal bombykal equally well whereas bmorgobp can discriminate between bombykol and bombykal x ray structures show that when bombykol is bound to bmorgobp it adopts a different conformation from that found when it binds to bmorpbp  binding to bmorgobp involves hydrogen bonding to arg  rather than to ser  as found for bmorpbp
