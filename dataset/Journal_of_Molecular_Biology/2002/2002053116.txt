With the aim to identify unconventional DNA polymerases from human cells, we have set up a special assay to fractionate HeLa extracts based on the ability (i) to bypass DNA lesions, (ii) to be resistant to aphidicolin and an inhibitory antibody against pol α and (iii) to be non-responsive to proliferating cell nuclear antigen. After eight different chromatographic steps, an aphidicolin-resistant DNA polymerase activity was obtained that was able to utilize either undamaged or abasic sites-containing DNA with the same efficiency. Biochemical characterization and immunoblot analysis allowed its identification as the human homologue of DNA polymerase θ (hpol θ), whose cDNA has been cloned by homology with the mus308 gene of Drosophila melanogaster but still awaited detailed biochemical characterization. The purified hpol θ was devoid of detectable helicase activity, possessed a 3′→5′ exonuclease activity and showed biochemical properties clearly distinct from any other eukaryotic DNA polymerase known so far. Misincorporation and fidelity assays showed that: (i) hpol θ was able to catalyze efficiently DNA synthesis past an abasic site; and (ii) hpol θ showed high fidelity. Our findings are discussed in light of the proposed physiological role of hpol θ
