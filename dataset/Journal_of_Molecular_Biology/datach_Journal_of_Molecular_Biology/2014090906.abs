direct interaction of     with ezrin promotes cell migration by regulating the formation of membrane ruffle
proteins have been shown to regulate the actin cytoskeleton remodeling cell adhesion and migration in this study we identified ezrin a cross linker between plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton as a novel     interacting partner the direct interaction between     and ezrin was validated in the cells and by in vitro assays we showed that the     binding region in ezrin was located within the n terminal and central  helical domains and that the  g to  i helices of     are responsible for the binding to ezrin functional analyses revealed that the regulation of cell migration and membrane ruffling by     is ezrin dependent for which the integrity of ezrin protein was required conversely the knockdown of     abrogates also the stimulatory effect of ezrin on cell migration and membrane ruffling moreover we found that the phosphorylation of thr  in ezrin facilitates the      ezrin interaction and the formation of membrane ruffles taken together these results suggest strongly that the functions of these two proteins in cell migration are linked and might be mediated by their direct physical interaction which is important for the formation of membrane ruffles
