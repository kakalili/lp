mutational analysis of the conserved bases c   and a   in the center of the decoding domain of escherichia coli  s rrna reveals an important tertiary interaction edited by j doudna
interactions within the decoding center of the  s ribosomal subunit have been investigated by constructing all  possible mutations at nucleotides c   and a   in helix  of  s rrna as expected most of the mutations resulted in highly deleterious phenotypes consistent with the high degree of conservation of this region and its functional importance a total of seven mutants were viable under conditions where the mutant ribosomes comprised    of the ribosomal pool a suppressor mutation specific for the c  u a  g mutant was isolated at position   in helix  of  s rrna in addition lack of dimethylation of a   a   caused by mutation of the ksga methylase enhanced the deleterious effect of many of the      mutations these data suggest that a higher order interaction between helices  and  in  s rrna is important for the proper functioning of the ribosome this is consistent with the recent high resolution crystal structures of the  s subunit which show a tertiary interaction between the      region of helix  and the dimethyl a stem loop
