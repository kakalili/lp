a unique hetero hexadecameric architecture displayed by the escherichia coli o  paaa  pare antitoxin  toxin complex
many bacterial pathogens modulate their metabolic activity virulence and pathogenicity through so called  toxin  antitoxin   ta modules the genome of the human pathogen escherichia coli o  contains two three component ta modules related to the known parde module here we show that the toxin ecpare maps in a branch of the rele pare toxin superfamily that is distinct from the branches that contain verified gyrase and ribosome inhibitors the structure of ecpare closely resembles that of caulobacter crescentus pare but shows a distinct pattern of conserved surface residues in agreement with its apparent inability to interact with gyra the antitoxin ecpaaa is characterized by two  helices h and h  that serve as molecular recognition elements to wrap itself around ecpare  both ecpaaa h and h are required to sustain a high affinity interaction with ecpare and for the inhibition of ecpare mediated killing in vivo furthermore evidence demonstrates that ecpaaa h  but not h  determines specificity for ecpare  the initially formed ecpaaa  ecpare heterodimer then assembles into a hetero hexadecamer which is stable in solution and is formed in a highly cooperative manner together these findings provide novel data on quaternary structure ta interactions and activity of a hitherto poorly characterized family of ta modules
