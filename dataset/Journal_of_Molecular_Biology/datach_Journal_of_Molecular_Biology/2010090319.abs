the critical roles of residues p  and f  of subunit a of the motor protein a atp synthase in p loop formation and nucleotide binding
the mutants p  a and f  a have been generated and their crystal structure was determined to resolutions of    and      respectively in order to understand the residues involved in the formation of the novel arched p loop of subunit a of the a atp synthase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot  both the structures show unique altered conformations for the p loop comparison with the previously solved wild type and p loop mutant s  a structures of subunit a showed that the p loop conformation for these two novel mutants occupy intermediate positions with the wild type fully arched and the well relaxed s  a mutant structures taking the extreme positions even though the deviation is similar for both mutants the curvature of the p loop faces the opposite direction deviations in the ger loop lying above the p loop are similar for both mutants but in f  a it moves towards the p loop by around    the curvature of the loop region v  v   located directly behind the p loop moves close by     towards the p loop in the f  a structure and away by     in the p  a structure two major deviations were observed in the p  a mutant which are not identified in any of the subunit a structures analyzed so far one being a wide movement of the n terminal loop region r  p   making a rotation of   and the other being rigid body rotation of the c terminal helices from q  a  by around   upwards taken together the data presented demonstrate the concerted effects of the critical residues p  a f   and s  in the unique p loop conformation of the a atp synthases
