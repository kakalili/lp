inhibiting the nucleation of amyloid structure in a huntingtin fragment by targeting  helix rich oligomeric intermediates
although oligomeric intermediates are transiently formed in almost all known amyloid assembly reactions their mechanistic roles are poorly understood recently we demonstrated a critical role for the  amino acid n terminus httnt segment of huntingtin htt in the oligomer mediated amyloid assembly of htt n terminal fragments in this mechanism the httnt segment forms the  helix rich core of the oligomers leaving much of the polyglutamine polyq segment disordered and solvent exposed nucleation of amyloid structure occurs within this local high concentration of disordered polyq here we demonstrate the kinetic importance of httnt self assembly by describing inhibitory httnt containing peptides that appear to work by targeting nucleation within the oligomer fraction these molecules inhibit amyloid nucleation by forming mixed oligomers with the httnt domains of polyq containing htt n terminal fragments in one class of inhibitors nucleation is passively suppressed due to the reduced local concentration of polyq within the mixed oligomer in the other class nucleation is actively suppressed by a proline rich polyq segment covalently attached to httnt studies with d amino acid and scrambled sequence versions of httnt suggest that inhibition activity is strongly linked to the propensity of inhibitory peptides to make amphipathic  helices httnt derivatives with c terminal cell penetrating peptide segments also exhibit excellent inhibitory activity the httnt based peptides described here especially those with protease resistant d amino acids and or with cell penetrating sequences may prove useful as lead therapeutics for inhibiting the nucleation of amyloid formation in huntington s disease
