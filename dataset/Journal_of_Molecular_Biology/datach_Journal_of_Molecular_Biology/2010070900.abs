a hinge in the distal end of the pacsin  f bar domain may contribute to membrane curvature sensing
the protein kinase c and casein kinase  substrates in neurons pacsins represent a subfamily of membrane binding proteins characterized by an amino terminal bin amphiphysin rvs f bar domain pacsins link membrane trafficking with actin dynamics and regulate the localization of distinct cargo molecules the f bar domain forms a dimer essential for lipid binding we have obtained crystals of authentic murine pacsin  that contain an ordered f bar domain indicating that additional domains are flexibly connected to f bar the structure shares similarity to other bar domains and exhibits special features unique to pacsins these include the uneven distribution of charged residues on the concave molecular surface and a so called wedge loop that is driven into the membrane upon binding of pacsin the murine pacsin  f bar domain requires dimerization for sensing of curved membranes and the present structure also provides a mechanism for higher order oligomer formation importantly comparison of murine with human and drosophila pacsin  f bar domains reveals stark differences in the orientation of distal helical segments leading to a wider crescent shape of murine pacsin  we define hinge residues for these movements that may help pacsins sense and concomitantly reinforce membrane curvature
