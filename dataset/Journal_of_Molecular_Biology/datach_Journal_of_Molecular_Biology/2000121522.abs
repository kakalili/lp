macromolecular assemblage of aminoacyl trna synthetases quantitative analysis of protein protein interactions and mechanism of complex assembly
the structure of the mammalian multi synthetase complex was investigated in vitro using qualitative and quantitative approaches this macromolecular assemblage comprises the bifunctional glutamyl prolyl trna synthetase the seven monospecific isoleucyl leucyl methionyl glutaminyl lysyl arginyl and aspartyl trna synthetases and the three auxiliary p  p  and p  proteins the scaffold p  protein was expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as a his tagged protein the different components of the complex were shown to associate in vitro with p  immobilized on ni  coated plates interactions between peripheral enzymes and p  are referred to as central interactions as opposed to lateral interactions between peripheral enzymes kinetic parameters of the interactions were determined by the means of a biosensor based approach the two dimeric proteins lysrs and asprs were found to tightly bind to p  with a kd value of   and  nm respectively these interactions involved the catalytic core of the enzymes by contrast binding of argrs or glnrs to p  was much weaker  gt  m  argrs and p  two peripheral components were shown to interact with moderate affinity kd  nm  since all the components of the complex are tightly associated within this particle lateral interactions were believed to contribute to the stabilization of this assemblage using an in vitro binding assay concomitant association of several components of the complex on immobilized p  could be demonstrated and revealed the involvement of synergistic effects for association of weakly interacting proteins taking into account the possible synergy between central and lateral contributions a sub complex containing p  p  argrs and glnrs was reconstituted in vitro these data provide compelling evidence for an ordered and concerted mechanism of complex assembly
