zebularine a novel dna methylation inhibitor that forms a covalent complex with dna methyltransferases
mechanism based inhibitors of enzymes which mimic reactive intermediates in the reaction pathway have been deployed extensively in the analysis of metabolic pathways and as candidate drugs the inhibition of cytosine c  specific dna methyltransferases c mtases by oligodeoxynucleotides containing  azadeoxycytidine azadc and  fluorodeoxycytidine fdc provides a well documented example of mechanism based inhibition of enzymes central to nucleic acid metabolism here we describe the interaction between the c mtase from haemophilus haemolyticus m hhai and an oligodeoxynucleotide duplex containing  h pyrimidinone an analogue often referred to as zebularine and known to give rise to high affinity complexes with mtases x ray crystallography has demonstrated the formation of a covalent bond between m hhai and the  h pyrimidinone containing oligodeoxynucleotide this observation enables a comparison between the mechanisms of action of  h pyrimidinone with other mechanism based inhibitors such as fdc this novel complex provides a molecular explanation for the mechanism of action of the anti cancer drug zebularine
