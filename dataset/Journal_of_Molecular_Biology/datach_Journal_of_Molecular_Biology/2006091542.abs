b  gene silencing in pituitary cells is regulated by its   enhancer
b cell specific b  ig  cd b genes in rat mouse and human are situated between the   growth hormone gh locus control region and the   gh gene cluster the entire gh genomic region is dnase  hypersensitive in gh expressing pituitary cells which predicts an  open  chromatin configuration and yet b  is not expressed the b  promoter and enhancers exhibit histone deacetylation in pituitary cells but histone deacetylase inhibition failed to activate b  expression the b  promoter and a   enhancer showed local dense dna methylation in both pituitary and non lymphoid cells consistent with gene silencing however dna methyltransferase inhibition did not activate b  expression either b  promoter constructs were minimally activated in transfected pituitary cells co transfection of the b cell specific octamer transcriptional co activator bob with the b  promoter construct resulted in high level promoter activity in pituitary cells comparable to b  promoter activity in transfected b cells unexpectedly inclusion of the b    enhancer in b  promoter constructs strongly inhibited b  transcriptional activity even when pituitary cells were co transfected with bob  both oct  and pit  bind the b    enhancer in in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay and in in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses these data indicate that the gh locus embedded tissue specific b  gene is silenced in gh expressing pituitary cells by epigenetic mechanisms the lack of a b cell specific transcription factor and likely by the b    enhancer acting as a powerful silencer in a context and tissue specific manner
