antiparallel conformation of knob and hole aglycosylated half antibody homodimers is mediated by a ch  ch hydrophobic interaction
bispecific antibody and antibody like molecules are of wide interest as potential therapeutics that can recognize two distinct targets among the variety of ways such molecules have been engineered is by creating  knob  and  hole  heterodimerization sites in the ch domains of two antibody heavy chains the molecules produced in this manner maintain their biological activities while differing very little from the native human igg sequence to better understand the knob into hole interface the molecular mechanism of heterodimerization and to engineer fc domains that could improve the assembly and purity of heterodimeric reaction products we sought crystal structures of aglycosylated heterodimeric and homodimeric  knob  and  hole  fc fragments derived from bacterial expression the structure of the knob into hole fc was determined at     except for the sites of mutation the structure is very similar to that of the native human igg fc consistent with a heterodimer interaction kinetic kd of lt nm homodimers of the  knob  and  hole  mutants were also obtained and their x ray structures were determined at resolutions    and    respectively both kinds of homodimers adopt a head to tail quaternary structure and thus do not contain direct knob knob or hole hole ch interactions the head to tail arrangement was disfavored by adding site directed mutations at f  and f  in the ch domains leading to increases in both rate and efficiency of bispecific heterodimer assembly
