nonmuscle myosin dependent synthesis of type i collagen
type i collagen synthesized in all tissues as the heterotrimer of two   i polypeptides and one   i polypeptide is the most abundant protein in the human body here we show that intact nonmuscle myosin filaments are required for the synthesis of heterotrimeric type i collagen conserved   stem  loop in collagen   i and   i mrnas binds the rna binding protein larp  larp interacts with nonmuscle myosin through its c terminal domain and associates collagen mrnas with the filaments dissociation of nonmuscle myosin filaments results in secretion of collagen   i homotrimer diminished intracellular colocalization of collagen   i and   i polypeptides required for folding of the heterotrimer  and their increased intracellular degradation inhibition of the motor function of myosin has similar collagen specific effects while disruption of actin filaments has a general effect on protein secretion nonmuscle myosin copurifies with polysomes and there is a subset of polysomes involved in myosin dependent translation of collagen mrnas these results indicate that association of collagen mrnas with nonmuscle myosin filaments is necessary to coordinately synthesize collagen   i and   i polypeptides we postulate that larp myosin dependent mechanism regulates the synthesis of heterotrimeric type i collagen by coordinating the translation of collagen mrnas
