crystal structure of the zinc binding transport protein znua from escherichia coli reveals an unexpected variation in metal coordination
bacterial atp binding cassette transport systems for high affinity uptake of zinc and manganese use a cluster  solute binding protein structures of four cluster  transport proteins have been determined previously however the structural determinants for discrimination between zinc and manganese remain under discussion to further investigate the variability of metal binding sites in bacterial transporters we have determined the structure of the zinc bound transport protein znua from escherichia coli to     resolution the overall structure of znua is similar to other solute binding transporters a scaffolding  helix forms the backbone for two structurally related globular domains the metal binding site is located at the domain interface the bound zinc ion is coordinated by three histidine residues his  his  and his   and one glutamate residue glu   the functional role of glu  for metal binding is unexpected because this residue is not conserved in previously determined structures of zinc and manganese specific transport proteins the observed metal coordination by four protein residues differs significantly from the zinc binding site in the znua transporter from synechocystis    which binds zinc via three histidine residues in addition the e coli znua structure reveals the presence of a disulfide bond in the c terminal globular domain that is not present in previously determined cluster  transport protein structures
