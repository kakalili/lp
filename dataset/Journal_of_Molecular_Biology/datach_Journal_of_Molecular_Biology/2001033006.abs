the mitochondrial proteins ssq and jac are required for the assembly of iron sulfur clusters in mitochondria edited by b holland
mitochondria of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contain three different hsp  chaperones ssc  ecm  and ssq  ssc is an essential protein that mediates the import of nuclear encoded proteins into the organelle and their subsequent folding the nucleotide state of ssc is thereby regulated by the nucleotide exchange factor mge  here we show that mge interacts with ssq in an atp dependent manner suggesting that mge also regulates ssq function in contrast to ssc  ssq does not associate with the tim  subunit of the protein translocating complex indicating a different function of both chaperones mutants in ssq were reported to have low levels of iron sulfur fes cluster containing enzymes employing an assay that allowed us to monitor the conversion of the apoform of mitochondrial ferredoxin into its fes containing holoform ssq was demonstrated to be required for the fes cluster assembly in mitochondria the mitochondrial dnaj homolog jac is crucial for this process whereas mdj function is dispensable furthermore the presence of frataxin is necessary for fes cluster assembly into ferredoxin suggesting a role for frataxin at the level of the formation of holo ferredoxin
