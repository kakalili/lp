high levels of wild type brca suppress homologous recombination
endogenous levels of the brca  breast cancer susceptibility  protein promote homologous recombination by regulating the essential strand exchange protein rad  to examine brca function in homologous recombination we expressed human brca in control mouse hybridoma cells as well as those that were depleted of endogenous brca by small interfering rna with moderate human brca expression homologous recombination was stimulated conversely a higher level of brca reduced homologous recombination and dna damage induced rad  foci formation cells expressing high levels of brca feature normal growth increased sensitivity to mitomycin c and increased illegitimate recombination brca overexpressing cells are also characterized by suppression of p  transcriptional regulation and a corresponding reduction in the expression of the p  responsive genes noxa and p  notably in cells expressing high levels of brca  small interfering rna depletion of human brca or ectopic expression of rad  increases homologous recombination and decreases illegitimate recombination thus high levels of wild type brca perturb rad  mediated homologous recombination and relatively normal recombination responses can be restored by rebalancing recombination factors
