context dependent remodeling of rad   dna complexes by srs is mediated by a specific protein  protein interaction
the yeast srs helicase removes rad  nucleoprotein filaments from single stranded dna ssdna  preventing dna strand invasion and exchange by homologous recombination this activity requires a physical interaction between srs and rad  which stimulates atp turnover in the rad  nucleoprotein filament and causes dissociation of rad  from ssdna srs also possesses a dna unwinding activity and here we show that assembly of more than one srs molecule on the   ssdna overhang is required to initiate dna unwinding when rad  is bound on the double stranded dna its interaction with srs blocks the helicase dna unwinding activity of srs  thus in different dna contexts the physical interaction of rad  with srs can either stimulate or inhibit the remodeling functions of srs  providing a means for tailoring dna strand exchange activities to enhance the fidelity of recombination
