the structure of a monomeric mutant cks protein reveals multiple functions for a conserved hinge region proline
cks cyclin dependent kinase subunit proteins are essential eukaryotic cell cycle regulatory proteins that physically associate with cyclin dependent kinases cdks to modulate their activity cks proteins have also been studied for their ability to form domain swapped dimers by exchanging  strands domain swapping is mediated by a conserved  hinge region containing two proline residues previous structural studies indicate that cks in its dimer form is unable to bind cdk suggesting that the monomer  dimer equilibrium of cks may have an effect on cks mediated cdk regulation we present the crystal structure of a proline to alanine mutant saccharomyces cerevisiae cks protein cks p a that preferentially adopts the monomer conformation but surprisingly fails to bind cdk comparison of the cks p a structure to that of other cks proteins reveals that pro  is critical for stabilizing a multiple  turn structure in the hinge region that properly positions an essential cdk binding residue additionally we find that these  turn formations conserved in cks homologs have implications for the mechanism and preferentiality of strand exchange together our observations suggest that the conservation of cks hinge region prolines reflects their functions in forming a cdk binding interface and that the ability of these prolines to control partitioning between monomer and dimer is a consequence of the  turn networks within the hinge
