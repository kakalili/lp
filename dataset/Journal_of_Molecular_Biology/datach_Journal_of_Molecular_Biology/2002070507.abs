the structure of an allosamidin complex with the coccidioides immitis chitinase defines a role for a second acid residue in substrate assisted mechanism
allosamidin is a known inhibitor of class  chitinases we show that allosamidin is a competitive inhibitor of the fungal chitinase cix from coccidioides immitis with a ki of  nm we report the x ray structure of the complex and show that upon inhibitor binding the side chain of asp  rotates to form an ion pair with the oxazolinium cation the mechanism of action is thought to involve protonation of the leaving group by glu  and substrate assistance by the sugar acetamido moiety to form an oxazoline like intermediate we converted both amino acid residues to the corresponding amide and found that each mutation effectively abolishes enzyme activity x ray structures show the mutant enzymes retain the basic wild type structure and that the loss of mutant activity is due to their altered chemical properties the high affinity of allosamidin and its similarity to the putative reaction intermediate suggests it is a transition state analog this helps validate our contention that the role of asp  is to electrostatically stabilize the reaction transition state
