the three dimensional structure of vim  a zn  lactamase from pseudomonas aeruginosa in its reduced and oxidised form
the crystal structures of the universally widespread metallo  lactamase mbl verona integron encoded mbl vim  from pseudomonas aeruginosa have been solved in their native form as well as in an unexpected oxidised form this carbapenem hydrolysing enzyme belongs to the so called b subfamily of mbls and shares the folding of      sandwich consisting of a core of  sheet surrounded by  helices surprisingly it showed a high tendency to be strongly oxidised at the catalytic cysteine located in the cys site cys   which in the oxidised structure becomes a cysteinesulfonic residue its native structure was obtained only in the presence of tris  carboxyethyl phosphine this oxidation might be a consequence of a lower affinity for the second zn located in the cys site that would also explain the observed susceptibility of vim  to chelating agents this modification if present in nature might play a role in catalytic down regulation comparison between native and oxidised vim  and a predicted model of vim  which shows one residue different in the cys site compared with vim  is performed to explain the different activities and antibiotic specificities
