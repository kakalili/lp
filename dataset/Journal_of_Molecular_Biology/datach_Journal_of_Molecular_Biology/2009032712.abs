characterisation of the nucleotide exchange factor itsn l evidence for a kinetic discrimination of gef stimulated nucleotide release from cdc
cdc  a member of the ras superfamily of small guanine nucleotide binding proteins plays an important role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton intracellular trafficking and cell polarity its activation is controlled by guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs  which stimulate the dissociation of bound guanosine   diphosphate gdp to allow guanosine   triphosphate gtp binding here we investigate the exchange factor activity of the dbl homology domain containing constructs of the adaptor protein intersectin l itsn l  which is a specific gef for cdc  a detailed kinetic characterisation comparing itsn l mediated nucleotide exchange on cdc  in its gtp versus gdp bound state reveals a kinetic discrimination for gef stimulated dissociation of gtp the maximum acceleration of the intrinsic mgdp      o n methyl anthraniloyl gdp release from cdc  by itsn l is accelerated at least    fold whereas the exchange of mgtp      o n methyl anthraniloyl gtp is stimulated only up to   fold at the same gef concentration the selectivity in nucleotide exchange kinetics for gdp over gtp is even more pronounced when a cdc  mutant f l is used which is characterised by fast intrinsic dissociation of nucleotides we furthermore show that both gtp and mg  ions are required for the interaction with effectors we suggest a novel model for selective nucleotide exchange residing on a conformational change of cdc  upon binding of gtp which enables effector binding to the cdc  gtp complex but at the same time excludes efficient modulation by the gef the higher exchange activity of itsn l towards the gdp bound conformation of cdc  could represent an evolutionary adaptation of this gef that ensures nucleotide exchange towards the formation of the signalling active gtp bound form of cdc  and avoids dissociation of the active complex
