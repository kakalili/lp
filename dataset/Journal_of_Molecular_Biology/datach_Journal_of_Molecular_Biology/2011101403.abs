complete modification maps for the cytosolic small and large subunit rrnas of euglena gracilis functional and evolutionary implications of contrasting patterns between the two rrna components
in the protist euglena gracilis the cytosolic small subunit ssu rrna is a single covalently continuous species typical of most eukaryotes in contrast the large subunit lsu rrna is naturally fragmented comprising  separate rna molecules instead of the bipartite  s  s eukaryotic lsu rrna typically seen we present extensively revised secondary structure models of the e gracilis ssu and lsu rrnas and have mapped the positions of all of the modified nucleosides in these rrnas   in ssu rrna and   in lsu rrna with only  lsu rrna modifications incompletely characterized  the relative proportions of ribose methylated nucleosides and pseudouridine     and     respectively are closely similar in the two rrnas however whereas the euglena ssu rrna has about the same absolute number of modifications as its human counterpart the euglena lsu rrna has twice as many modifications as the corresponding human lsu rrna the increased levels of rrna fragmentation and modification in e gracilis lsu rrna are correlated with a  fold increase in the level of mispairing in helical regions compared to the human lsu rrna in contrast no comparable increase in mispairing is seen in helical regions of the ssu rrna compared to its homologs in other eukaryotes in view of the reported effects of both ribose methylated nucleoside and pseudouridine residues on rna structure these correlations lead us to suggest that increased modification in the lsu rrna may play a role in stabilizing a  looser  structure promoted by elevated helical mispairing and a high degree of fragmentation
