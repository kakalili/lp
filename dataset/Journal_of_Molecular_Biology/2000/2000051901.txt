The molten globule state of α-lactalbumin has ordered secondary structure in the α-domain, which comprises residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123. In order to investigate which part of a polypeptide is important for stabilizing the molten globule state of α-lactalbumin, we have produced and studied three chimeric proteins of bovine and human α-lactalbumin. The stability of the molten globule state formed by domain-exchanged α-lactalbumin, in which the amino acid sequence in the α-domain comes from human α-lactalbumin and that in the β-domain comes from bovine α-lactalbumin, is the same as that of human α-lactalbumin and is substantially greater than that of bovine α-lactalbumin. Therefore, our results show that the stability of the molten globule state of α-lactalbumin is determined by the α-domain and the β-domain is not important for stabilizing the molten globule state. The substitution of residues 1 to 34 of bovine α-lactalbumin with those of human α-lactalbumin substantially increases the stability of the molten globule state, while the substitution of residues 86 to 123 of bovine α-lactalbumin with those of human α-lactalbumin decreases the stability of the molten globule state. Therefore, residues 1 to 34 in human α-lactalbumin is more important for the stability of the human α-lactalbumin molten globule state than residues 86 to 123. The stabilization of the molten globule state due to substitution of both residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123 is not identical with the sum of the two individual substitutions, demonstrating the non-additivity of the stabilization of the molten globule state. This result indicates that there is a long-range interaction between residues 1 to 34 and 86 to 123 in the molten globule state of human α-lactalbumin. The differences in the stabilities of the molten globule states are well correlated with the averaged helical propensity values in the α-domain when the long-range interactions are negligible, suggesting that the local interaction is the dominant term for determining the stability of the molten globule state. Our results also indicate that the apparent cooperativity is closely linked to the stability of the molten globule state, even if the molten globule state is weakly cooperative.
