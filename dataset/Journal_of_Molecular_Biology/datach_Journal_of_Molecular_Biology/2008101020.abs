the quaternary structure of a calcium permeable ampa receptor conservation of shape and symmetry across functionally distinct subunit assemblies
ampa receptors ampa rs are formed as heterotetrameric combinations of subunits known as glur  glur  the calcium permeability of ampa rs is controlled by the identity of the amino acid side chain contributed by each subunit at a key position in the conductance pathway which can be either a glutamine q or an arginine r  tetramers assembled only from q containing subunits are calcium permeable in contrast tetramers that incorporate r containing subunits are calcium impermeable both forms play key roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system here using electron microscopy we present the first quaternary structure of a calcium permeable q homomeric ampa r the receptor is elongated with overall  fold symmetry and a large central vestibule it is thus similar to the structure previously reported for an ampa r assembled exclusively from r subunits both structures differ from those reported for brain derived but urea washed  native  ampa rs which exhibited multiple asymmetrical conformations however even transient exposure of our q homomeric ampa rs to urea significantly attenuates the binding of a conformationally specific antibody as a result we propose a model in which all ampa rs share a  fold symmetrical structure and in which subunit dependent differences in assembly trafficking and electrophysiology are mediated within the framework of fundamentally similar quaternary conformations
