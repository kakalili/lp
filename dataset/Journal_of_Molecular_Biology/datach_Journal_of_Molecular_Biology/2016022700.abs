functionalization of an antisense small rna
in order to explore the possibility of adding new functions to preexisting genes we considered a framework of riboregulation we created a new riboregulator consisting of the reverse complement of a known riboregulator using computational design we engineered a cis repressing   untranslated region that can be activated by this new riboregulator as a result both rnas can orthogonally trans activate translation of their cognate independent targets the two riboregulators can also repress each other by antisense interaction although not symmetrically our work highlights that antisense small rnas can work as regulatory agents beyond the antisense paradigm and that hence they could be interfaced with other circuits used in synthetic biology
