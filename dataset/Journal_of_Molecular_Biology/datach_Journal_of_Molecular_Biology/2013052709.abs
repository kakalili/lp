the molecular architecture of the bacteriophage t neck
a hexamer of the bacteriophage t tail terminator protein gp  attaches to the top of the phage tail stabilizing the contractile sheath and forming the interface for binding of the independently assembled head here we report the crystal structure of the gp  hexamer describe its interactions in t virions that have either an extended tail or a contracted tail and discuss its structural relationship to other phage proteins the neck of t virions is decorated by the  collar  and  whiskers   made of fibritin molecules fibritin acts as a chaperone helping to attach the long tail fibers to the virus during the assembly process the collar and whiskers are environment sensing devices regulating the retraction of the long tail fibers under unfavorable conditions thus preventing infection cryo electron microscopy analysis suggests that twelve fibritin molecules attach to the phage neck with six molecules forming the collar and six molecules forming the whiskers
