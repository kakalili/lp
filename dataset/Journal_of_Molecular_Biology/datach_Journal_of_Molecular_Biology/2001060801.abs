structural studies of the trna domain of tmrna
tmrna is a small stable prokaryotic rna it rescues ribosomes that have become stalled during the translation of mrna fragments lacking stop codons or during periods of trna scarcity it derives its name from the presence of two separate domains one that functions as a trna and another that serves as an mrna we have carried out modeling and transient electric birefringence studies to determine the angle between the acceptor stem and anticodon stem of the trna domain of eschericia coli tmrna the results of the modeling studies yielded an interstem angle of    in agreement with the lower end of the range of angles        determined experimentally for various solution conditions the range of experimental angles is greater than the angles observed for any of the trna crystal structures in line with the presence of a shortened d stem the secondary structure of the trna domain is conserved for all known tmrna sequences so we propose that the angle is also conserved these results also suggest that the region of tmrna between p a and p b may interact with the decoding site of the ribosome
