evaluation of energetic and dynamic coupling networks in a pdz domain protein
a number of computational and experimental studies have identified intramolecular communication  pathways  or  networks  important for transmitting allostery here we have used mutagenesis and nmr relaxation methods to investigate the scope and nature of the communication networks found in the second post synaptic density  discs large zonula occludens  pdz domain of the human protein tyrosine phosphatase e protein hptp e  pdz  it was found that most mutations do not have a significant energetic contribution to peptide ligand binding three mutants that showed significant changes in binding also displayed context dependent dynamic effects both a mutation at a partially exposed site h y and a buried core position i v had a limited response in side chain h based dynamics when compared to wild type pdz  in contrast a change at a second core position i f that had previously been shown to be part of an energetic and dynamic network resulted in extensive changes in side chain dynamics this response is reminiscent to that seen previously upon peptide ligand binding these results shed light on the nature of the pdz dynamic network and suggest that position  in pdz acts as a  hub  that is energetically and dynamically critical for transmitting changes in dynamics throughout the pdz domain
