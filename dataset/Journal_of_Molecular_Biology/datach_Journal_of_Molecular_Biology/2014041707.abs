structural analysis of a fungal methionine synthase with substrates and inhibitors
the cobalamin independent methionine synthase from candida albicans known as met p is a  kda enzyme that consists of two     barrels the active site is located between the two domains and has binding sites for a zinc ion and substrates l homocysteine and  methyl tetrahydrofolate glutamate  met p catalyzes transfer of the methyl group of  methyl tetrahydrofolate glutamate to the l homocysteine thiolate to generate methionine met p is essential for fungal growth and we currently pursue it as an antifungal drug design target here we report the binding of l homocysteine methionine and several folate analogs we show that binding of l homocysteine or methionine results in conformational rearrangements at the amino acid binding pocket moving the catalytic zinc into position to activate the thiol group we also map the folate binding pocket and identify specific binding residues like asn   whose mutation eliminates catalytic activity we also report the development of a robust fluorescence based activity assay suitable for high throughput screening we use this assay and an x ray structure to characterize methotrexate as a weak inhibitor of fungal met p
