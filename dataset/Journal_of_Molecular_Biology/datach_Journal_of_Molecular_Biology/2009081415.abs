the folding trajectory of rnase h is dominated by its topology and not local stability a protein engineering study of variants that fold via two state and three state mechanisms
proteins can sample a variety of partially folded conformations during the transition between the unfolded and native states some proteins never significantly populate these high energy states and fold by an apparently two state process however many proteins populate detectable partially folded forms during the folding process the role of such intermediates is a matter of considerable debate a single amino acid change can convert escherichia coli ribonuclease h from a three state folder that populates a kinetic intermediate to one that folds in an apparent two state fashion we have compared the folding trajectories of the three state rnase h and the two state rnase h proteins with the same native state topology but altered regional stability using a protein engineering approach our data suggest that both versions of rnase h fold through a similar trajectory with similar high energy conformations mutations in the core and the periphery of the protein affect similar aspects of folding for both variants suggesting a common trajectory with folding of the core region followed by the folding of the periphery our results suggest that formation of specific partially folded conformations may be a general feature of protein folding that can promote rather than hinder efficient folding
