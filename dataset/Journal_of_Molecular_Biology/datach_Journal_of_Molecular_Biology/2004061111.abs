structural and functional characterization on the interaction of yeast tfiid subunit taf with tata binding protein
general transcription factor tfiid consisting of tata binding protein tbp and tbp associated factors tafs  plays a central role in both positive and negative regulation of transcription the taf n terminal domain tand of taf has been shown to interact with tbp and to modulate the interaction of tbp with the tata box which is required for transcriptional initiation and activation of tata promoter operated genes we have previously demonstrated that the drosophila tand region of taf  residues     undergoes an induced folding from a largely unstructured state to a globular structure that occupies the dna binding surface of tbp thereby inhibiting the dna binding activity of tbp in saccharomyces cerevisiae the tand region of taf displays marked differences in the primary structure relative to drosophila taf    identity yet possesses transcriptional activity both in vivo and in vitro here we present structural and functional studies of yeast tand and tand regions residues     and     respectively  our nmr data show that in yeast tand contains two  helices residues          and tand forms a mini  sheet structure residues          these tand and tand structured regions interact with the concave and convex sides of the saddle like structure of tbp respectively present nmr mutagenesis and genetic data together elucidate that the minimal region tand core required for gal dependent transcriptional activation corresponds to the first helix region of tand  while the functional core region of tand  involved in direct interaction with tbp convex  helix  overlaps with the mini  sheet region
