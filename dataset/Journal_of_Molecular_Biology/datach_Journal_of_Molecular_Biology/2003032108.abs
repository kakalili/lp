rapid kinetic analysis of ef g dependent mrna translocation in the ribosome
precise and coordinated movement of the trna  mrna complex within the ribosome is a fundamental step during protein biosynthesis the molecular mechanism for this process is still poorly understood here we describe a new sensitive method for monitoring elongation factor g dependent translocation of the mrna in the ribosome in this method the fluorescent probe pyrene is covalently attached to the   end of a short mrna sequence at position   translocation of the mrna by one codon results in a significant decrease in the fluorescence emission of pyrene and can be used to directly monitor mrna movement using rapid kinetic methods importantly this method offers the flexibility of using any trna or trna analog in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of translocation our results show that the mrna is translocated at the same rate as the trnas which is consistent with the view that the movement of the trnas and the mrna are coupled in the ribosome furthermore an anticodon stem loop analog of trna is translocated from the ribosomal a site at a rate constant that is   fold lower than peptidyl trna indicating that the d stem t stem and acceptor stem of a site trna contribute significantly to the rate of translocation
