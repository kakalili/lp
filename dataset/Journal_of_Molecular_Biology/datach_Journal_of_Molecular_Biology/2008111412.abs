characterization of protein fold by wide angle x ray solution scattering
wide angle x ray solution scattering waxs patterns contain substantial information about the three dimensional structure of a protein although waxs data have far less information than is required for determination of a full three dimensional structure the actual amount of information contained in a waxs pattern has not been carefully quantified here we carry out an analysis of the amount of information that can be extracted from a waxs pattern and demonstrate that it is adequate to estimate the secondary structure content of a protein and to strongly limit its possible tertiary structures waxs patterns computed from the atomic coordinates of a set of   protein domains representing all of known fold space were used as the basis for constructing a multidimensional space of all corresponding waxs patterns   waxs space   within waxs space each scattering pattern is represented by a single vector a principal components analysis was carried out to identify those directions in waxs space that provide the greatest discrimination among patterns the number of dimensions that provide significant discrimination among protein folds agrees well with the number of independent parameters estimated from a na ve shannon sampling theorem approach estimates of the relative abundances of secondary structures were made using training test sets derived from this data set the average error in the estimate of  helical content was   and of  sheet content was   the distribution of proteins that are members of the four structure classes        and    are well separated in waxs space when data extending to a spacing of     are used quantification of the information embedded within a waxs pattern indicates that these data can be used as a powerful constraint in homology modeling of protein structures
