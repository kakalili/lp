rescoring docking hit lists for model cavity sites predictions and experimental testing
molecular docking computationally screens thousands to millions of organic molecules against protein structures looking for those with complementary fits many approximations are made often resulting in low  hit rates   a strategy to overcome these approximations is to rescore top ranked docked molecules using a better but slower method one such is afforded by molecular mechanics  generalized born surface area mm  gbsa techniques these more physically realistic methods have improved models for solvation and electrostatic interactions and conformational change compared to most docking programs to investigate mm  gbsa rescoring we re ranked docking hit lists in three small buried sites a hydrophobic cavity that binds apolar ligands a slightly polar cavity that binds aryl and hydrogen bonding ligands and an anionic cavity that binds cationic ligands these sites are simple consequently incorrect predictions can be attributed to particular errors in the method and many likely ligands may actually be tested in retrospective calculations mm  gbsa techniques with binding site minimization better distinguished the known ligands for each cavity from the known decoys compared to the docking calculation alone this encouraged us to test rescoring prospectively on molecules that ranked poorly by docking but that ranked well when rescored by mm  gbsa a total of  molecules highly ranked by mm  gbsa for the three cavities were tested experimentally of these   were observed to bind  these are docking false negatives rescued by rescoring the  remaining molecules are true negatives by docking and false positives by mm  gbsa x ray crystal structures were determined for  of these  molecules in many cases the geometry prediction by mm  gbsa improved the initial docking pose and more closely resembled the crystallographic result yet in several cases the rescored geometry failed to capture large conformational changes in the protein intriguingly rescoring not only rescued docking false positives but also introduced several new false positives into the top ranking molecules we consider the origins of the successes and failures in mm  gbsa rescoring in these model cavity sites and the prospects for rescoring in biologically relevant targets
