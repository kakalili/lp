the nutrient dependent o glcnac modification controls the expression of liver fatty acid synthase
liver fatty acid synthase fas is pivotal for de novo lipogenesis loss of control of this metabolic pathway contributes to the development of liver pathologies ranging from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash which can lead to cirrhosis and less frequently to hepatocellular carcinoma therefore deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing the expression and function of key enzymes such as fas is crucial herein we link the availability of this lipogenic enzyme to the nutrient dependent post translational modification o glcnac that is thought to be deregulated in metabolic diseases diabetes obesity and metabolic syndrome  we demonstrate that expression and activity of liver fas correlate with o glcnacylation contents in ob ob mice and in mice fed with a high carbohydrate diet both in a transcription dependent and independent manner more importantly inhibiting the removal of o glcnac residues in mice intraperitoneally injected with the selective and potent o glcnacase oga inhibitor thiamet g increases fas expression fas and o glcnac transferase ogt physically interact and fas is o glcnac modified treatment of a liver cell line with drugs or nutrients that elevate the o glcnacylation interferes with fas expression inhibition of oga increases the interaction between fas and the deubiquitinase ubiquitin specific protease a usp a in vivo and ex vivo providing mechanistic insights into the control of fas expression through o glcnacylation together these results reveal a new type of regulation of fas linked to o glcnacylation status and advance our knowledge on deregulation of lipogenesis in diverse forms of liver diseases
