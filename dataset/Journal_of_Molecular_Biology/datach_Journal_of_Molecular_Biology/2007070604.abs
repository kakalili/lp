molecular and structural basis for redox regulation of  actin
an essential consequence of growth factor mediated signal transduction is the generation of intracellular h o  it operates as a second messenger in the control of actin microfilament dynamics causing rapid and dramatic changes in the morphology and motile activity of stimulated cells little is understood about the molecular mechanisms causing these changes in the actin system here it is shown that h o acts directly upon several levels of this system and some of the mechanistic effects are detailed we describe the impact of oxidation on the polymerizability of non muscle    actin and compare with that of muscle  actin oxidation of    actin can cause a complete loss of polymerizability crucially reversible by the thioredoxin system further oxidation of the actin impedes its interaction with profilin and causes depolymerization of filamentous actin the effects of oxidation are critically dependent on the nucleotide state and the concentration of ca  we have determined the crystal structure of oxidized  actin to a resolution of     the arrangement in the crystal implies an antiparallel homodimer connected by an intermolecular disulfide bond involving cysteine   our data indicate that this dimer forms under non polymerizing and oxidizing conditions we identify oxidation of cysteine   in the crystallized actin dimer likely to a cysteine sulfinic acid in    actin this is the cysteine residue most reactive towards h o in solution and we suggest plausible structural determinants for its reactivity no other oxidative modification was obvious in the structure highlighting the specificity of the oxidation by h o  possible consequences of the observed effects in a cellular context and their potential relevance are discussed
