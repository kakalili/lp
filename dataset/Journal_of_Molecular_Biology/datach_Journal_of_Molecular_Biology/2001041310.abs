high affinity t cell receptors from yeast display libraries block t cell activation by superantigens edited by i a wilson
the   t cell receptor tcr can be triggered by a class of ligands called superantigens enterotoxins secreted by bacteria act as superantigens by simultaneously binding to an mhc class ii molecule on an antigen presenting cell and to a tcr  chain thereby causing activation of the t cell the cross reactivity of enterotoxins with different v  regions can lead to stimulation of a large fraction of t cells to understand the molecular details of tcr enterotoxin interactions and to generate potential antagonists of these serious hyperimmune reactions we engineered soluble tcr mutants with improved affinity for staphylococcal enterotoxin c  sec  a library of randomly mutated single chain tcrs v  linker v  were expressed as fusions to the aga p protein on the surface of yeast cells mutants were selected by flow cytometric cell sorting with a fluorescent labeled sec  various mutations were identified primarily in v  residues that are located at the tcr sec interface the combined mutations created a remodeled sec binding surface and yielded a v  domain with an affinity that was increased by   fold kd   nm  a soluble form of this v  mutant was a potent inhibitor of sec mediated t cell activity suggesting that these engineered proteins may be useful as antagonists
