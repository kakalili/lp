dna packaging motor assembly intermediate of bacteriophage
unraveling the structure and assembly of the dna packaging atpases of the tailed double stranded dna bacteriophages is integral to understanding the mechanism of dna translocation here the bacteriophage   packaging atpase gene product   gp  was overexpressed in soluble form in bacillus subtilis psac  purified to near homogeneity and assembled to the   precursor capsid prohead to produce a packaging motor intermediate that was fully active in in vitro dna packaging the formation of higher oligomers of the gp  from monomers was concentration dependent and was characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation gel filtration and electron microscopy the binding of multiple copies of gp  to the prohead was dependent on the presence of an oligomer of   or   base prohead rna prna fixed to the head  tail connector at the unique portal vertex of the prohead the use of mutant prnas demonstrated that gp  bound specifically to the a helix of prna and ribonuclease footprinting of gp  on prna showed that gp  protected the cc residues of the cca bulge residues     of the a helix the binding of gp  to the prohead prna to constitute the complete and active packaging motor was confirmed by cryo electron microscopy three dimensional reconstruction of the prohead prna gp  complex the complex was capable of supercoiling dna  gp as observed previously for gp  alone therefore the binding of gp  to the prohead rather than first to dna  gp  represents an alternative packaging motor assembly pathway
