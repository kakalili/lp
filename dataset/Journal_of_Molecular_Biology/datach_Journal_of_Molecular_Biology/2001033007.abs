an expressed sequence tag est data mining strategy succeeding in the discovery of new g protein coupled receptors edited by j thornton
we have developed a comprehensive expressed sequence tag database search method and used it for the identification of new members of the g protein coupled receptor superfamily our approach proved to be especially useful for the detection of expressed sequence tag sequences that do not encode conserved parts of a protein making it an ideal tool for the identification of members of divergent protein families or of protein parts without conserved domain structures in the expressed sequence tag database at least  of the expressed sequence tags found with this strategy are promising candidates for new putative g protein coupled receptors here we describe the sequence and expression analysis of five new members of this receptor superfamily namely gpr  gpr  gpr  gpr  and gpr  we also studied the genomic structure and chromosomal localization of the respective genes applying in silico methods a cluster of six closely related g protein coupled receptors was found on the human chromosome q  q  it consists of four orphan receptors gpr  gpr  gpr  and h   the purinergic receptor p y  and the uridine   diphosphoglucose receptor kiaa   it seems likely that these receptors evolved from a common ancestor and therefore might have related ligands in conclusion we describe a data mining procedure that proved to be useful for the identification and first characterization of new genes and is well applicable for other gene families
