toxin  antitoxin loci as stress response elements chpak mazf and chpbk cleave translated rnas and are counteracted by tmrna
prokaryotic chromosomes encode toxin  antitoxin loci often in multiple copies in most cases the function of these genes is not known the chpa mazef locus of escherichia coli has been described as a cell killing module that induces bacterial apoptosis during nutritional stress however we found recently that chpak mazf does not confer cell killing but rather induces a bacteriostatic condition from which the cells could be resuscitated results presented here yield a mechanistic explanation for the detrimental effect on cell growth exerted by chpak and the homologous chpbk protein of e coli we show that both proteins inhibit translation by inducing cleavage of translated mrnas consistently the inhibitory effect of the proteins was counteracted by tmrna amino acid starvation induced strong transcription of chpa that depended on lon protease but not on ppgpp simultaneously chpak cleaved tmrna in its coding region thus chpak and chpbk inhibit translation by a mechanism very similar to that of e coli rele on the basis of these results we propose a model that integrates ta loci into general prokaryotic stress physiology
