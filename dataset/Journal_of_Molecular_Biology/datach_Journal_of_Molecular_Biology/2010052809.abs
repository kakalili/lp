the effect of monastrol on the processive motility of a dimeric kinesin  head kinesin  stalk chimera
controlled activity of several kinesin motors is required for the proper assembly of the mitotic spindle eg  a homotetrameric bipolar kinesin  from xenopus laevis can cross link and slide anti parallel microtubules apart by a motility mechanism comprising diffusional and directional modes how this mechanism is regulated possibly by the tail domains of the opposing motors is poorly understood in order to explore the basic unregulated kinesin  motor activity we generated a stably dimeric kinesin  construct eg kin consisting of the motor domain and neck linker of eg and the neck coiled coil of drosophila melanogaster kinesin  dmkhc  in single molecule motility assays we found this chimera to be highly processive in addition we studied the effect of the kinesin  specific inhibitor monastrol using single molecule fluorescence assays we found that monastrol reduced the length of processive runs but strikingly did not affect velocity quantitative analysis of monastrol dose dependence suggests that two bound monastrol molecules are required to be bound to an eg kin dimer to terminate a run
