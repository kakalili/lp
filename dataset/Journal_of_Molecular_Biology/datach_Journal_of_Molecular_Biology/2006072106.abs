interplay between ion binding and catalysis in the thioredoxin coupled arsenate reductase family
in the thioredoxin trx coupled arsenate reductase family arsenate reductase from staphylococcus aureus plasmid pi   sa arsc and from bacillus subtilis bs arsc are structurally related detoxification enzymes catalysis of the reduction of arsenate to arsenite involves a p loop cys thr gly asn ser cys arg  structural motif and a disulphide cascade between three conserved cysteine residues cys  cys  and cys   for its activity sa arsc benefits from the binding of tetrahedral oxyanions in the p loop active site and from the binding of potassium in a specific cation binding site in contrast the steady state kinetic parameters of bs arsc are not affected by sulphate or potassium the commonly occurring mutation of a histidine h   located about    from the potassium binding site in sa arsc to a glutamine uncouples the kinetic dependency on potassium in addition the binding affinity for potassium is affected by the presence of a lysine k  or an aspartic acid d  in combination with two negative charges d  and e  on the surface of trx coupled arsenate reductases in the p loop of the trx coupled arsenate reductase family the peptide bond between gly  and asn  can adopt two distinct conformations the unique geometry of the p loop with asn  in  conformation which is not observed in structurally related lmw ptpases is stabilized by tetrahedral oxyanions and decreases the pka value of cys  and cys  tetrahedral oxyanions stabilize the p loop in its catalytically most active form which might explain the observed increase in kcat value for sa arsc therefore a subtle interplay of potassium and sulphate dictates the kinetics of trx coupled arsenate reductases
