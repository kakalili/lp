novel interaction of ornithine decarboxylase with sepiapterin reductase regulates neuroblastoma cell proliferation
ornithine decarboxylase odc is the sentinel enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis both odc and polyamines regulate cell division proliferation and apoptosis sepiapterin reductase spr catalyzes the last step in the biosynthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin bh  an essential cofactor of nitric oxide synthase and has been implicated in neurological diseases but not yet in cancer in this study we present compelling evidence that native odc and spr physically interact and we defined the individual amino acid residues involved in both enzymes using in silico protein  protein docking simulations the resulting heterocomplex is a surprisingly compact structure featuring two energetically and structurally equivalent binding modes both in monomer and in dimer conformations the novel interaction between odc and spr proteins was confirmed under physiological conditions by co immunoprecipitation and co localization in neuroblastoma nb cells importantly we showed that sirna small interfering rna mediated knockdown of spr expression significantly reduced endogenous odc enzyme activity in nb cells thus demonstrating the biological relevance of the odc  spr interaction finally in a cohort of  human nb tumors we found that high spr mrna expression correlated significantly with poor survival prognosis using a kaplan  meier analysis log rank test p       suggesting an oncogenic role for spr in nb tumorigenesis in conclusion we showed that odc binds spr and thus propose a new concept in which two well characterized biochemical pathways converge via the interaction of two enzymes we identified spr as a novel regulator of odc enzyme activity and based on clinical evidence present a model in which spr drives odc mediated malignant progression in nb
