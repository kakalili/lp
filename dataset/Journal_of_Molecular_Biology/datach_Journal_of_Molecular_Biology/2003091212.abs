visualization by cryo electron microscopy of genomic rna that binds to the protein capsid inside bacteriophage ms
the icosahedrally symmetrized structure of bacteriophage ms as determined by cryo electron microscopy em reveals the presence of genomic rna that attaches to coat protein dimers earlier x ray diffraction studies revealed similar interactions between the unique operator hairpin of the ms genomic rna and the coat protein dimer this observation leads us to conclude that not only the operator but also many other rna sequences in the genome of ms  are able to bind to the coat protein dimer a substantial number of potential coat protein dimer binding sites are present in the genome of ms that can account for the observed rna densities in the em map moreover it appears that these stem loop structures are able to bind in a similar fashion to the coat protein dimer as the wild type operator hairpin the em map also shows additional density between the potential operator binding sites linking the rna stem loops together to form an icosahedral network around the  and  fold axes this rna network is bound to the inside of the ms capsid and probably influences both capsid stability and formation supporting the idea that capsid formation and rna packaging are intimately linked to each other
