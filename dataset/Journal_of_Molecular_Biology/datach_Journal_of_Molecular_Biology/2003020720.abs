nmr structure of a variant human prion protein with two disulfide bridges
the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the globular domain with residues      of a variant human prion protein with two disulfide bonds hprp m  c e  c  shows the same global fold as wild type hprp       it contains three  helices of residues           and      an anti parallel  sheet of residues      and      and the disulfides cys  cys  and cys  cys   the engineered extra disulfide bond in the presumed  protein x  binding site is accommodated with slight strictly localized conformational changes high compatibility of hprp with insertion of a second disulfide bridge in the protein x epitope was further substantiated by model calculations with additional variant structures the ease with which the hprp structure can accommodate a variety of locations for a second disulfide bond within the presumed protein x binding epitope suggests a functional role for the extensive perturbation by a natural second disulfide bond of the corresponding region in the human doppel protein
