structure of an amide bond forming f     glutamyl ligase from archaeoglobus fulgidus  a member of a new family of non ribosomal peptide synthases
f  is a flavin like redox active coenzyme commonly used by archaea and some eubacteria in a variety of biochemical reactions in methanogenesis the formation of secondary metabolites the degradation of nitroaromatic compounds activation of nitroimidazofurans and f  dependent photolysis in dna repair coenzyme f   biosynthesis from   didemethyl  hydroxy  deazariboflavin fo and lactaldehyde involves six enzymatic steps and five proteins cofa cofb cofc cofd and cofe  cofe a f     glutamyl ligase is responsible for the last two enzymatic steps it catalyses the gtp dependent addition of two l glutamate residues to f   to form f    cofe is found in archaea the aerobic actinomycetes and cyanobacteria here we report the first crystal structure of the apo f     glutamyl ligase cofe af from archaeoglobus fulgidus and its complex with gdp at     and     resolution respectively the structure of cofe af reveals a novel protein fold with an intertwined butterfly like dimer formed by two domain monomers gdp and mn  are bound within the putative active site in a large groove at the dimer interface we show that the enzyme adds a glutamate residue to both f   and f   in two distinct steps cofe represents the first member of a new structural family of non ribosomal peptide synthases
