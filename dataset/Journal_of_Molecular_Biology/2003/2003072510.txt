The macrolide–lincosamide–streptogramin B class (MLS) of antibiotics contains structurally different but functionally similar drugs, that all bind to the 50S ribosomal subunit. It has been suggested that these compounds block the path by which nascent peptides exit the ribosome. We have studied the mechanisms of action of four macrolides (erythromycin, josamycin, spiramycin and telithromycin), one lincosamide (clindamycin) and one streptogramin B (pristinamycin IA). All these MLS drugs cause dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome. Josamycin, spiramycin and clindamycin, that extend to the peptidyl transferase center, cause dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs containing two, three or four amino acid residues. Erythromycin, which does not reach the peptidyl transferase center, induces dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs containing six, seven or eight amino acid residues. Pristinamycin IA causes dissociation of peptidyl-tRNAs with six amino acid residues and telithromycin allows polymerisation of nine or ten amino acid residues before peptidyl-tRNA dissociates. Our data, in combination with previous structural information, suggest a common mode of action for all MLS antibiotics, which is modulated by the space available between the peptidyl transferase center and the drug.
