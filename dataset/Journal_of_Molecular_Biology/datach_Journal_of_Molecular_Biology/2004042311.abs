the crystal structure of three site directed mutants of escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase further evidence for a catalytic triad
dihydrodipicolinate synthase dhdps ec      catalyses the branchpoint reaction of lysine biosynthesis in plants and microbes the condensation of s aspartate  semialdehyde and pyruvate the crystal structure of wild type dhdps has been published to    revealing a tetrameric molecule comprised of four identical     barrels each containing one active site previous workers have hypothesised that the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme involves a catalytic triad of amino acid residues tyr   thr  and tyr   which provide a proton shuttle to transport protons from the active site to solvent we have tested this hypothesis using site directed mutagenesis to produce three mutant enzymes dhdps y  f dhdps t v and dhdps y  f each of these mutants has substantially reduced activity consistent with the catalytic triad hypothesis we have determined each mutant crystal structure to at least    resolution and compared the structures to the wild type enzyme all mutant enzymes crystallised in the same space group as the wild type form and only minor differences in structure are observed these results suggest that the catalytic triad is indeed in operation in wild type dhdps
