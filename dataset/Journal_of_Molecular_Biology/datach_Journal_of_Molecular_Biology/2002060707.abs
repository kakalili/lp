crystal structure of shikimate kinase from mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals the dynamic role of the lid domain in catalysis
shikimate kinase sk and other enzymes in the shikimate pathway are potential targets for developing non toxic antimicrobial agents herbicides and anti parasite drugs because the pathway is essential in the above species but is absent from mammals the crystal structure of mycobacterium tuberculosis sk mtsk in complex with mgadp has been determined at    resolution revealing critical information for the structure based design of novel anti m tuberculosis agents mtsk with a five stranded parallel  sheet flanked by eight  helices has three domains the core domain the shikimate binding domain sb  and the lid domain the adp molecule is bound with its adenine moiety sandwiched between the side chains of arg  and pro   its  phosphate group in the p loop and the  and  phosphate groups hydrogen bonded to the guanidinium group of arg   arg  is located in the lid domain is strictly conserved in sk sequences is observed for the first time to interact with any bound nucleotide and appears to be important in both substrate binding and catalysis the crystal structure of mtsk this work and that of erwinia chrysanthemi sk suggest a concerted conformational change of the lid and sb domains upon nucleotide binding
