smpb contributes to reading frame selection in the translation of transfer  messenger rna
transfer  messenger rna tmrna acts first as a trna and then as an mrna template to rescue stalled ribosomes in eubacteria together with its protein partner smpb small protein b  tmrna enters stalled ribosomes and transfers an ala residue to the growing polypeptide chain a remarkable step then occurs the ribosome leaves the stalled mrna and resumes translation using tmrna as a template adding a short peptide tag that destines the aborted protein for destruction exactly how the ribosome switches templates resuming translation on tmrna in the proper reading frame remains unknown within the tmrna sequence itself five nucleotides u aguc immediately upstream of the first codon appear to direct frame selection in particular mutation of the conserved a  results in severe loss of function both in vitro and in vivo the a c mutation causes translation to resume exclusively in the  frame several candidate binding partners for this upstream sequence have been identified in vitro using a genetic selection for tmrna activity in escherichia coli we identified mutations in the smpb protein that restore the function of a c tmrna in vivo the smpb mutants increase tagging in the normal reading frame and reduce tagging in the  frame these results demonstrate that smpb is functionally linked with the sequence upstream of the tmrna template both contribute to reading frame selection on tmrna
