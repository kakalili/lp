l-Gulonate 3-dehydrogenase (GDH) is a bifunctional dimeric protein that functions not only as an NAD+-dependent enzyme in the uronate cycle but also as a taxon-specific λ-crystallin in rabbit lens. Here we report the first crystal structure of GDH in both apo form and NADH-bound holo form. The GDH protomer consists of two structural domains: the N-terminal domain with a Rossmann fold and the C-terminal domain with a novel helical fold. In the N-terminal domain of the NADH-bound structure, we identified 11 coenzyme-binding residues and found 2 distinct side-chain conformers of Ser124, which is a putative coenzyme/substrate-binding residue. A structural comparison between apo form and holo form and a mutagenesis study with E97Q mutant suggest an induced-fit mechanism upon coenzyme binding; coenzyme binding induces a conformational change in the coenzyme-binding residues Glu97 and Ser124 to switch their activation state from resting to active, which is required for the subsequent substrate recruitment. Subunit dimerization is mediated by numerous intersubunit interactions, including 22 hydrogen bonds and 104 residue pairs of van der Waals interactions, of which those between two cognate C-terminal domains are predominant. From a structure/sequence comparison within GDH homologues, a much greater degree of interprotomer interactions (both polar and hydrophobic) in the rabbit GDH would contribute to its higher thermostability, which may be relevant to the other function of this enzyme as λ-crystallin, a constitutive structural protein in rabbit lens. The present crystal structures and amino acid mutagenesis studies assigned the role of active-site residues: catalytic base for His145 and substrate binding for Ser124, Cys125, Asn196, and Arg231. Notably, Arg231 participates in substrate binding from the other subunit of the GDH dimer, indicating the functional significance of the dimeric state. Proper orientation of the substrate-binding residues for catalysis is likely to be maintained by an interprotomer hydrogen-bonding network of residues Asn196, Gln199, and Arg231, suggesting a network-based substrate recognition of GDH.
