a novel approach to decoy set generation designing a physical energy function having local minima with native structure characteristics
we suggest a new approach to the generation of candidate structures decoys for ab initio prediction of protein structures our method is based on random sampling of conformation space and subsequent local energy minimization at the core of this approach lies the design of a novel type of energy function this energy function has local minima with native structure characteristics and wide basins of attraction the current work presents our motivation for deriving such an energy function and also tests the derived energy function our approach is novel in that it takes advantage of the inherently rough energy landscape of proteins which is generally considered a major obstacle for protein structure prediction when local minima have wide basins of attraction the protein s conformation space can be greatly reduced by the convergence of large regions of the space into single points namely the local minima corresponding to these funnels we have implemented this concept by an iterative process the potential is first used to generate decoy sets and then we study these sets of decoys to guide further development of the potential a key feature of our potential is the use of cooperative multi body interactions that mimic the role of the entropic and solvent contributions to the free energy the validity and value of our approach is demonstrated by applying it to  diverse small proteins we show that for these proteins the size of conformation space is considerably reduced by the new energy function in fact the reduction is so substantial as to allow efficient conformational sampling as a result we are able to find a significant number of near native conformations in random searches performed with limited computational resources
