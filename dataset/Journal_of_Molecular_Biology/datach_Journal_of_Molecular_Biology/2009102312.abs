product release rather than chelation determines metal specificity for ferrochelatase
ferrochelatase protoheme ferrolyase e c      is the terminal enzyme in heme biosynthesis and catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin ix to form protoheme ix heme  within the past two years x ray crystallographic data obtained with human ferrochelatase have clearly shown that significant structural changes occur during catalysis that are predicted to facilitate metal insertion and product release one unanswered question about ferrochelatase involves defining the mechanism whereby some metals such as divalent fe co ni and zn can be used by the enzyme in vitro to produce the corresponding metalloporphyrins while other metals such as divalent mn hg cd or pb are inhibitors of the enzyme through the use of high resolution x ray crystallography along with characterization of metal species via their anomalous diffraction the identity and position of hg cd ni or mn in the center of enzyme bound porphyrin macrocycle were determined when pb hg cd or ni was present in the macrocycle the conserved  helix was in the extended partially unwound  product release  state interestingly in the structure of ferrochelatase with mn porphyrin bound the  helix is not extended or unwound and is in the  substrate bound  conformation these findings show that at least in the cases of mn pb cd and hg metal  inhibition  of ferrochelatase is not due to the inability of the enzyme to insert the metal into the macrocycle or by binding to a second metal binding site as has been previously proposed rather inhibition occurs after metal insertion and results from poor or diminished product release possible explanations for the lack of product release are proposed herein
