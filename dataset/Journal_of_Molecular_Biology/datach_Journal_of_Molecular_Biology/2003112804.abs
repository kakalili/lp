folding of cu zn superoxide dismutase and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  has been implicated in the familial form of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  it has been suggested that mutant mediated sod misfolding aggregation is an integral part of the pathology of als we study the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of sod using a hybrid molecular dynamics approach we reproduce the experimentally observed sod folding thermodynamics and find that the residues which contribute the most to sod thermal stability are also crucial for apparent two state folding kinetics surprisingly we find that these residues are located on the surface of the protein and not in the hydrophobic core mutations in some of the identified residues are found in patients with the disease we argue that the identified residues may play an important role in aggregation to further characterize the folding of sod  we study the role of cysteine residues in folding and find that non native disulfide bond formation may significantly alter sod folding dynamics and aggregation propensity
