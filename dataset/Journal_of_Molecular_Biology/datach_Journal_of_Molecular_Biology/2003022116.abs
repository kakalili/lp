localization of the trigger factor binding site on the ribosomal  s subunit
in escherichia coli protein folding is undertaken by three distinct sets of chaperones the dnak dnaj and groel groes systems and the trigger factor tf  tf has been proposed to be the first chaperone to interact with the nascent polypeptide chain as it emerges from the tunnel of the  s ribosome and thus probably plays an important role in co translational protein folding we have made complexes with deuterated ribosomes  s subunits and  s ribosomes and protated tf and determined the tf binding site on the respective complexes using the neutron scattering technique of spin contrast variation our data suggest that the tf binds in the form of a homodimer on both the  s subunit and the  s ribosome the tf position is in proximity to the tunnel exit site near ribosomal proteins l  and l  located on the back of the  s subunit the positions deviate from one another such that the position on the  s ribosome is located slightly further from the tunnel than that determined for the  s subunit alone nevertheless from both determined positions interaction between tf and a short nascent chain of  amino acid residues would be plausible compatible with a role for tf participation in co translational protein folding
