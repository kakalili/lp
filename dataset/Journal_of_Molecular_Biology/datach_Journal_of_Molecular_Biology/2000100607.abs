crystal structure of mycobacterium tuberculosis  hydroxymethyl   dihydropteroate synthase in complex with pterin monophosphate new insight into the enzymatic mechanism and sulfa drug action edited by i wilson
the enzyme  hydroxymethyl   dihydropteroate synthase dhps catalyzes the condensation of para aminobenzoic acid paba with  hydroxymethyl   dihydropterin pyrophosphate to form  hydroxymethyl   dihydropteroate and pyrophosphate dhps is essential for the de novo synthesis of folate in prokaryotes lower eukaryotes and in plants but is absent in mammals inhibition of this enzyme  s activity by sulfonamide and sulfone drugs depletes the folate pool resulting in growth inhibition and cell death here we report the    resolution crystal structure of the binary complex of  hydroxymethylpterin monophosphate ptp with dhps from mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb  a pathogen responsible for the death of millions of human beings each year comparison to other dhps structures reveals that the m tuberculosis dhps structure is in a unique conformation in which loop  closes over the active site the mtb dhps structure hints at a mechanism in which both loops  and  play important roles in catalysis by shielding the active site from bulk solvent and allowing pyrophosphoryl transfer to occur a binding mode for paba sulfonamides and sulfones is suggested based on  i the new conformation of the closed loop   ii the distribution of dapsone and sulfonamide resistance mutations  iii the observed direction of the bond between the  methyl carbon atom and the bridging oxygen atom to the  phosphate group in the mtb dhps ptp binary complex and iv the conformation of loop  in the escherichia coli dhps structure finally the mtb dhps structure reveals a highly conserved pterin binding pocket that may be exploited for the design of novel antimycobacterial agents
