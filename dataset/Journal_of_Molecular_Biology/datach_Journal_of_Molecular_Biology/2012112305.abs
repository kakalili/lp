structural basis for   end specific recognition of single stranded dna by the r h domain from human s bp
the r h domain is a conserved sequence motif in nucleic acid binding proteins previously we reported the solution structure of the r h domain and identified a putative nucleic acid binding site composed of three conserved basic residues liepinsh e  leonchiks a  sharipo a  guignard l  amp otting g     solution structure of the r h domain from human s bp   j mol biol          here we determine the binding affinities of mononucleotides and dinucleotides for the r h domain from human s bp  s bp r h and map their binding sites on the protein s surface although the binding affinities show up to   fold selectivity between different nucleotides their binding sites and conformations seem very similar further we report the nmr structure of the s bp r h in complex with deoxyguanosine   monophosphate dgmp mimicking the   end of single stranded dna pseudocontact shifts from a paramagnetic lanthanide tag attached to residue   in the mutant a  c confirmed that binding of dgmp brings a loop of the protein into closer proximity the structure provides the first structural insight into single stranded nucleic acid recognition by the r h domain and shows that the r h domain specifically binds the phosphorylated   end through electrostatic interactions with the two conserved arginines and stacking interactions with the highly conserved histidine
