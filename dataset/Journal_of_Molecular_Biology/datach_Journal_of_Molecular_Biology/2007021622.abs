solution structure of the thap domain from caenorhabditis elegans c terminal binding protein ctbp
the thap thanatos associated protein domain is a recently discovered zinc binding domain found in proteins involved in transcriptional regulation cell cycle control apoptosis and chromatin modification it contains a single zinc atom ligated by cysteine and histidine residues within a cys x  cys x   cys x his consensus we have determined the nmr solution structure of the thap domain from caenorhabditis elegans c terminal binding protein ctbp and show that it adopts a fold containing a treble clef motif bearing similarity to the zinc finger associated domain zad from drosophila grauzone the ctbp thap domain contains a large positively charged surface patch and we demonstrate that this domain can bind to double stranded dna in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay these data together with existing reports indicate that thap domains might exhibit a functional diversity similar to that observed for classical and gata type zinc fingers
