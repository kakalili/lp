a structural model for the assembly of the  s subunit of the ribosome
the order in which proteins bind to  s rrna the assembly map was determined by nomura and co workers in the early   s the assembly map shows the dependencies of binding of successive proteins but fails to address the relationship of these dependencies to the three dimensional folding of the ribosome here using molecular mechanics techniques we rationalize the order of protein binding in terms of ribosomal folding we determined the specific contacts between the ribosomal proteins and  s rrna from a crystal structure of the  s subunit  fjg  we then used these contacts as restraints in a rigid body monte  carlo simulation with reduced representation models of the rna and proteins proteins were added sequentially to the rna in the order that they appear in the assembly map our results show that proteins nucleate the folding of the head platform and body domains but they do not strongly restrict the orientations of the domains relative to one another we also examined the contributions of individual proteins to the formation of binding sites for sequential proteins in the assembly process binding sites for the primary binding proteins are generally more ordered in the naked rna than those for other proteins furthermore we examined one pathway in the assembly map and found that the addition of early binding proteins helps to organize the rna around the binding sites of proteins that bind later it appears that the order of assembly depends on the degree of pre organization of each protein s binding site at a given stage of assembly and the impact that the binding of each protein has on the organization of the remaining unoccupied binding sites
