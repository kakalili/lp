structural basis of  catenin recognition by tax interacting protein
tax interacting protein  tip  is an unusual signaling protein containing a single pdz domain tip  is able to bind  catenin with high affinity and thus inhibit its transcriptional activity the high resolution crystal structure of tip  in complex with the c terminal peptide of  catenin provides molecular details for the recognition of  catenin by tip  moreover structural comparison of peptide free and peptide bound tip  reveals that significant conformational changes are required in the  b  c loop region of tip  to avoid clashes with the incoming c terminal  catenin peptide such conformational changes have not been observed in other structures of pdz domains in addition to the canonical peptide binding pocket of the pdz domain tip  can form a binding cavity to anchor more amino acids through a conserved hydrophobic residue pair trp  of  catenin and pro  of tip   structural and biochemical data indicate that the canonical binding pocket together with the hydrophobic residue pair are presumably the major cause of the significantly higher affinity of the  catenin c terminal to tip  than to other pdz domains providing a unique binding specificity our results reveal the molecular mechanism of tip  as an antagonist in pdz domain signaling
