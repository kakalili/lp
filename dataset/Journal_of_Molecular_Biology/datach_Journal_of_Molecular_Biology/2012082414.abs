early steps in oxidation induced sod misfolding implications for non amyloid protein aggregation in familial als
among the diseases of protein misfolding amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als is unusual in that the proteinaceous neuronal inclusions that are the hallmark of the disease have neither the classic fibrillar appearance of amyloid by transmission electron microscopy nor the affinity for the dye congo red that is a defining feature of amyloid mutations in the cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  cause the largest subset of inherited als cases the mechanism by which this highly stable enzyme misfolds to form non amyloid aggregates is currently poorly understood as are the stresses that initiate misfolding the oxidative damage hypothesis proposes that sod s normal free radical scavenger role puts it at risk of oxidative damage and that it is this damage that triggers the misfolding primed by mutation here we present evidence that hydrogen peroxide treatment which generates free radical species at the sod active site causes oxidative damage to active site histidine residues leading to major structural changes and non amyloid aggregation similar to that seen in als time resolved measurements of release of bound metal ligands exposure of hydrophobic surface area and alterations in the sod proton nmr spectrum have allowed us to model the early structural changes occurring as sod misfolds prior to aggregation als causing sod mutations apparently alter this pathway by increasing exposure of buried epitopes in misfolded species populated at endpoint we have identified a well populated early misfolding intermediate that could serve as a target for therapies designed to block downstream misfolding and aggregation events and thereby treat sod associated als
