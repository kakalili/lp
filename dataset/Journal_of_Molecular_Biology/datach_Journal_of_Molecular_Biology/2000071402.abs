a novel   nucleotide variant of      one of a class of sequences defining the escherichia coli recombination hotspot   edited by m gottesman
in wild type escherichia coli recognition of the recombination hotspot      gctggtgg    by the recbcd enzyme is central to homologous recombination however in the recc  class of recbcd mutants stimulation of recombination by the canonical  sequence is not detectable but the levels of homologous recombination are nearly wild type in vivo studies demonstrate that a member of this class of mutants the recc   allele encodes an enzyme that responds to a novel variant of   termed       gctggtgctcg    here we establish that in vitro the    sequence is recognized more efficiently by the recbc  d enzyme than is the wild type   this is manifest by both a greater modification of nuclease activity and a higher stimulation of reca protein mediated joint molecule formation at    than at   sequencing of the recc   gene revealed that it contains a frameshift mutation which results in a replacement of nine of the wild type amino acid residues by eight in the mutant protein and defines a locus that is important for the specificity of  recognition in addition we show that this novel   nucleotide    sequence also regulates the wild type recbcd enzyme supporting the notion that variants of the canonical  constitute a class of sequences that regulate the recombination function of recbcd enzyme
