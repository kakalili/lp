both the p  and p  subunits of the helicobacter pylori vaca toxin are targeted to mammalian mitochondria
helicobacter pylori infection causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer a major toxin secreted by h pylori is the bipartite vacuolating cytotoxin a vaca the toxin is believed to enter host cells as two subunits the p  subunit   kda and the p  subunit   kda  at the biochemical level it has been shown that vaca forms through the assembly of large multimeric pores composed of both the p  subunit and the p  subunit in biological membranes one of the major target organelles of vaca is the mitochondria since only the p  subunit has been reported to be translocated into mitochondria and the p  subunit is not imported it has been contentious as to whether vaca assembles into pores in a mitochondrial membrane here we show the p  protein is imported into the mitochondria along with the p  protein subunit the p  subunit integrally associates with the mitochondrial inner membrane and both the p  subunit and the p  subunit are exposed to the mitochondrial intermembrane space their colocalization suggests that they could reassemble and form a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane
