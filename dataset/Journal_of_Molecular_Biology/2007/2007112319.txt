Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are characterized by the presence of filamentous inclusions in nerve cells. These filaments are amyloid fibrils that are made of the protein α-synuclein, which is genetically linked to rare cases of PD and DLB. β-Synuclein, which shares 60% identity with α-synuclein, is not found in the inclusions. Furthermore, while recombinant α-synuclein readily assembles into amyloid fibrils, β-synuclein fails to do so. It has been suggested that this may be due to the lack in β-synuclein of a hydrophobic region that spans residues 73–83 of α-synuclein. Here, fibril assembly of recombinant human α-synuclein, α-synuclein deletion mutants, β-synuclein and β/α-synuclein chimeras was assayed quantitatively by thioflavin T fluorescence and semi-quantitatively by transmission electron microscopy. Deletion of residues 73–83 from α-synuclein did not abolish filament formation. Furthermore, a chimera of β-synuclein with α-synuclein(73–83) inserted was significantly less fibrillogenic than wild-type α-synuclein. These findings, together with results obtained using a number of recombinant synucleins, showed a correlation between fibrillogenesis and mean β-strand propensity, hydrophilicity and charge of the amino acid sequences. The combination of these simple physicochemical properties with a previously described calculation of β-strand contiguity allowed us to design mutations that changed the fibrillogenic propensity of α-synuclein in predictable ways.
