uncontrolled zinc and copper induced oligomerisation of the human complement regulator factor h and its possible implications for function and disease
polymorphisms in factor h fh  a major regulator of complement activation and the accumulation of high zinc concentrations in the outer retina are both associated with age related macular degeneration fh is inhibited by zinc which causes fh to aggregate to investigate this we quantitatively studied zinc induced fh self association by x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation to demonstrate uncontrolled fh oligomerisation in conditions corresponding to physiological levels of fh and pathological levels of zinc in the outer retina by scattering fh at       m was unaffected until zn increased to    m whereupon the radius of gyration rg values increased from  to   nm at zn     m the maximum dimension of fh increased from  to   nm indicating that compact oligomers had formed by ultracentrifugation size distribution analyses showed that monomeric fh at    s was the major species at zn up to    m at zn above    m a series of large oligomers were formed ranging up to   s in size oligomerisation was reversed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid structurally distinct large oligomers were observed for cu while ni cd and fe showed low amounts of oligomers and mg and ca showed no change fluid phase assays showed reduced fh activities that correlated with increased oligomer formation the results were attributed to different degrees of stabilisation of weak self dimerisation sites in fh by transition metals the relevance of metal induced fh oligomer formation to complement regulation and age related macular degeneration is discussed
