5′-Nucleotidase belongs to a large superfamily of distantly related dinuclear metallophosphatases including the Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and purple acid phosphatases. The protein undergoes a 96° domain rotation between an open (inactive) and a closed (active) enzyme form. Complex structures of the closed form with the products adenosine and phosphate, and with the substrate analogue inhibitor α,β-methylene ADP, have been determined at 2.1 Å and 1.85 Å resolution, respectively. In addition, a complex of the open form of 5′-nucleotidase with ATP was analyzed at a resolution of 1.7 Å. These structures show that the adenosine group binds to a specific binding pocket of the C-terminal domain. The adenine ring is stacked between Phe429 and Phe498. The N-terminal domain provides the ligands to the dimetal cluster and the conserved His117, which together form the catalytic core structure. However, the three C-terminal arginine residues 375, 379 and 410, which are involved in substrate binding, may also play a role in transition-state stabilization. The β-phosphate group of the inhibitor is terminally coordinated to the site 2 metal ion. The site 1 metal ion coordinates a water molecule which is in an ideal position for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, assuming an in-line mechanism of phosphoryl transfer. Another water molecule bridges the two metal ions.
