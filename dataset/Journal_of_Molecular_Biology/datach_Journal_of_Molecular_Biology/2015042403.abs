translation elongation factor ef tu modulates filament formation of actin like mreb protein in vitro
ef tu has been shown to interact with actin like protein mreb and to affect its localization in escherichia coli and in bacillus subtilis cells we have purified yfp mreb in an active form which forms filaments on glass slides in vitro and was active in dynamic light scattering assays polymerizing in milliseconds after addition of magnesium purified ef tu enhanced the amount of mreb filaments as seen by sedimentation assays the speed of filament formation and the length of mreb filaments in vitro ef tu had the strongest impact on mreb filaments in a   ratio and ef tu co sedimented with mreb filaments revealing a stoichiometric interaction between both proteins this was supported by cross linking assays where   species were well detectable when expressed in e coli cells b subtilis mreb formed filaments and induced the formation of co localizing b subtilis ef tu structures indicating that mreb can direct the positioning of ef tu structures in a heterologous cell system fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that mreb filaments have a higher turnover in b subtilis cells than in e coli cells indicating different filament kinetics in homologous or heterologous cell systems the data show that mreb can direct the localization of ef tu in vivo which in turn positively affects the formation and dynamics of mreb filaments thus ef tu is a modulator of the activity of a bacterial actin like protein
