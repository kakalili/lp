the    resolution structure of the catalytic portion of a cyanobacterial membrane bound manganese superoxide dismutase
cyanobacteria are shown to be unique in containing membrane bound manganese superoxide dismutases mnsod  they are homodimeric type  membrane proteins that protect this phototrophic organism against oxidative stress we have determined for the first time the    resolution structure of the catalytic portion of the mnsod from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena pcc    within each subunit both the n terminal helical hairpin his  and his   and the c terminal    domain his  and asp   contribute ligands to the catalytic manganese site together with a water or hydroxide ion ohx a five coordinated trigonal bipyramidal geometry is formed with ohx and his  forming the axial ligands and manganese shifted out of the equatorial plane in the direction of ohx the ligands including ohx are tightly constrained by hydrogen bonding with surrounding residues either from the same monomer tyr  asn   trp   gln   val   trp   or from the neighbouring subunit glu   tyr   this underlines the important role of the symmetric dimeric structure of mnsods in contributing elements to both the active site and the substrate funnel the mn  mn distance     is bridged by the hydrogen bonded his  of one monomer with glu  of the other monomer a detailed discussion of the structure a comparison with known structures of soluble mnsods as well as a model of the cyanobacterial membrane bound mnsod is presented
