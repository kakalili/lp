kinetic mechanism and catalysis of a native state prolyl isomerization reaction
folding of tendamistat is a rapid two state process for the majority of the unfolded molecules in fluorescence monitored refolding kinetics about  of the unfolded molecules fold slowly     s    limited by peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerization this is significantly less than expected from the presence of three trans prolyl peptide bonds in the native state in interrupted refolding experiments we detected an additional very slow folding reaction     s   at ph  with an amplitude of about   this reaction is caused by the interconversion of a highly structured intermediate to native tendamistat the intermediate has essentially native spectroscopic properties and about  of it remain populated in equilibrium after folding is complete catalysis by human cyclophilin  identifies this very slow reaction as a prolyl isomerization reaction this shows that prolyl isomerases are able to efficiently catalyze native state isomerization reactions which allows them to influence biologically important regulatory conformational transitions folding kinetics of the proline variants p a p a p a and p a p a show that the very slow reaction is due to isomerization of the glu pro and ala pro peptide bonds which are located in a region that makes strong backbone and side chain interactions to both  sheets in the p a variant the very slow isomerization reaction is still present but native state heterogeneity is not observed any more indicating a long range destabilizing effect on the alternative native state relative to n these results enable us to include all prolyl and non prolyl peptide bond isomerization reactions in the folding mechanism of tendamistat and to characterize the kinetic mechanism and the energetics of a native state prolyl isomerization reaction
