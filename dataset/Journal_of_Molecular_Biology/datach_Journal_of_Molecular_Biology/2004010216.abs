optimization of the antibody ch domain by residue frequency analysis of igg sequences
in an attempt to enhance the overall assembly yield and half life of recombinant antibody proteins we have cloned and expressed several igg ch domains and examined their folding refolding characteristics we utilized a cytoplasmic bacterial expression system with a thioredoxin reductase knock out strain of bl  de  to produce bovine murine and human ch  under identical conditions expression of bovine ch resulted consistently in the highest yields of properly folded oxidized protein circular dichroism and fluorescence experiments demonstrate that oxidized bovine and murine ch have surprisingly similar structures and stabilities considering the marginal sequence conservation between the two molecules residue frequency analysis using a limited data set of  unique fc sequences originating from  different mammalian species targeted five specific sites for optimization within bovine ch  combination of three of these mutants increased the thermal stability of the molecule to   c comparison of this approach to similar studies using larger sequence databases and or different selection criteria suggests sequence database design can increase the success rate for identifying residue sites worth optimizing this optimized ch domain can be used as a particularly stable platform for functional design and can be grafted into full length antibody sequences to enhance their thermodynamic parameters and shelf life
