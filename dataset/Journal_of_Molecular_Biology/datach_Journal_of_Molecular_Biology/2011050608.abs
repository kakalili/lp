visualising a viral rna genome poised for release from its receptor complex
we describe the cryo electron microscopy structure of bacteriophage ms bound to its receptor the bacterial f pilus the virus contacts the pilus at a capsid  fold vertex thus locating the surface accessible portion of the single copy of the pilin binding maturation protein present in virions this arrangement allows a  fold averaged map to be calculated showing for the first time in any virus  receptor complex the nonuniform distribution of rna within the capsid strikingly at the vertex that contacts the pilus a rod of density that may include contributions from both genome and maturation protein sits above a channel that goes through the capsid to the outside this density is reminiscent of the dna density observed in the exit channel of double stranded dna phages suggesting that the rna  maturation protein complex is poised to leave the capsid as the first step of the infection process
