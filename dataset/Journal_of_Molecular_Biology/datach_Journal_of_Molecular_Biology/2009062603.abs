an extended structure of the apobec g catalytic domain suggests a unique holoenzyme model
human apobec g a g belongs to a family of polynucleotide cytidine deaminases this family includes apobec and aid which edit apob mrna and antibody gene dna respectively a g deaminates cytidines to uridines in single strand dna and inhibits the replication of human immunodeficiency virus  other retroviruses and retrotransposons although the mechanism of a g catalyzed dna deamination has been investigated genetically and biochemically atomic details are just starting to emerge here we compare the dna cytidine deaminase activities and nmr structures of two a g catalytic domain constructs the longer a g    protein is considerably more active than the shorter a g    variant the longer structure has an   helix residues      that was not apparent in the shorter protein and it contributes to catalytic activity through interactions with hydrophobic core structures         and    both a g catalytic domain solution structures have a discontinuous   region that is clearly different from the continuous   strand of another family member apobec  in addition the longer a g    structure revealed part of the n terminal pseudo catalytic domain including the interdomain linker and some of the last  helix these structured residues residues      enabled a novel full length a g model by providing physical overlap between the n terminal pseudo catalytic domain and the new c terminal catalytic domain structure contrary to predictions this structurally constrained model suggested that the two domains are tethered by structured residues and that the n and c terminal   regions are too distant from each other to participate in this interaction
