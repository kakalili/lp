identification of an allosteric signaling network within tec family kinases
the tec family kinases are tyrosine kinases that function primarily in hematopoietic cells the catalytic activity of the tec kinases is positively influenced by the regulatory domains outside of the kinase domain the current lack of a full length tec kinase structure leaves a void in our understanding of how these positive regulatory signals are transmitted to the kinase domain recently a conserved structure within kinases the  regulatory spine   which assembles and disassembles as a kinase switches between its active and inactive states has been identified here we define the residues that comprise the regulatory spine within tec kinases compared to previously characterized systems the tec kinases contain an extended regulatory spine that includes a conserved methionine within the c helix and a conserved tryptophan within the src homology  kinase linker of tec kinases this extended regulatory spine forms a conduit for transmitting the presence of the regulatory domains of tec kinases to the catalytic domain we further show that mutation of the gatekeeper residue at the edge of the regulatory spine stabilizes the regulatory spine resulting in a constitutively active kinase domain importantly the regulatory spine is preassembled in this gatekeeper mutant rendering phosphorylation on the activation loop unnecessary for its activity moreover we show that the disruption of the conserved electrostatic interaction between bruton s tyrosine kinase r  on the activation loop and bruton s tyrosine kinase e  on the c helix also aids in the assembly of the regulatory spine thus the extended regulatory spine is a key structure that is critical for maintaining the activity of tec kinases
