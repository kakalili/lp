the effects of nucleotides on muts dna binding kinetics clarify the role of muts atpase activity in mismatch repair
muts protein initiates mismatch repair with recognition of a non watson  crick base pair or base insertion deletion site in dna and its interactions with dna are modulated by atpase activity here we present a kinetic analysis of these interactions including the effects of atp binding and hydrolysis reported directly from the mismatch site by  aminopurine fluorescence when free of nucleotides the thermus aquaticus muts dimer binds a mismatch rapidly kon    m   s   and forms a stable complex with a half life of   s koff   s    when one or both nucleotide binding sites on the muts  mismatch complex are occupied by atp the complex remains fairly stable with a half life of    s koff      s    although mutsatp becomes incapable of re binding the mismatch when one or both nucleotide binding sites on the muts dimer are occupied by adp the muts  mismatch complex forms rapidly kon     m   s   and also dissociates rapidly with a half life of   s koff   s    integration of these muts dna binding kinetics with previously described atpase kinetics reveals that  a in the absence of a mismatch muts in the adp bound form engages in highly dynamic interactions with dna perhaps probing base pairs for errors  b in the presence of a mismatch muts stabilized in the atp bound form releases the mismatch slowly perhaps allowing for onsite interactions with downstream repair proteins  c atp bound muts then moves off the mismatch perhaps as a mobile clamp facilitating repair reactions at distant sites on dna until atp is hydrolyzed or dissociates and the protein turns over
