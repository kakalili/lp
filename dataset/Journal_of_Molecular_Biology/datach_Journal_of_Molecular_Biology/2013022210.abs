cdr h diversity is not required for antigen recognition by synthetic antibodies
a synthetic phage displayed antibody repertoire was constructed with equivalent chemical diversity in the third complementarity determining regions of the heavy cdr h  and light cdr l  chains which contrasts with natural antibodies in which cdr h is much more diverse than cdr l due to the genetic mechanisms that generate antibody encoding genes surprisingly the synthetic repertoire yielded numerous functional antibodies that contained mutated cdr l sequences but a fixed cdr h sequence alanine scanning analysis of antibodies that recognized  different antigens but contained a common cdr h loop showed that in most cases the fixed cdr h sequence was able to contribute favorably to antigen recognition but in some cases the loop was functionally inert structural analysis of one such antibody in complex with antigen showed that the inert cdr h loop was nonetheless highly buried at the antibody  antigen interface taken together these results show that cdr h diversity is not necessarily required for the generation of antibodies that recognize diverse protein antigens with high affinity and specificity and if given the chance cdr l readily assumes the dominant role for antigen recognition these results contrast with the commonly accepted view of antigen recognition derived from the analysis of natural antibodies in which cdr h is presumed to be dominant and cdr l is presumed to play an auxiliary role furthermore the results show that natural antibody function is genetically constrained and it should be possible to develop more functional synthetic antibody libraries by expanding the diversity of cdr l beyond what is observed in nature
