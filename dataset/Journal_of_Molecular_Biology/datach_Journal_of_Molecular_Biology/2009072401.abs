regiospecific phosphorylation control of the sr protein asf sf by srpk
sr proteins splicing factors containing arginine  serine repeats are essential factors that control the splicing of precursor mrna by regulating multiple steps in spliceosome development the prototypical sr protein asf sf  human alternative splicing factor contains two n terminal rna recognition motifs rrms  rrm and rrm  and a  residue c terminal rs arginine  serine rich domain that can be phosphorylated at numerous serines by the protein kinase sr specific protein kinase srpk   the rs domain c terminal domain that is rich in arginine  serine repeats residues       is further divided into n terminal rs  n terminal portion of the rs domain residues       and c terminal rs  c terminal portion of the rs domain residues       segments whose modification guides the nuclear localization of asf sf  while previous studies revealed that srpk phosphorylates rs  regiospecific and temporal specific control within the largely redundant rs domain is not well understood to address this issue we performed engineered footprinting and single turnover experiments to determine where and how srpk initiates phosphorylation within the rs domain the data show that local sequence elements in the rs domain control the strong kinetic preference for rs phosphorylation srpk initiates phosphorylation in a small region of serines initiation box in the middle of the rs domain at the c terminal end of rs and then proceeds in an n terminal direction this initiation process requires both a viable docking groove in the large lobe of srpk and one rrm rrm  on the n terminal flank of the rs domain thus while local rs sr content steers regional preferences in the rs domain distal contacts with srpk guide initiation and directional phosphorylation within these regions
