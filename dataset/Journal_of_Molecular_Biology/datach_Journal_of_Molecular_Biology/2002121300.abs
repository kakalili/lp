crystal structures of two rat mhc class ia rt a molecules that are associated differentially with peptide transporter alleles tap a and tap b
antigenic peptides are loaded onto class i mhc molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum er by a complex consisting of the mhc class i heavy chain   microglobulin calreticulin tapasin erp  er  and the transporter associated with antigen processing tap  while most mammalian species transport these peptides into the er via a single allele of tap rats have evolved different taps tap a and tap b that are present in different inbred strains each tap delivers a different spectrum of peptides and is associated genetically with distinct subsets of mhc class ia alleles but the molecular basis for the conservation or co evolution of the two transporter alleles is unknown we have determined the crystal structures of a representative of each mhc subset viz rt aa and rt a c in association with high affinity nonamer peptides the structures reveal how the chemical properties of the two different rat mhc f pockets match those of the corresponding c termini of the peptides corroborating biochemical data on the rates of peptide  mhc complex assembly an unusual sequence in rt a c leads to a major deviation from the highly conserved     loop residues     conformation in mouse and human mhc class i structures this loop change contributes to profound changes in the shape of the a pocket in the peptide binding groove and may explain the function of rt a c as an inhibitory natural killer cell ligand
