evidence for  unseen  transposase  dna contacts
in this study evidence of novel important interactions between a hyperactive tn transposon recognition end sequence and hyperactive tn transposase tnp are presented a hyperactive tn end sequence the mosaic end me  was isolated previously the me and a wild type end sequence the outside end oe  differ at only three positions yet transposition on the me is tenfold higher than on the oe in vivo also transposition on the me is much more efficient than transposition on the oe in vitro here we show that the decreased activity observed for the oe is caused by a defect in paired ends complex pec formation resulting from the orientation of the a  t base pair at position  of this end efficient pec formation requires an interaction between the c methyl group c me on the non transferred strand thymine base at position  t  and tnp pec formation on nicked substrates is much less affected by the orientation of the a  t base pair at position  indicating that the c me group is important only for steps preceding nicking a recently determined co crystal structure of tn tnp with the me is discussed and a model explaining possible roles for the base pair at position  is explored
