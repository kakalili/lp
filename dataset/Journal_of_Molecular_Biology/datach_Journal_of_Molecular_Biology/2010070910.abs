oligomeric state in the crystal structure of modular fad synthetase provides insights into its sequential catalysis in prokaryotes
the crystal structure of the modular flavin adenine dinucleotide fad synthetase from corynebacterium ammoniagenes has been solved at     resolution the structure of c ammoniagenes fad synthetase presents two catalytic modules  a c terminus with atp  riboflavin kinase activity and an n terminus with atp  flavin mononucleotide fmn adenylyltransferase activity  that are responsible for the synthesis of fad from riboflavin in two sequential steps in the monomeric structure the active sites from both modules are placed    away preventing the direct transfer of the product from the first reaction fmn to the second catalytic site where it acts as substrate crystallographic and biophysical studies revealed a hexameric assembly formed by the interaction of two trimers each trimer presents a head  tail configuration with fmn adenylyltransferase and riboflavin kinase modules from different protomers approaching the active sites and allowing the direct transfer of fmn experimental results provide molecular level evidences of the mechanism of the synthesis of fmn and fad in prokaryotes in which the oligomeric state could be involved in the regulation of the catalytic efficiency of the modular enzyme
