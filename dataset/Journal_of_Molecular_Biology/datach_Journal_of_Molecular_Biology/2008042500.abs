the catalytic subunit of shiga like toxin  interacts with ribosomal stalk proteins and is inhibited by their conserved c terminal domain
shiga like toxin  slt  is a type ii ribosome inactivating protein its a domain blocks protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by catalyzing the depurination of a single adenine base in  s rrna the molecular mechanism leading to this site specific depurination event is thought to involve interactions with eukaryotic ribosomal proteins here we present evidence that the a chain of slt  binds to the ribosomal proteins p  p  and p  these proteins were identified from a hela cell lysate by tandem mass spectrometry and subsequently confirmed to bind to slt  a chain by yeast two hybrid and pull down experiments using candidate full length proteins moreover the removal of the last  amino acids of either protein p or p abolishes the interaction with the a chain whereas p  lacking this common c terminus still binds to the a domain in vitro pull down experiments using fusion protein tagged c terminal peptides corresponding to the common    and  terminal residues of p and p confirmed that the a chain of slt  as well as the a chain of ricin bind to this shared c terminal peptide motif more importantly a synthetic peptide corresponding to the  amino acid c terminus of p and p was shown to inhibit the ribosome inactivating function of the a chain of slt  in an in vitro transcription and translation coupled assay these results suggest a role for the ribosomal stalk in aiding the a chain of slt  and other type ii ribosome inactivating proteins in localizing its catalytic domain near the site of depurination in the  s rrna
