expression of an rnase p ribozyme against the mrna encoding human cytomegalovirus protease inhibits viral capsid protein processing and growth
a sequence specific ribozyme m gs rna derived from the catalytic rna subunit of rnase p from escherichia coli was used to target the mrna encoding human cytomegalovirus hcmv protease pr  a viral protein that is responsible for the processing of the viral capsid assembly protein we showed that the constructed ribozyme cleaved the pr mrna sequence efficiently in vitro moreover a reduction of about   in the expression level of the protease and a reduction of about   fold in hcmv growth were observed in cells that expressed the ribozyme stably in contrast a reduction of less than   in the expression of viral protease and viral growth was observed in cells that either did not express the ribozyme or produced a catalytically inactive ribozyme mutant further examination of the antiviral effects of the ribozyme mediated cleavage of pr mrna indicates that   the proteolytic cleavage of the capsid assembly protein is inhibited significantly and   the packaging of the viral genomic dna into the cmv capsids is blocked these observations are consistent with the notion that the protease functions to process the capsid assembly protein and is essential for viral capsid assembly moreover our results indicate that the rnase p ribozyme mediated cleavage specifically reduces the expression of the protease but not other viral genes examined thus m gs ribozyme is highly effective in inhibiting hcmv growth by targeting the pr mrna and may represent a novel class of general gene targeting agents for the studies and treatment of infections caused by human viruses including hcmv
