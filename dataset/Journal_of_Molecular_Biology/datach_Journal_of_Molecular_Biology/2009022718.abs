solution structure and calcium binding properties of m crystallin a primordial   crystallin from archaea
the lens   crystallin superfamily has many diverse but topologically related members belonging to various taxa based on structural topology these proteins are considered to be evolutionarily related to lens crystallins suggesting their origin from a common ancestor proteins with   crystallin domains although found in some eukaryotes and eubacteria have not yet been reported in archaea sequence searches in the genome of the archaebacterium methanosarcina acetivorans revealed the presence of a protein annotated as a   crystallin family protein named m crystallin solution structure of this protein indicates a typical   crystallin fold with a paired greek key motif among the known structures of   crystallin members m crystallin was found to be structurally similar to the vertebrate lens   crystallins the ca  binding properties of this primordial protein are somewhat more similar to those of vertebrate   crystallins than to those of bacterial homologues these observations taken together suggest that amphibian and vertebrate   crystallin domains are evolutionarily more related to archaeal homologues than to bacterial homologues additionally identification of a   crystallin homologue in archaea allows us to demonstrate the presence of this domain in all the three domains of life
