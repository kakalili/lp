recycling of the posttermination complexes of mycobacterium smegmatis and escherichia coli ribosomes using heterologous factors
in eubacteria ribosome recycling factor rrf and elongation factor g efg function together to dissociate posttermination ribosomal complexes earlier studies using heterologous factors from mycobacterium tuberculosis in escherichia coli revealed that specific interactions between rrf and efg are crucial for their function in ribosome recycling here we used translation factors from e coli mycobacterium smegmatis and m tuberculosis and polysomes from e coli and m smegmatis and employed in vivo and in vitro experiments to further understand the role of efg in ribosome recycling we show that e coli efg ecoefg recycles e coli ribosomes with e coli rrf ecorrf  but not with mycobacterial rrfs also ecoefg fails to recycle m smegmatis ribosomes with either ecorrf or mycobacterial rrfs on the other hand mycobacterial efgs recycle both e coli and m smegmatis ribosomes with either of the rrfs these observations suggest that efg establishes distinct interactions with rrf and the ribosome to carry out ribosome recycling furthermore the efg chimeras generated by swapping domains between mycobacterial efgs and ecoefg suggest that while the residues needed to specify the efg interaction with rrf are located in domains iv and v those required to specify its interaction with the ribosome are located throughout the molecule
