inter ring communication is dispensable in the reaction cycle of group ii chaperonins
chaperonins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones with the subunit molecular mass of  kda they exist as double ring oligomers with central cavities an atp dependent conformational change of the cavity induces the folding of an unfolded protein that is captured in the cavity in the group i chaperonins which are present in eubacteria and eukaryotic organelles inter ring communication takes important role for the reaction cycle however there has been limited study on the inter ring communication in the group ii chaperonins that exist in archaea and the eukaryotic cytosol in this study we have constructed the asymmetric ring complex of a group ii chaperonin using circular permutated covalent mutants although one ring of the asymmetric ring complex lacks atpase or atp binding activity the other wild type ring undergoes an atp dependent conformational change and maintains protein folding activity the results clearly demonstrate that inter ring communication is dispensable in the reaction cycle of group ii chaperonins
