assembly of light harvesting bacteriochlorophyll in a model transmembrane helix in its natural environment
the transmembrane bacteriochlorophyll binding region of a bacterial light harvesting complex  lh   from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides was redesigned and overexpressed in a mutant of rb sphaeroides lacking lh  bacteriochlorophyll served as internal probe for the fitness of this new region for the assembly and energy transfer function of the lh complex the ability to absorb and transfer light energy is practically undisturbed by the exchange of the transmembrane segment valine   to threonine   of lh   with a  residue ala leu sequence this stretch makes up the residues of the transmembrane helix that are in close contact      with the bacteriochlorophyll molecules that are coordinated through his of both the  and  subunits in this ala leu stretch neither  his  which binds the bacteriochlorophyll nor the adjacent  ile   were replaced novel lh complexes composed of lh   with a model transmembrane sequence and a normal lh   are assembled in vivo into a complex the biochemical and spectroscopic properties of which closely resemble the native one in contrast the additional insertion of four residues just outside the c terminal end of the model transmembrane helix leads to complete loss of functional antenna complex the results suggest that light energy can be harvested and transferred efficiently by bacteriochlorophyll molecules attached to only few key residues distributed over the polypeptide while residues at the bacteriochlorophyll  helix interface seem to be largely dispensable for the functional assembly of this membrane protein complex this novel antenna with a simplified transmembrane domain and a built in probe for assembly and function provides a powerful model system for investigation of the factors that contribute to the assembly of chromophores in membrane embedded proteins
