core side chain packing and backbone conformation in lpp  coiled coil mutants
native proteins exhibit precise geometric packing of atoms in their hydrophobic interiors nonetheless controversy remains about the role of core side chain packing in specifying and stabilizing the folded structures of proteins here we investigate the role of core packing in determining the conformation and stability of the lpp  trimerization domain the x ray crystal structures of lpp  mutants with alanine substitutions at two and four interior core positions reveal trimeric coiled coils in which the twist of individual helices and the helix  helix spacing vary significantly to achieve the most favored superhelical packing arrangement introduction of each alanine  layer  into the hydrophobic core destabilizes the superhelix by  kcalmol   although the methyl groups of the alanine residues pack at their optimum van der waals contacts in the coiled coil trimer they provide a smaller component of hydrophobic interactions than bulky hydrophobic side chains to the thermodynamic stability thus specific side chain packing in the hydrophobic core of coiled coils are important determinants of protein main chain conformation and stability
