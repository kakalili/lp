structure of a slow processing precursor penicillin acylase from escherichia coli reveals the linker peptide blocking the active site cleft edited by k nagai
penicillin g acylase is a periplasmic protein cytoplasmically expressed as a precursor polypeptide comprising a signal sequence the a and b chains of the mature enzyme   and   residues respectively joined by a spacer peptide of  amino acid residues the wild type ab heterodimer is produced by proteolytic removal of this spacer in the periplasm the first step in processing is believed to be autocatalytic hydrolysis of the peptide bond between the c terminal residue of the spacer and the active site serine residue at the n terminus of the b chain we have determined the crystal structure of a slowly processing precursor mutant thr  gly of penicillin g acylase from escherichia coli which reveals that the spacer peptide blocks the entrance to the active site cleft consistent with an autocatalytic mechanism of maturation in this mutant precursor there is however an unexpected cleavage at a site four residues from the active site serine residue analyses of the stereochemistry of the      bond seen to be cleaved in this precursor structure and of the      peptide bond have suggested factors that may govern the autocatalytic mechanism
