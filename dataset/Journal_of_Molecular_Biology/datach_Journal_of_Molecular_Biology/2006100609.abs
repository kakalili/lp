archaeal n terminal protein maturation commonly involves n terminal acetylation a large scale proteomics survey
we present the first large scale survey of n terminal protein maturation in archaea based on   proteomically identified n terminal peptides from the two haloarchaea halobacterium salinarum and natronomonas pharaonis the observed protein maturation pattern can be attributed to the combined action of methionine aminopeptidase and n terminal acetyltransferase and applies to cytosolic proteins as well as to a large fraction of integral membrane proteins both n terminal maturation processes primarily depend on the amino acid in penultimate position in which serine and threonine residues are over represented removal of the initiator methionine occurs in two thirds of the haloarchaeal proteins and requires a small penultimate residue indicating that methionine aminopeptidase specificity is conserved across all domains of life while n terminal acetylation is rare in bacteria our proteomic data show that acetylated n termini are common in archaea affecting about   of the proteins and revealing a distinct archaeal n terminal acetylation pattern haloarchaeal n terminal acetyltransferase reveals narrow substrate specificity which is limited to cleaved n termini starting with serine or alanine residues a comparative analysis of   ortholog pairs with identified n terminal peptide showed that acetylatable n terminal residues are predominantly conserved amongst the two haloarchaea only few exceptions from the general n terminal acetylation pattern were observed which probably represent protein specific modifications as they were confirmed by ortholog comparison
