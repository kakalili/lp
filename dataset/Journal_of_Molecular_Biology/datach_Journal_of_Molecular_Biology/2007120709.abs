mutational analysis of s  protein and implications for the accuracy of decoding by the ribosome
the fidelity of aminoacyl trna selection by the ribosome depends on a conformational switch in the decoding center of the small ribosomal subunit induced by cognate but not by near cognate aminoacyl trna the aminoglycosides paromomycin and streptomycin bind to the decoding center and induce related structural rearrangements that explain their observed effects on miscoding structural and biochemical studies have identified ribosomal protein s  as well as specific nucleotides in  s ribosomal rna as a critical molecular contributor in distinguishing between cognate and near cognate trna species as well as in promoting more global rearrangements in the small subunit referred to as  closure   here we use a mutational approach to define contributions made by two highly conserved loops in s  to the process of trna selection most s  variant ribosomes tested display increased levels of fidelity a  restrictive  phenotype  interestingly several variants k a and r a were substantially resistant to the miscoding effects of paromomycin further characterization of the compromised paromomycin response identified a probable second fidelity modulating binding site for paromomycin in the  s ribosomal rna that facilitates closure of the small subunit and compensates for defects associated with the s  mutations
