the structure of tax bp ubz  provides insight into target specificity and adaptability
tax bp is a novel ubiquitin binding adaptor protein involved in the negative regulation of the nf kappab transcription factor which is a key player in inflammatory responses immunity and tumorigenesis tax bp recruits a  to the ubiquitinated signaling proteins traf and rip  leading to their a  mediated deubiquitination and the disruption of il  induced and tnf induced nf kappab signaling respectively the two zinc fingers localized at its c terminus function as novel ubiquitin binding domains ubz ubiquitin binding zinc finger  here we present for the first time both the solution and crystal structures of two classical ubz domains in tandem within the human tax bp  the relative orientation of the two domains is slightly different in the x ray structure with respect to the nmr structure indicating some degree of conformational flexibility which is rationalized by nmr relaxation data the observed degree of flexibility and stability between the two ubz domains might have consequences on the recognition mechanism of interacting partners
