structure and dynamics of ctx m enzymes reveal insights into substrate accommodation by extended spectrum  lactamases
oxyimino cephalosporin antibiotics such as ceftazidime escape the hydrolytic activity of most bacterial  lactamases their widespread use prompted the emergence of the extended spectrum  lactamases ctx ms which have become highly prevalent the c   amino thiazol oxyimino amide side chain of ceftazidime has a protective effect against most ctx m  lactamases however asp  gly ctx m derivatives demonstrate enhanced hydrolytic activity against this compound in this work we present the crystallographic structures of asp  gly harboring enzyme ctx m  in complex with ceftazidime like glycylboronic acid resolution      and molecular dynamics simulations of the corresponding acyl  enzyme complex these experiments revealed breathing motions of ctx m enzymes and the role of the substitution asp  gly in the accommodation of ceftazidime the substitution asp  gly resulted in insertion of the c  side chain of ceftazidime deep in the catalytic pocket and orchestrated motions of the active serine ser  the   strand and the omega loop which favored the key interactions of the residues   and   with ceftazidime
