unexpected formation of parallel duplex in gaa and ttc trinucleotide repeats of friedreich  s ataxia edited by i tinoco
the onset and progress of friedreich  s ataxia frda is associated with the genetic instability of the gaa  ttc trinucleotide repeats located within the frataxin gene the instability of these repeats may involve the formation of an alternative dna structure poly purine r poly pyrimidine y sequences typically form triplex dna structures which may contribute to genetic instability conventional wisdom suggested that triplex structures formed by these poly purine r poly pyrimidine y sequences may contribute to their genetic instability here we report the characterization of the single stranded gaa and ttc sequences and their mixtures using nmr uv melting and gel electrophoresis as well as chemical and enzymatic probing methods we show that the frda gaa ttc repeats are capable of forming various alternative structures the most intriguing is the observation of a parallel gaa  ttc duplex in equilibrium with the antiparallel watson crick gaa  ttc duplex we also show that the gaa strands form self assembled structures whereas the ttc strands are essentially unstructured finally we demonstrate that the frda repeats form only the yry triplex but not the rry triplex at neutral ph and the complete formation of the yry triplex requires the ratio of gaa to ttc strand larger than   the structural features presented here and in other studies distinguish the frda gaa  ttc repeats from the fragile x cgg  ccg  myotonic dystrophy ctg  cag and the huntington cag  ctg repeats
