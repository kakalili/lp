crystal structure of rice rubisco and implications for activation induced by positive effectors nadph and  phosphogluconate
the key enzyme of plant photosynthesis d ribulose   bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco  must be activated to become catalytically competent via the carbamylation of lys  of the large subunit and subsequent stabilization by mg  coordination many biochemical studies have reported that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph and  phosphogluconate  pg function as positive effectors to promote activation however the structural mechanism remains unknown here we have determined the crystal structures of activated rice rubisco in complex with nadph  pg or  carboxy d arabinitol   bisphosphate  cabp  the structures of the nadph and pg complexes adopt open state conformations in which loop  at the catalytic site and some other loops are disordered the structure of the cabp complex is in a closed state similar to the previous cabp bound activated structures from other sources the catalytic sites of the nadph and pg complexes are fully activated despite the fact that bicarbonate nahco  was not added into the crystallization solution in the catalytic site nadph does not interact with mg  directly but interacts with mg  coordinated water molecules while pg interacts with mg  directly these observations suggest that the two effectors promote rubisco activation by stabilizing the complex of mg  and the carbamylated lys  with unique interactions and preventing its dissociation the structure also reveals that the relaxed complex of the effectors nadph or pg  distinct from the tight binding mode of cabp would allow rapid exchange of the effectors in the catalytic sites by substrate d ribulose   bisphosphate for catalysis in physiological conditions
