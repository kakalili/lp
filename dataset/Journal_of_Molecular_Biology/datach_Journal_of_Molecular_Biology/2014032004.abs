innate antiviral immune signaling viral evasion and modulation by hiv
the intracellular innate antiviral response in human cells is an essential component of immunity against virus infection as obligate intracellular parasites all viruses must evade the actions of the host cell s innate immune response in order to replicate and persist innate immunity is induced when pathogen recognition receptors of the host cell sense viral products including nucleic acid as  non self   this process induces downstream signaling through adaptor proteins to activate latent transcription factors that drive the expression of genes encoding antiviral and immune modulatory effector proteins that restrict virus replication and regulate adaptive immunity the interferon regulatory factors irfs are transcription factors that play major roles in innate immunity in particular irf is activated in response to infection by a range of viruses including rna viruses dna viruses and retroviruses among these viruses human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  remains a major global health problem mediating chronic infection in millions of people wherein recent studies show that viral persistence is linked with the ability of the virus to dysregulate and evade the innate immune response in this review we discuss viral pathogen sensing innate immune signaling pathways and effectors that respond to viral infection the role of irf in these processes and how it is regulated by pathogenic viruses we present a contemporary overview of the interplay between hiv  and innate immunity with a focus on understanding how innate immune control impacts infection outcome and disease
