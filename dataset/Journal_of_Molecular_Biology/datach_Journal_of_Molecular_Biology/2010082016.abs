asymmetric dimeric structure of ferredoxin nad p  oxidoreductase from the green sulfur bacterium chlorobaculum tepidum implications for binding ferredoxin and nadp
ferredoxin nad p  oxidoreductase fnr catalyzes the reduction of nad p  to nad p h with the reduced ferredoxin fd during the final step of the photosynthetic electron transport chain fnr from the green sulfur bacterium chlorobaculum tepidum is functionally analogous to plant type fnr but shares a structural homology to nadph dependent thioredoxin reductase trxr  here we report the crystal structure of c tepidum fnr to     resolution which reveals a unique structure  function relationship c tepidum fnr consists of two functional domains for binding fad and nad p h that form a homodimer in which the domains are arranged asymmetrically one nad p h domain is present as the open form the other with the equivalent nad p h domain as the relatively closed form we used site directed mutagenesis on the hinge region connecting the two domains in order to investigate the importance of the flexible hinge the asymmetry of the nad p h domain and the comparison with trxr suggested that the hinge motion might be involved in pyridine nucleotide binding and binding of fd surprisingly the crystal structure revealed an additional c terminal sub domain that tethers one protomer and interacts with the other protomer by    stacking of phe  and the isoalloxazine ring of fad the position of this stacking phe  is almost identical with both of the conserved c terminal tyr residues of plant type fnr and the active site dithiol of trxr implying a unique structural basis for enzymatic reaction of c tepidum fnr
