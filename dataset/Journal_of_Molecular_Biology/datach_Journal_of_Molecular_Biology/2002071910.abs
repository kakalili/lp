solution structure of the pro hormone convertase  pro domain from mus musculus
the solution structure of the mouse pro hormone convertase pc  pro domain was determined using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and is the first structure to be obtained for any of the domains in the convertase family the ensemble of nmr derived structures shows a well ordered core consisting of a four stranded antiparallel  sheet with two  helices packed against one side of this sheet sequence homology suggests that the other eukaryotic pc pro domains will have the same overall fold and most of the residues forming the hydrophobic core of pc are highly conserved within the pc family however some of the core residues are predicted by homology to be replaced by polar amino acid residues in other pc pro domains and this may help to explain their marginal stability interestingly the folding topology observed here is also seen for the pro domain of bacterial subtilisin despite little or no sequence homology both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic structures have hydrophobic residues clustered on the solvent accessible surface of their  sheets although the individual residue types differ in the bacterial case this region is buried at the binding interface with the catalytic domain and in the eukaryotic pc family these surface residues are conserved we therefore propose that the hydrophobic patch in the pc pro domain is involved in the binding interface with its cognate catalytic domain in a similar manner to that seen for the bacterial system the pc pro domain structure also reveals potential mechanisms for the acid induced dissociation of the complex between pro and catalytic domains
