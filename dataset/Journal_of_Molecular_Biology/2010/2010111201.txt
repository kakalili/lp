Chromatin fibers encountered in various species and tissues are characterized by different nucleosome repeat lengths (NRLs) of the linker DNA connecting the nucleosomes. While single cellular organisms and rapidly growing cells with high protein production have short NRL ranging from 160 to 189 bp, mature cells usually have longer NRLs ranging between 190 and 220 bp. Recently, various experimental studies have examined the effect of NRL on the internal organization of chromatin fiber. Here, we investigate by mesoscale modeling of oligonucleosomes the folding patterns for different NRL, with and without linker histone (LH), under typical monovalent salt conditions using both one-start solenoid and two-start zigzag starting configurations. We find that short to medium NRL chromatin fibers (173 to 209 bp) with LH condense into zigzag structures and that solenoid-like features are viable only for longer NRLs (226 bp). We suggest that medium NRLs are more advantageous for packing and various levels of chromatin compaction throughout the cell cycle than their shortest and longest brethren; the former (short NRLs) fold into narrow fibers, while the latter (long NRLs) arrays do not easily lead to high packing ratios due to possible linker DNA bending. Moreover, we show that the LH has a small effect on the condensation of short-NRL arrays but has an important condensation effect on medium-NRL arrays, which have linker lengths similar to the LH lengths. Finally, we suggest that the medium-NRL species, with densely packed fiber arrangements, may be advantageous for epigenetic control because their histone tail modifications can have a greater effect compared to other fibers due to their more extensive nucleosome interaction network.
