the gene transfer agent rcgta contains head spikes needed for binding to the rhodobacter capsulatus polysaccharide cell capsule
viruses and bacteriophages recognize cell surface proteins using receptor binding proteins in most tailed bacteriophages receptor binding proteins are located on the bacteriophage tail the gene transfer agent of rhodobacter capsulatus rcgta morphologically resembles a tailed bacteriophage and binds to a capsular polysaccharide covering r capsulatus cells here we report that the rcgta capsid head is decorated by spikes that are needed for binding to the capsule the triangular spikes measured  nm and appeared to be attached at the capsid vertices head spike production required the putative carbohydrate binding protein ghsb rcc    previously thought to encode a side tail fiber protein we found that ghsb is likely co transcribed with ghsa rcc    and that ghsa ghsb is regulated by the ccka chpt ctra phosphorelay homologues and a quorum sensing system ghsa and ghsb were found to be ccka dependent rcgta maturation factors as ghsa and ghsb deficient particles were found to have altered native gel electrophoresis migration additionally we provide electron microscopy images showing that rcgta contains side tail fibers and a baseplate like structure near the tip of the tail which are independent of ghsb
