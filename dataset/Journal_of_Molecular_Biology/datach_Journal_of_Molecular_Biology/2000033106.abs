the crystal structure of thymidylate synthase from pneumocystis carinii reveals a fungal insert important for drug design edited by i a wilson
thymidylate synthase from pneumocystis carinii pcts is an especially important drug target since p carinii is a fungus that causes opportunistic pneumonia infections in immune compromised patients and is among the leading causes of death of aids patients thymidylate synthase ts is the sole enzyme responsible for the de novo production of deoxythymidine monophosphate and hence is crucial for dna replication in every organism inhibitors selective for p carinii ts over human ts would be greatly beneficial in combating this disease the crystal structure of ts from p carinii bound to its substrate dump and a cofactor mimic cb   was determined to    resolution a comparison with other species of ts shows that the volume of the closed pcts active site is   larger than that of five other ts closed active sites a two residue proline insert that is strictly conserved among all fungal species of ts and a novel c terminal closing interaction involving a p carinii specific tyrosine residue are primarily responsible for this increase in volume the structure suggests several options for designing an inhibitor specific to pcts and avoiding interactions with human ts taking advantage of the residue substitutions of p carinii ts over human ts enables the design of a selective inhibitor additionally the larger volume of the active site of pcts is an important advantage for designing de novo inhibitors that will exclude the human ts active site through steric hindrance
