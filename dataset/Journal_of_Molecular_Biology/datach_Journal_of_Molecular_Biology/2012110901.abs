binding and translocation of termination factor rho studied at the single molecule level
rho termination factor is an essential hexameric helicase responsible for terminating     of all mrna synthesis in escherichia coli we used single molecule force spectroscopy to investigate rho  rna binding interactions at the rho utilization site of the  tr terminator our results are consistent with rho complexes adopting two states one that binds   nt of rna across all six of the rho primary binding sites and another that binds   nt at the six primary sites plus a single secondary site situated at the center of the hexamer the single molecule data serve to establish that rho translocates       toward rna polymerase rnap by a tethered tracking mechanism looping out the intervening rna between the rho utilization site and rnap these findings lead to a general model for rho binding and translocation and establish a novel experimental approach that should facilitate additional single molecule studies of rna binding proteins
