a structural basis for selective dimerization by nf  b relb
transcription factors of the nuclear factor kappab nf  b family arise through the combinatorial association of five distinct rel subunits into functional dimers however not every dimer combination is observed in cells the relb subunit for example does not appear as a homodimer and forms heterodimers exclusively in combination with p  or p  subunits we previously reported that the relb homodimer could be forced to assemble through domain swapping in vitro in order to understand the mechanism of selective dimerization among rel subunits we have determined the x ray crystal structures of five relb dimers we find that relb forms canonical side by side heterodimers with p  and p  we observe that although mutation of four surface hydrophobic residues that are unique to relb does not affect its propensity to form homodimers via domain swapping alteration of two interfacial residues converts relb to a side by side homodimer surprisingly these mutant relb homodimers remain distinct from canonical side by side nf  b dimers in that the two monomers move away from one another along the  fold axis to avoid non complementary interactions at the interface the presence of distinct residues buried within the hydrophobic core of the relb dimerization domain appears to influence the conformations of the surface residues that mediate the dimer interface this conclusion is consistent with prior observations that alterations of domain core residues change dimerization propensity in the nf  b family transcription factors we suggest that relb has evolved into a specialized nf  b subunit with unique amino acids optimized for selective formation of heterodimers with p  and p
