respiratory complexes iii and iv are not essential for the assembly stability of complex i in fungi
the functional relevance of respiratory supercomplexes in various eukaryotes including mammals plants and fungi is hitherto poorly elucidated however substantial evidence indicates as a major role the assembly and or stabilization of mammalian complex i by supercomplex formation with complexes iii and iv here we demonstrate by using native electrophoresis that the long lived podospora anserina mutant cyc   respiring exclusively via the alternative oxidase aox  lacks an assembled complex iii and possesses complex i partially assembled with complex iv into a supercomplex this resembles the situation in complex iv deficient mutants displaying a corresponding phenotype but possessing i  iii supercomplexes instead suggesting that either complex iii or complex iv is in a redundant manner necessary for assembly stabilization of complex i as previously shown in mammals to corroborate this notion we constructed the double mutant cyc  cox  ble surprisingly this mutant lacking both complexes iii and iv is viable and essentially a phenocopy of mutant cyc  including the reversal of the phenotype towards wild type like characteristics by the several fold overexpression of the aox in mutant cyc  cox  ble gpd aox  fungal specific features not found in mammals that must be responsible for assembly stabilization of fungal complex i when complexes iii and iv are absent such as the presence of the aox and complex i dimerization are addressed and discussed these intriguing results unequivocally prove that complexes iii and iv are dispensable for assembly stability of complex i in fungi contrary to the situation in mammals thus highlighting the imperative to unravel the biogenesis of complex i as well as the true supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain and its functional significance in a variety of model eukaryotes in summary we present the first obligatorily aerobic eukaryote with an artificial simultaneous lack of the respiratory complexes iii and iv
