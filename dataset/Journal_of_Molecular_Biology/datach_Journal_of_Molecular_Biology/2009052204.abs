e k parkinson  s linked mutation enhances c terminal to n terminal contacts in  synuclein
parkinson s disease pd is associated with the deposition of fibrillar aggregates of the protein  synuclein  s in neurons intramolecular contacts between the acidic c terminal tail of  s and its n terminal region have been proposed to regulate  s aggregation and two originally described pd mutations a p and a t reportedly reduce such contacts we find that the most recently discovered pd linked  s mutation e k which also accelerates the aggregation of the protein does not interfere with c terminal to n terminal contacts and instead enhances such contacts furthermore we do not observe a substantial reduction in such contacts in the two previously characterized mutants our results suggest that c terminal to n terminal contacts in  s are not strongly protective against aggregation and that the dominant mechanism by which pd linked mutations facilitate  s aggregation may be altering the physicochemical properties of the protein such as net charge e k and secondary structure propensity a p and a t
