folding kinetics of staphylococcal nuclease studied by tryptophan engineering and rapid mixing methods
to monitor the development of tertiary structural contacts during folding a unique tryptophan residue was introduced at seven partially buried locations residues             and   of a tryptophan free variant of staphylococcal nuclease p g p  g h  l w  h  thermal unfolding measurements by circular dichroism indicate that the variants are destabilized but maintain the ability to fold into a native like structure for the variants with trp at positions    and   the intrinsic fluorescence is significantly quenched in the native state due to close contact with polar side chains that act as intramolecular quenchers all other variants exhibit enhanced fluorescence under native conditions consistent with burial of the tryptophan residues in an apolar environment the kinetics of folding was observed by continuous and stopped flow fluorescence measurements over refolding times ranging from    s to   s the folding kinetics of all variants is quantitatively described by a mechanism involving a major pathway with a series of intermediate states and a minor parallel channel the engineered tryptophan residues in the  barrel and the n terminal part of the  helical domain become partially shielded from the solvent at an early stage  lt  ms  indicating that this region undergoes a rapid collapse for some variants a major increase in fluorescence coincides with the rate limiting step of folding on the   ms time scale indicating that these tryptophan residues are buried only during the late stages of folding other variants exhibit a transient increase in fluorescence during the   ms phase followed by a decrease during the rate limiting phase these observations are consistent with burial of these probes in a collapsed but loosely packed intermediate followed by the rate limiting formation of the densely packed native core which brings the tryptophan residues into close contact with intramolecular quenchers
