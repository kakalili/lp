crystal structure of human poly a polymerase gamma reveals a conserved catalytic core for canonical poly a polymerases
in eukaryotes the poly a tail added at the   end of an mrna precursor is essential for the regulation of mrna stability and the initiation of translation poly a polymerase pap is the enzyme that catalyzes the poly a addition reaction multiple isoforms of pap have been identified in vertebrates which originate from gene duplication alternative splicing or post translational modifications the complexity of pap isoforms suggests that they might play different roles in the cell phylogenetic studies indicate that vertebrate paps are grouped into three clades termed    and   which originated from two gene duplication events to date all the available pap structures are from the pap  clade here we present the crystal structure of the first representative of the pap  clade human pap  bound to cordycepin triphosphate   datp and ca  the structure revealed that pap  closely resembles its pap  ortholog an analysis of residue conservation reveals a conserved catalytic binding pocket whereas residues at the surface of the polymerase are more divergent
