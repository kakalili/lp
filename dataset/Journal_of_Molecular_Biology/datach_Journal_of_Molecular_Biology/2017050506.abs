architecture of the flagellar switch complex of escherichia coli conformational plasticity of flig and implications for adaptive remodeling
structural models of the complex that regulates the direction of flagellar rotation assume either   or   copies of the protein flig support for   came from crosslinking experiments identifying an intersubunit contact most consistent with that number support for   came from the observation that flagella can assemble and rotate when flig is genetically fused to flif for which the accepted number is   here we have undertaken crosslinking and other experiments to address more fully the question of flig number the results indicate a copy number of   for flig an interaction between the c terminal and middle domains which has been taken to support a model with   copies is also supported to reconcile the interaction with a flig number of   we hypothesize conformational plasticity in an interdomain segment of flig that allows some subunits to bridge gaps created by the number mismatch this proposal is supported by mutant phenotypes and other results indicating that the normally helical segment adopts a more extended conformation in some subunits the flig amino terminal domain is organized in a regular array with dimensions matching a ring in the upper part of the complex the model predicts that flig copy number should be tied to that of flif whereas flim copy number can increase or decrease according to the number of flig subunits that adopt the extended conformation this has implications for the phenomenon of adaptive switch remodeling in which the flim copy number varies to adjust the bias of the switch
