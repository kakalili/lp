the equilibrium unfolding pathway of a     barrel
the     barrel is the most commonly occurring fold among enzymes a key step towards rationally engineering     barrel proteins is to understand their underlying structural organization and folding energetics using misincorporation proton  alkyl exchange mpax  a new tool for solution structural studies of large proteins we have performed a native state exchange analysis of the prototypical     barrel triosephosphate isomerase three cooperatively unfolding subdomains within the structure are identified as well as two partially unfolded forms of the protein the c terminal domain coincides with domains reported to exist in four other     barrels but the two n terminal domains have not been observed previously these partially unfolded forms may represent sequential intermediates on the folding pathway of triosephosphate isomerase the methods reported here should be applicable to a variety of other biological problems involving protein conformational changes
