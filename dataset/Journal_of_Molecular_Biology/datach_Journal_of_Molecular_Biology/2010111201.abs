modeling studies of chromatin fiber structure as a function of dna linker length
chromatin fibers encountered in various species and tissues are characterized by different nucleosome repeat lengths nrls of the linker dna connecting the nucleosomes while single cellular organisms and rapidly growing cells with high protein production have short nrl ranging from   to   bp mature cells usually have longer nrls ranging between   and   bp recently various experimental studies have examined the effect of nrl on the internal organization of chromatin fiber here we investigate by mesoscale modeling of oligonucleosomes the folding patterns for different nrl with and without linker histone lh  under typical monovalent salt conditions using both one start solenoid and two start zigzag starting configurations we find that short to medium nrl chromatin fibers   to   bp with lh condense into zigzag structures and that solenoid like features are viable only for longer nrls    bp  we suggest that medium nrls are more advantageous for packing and various levels of chromatin compaction throughout the cell cycle than their shortest and longest brethren the former short nrls fold into narrow fibers while the latter long nrls arrays do not easily lead to high packing ratios due to possible linker dna bending moreover we show that the lh has a small effect on the condensation of short nrl arrays but has an important condensation effect on medium nrl arrays which have linker lengths similar to the lh lengths finally we suggest that the medium nrl species with densely packed fiber arrangements may be advantageous for epigenetic control because their histone tail modifications can have a greater effect compared to other fibers due to their more extensive nucleosome interaction network
