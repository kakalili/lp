mechanical design of the third fniii domain of tenascin c
by combining single molecule atomic force microscopy afm  proline mutagenesis and steered molecular dynamics smd simulations we investigated the mechanical unfolding dynamics and mechanical design of the third fibronectin type iii domain of tenascin c tnfn  in detail we found that the mechanical stability of tnfn is similar to that of other constituting fniii domains of tenascin c and the unfolding process of tnfn is an apparent two state process by employing proline mutagenesis to block the formation of backbone hydrogen bonds and introduce structural disruption in  sheet we revealed that in addition to the important roles played by hydrophobic core packing backbone hydrogen bonds in  hairpins are also responsible for the overall mechanical stability of tnfn  furthermore proline mutagenesis revealed that the mechanical design of tnfn is robust and the mechanical stability of tnfn is very resistant to structural disruptions caused by proline substitutions in  sheets proline mutant f p is one exception as the proline mutation at position  reduced the mechanical stability of tnfn significantly and led to unfolding forces of lt   pn this result suggests that phe  is a weak point of the mechanical resistance for tnfn  we used smd simulations to understand the molecular details underlying the mechanical unfolding of tnfn  the comparison between the afm results and smd simulations revealed similarities and discrepancies between the two we compared the mechanical unfolding and design of tnfn and its structural homologue the tenth fniii domain from fibronectin these results revealed the complexity underlying the mechanical design of fniii domains and will serve as a starting point for systematically analyzing the mechanical architecture of other fniii domains in tenascins c and will help to gain a better understanding of some of the complex features observed for the stretching of native tenascin c
