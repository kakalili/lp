stabilization of bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by a  cation interaction edited by j thornton
proteins can use aromatic side chains to stabilize bound cationic ligands through cation  interactions here we report the first example of the reciprocal process termed  cation in which a cationic protein side chain stabilizes a neutral aromatic ligand site directed mutagenesis revealed that an arginine side chain located in the deep binding pocket of a monoclonal antibody  d  is essential for binding the neutral polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon benzo a pyrene this arg was very likely selected for in the primary response further underscoring the importance of the  cation interaction for ligand binding which should be considered in protein analysis and design when ligands include aromatic groups
