a   protects non toxic a   monomer from aggregation
a   and a   are the predominant a  species in the human body toxic a   oligomers and fibrils are believed to play a key role in causing alzheimer s disease ad  however the role of a   in ad pathogenesis is not well established emerging evidence indicates a protective role for a   in ad pathogenesis although a   is known to inhibit a   fibril formation it is not clear whether the inhibition acts on the non toxic monomer or acts on the toxic a   oligomers in contrast to conventional methods that detect the appearance of fibrils in our study a   aggregation was monitored by the decreasing nmr signals from a   monomers in addition differential nmr isotope labelling enabled the selective observation of a   aggregation in a mixture of a   and a   we found a   monomers inhibit the aggregation of non toxic a   monomers in an a   a   ratio dependent manner nmr titration revealed that a   monomers bind to a   aggregates with higher affinity than a   monomers a   can also release a   monomers from a   aggregates thus a   likely protects a   monomers by competing for the binding sites on pre existing a   aggregates combining our data with growing evidence from transgenic mice and human genetics we propose that a   plays a critical protective role in alzheimer s by inhibiting the aggregation of a   monomer a   itself a peptide already present in the human body may therefore be useful for ad prevention and therapy
