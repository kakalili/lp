the crystal structure of helicobacter cysteine rich protein c at    resolution similar peptide binding sites in tpr and sel like repeat proteins
helicobacter pylori is a gram negative human pathogen that infects the gastric mucosa and causes an inflammatory process leading to gastritis ulceration and cancer bacterial cell surface and secreted proteins often play an important role in pathogen  host interactions and are thought to be selective mediators for the pathology of the infection the helicobacter cysteine rich proteins hcp represent a large family of secreted proteins that seem to be specific for microorganisms from the  subfamily of proteobacteria although significantly elevated levels of anti hcp antibodies were observed in many patients infected with h pylori details on the biological functions of hcp proteins are sparse hcps belong to a large family of sel like multi repeat proteins the crystal structure of hcpc was refined at    resolution and revealed a super helical topology composed of seven disulfide bridged    repeats an n terminal capping helix and an extended c terminal coil consisting of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues in the crystal packing the c terminal coil interacts with the concave surface of a symmetry related hcpc super helix a hydrophobic pocket and a cluster of negatively charged residues recognize the side chains of val  and lys  from the c terminal coil respectively the peptide nitrogen atom of his  forms a short hydrogen bond with the side chain of asn  the interactions seen in this crystal contact are strikingly similar to the peptide binding modes of the hsp  hsp  organizing protein and the pex receptor the conservation of the peptide binding mode suggests that hcpc might recognize its binding partner in a similar way
