modeling of substrate specificity of the alzheimer  s disease amyloid precursor protein  secretase edited by f e cohen
the enzyme bace   site app cleaving enzyme has recently been identified as the  secretase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein app to produce the n terminus of the a  peptide found in plaques in the brains of alzheimer  s disease patients bace is an aspartic protease similar to pepsin and renin comparative modeling of the three dimensional structure of bace in complex with its substrate shows that several residues confer specificity of the enzyme for app in particular arg  forms a salt bridge with the p   asp of the app substrate explaining the unusual preference of bace among aspartic proteases for a p   residue that is negatively charged several hydrophobic residues in the enzyme form a pocket for the p hydrophobic residue met in wild type app and leu in app with the    swedish mutation  associated with early onset of alzheimer  s disease  inhibitors that can bind to the bace active site may prove useful for drugs to treat and prevent alzheimer  s disease
