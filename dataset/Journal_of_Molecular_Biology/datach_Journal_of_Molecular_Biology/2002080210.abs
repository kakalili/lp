crystal structure of earthworm fibrinolytic enzyme component a revealing the structural determinants of its dual fibrinolytic activity
earthworm fibrinolytic enzyme component a efea from eisenia fetida is a strong fibrinolytic enzyme that not only directly degrades fibrin but also activates plasminogen proteolytic assays further revealed that it cleaved behind various p residue types the crystal structure of efea was determined using the mir method and refined to    resolution the enzyme showing the overall polypeptide fold of chymotrypsin like serine proteases possesses essential s specificity determinants characteristic of elastase however the  strand at the west rim of the s specificity pocket is significantly elongated by a unique four residue insertion ser ser gly leu after val   which not only provides additional substrate hydrogen binding sites for distal p residues but also causes extension of the s pocket at the south rim the s subsite of the enzyme was partially occluded by the bulky side chain of residue tyr  structure based inhibitor modeling demonstrated that efea s s specificity pocket was preferable for elastase specific small hydrophobic p residues while its accommodation of long and or bulky p residues was also feasible if enhanced binding of the substrate and induced fit of the s pocket were achieved efea is thereby endowed with relatively broad substrate specificity including the dual fibrinolysis the presence of tyr  at the s subsite indicates a preference for p gly while an induced fit of tyr  was also suggested for accommodation of bigger p residues this structure is the first reported for an earthworm fibrinolytic enzyme component and serine protease originating from annelid worms
