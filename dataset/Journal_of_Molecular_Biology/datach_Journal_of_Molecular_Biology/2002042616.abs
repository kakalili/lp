folding in vitro of light harvesting chlorophyll a b protein is coupled with pigment binding
the major light harvesting chlorophyll a b protein lhciib of the plant photosynthetic apparatus is able to self organise in vitro when the recombinant apoprotein lhcb  is solubilised in the denaturing detergent sodium or lithium dodecylsulfate sds or lds and then mixed with chlorophylls and carotenoids under renaturing conditions structurally authentic lhciib forms assembly of functional lhciib as indicated by the establishment of energy transfer between complex bound chlorophyll molecules occurs in two apparent kinetic steps with time constants of  to  seconds and  to   seconds depending on the reaction conditions here we use circular dichroism cd in the far uv range to monitor the folding of the lhciib apoprotein as it is complexed with pigments the  helix content in the protein s secondary structure increases in two apparent kinetic steps with time constants similar to those observed for the establishment of chlorophyll energy transfer when the carotenoid concentration in the reaction mixture is reduced the time constants of  helix formation increase as do those for the appearance of chlorophyll energy transfer this indicates that both processes pigment assembly and secondary structure formation are tightly coupled a substantial amount of  helix is present in dodecylsulfate solubilised lhciib apoprotein and appears to be distributed among various protein domains
