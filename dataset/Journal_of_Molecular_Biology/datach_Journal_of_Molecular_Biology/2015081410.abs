using molecular dynamics simulations as an aid in the prediction of domain swapping of computationally designed protein variants
in standard implementations of computational protein design a positive design approach is used to predict sequences that will be stable on a given backbone structure possible competing states are typically not considered primarily because appropriate structural models are not available one potential competing state the domain swapped dimer is especially compelling because it is often nearly identical with its monomeric counterpart differing by just a few mutations in a hinge region molecular dynamics md simulations provide a computational method to sample different conformational states of a structure here we tested whether md simulations could be used as a post design screening tool to identify sequence mutations leading to domain swapped dimers we hypothesized that a successful computationally designed sequence would have backbone structure and dynamics characteristics similar to that of the input structure and that in contrast domain swapped dimers would exhibit increased backbone flexibility and or altered structure in the hinge loop region to accommodate the large conformational change required for domain swapping while attempting to engineer a homodimer from a  amino acid fragment of the monomeric protein engrailed homeodomain enh  we had instead generated a domain swapped dimer enh dsd  md simulations on these proteins showed increased b factors derived from md simulation in the hinge loop of the enh dsd domain swapped dimer relative to monomeric enh two point mutants of enh dsd designed to recover the monomeric fold were then tested with an md simulation protocol the md simulations suggested that one of these mutants would adopt the target monomeric structure which was subsequently confirmed by x ray crystallography
