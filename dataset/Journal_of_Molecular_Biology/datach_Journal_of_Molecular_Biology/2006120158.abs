crystal structure of the agrin responsive immunoglobulin like domains  and  of the receptor tyrosine kinase musk
muscle specific kinase musk is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle where it is required for formation of the neuromuscular junction musk is activated by agrin a neuron derived heparan sulfate proteoglycan here we report the crystal structure of the agrin responsive first and second immunoglobulin like domains ig and ig  of the musk ectodomain at     resolution the structure reveals that musk ig and ig are ig like domains of the i set subfamily which are configured in a linear semi rigid arrangement in addition to the canonical internal disulfide bridge ig contains a second solvent exposed disulfide bridge which our biochemical data indicate is critical for proper folding of ig and processing of musk two ig  molecules form a non crystallographic dimer that is mediated by a unique hydrophobic patch on the surface of ig  biochemical analyses of musk mutants introduced into musk    myotubes demonstrate that residues in this hydrophobic patch are critical for agrin induced musk activation
