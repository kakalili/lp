turn nucleation perturbs amyloid  self assembly and cytotoxicity
the accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid   a  fibrils is a hallmark of alzheimer s disease although prefibrillar oligomeric species are believed to be the primary neurotoxic congeners in the pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease uncertainty regarding the mechanistic relationship between a  oligomer and fibril formation and the cytotoxicity of these aggregate species persists   turn formation has been proposed to be a potential rate limiting step during a  fibrillogenesis the effect of turn nucleation on a  self assembly was probed by systematically replacing amino acid pairs in the putative turn region of a  residues     with d progly dpg  an effective turn nucleating motif the kinetic thermodynamic and cytotoxic effects of these mutations were characterized it was found that turn formation dramatically accelerated a  fibril self assembly dependent on the site of turn nucleation the cytotoxicity of the three dpg containing a  variants was significantly lower than that of wild type a   presumably due to decreased oligomer populations as a function of a more rapid progression to mature fibrils oligomer populations were not eliminated however suggesting that turn formation is also a feature of oligomer structures these results indicate that turn nucleation is a critical step in a   fibril formation
