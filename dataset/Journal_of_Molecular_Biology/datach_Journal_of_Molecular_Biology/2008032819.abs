structure and dynamics of ca  binding domain  of the na ca  exchanger in the presence and in the absence of ca
the na ca  exchanger is the major exporter of ca  across the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes the activity of the exchanger is regulated by a large intracellular loop that contains two ca  binding domains calcium binding domain cbd  and cbd  cbd binds ca  with much higher affinity than cbd and is considered to be the primary ca  sensor the effect of ca  on the structure and dynamics of cbd has been characterized by nmr spectroscopy using chemical shifts residual dipolar couplings and spin relaxation residual dipolar couplings are used in a new way for residue selection in the determination of the anisotropic rotational diffusion tensor from spin relaxation data the results provide a highly consistent description across these complementary data sets and show that ca  binding is accompanied by a selective conformational change among the binding site residues residues that exhibit a significant conformational change are also sites of altered dynamics in particular ca  binding restricts the mobility of the major acidic segment and affects the dynamics of several nearby binding loops these observations indicate that ca  elicits a local transition to a well ordered coordination geometry in the cbd binding site
