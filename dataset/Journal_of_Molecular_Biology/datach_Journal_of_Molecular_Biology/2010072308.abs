strategy for the use of affinity grids to prepare non his tagged macromolecular complexes for single particle electron microscopy
affinity grids are electron microscopy em grids with a pre deposited lipid monolayer containing functionalized nickel nitrilotriacetic acid lipids affinity grids can be used to prepare his tagged proteins for single particle em from impure solutions or even directly from cell extracts here we introduce the concept of his tagged adaptor molecules which eliminate the need for the target protein or complex to be his tagged the use of his tagged protein a as adaptor molecule allows affinity grids to be used for the preparation of virtually any protein or complex provided that a specific antibody is available or can be raised against the target protein the principle is that the affinity grid is coated with a specific antibody that is recruited to the grid by his tagged protein a the antibody decorated affinity grid can then be used to isolate the target protein directly from a cell extract we first established this approach by preparing negatively stained specimens of both native ribosomal complexes and ribosomal complexes carrying different purification tags directly from hek  t cell extract we then used the his tagged protein a antibody strategy to isolate rna polymerase ii still bound to native dna from hek  t cell extract allowing us to calculate a    resolution density map by single particle cryo em
