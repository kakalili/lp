the three dimensional structure of genomic rna in bacteriophage ms  implications for assembly
using cryo electron microscopy single particle image processing and three dimensional reconstruction with icosahedral averaging we have determined the three dimensional solution structure of bacteriophage ms capsids reassembled from recombinant protein in the presence of short oligonucleotides we have also significantly extended the resolution of the previously reported structure of the wild type ms virion the structures of recombinant ms capsids reveal clear density for bound rna beneath the coat protein binding sites on the inner surface of the t  ms capsid and show that a short extension of the minimal assembly initiation sequence that promotes an increase in the efficiency of assembly interacts with the protein capsid forming a network of bound rna the structure of the wild type ms virion at     resolution reveals icosahedrally ordered density encompassing    of the single stranded rna genome the genome in the wild type virion is arranged as two concentric shells of density connected along the  fold symmetry axes of the particle this novel rna fold provides new constraints for models of viral assembly
