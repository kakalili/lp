the q base of asparaginyl trna is dispensable for efficient   ribosomal frameshifting in eukaryotes edited by j karn
the frameshift signal of the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus ibv contains two cis acting signals essential for efficient frameshifting a heptameric slippery sequence uuuaaac and an rna pseudoknot structure located downstream the frameshift takes place at the slippery sequence with the two ribosome bound trnas slipping back simultaneously by one nucleotide from the zero phase u uua aac to the   phase uuu aaa  asparaginyl trna which decodes the a site codon aac has the modified base q at the wobble position of the anticodon    quu    and it has been speculated that q may be required for frameshifting to test this we measured frameshifting in cos cells that had been passaged in growth medium containing calf serum or horse serum growth in horse serum which contains no free queuine eliminates q from the cellular trna population upon repeated passage over ten cell passages however we found no significant difference in frameshift efficiency between the cell types arguing against a role for q in frameshifting we confirmed that the cells cultured in horse serum were devoid of q by purifying trnas and assessing their q content by trna transglycosylase assays and coupled hplc mass spectroscopy supplementation of the growth medium of cells grown either on horse serum or calf serum with free queuine had no effect on frameshifting either these findings were recapitulated in an in vitro system using rabbit reticulocyte lysates that had been largely depleted of endogenous trnas and resupplemented with q free or q containing trna populations thus q base is not required for frameshifting at the ibv signal and some other explanation is required to account for the slipperiness of eukaryotic asparaginyl trna
