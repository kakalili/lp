Thermally induced transition curves of hen egg-white lysozyme were measured in the presence of several concentrations of dextran at pH 2.0 by near-UV and far-UV CD. The transition curves were fitted to a two-state model by a non-linear, least-squares method to obtain the transition temperature (Tm), enthalpy change (ΔHu(Tm)), and free energy change (ΔGu(T)) of the unfolding transition. An increase in Tm and almost constant ΔHu(Tm) values were observed in the presence of added dextran at concentrations exceeding ca 100gl−1. In addition, dextran-induced conformational changes of fully unfolded protein were investigated by CD spectroscopy. Addition of high concentrations of dextran to solutions of acid-unfolded cytochrome c at pH 2.0 results in a shift of the CD spectrum from that characteristic of the fully unfolded polypeptide to that characteristic of the more compact, salt-induced molten globule state, a result suggesting that the molten globule-like state is stabilized relative to the fully unfolded form in crowded environments. Both observations are in qualitative accord with predictions of a previously proposed model for the effect of intermolecular excluded volume (macromolecular crowding) on protein stability and conformation.
