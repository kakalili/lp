molecular dynamics of the frame shifting pseudoknot from beet western yellows virus the role of non watson crick base pairing ordered hydration cation binding and base mutations on stability and unfolding edited by j doudna
molecular dynamics simulations of the frame shifting pseudoknot from beet western yellows virus bwyv ndb file ur   were performed with explicit inclusion of solvent and counterions in all   ns of simulation were carried out including  ns of the native structure with protonation of the crucial cytosine residue c n   the native structure exhibited stable trajectories retaining all watson crick and tertiary base pairs except for fluctuations or transient disruptions at specific sites the most significant fluctuations involved the change or disruption of hydrogen bonding between c n  and bases g  a  and c  as well as disruption of the water bridges linking c n  with a  and c  to increase sampling of rare events the native simulation was continued at   k a partial irreversible unfolding of the molecule was initiated by slippage of c n  relative to g  and continued by sudden concerted changes in hydrogen bonding involving a  a  and a  these events were followed by a gradual loss of stacking interactions in loop  of the watson crick base pairs only the   terminal pair of stem  dissociated at   k while the trans sugar edge sugar edge a  g interaction remained surprisingly stable four additional room temperature simulations were carried out to obtain insights into the structural and dynamic effects of selected mutations in two of these c was left unprotonated considerable local rearrangements occurred that were not observed in the crystal structure thus confirming n protonation of c in the native molecule we also investigated the effect of mutating c n  to u  to correlate with experimental and phylogenetic studies and of changing the g  c  base pair to a  u  to weaken the trans sugar edge interaction between positions  and  and to test models of unfolding the simulations indicate that the c  g  c  base triple at the junction is the most labile region of the frame shifting pseudoknot they provide insights into the roles of the other non watson crick base pairs in the early stages of unfolding of the pseudoknot which must occur to allow readthrough of the message by the ribosome the simulations revealed several critical highly ordered hydration sites with close to    occupancies and residency times of individual water molecules of up to  ns sodium cation coordination sites with occupancies above   were also observed
