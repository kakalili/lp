global transcription regulation by dna topoisomerase i in exponentially growing saccharomyces cerevisiae cells activation of telomere proximal genes by top deletion
to establish the cellular functions of dna topoisomerase i b top p at a global level we have determined the expression profiles and histone modification patterns affected by top gene deletion  top  in saccharomyces cerevisiae in exponentially growing cells  top specifically increases transcription of telomere proximal genes and decreases glucose utilization and energy production pathways immunoprecipitation data demonstrate that top p can bind to and is catalytically active at telomeric dna repeats and that both  top and an inactive y  f top p mutant increase h histone acetylation at telomere proximal regions interestingly while the y  f mutation has no influence on enzyme recruitment to chromatin sites it has a marked effect on h k  acetylation at subtelomeric regions the top p mutation also increases h histone k dimethylation which has been associated with gene transcription at   termini of subtelomeric genes no major effect of  top or mutation was detected on sir p recruitment however  top has an effect on transcript levels of genes known to regulate telomeric silencing thus the findings indicate that top p activity can favor both a repressed chromatin organization and a reduced gene expression level at telomere proximal regions in yeast as telomere proximal regions are known to be enriched for stress activated genes our findings show that top p can optimize transcript levels for cell growth in exponentially growing cells under a synthetic medium with glucose
