peptide linkage to the  subunit of mhcii creates a stably inverted antigen presentation complex
class ii proteins of the major histocompatibility complex mhcii typically present exogenous antigenic peptides to cognate t cell receptors of cd t lymphocytes the exact conformation of peptide  mhcii complexes pmhcii can vary depending on the length register and orientation of the bound peptide we have recently found the self peptide clip class  ii associated invariant chain  derived peptide to adopt a dynamic bidirectional binding mode with regard to the human mhcii hla dr  hla human leukocyte antigen  we suggested that inversely bound peptides could activate specific t cell clones in the context of autoimmunity as a first step to prove this hypothesis pmhc complexes restricted to either the canonical or the inverted peptide orientation have to be constructed here we show that genetically encoded linkage of clip and two other antigenic peptides to the hla dr   chain results in stable complexes with inversely bound ligands two  dimensional nmr and biophysical analyses indicate that the clip bound pmhcinv complex pmhcinv inverted mhcii  peptide complex displays high thermodynamic stability but still allows for the exchange against higher  affinity viral antigen complemented by comparable data on a corresponding  chain fused canonical hla dr clip complex we further show that linkage of clip leads to a binding mode exactly the same as that of the corresponding unlinked constructs we suggest that our approach constitutes a general strategy to create pmhcinv complexes such engineering is needed to create orientation specific antibodies and raise t cells to study phenomena of autoimmunity caused by isomeric pmhcs
