selection and characterization of small random transmembrane proteins that bind and activate the platelet derived growth factor  receptor
growth factor receptors are typically activated by the binding of soluble ligands to the extracellular domain of the receptor but certain viral transmembrane proteins can induce growth factor receptor activation by binding to the receptor transmembrane domain for example homodimers of the transmembrane  amino acid bovine papillomavirus e protein bind the transmembrane region of the pdgf  receptor tyrosine kinase causing receptor dimerization phosphorylation and cell transformation to determine whether it is possible to select novel biologically active transmembrane proteins that can activate growth factor receptors we constructed and identified small proteins with random hydrophobic transmembrane domains that can bind and activate the pdgf  receptor remarkably cell transformation was induced by approximately   of the clones in a library in which  transmembrane amino acid residues of the e protein were replaced with random hydrophobic sequences the transformation competent transmembrane proteins formed dimers and stably bound and activated the pdgf  receptor genetic studies demonstrated that the biological activity of the transformation competent proteins depended on specific interactions with the transmembrane domain of the pdgf  receptor a consensus sequence distinct from the wild type e sequence was identified that restored transforming activity to a non transforming poly leucine transmembrane sequence indicating that divergent transmembrane sequence motifs can activate the pdgf  receptor molecular modeling suggested that diverse transforming sequences shared similar protein structure including the same homodimer interface as the wild type e protein these experiments have identified novel proteins with transmembrane sequences distinct from the e protein that can activate the pdgf  receptor and transform cells more generally this approach may allow the creation and identification of small proteins that modulate the activity of a variety of cellular transmembrane proteins
