identification of novel alternative splicing events in the huntingtin gene and assessment of the functional consequences using structural protein homology modelling
huntington s disease hd is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a pathological cag trinucleotide repeat expansion in the large multi exon gene huntingtin htt  although multiple pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed for hd there is increasing interest in the rna processing of the htt gene in mammals most multi exon genes are alternatively spliced however few alternative transcripts have been described for htt given the numerous protein bands detected in mouse and human brain tissue by western blotting using anti huntingtin antibodies we examined whether alternative splicing of htt may account for some of these fragments using rt pcr in mouse brain we detected two novel splice variants of htt that lacked the   bp exon   htt  ex  or retained a  bp portion of intron   htt  in  via use of a cryptic splice site the alternative transcripts were present in wild type and homozygous hdh q  q   mouse brain at all ages and in all brain regions and peripheral tissues studied differential splicing of htt  ex  was found in the cerebellum of hdh q  q   mice with a significant reduction in transcript levels in mutant animals in human brain we detected similar splice variants lacking exons  and   the ability of alternatively spliced transcripts to encode different protein isoforms with individual functions in the cell combined with the known role of splicing in disease renders these novel transcripts of interest in the context of hd pathogenesis
