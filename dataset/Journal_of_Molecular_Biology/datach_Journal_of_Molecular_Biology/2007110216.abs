crystal structure of family  uracil dna glycosylase bound to dna
uracil dna glycosylase udg removes uracil generated by the deamination of cytosine or misincorporation of deoxyuridine monophosphate within the udg superfamily a fifth udg family lacks a polar residue in the active site motif which mediates the hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by activation of a water molecule in udg families    we have determined the crystal structure of a novel family  udg from thermus thermophilus hb complexed with dna containing an abasic site the active site structure suggests this enzyme uses both steric force and water activation for its excision reaction a conserved asparagine residue acts as a ligand to the catalytic water molecule the structure also implies that another water molecule acts as a barrier during substrate recognition based on no significant open  closed conformational change upon binding to dna we propose a  slide in  mechanism for initial damage recognition
