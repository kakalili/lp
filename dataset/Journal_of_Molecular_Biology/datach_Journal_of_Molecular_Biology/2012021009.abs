ligand binding and membrane insertion compete with oligomerization of the bclxl apoptotic repressor
b cell lymphoma extra large bclxl apoptotic repressor plays a central role in determining the fate of cells to live or die during physiological processes such as embryonic development and tissue homeostasis herein using a myriad of biophysical techniques we provide evidence that ligand binding and membrane insertion compete with oligomerization of bclxl in solution of particular importance is the observation that such oligomerization is driven by the intermolecular binding of its c terminal transmembrane tm domain to the canonical hydrophobic groove in a domain swapped trans fashion whereby the tm domain of one monomer occupies the canonical hydrophobic groove within the other monomer and vice versa binding of bh ligands to the canonical hydrophobic groove displaces the tm domain in a competitive manner allowing bclxl to dissociate into monomers upon hetero association remarkably spontaneous insertion of bclxl into dmpc dhpc   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine   dihexanoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine bicelles results in a dramatic conformational change such that it can no longer recognize the bh ligands in what has come to be known as the  hit and run  mechanism collectively our data suggest that oligomerization of a key apoptotic repressor serves as an allosteric switch that fine tunes its ligand binding and membrane insertion pertinent to the regulation of apoptotic machinery
