senataxin genome guardian at the interface of transcription and neurodegeneration
r loops comprise an rna dna hybrid and a displaced single stranded dna they play crucial biological functions and are implicated in neurological diseases including ataxias amyotrophic lateral sclerosis nucleotide expansion disorders friedreich ataxia and fragile x syndrome  and cancer currently it is unclear which mechanisms cause r loop structures to become pathogenic the rna dna helicase senataxin setx is one of the best characterised r loop binding factors in vivo mutations in setx are linked to two neurodegenerative disorders ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type  aoa  and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis type  als  setx is known to play a role in transcription neurogenesis and antiviral response here we review the causes of r loop dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases and how these structures contribute to pathomechanisms we will discuss the importance of setx as a genome guardian in suppressing aberrant r loop formation and analyse how setx mutations can lead to neurodegeneration in aoa als  finally we will discuss the implications for other r loop associated neurodegenerative diseases and point to future therapeutic approaches to treat these disorders
