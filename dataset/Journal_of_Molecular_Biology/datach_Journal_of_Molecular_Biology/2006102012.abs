structure of the escherichia coli heptosyltransferase waac binary complexes with adp and adp  deoxy  fluoro heptose
lipopolysaccharides constitute the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria and are therefore essential for cell growth and viability the heptosyltransferase waac is a glycosyltransferase gt involved in the synthesis of the inner core region of lps it catalyzes the addition of the first l glycero d manno heptose heptose molecule to one  deoxy d manno oct  ulosonic acid kdo residue of the kdo lipid a molecule heptose is an essential component of the lps core domain its absence results in a truncated lipopolysaccharide associated with the deep rough phenotype causing a greater susceptibility to antibiotic and an attenuated virulence for pathogenic gram negative bacteria thus waac represents a promising target in antibacterial drug design here we report the structure of waac from the escherichia coli pathogenic strain rs  alone at     resolution and in complex with either adp or the non cleavable analog adp  deoxy  fluoro heptose of the sugar donor at     resolution waac adopts the gt b fold in two domains characteristic of one glycosyltransferase structural superfamily the comparison of the three different structures shows that waac does not undergo a domain rotation characteristic of the gt b family upon substrate binding but allows the substrate analog and the reaction product to adopt remarkably distinct conformations inside the active site in addition both binary complexes offer a close view of the donor subsite and together with results from site directed mutagenesis studies provide evidence for a model of the catalytic mechanism
