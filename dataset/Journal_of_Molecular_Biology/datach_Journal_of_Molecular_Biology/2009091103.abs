a computationally guided protein interaction screen uncovers coiled coil interactions involved in vesicular trafficking
mapping protein  protein interactions at a domain or motif level can provide structural annotation of the interactome the  helical coiled coil is among the most common protein interaction motifs and proteins predicted to contain coiled coils participate in diverse biological processes here we introduce a combined computational experimental screening strategy that we used to uncover coiled coil interactions among proteins involved in vesicular trafficking in saccharomyces cerevisiae a number of coiled coil complexes have already been identified and reported to play important roles in this important biological process we identify additional examples of coiled coils that can form physical associations the computational strategy used to prioritize coiled coil candidates for testing dramatically improved the efficiency of discovery in a large experimental screen as assessed by comprehensive yeast two hybrid assays computational prefiltering retained   of positive interacting pairs and eliminated gt   of negatives from a set of interaction candidates the coiled coil mediated interaction network elucidated using the combined computational experimental approach comprises  coiled coil associations between  protein pairs among which  protein interactions have not been previously reported in interaction databases and  interactions were previously known at the protein level but have now been localized to the coiled coil motif the coiled coil mediated interactions were specific rather than promiscuous and many interactions could be recapitulated in a green fluorescent protein complementation assay our method provides an efficient route to discovering new coiled coil interactions and uncovers a number of associations that may have functional significance for vesicular trafficking
