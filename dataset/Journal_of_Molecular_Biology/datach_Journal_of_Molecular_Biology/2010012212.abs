selective removal of individual disulfide bonds within a potato type ii serine proteinase inhibitor from nicotiana alata reveals differential stabilization of the reactive site loop
the  amino acid trypsin inhibitor  from nicotiana alata t  belongs to the potato type ii family also known as the pinii family of proteinase inhibitors one of the major families of canonical proteinase inhibitors t contains four disulfide bonds two of which c  c  and c  c  stabilize the reactive site loop to investigate the influence of these two disulfide bonds on the structure and function of potato ii inhibitors we constructed two variants of t  c a c a t and c a c a t  in which these two disulfide bonds were individually removed and replaced by alanine residues trypsin inhibition assays show that wild type t has a ki of lt  nm c a c a t has a weaker ki of     nm and the potency of the c a c a variant is further decreased to a ki of      m to assess the influence of the disulfide bonds on the structure of t  we determined the structure and dynamics of both disulfide variants by nmr spectroscopy the structure of c a c a t and the amplitude of intrinsic flexibility in the reactive site loop resemble that of the wild type protein closely despite the lack of the c  c  disulfide bond whereas the timescale of motions is markedly decreased the rescue of the structure despite loss of a disulfide bond is due to a previously unrecognized network of interactions which stabilizes the structure of the reactive site loop in the region of the missing disulfide bond while allowing intrinsic motions on a fast picosecond  nanosecond timescale in contrast no comparable interactions are present around the c  c  disulfide bond consequently the reactive site loop becomes disordered and highly flexible in the structure of c a c a t  making it unable to bind to trypsin thus the reactive site loop of t is stabilized differently by the c  c  and c  c  disulfide bonds the c  c  disulfide bond is essential for the inhibitory activity of t  whereas the c  c  disulfide bond is not as critical for maintaining the three dimensional structure and function of the molecule but is responsible for maintaining flexibility of the reactive site loop on a microsecond  nanosecond timescale
