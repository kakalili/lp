nucleotide free sb raf is preferentially bound by hsp  and cdc  in vitro
the molecular chaperone hsp  and its cofactor cdc  are required for the stability of protein kinases in the cellular environment upon pharmacological inhibition of hsp  the hsp  dependent kinases are degraded quickly by the proteasome clear physiological evidence for the formation of heterooligomeric complexes between the chaperone system and its kinase clients exist but the mechanisms of client processing are still enigmatic here we investigate the interaction of the chaperone system with a stabilized fragment of the hsp  dependent protein kinase b raf sb raf  sb raf is aggregation prone at elevated temperatures we find that nucleotide binding strongly stabilizes the folded state of sb raf and suppresses its aggregation also cdc  and hsp  in combination can suppress sb raf aggregation while forming a ternary complex with the kinase the presence of nucleotides leads to the dissociation of the kinase from the ternary chaperone complex implying that the stabilization of the kinase by nucleotides reduces its affinity toward the chaperone machinery human cdc   hsp  complexes can bind to kinase if the nm domain of the chaperone is present nematode cdc  which does not require the n terminal hsp  domain for binding can form a ternary complex with the mc construct of hsp  which lacks the aggregation propensity of sb raf like the full length complex this interaction is sensitive to atp binding to sb raf we thus find that the interaction between sb raf and the hsp  chaperone system is based on contacts with the m domain of hsp  which contributes in forming the ternary complex with cecdc  as long as the kinase is not stabilized by nucleotide
