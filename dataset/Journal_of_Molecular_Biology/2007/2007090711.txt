Host response to viral RNA genomes and replication products represents an effective strategy to combat viral invasion. PKR is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that binds to double-stranded (ds)RNA, autophosphorylates its kinase domain, and subsequently phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). This results in attenuation of protein translation, preventing synthesis of necessary viral proteins. In certain DNA viruses, PKR function can be evaded by transcription of highly structured virus-encoded dsRNA inhibitors that bind to and inactivate PKR. We probe here the mechanism of PKR inhibition by two viral inhibitor RNAs, EBERI (from Epstein–Barr) and VAI (from human adenovirus). Native gel shift mobility assays and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments confirmed that the RNA-binding domains of PKR are sufficient and necessary for the interaction with dsRNA inhibitors. Both EBERI and VAI are effective inhibitors of PKR activation by preventing trans-autophosphorylation between two PKR molecules. The RNA inhibitors prevent self-association of PKR molecules, providing a mechanistic basis for kinase inhibition. A variety of approaches indicated that dsRNA inhibitors remain associated with PKR under activating conditions, as opposed to activator dsRNA molecules that dissociate due to reduced affinity for the phosphorylated form of PKR. Finally, we show using a HeLa cell extract system that inhibitors of PKR result in translational recovery by the protein synthesis machinery. These data indicate that inhibitory dsRNAs bind preferentially to the latent, dephosphorylated form of PKR and prevent dimerization that is required for trans-autophosphorylation.
