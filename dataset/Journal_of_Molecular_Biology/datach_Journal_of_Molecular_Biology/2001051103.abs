islet amyloid polypeptide identification of long range contacts and local order on the fibrillogenesis pathway edited by f cohen
the pathology of type ii diabetes includes deposition of amyloid in the extra cellular space surrounding the  cells of the endocrine pancreas the principle component of these deposits is an insoluble fibrillar form of a normally soluble  residue peptide hormone islet amyloid polypeptide multiple sequence analysis and peptide synthesis have identified a core set of residues   to   as intrinsically amyloidogenic as the fibrillogenesis of the     peptide often requires conditions that deviate considerably from physiological residues  to  may be necessary but not sufficient for amyloidosis we aim to determine the structural role of residues outside this core in the context of in vitro fibrillogenesis of the wild type peptide at physiological ph and ionic strength specifically we make use of an intrinsic fluorescent probe tyrosine   y   to explore the role of the c terminus in fibrillogenesis our protocol permits steady state measurement of the lag phase and fiber conformational states of the protein under identical conditions these are compared to a non amyloidogenic variant of islet amyloid polypeptide from rat and n acetyl tyrosinamide as models of the unfolded state under matched conditions spectral quenching and anisotropic properties of y  in the fiber state indicate that the c terminus is packed in a well defined environment with near frozen rigidity the presence of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer pathway shows y  is near f  and f  the lag phase conformation while considerably less ordered than the fiber is more ordered than unfolded models differences in anisotropy between the lag and fiber state were used to monitor fibrillogenesis in real time parallel assessment of fiber formation using the histological dye tht indicate that ordering at the c terminus of islet amyloid polypeptide is coincident with and thus indicative of fiber formation
