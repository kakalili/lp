gene amplification involves site specific short homology independent illegitimate recombination in acinetobacter sp strain adp
a system for studying gene amplification in the bacterium acinetobacter sp strain adp was used to isolate   spontaneous mutants the method selects for the elevated expression of neighboring transcriptional units in a parent strain lacking its normal transcriptional activators gene amplification can compensate for the activator loss by increasing the copy number of seven weakly expressed genes mutant colonies arose from the parent strain at a frequency of    within three weeks all but one of these mutants carried tandem head to tail repeats of a chromosomal segment amplicon  these amplicons varied in size from approximately     kb and ranged in copy number from  to more than   gene amplification involved a two step process in which duplications formed independently of reca illegitimate recombination fused normally distant chromosomal regions to create novel dna duplication junctions these junctions were isolated from amplification mutants using an assay that exploits acinetobacter natural transformability sequence analysis of  junctions revealed little identity in the recombining regions furthermore multiple independently isolated mutants contained identical junctions six different junctions each found in two to six mutants revealed that some recombination events are site specific several recurring junctions were studied using pcr in each case the identical duplication present in the mutant was estimated to have occurred in as many as one in a million cells in populations of strains never exposed to selective conditions these duplications appeared to form spontaneously by a novel type of short homology independent site specific process however in the absence of reca mutant colonies were not selected from parent cells containing these duplications thus the second gene amplification step most likely depends on homologous recombination to increase amplicon copy number these studies support the theory that gene amplification is a driving force in the evolution of functionally related gene clusters
