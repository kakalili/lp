crystal structure of mshb from mycobacterium tuberculosis a deacetylase involved in mycothiol biosynthesis
all living species require protection against the damaging effects of the reactive oxygen species that are a natural by product of aerobic life in most organisms glutathione is a critical component of these defences maintaining a reducing environment inside cells some bacteria however including pathogenic mycobacteria use an alternative low molecular mass thiol compound called mycothiol msh for this purpose enzymes that synthesize msh are attractive candidates for the design of novel anti tb drugs because of the importance of msh for mycobacterial life and the absence of such enzymes in humans we have determined the three dimensional structure of mshb rv    a metal dependent deacetylase from mycobacterium tuberculosis that catalyses the second step in msh biosynthesis the structure determined at    resolution by x ray crystallography r    rfree     reveals an    fold in which helices pack against a seven stranded mostly parallel  sheet large loops emanating from the c termini of the  strands enclose a deep cavity which is the location of the putative active site at the bottom of this cavity is a metal binding site associated with a sequence motif ahpdde that is invariant in all homologues an adventitiously bound  octylglucoside molecule used in crystallization enables us to model the binding of the true substrate and propose a metal dependent mechanistic model for deacetylation sequence comparisons indicate that mshb is representative of a wider family of enzymes that act on substituted n acetylglucosamine residues including a deacetylase involved in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchors in eukaryotes
