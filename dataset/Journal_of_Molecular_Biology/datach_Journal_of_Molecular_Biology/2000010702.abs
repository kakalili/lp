the basis for the super repressor phenotypes of the av  and ek  mutants of trp repressor edited by r ebright
the dna binding properties of two super repressor mutants of the escherichia coli trp repressor ek  and av  have been investigated using steady state fluorescence anisotropy measurements in order to further elucidate the basis for their super repressor phenotypes several suggestions have been previously proposed as the basis for the super repressor phenotype of ek  and av  for the negative to positive charge change ek  mutant increased electrostatic interactions between the ek  mutant and the operator and increased protein protein interactions between ek  dimers have been suggested as contributing to the super repressor phenotype of this mutant we show that ek  dimers actually bind to wild type and variant operator sequences with a decrease in apparent cooperativity and an increase in affinity compared to wttr dimers thus the ek  super repressor phenotype is not due to increased cooperative binding between ek  dimers these results support the hypothesis that the super repressor phenotype of ek  arises from increased electrostatic interactions between the mutant and dna in the case of the av  mutant weaker binding affinity of apo av  to non specific dna increased selectivity of binding of av  for the operator and a higher population of folded functional av  dimers available to bind the operator under limiting l trp conditions in vivo have been proposed for the super repressor phenotype of this mutant we show that like the ek  mutant apoav  binds with higher affinity to non specific dna compared to apo wttr and that the holo av  mutant does not bind with higher selectivity to the operator has had been previously proposed we therefore conclude that the super repressor phenotype of the av  mutant is due to an increase in the population of folded functional av  dimers under limiting l trp conditions in vivo
