an entirely cell based system to generate single chain antibodies against cell surface receptors
the generation of recombinant antibodies abs using phage display is a proven method to obtain a large variety of abs that bind with high affinity to a given antigen traditionally the generation of single chain abs depends on the use of recombinant proteins in several stages of the procedure this can be a problem especially in the case of cell surface receptors because abs generated and selected against recombinant proteins may not bind the same protein expressed on a cell surface in its native form and because the expression of some receptors as recombinant proteins is problematic to overcome these difficulties we developed a strategy to generate single chain abs that does not require the use of recombinant protein at any stage of the procedure in this strategy stably transfected cells are used for the immunization of mice measuring ab responses to immunization panning the phage library high throughput screening of arrayed phage clones and characterization of recombinant single chain variable regions this strategy was used to generate a panel of single chain abs specific for the innate immunity receptor toll like receptor  once generated individual single chain variable regions were subcloned into an expression vector allowing the production of recombinant abs in insect cells thus avoiding the contamination of recombinant abs with microbial products this cell based system efficiently generates abs that bind to native molecules on the cell surface bypasses the requirement of recombinant protein production and avoids risks of microbial component contamination
