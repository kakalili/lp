a survey of  repressor fragments from two state to downhill folding
we survey the two state to downhill folding transition by examining        mutants that cover a wide range of stabilities and folding rates we investigated four new       mutants designed to fold especially rapidly two were engineered using the core remodeling of lim and sauer and two were engineered using ferreiro et al s frustratometer these proteins have probe dependent melting temperatures as high as    c and exhibit a fast molecular phase with the characteristic temperature dependence of the amplitude expected for downhill folding the survey reveals a correlation between melting temperature and downhill folding previously observed for the  sheet protein ww domain a simple model explains this correlation and predicts the melting temperature at which downhill folding becomes possible an x ray crystal structure with a     resolution of a fast folding mutant fragment shows regions of enhanced rigidity compared to the full wild type protein
