alternative allosteric mechanisms can regulate the substrate and e in sumo conjugation
sumoylation is the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin like modifier sumo to a target protein similar to other ubiquitin like pathways three enzyme types are involved that act in succession an activating enzyme e  a conjugating enzyme e  and a ligase e  to date unlike other ubiquitin like mechanisms sumoylation of the target rangap  targetrangap  does not absolutely require the e of the system ranbp  e ranbp  since the presence of e  e ubc  is enough to sumoylate targetrangap  however in the presence of e  sumoylation is more efficient to understand the role of the target specificity of e ranbp and e ubc  we carried out molecular dynamics simulations for the structure of e ubc  sumo  targetrangap with and without the e ranbp ligase analysis of the dynamics of e ubc  sumo  targetrangap in the absence and presence of e ranbp revealed that two different allosteric sites regulate the ligase activity  i in the presence of e ranbp  the e ubc s loop   ii in the absence of e ranbp  the leu   arg  region of sumo these results provide a first insight into the question of how e ranbp can act as an intrinsic e for e ubc and why in its absence the activity of e ubc  sumo  targetrangap could still be maintained albeit at lower efficiency
