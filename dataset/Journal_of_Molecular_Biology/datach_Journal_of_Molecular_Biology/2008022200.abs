modulating catalytic activity by unnatural amino acid residues in a gsh binding loop of gst p
the loop following helix   in glutathione transferase p  has two conserved residues cys  and tyr  important for glutathione gsh binding and catalytic activity chemical modification of cys  thwarts the catalytic activity of the enzyme and mutation of tyr  generally decreases the kcat value and the affinity for gsh in a differential manner cys  and tyr  were targeted by site specific mutations and chemical modifications in order to investigate how the   loop modulates gsh binding and catalysis mutation of cys  into ala increased kmgsh  fold and decreased the binding energy of gsh by   kcal mol furthermore the protein stability against thermal inactivation and chemical denaturation decreased the crystal structure of the cys free variant was determined and its similarity to the wild type structure suggests that the mutation of cys  increases the flexibility of the   loop rather than dislocating the gsh interacting residues on the other hand replacement of tyr  with cys producing mutant y c increased the gibbs free energy of the catalyzed reaction by   kcal mol lowered the affinity for s hexyl glutathione by   kcal mol and decreased the thermal stability the targeted alkylation of cys  in y c increased the affinity for gsh and protein stability characterization of the most active alkylated variants s n butyl  s n pentyl  and s cyclobutylmethyl y c indicated that the affinity for gsh is restored by stabilizing the   loop through positioning of the key residue into the lock structure of the neighboring subunit in addition kcat can be further modulated by varying the structure of the key residue side chain which impinges on the rate limiting step of catalysis
