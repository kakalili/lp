crystal structure of human general transcription factor tfiie at atomic resolution
in eukaryotes rna polymerase ii requires general transcription factors to initiate mrna transcription tfiie subunits  and  form a heterodimer and recruit tfiih to complete the assembly of the pre initiation complex here we have determined the crystal structure of human tfiie at atomic resolution the n terminal half of tfiie  forms an extended winged helix wh domain with an additional helix followed by a zinc finger domain tfiie  contains the wh domain followed by two coiled coil helices intertwining with tfiie  we also showed that tfiie  binds to tfiie  with nanomolar affinity using isothermal titration calorimetry in addition mutations on the residues involved in the interactions resulted in severe growth defects in yeast lack of the c terminal region of yeast tfiie  causes a mild growth defect in vivo these findings provide a structural basis for understanding the functional mechanisms of tfiie in the context of pre initiation complex formation and transcription initiation
