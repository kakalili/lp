The Type III restriction endonuclease EcoP15I forms a hetero-oligomeric enzyme complex that consists of two modification (Mod) subunits and two restriction (Res) subunits. Structural data on Type III restriction enzymes in general are lacking because of their remarkable size of more than 400 kDa and the laborious and low-yield protein purification procedures. We took advantage of the EcoP15I-overexpressing vector pQEP15 and affinity chromatography to generate a quantity of EcoP15I high enough for comprehensive proteolytic digestion studies and analyses of the proteolytic fragments by mass spectrometry. We show here that in the presence of specific DNA the entire Mod subunit is protected from trypsin digestion, whereas in the absence of DNA stable protein domains of the Mod subunit were not detected. In contrast, the Res subunit is comprised of two trypsin-resistant domains of approximately 77−79 kDa and 27−29 kDa, respectively. The cofactor ATP and the presence of DNA, either specific or unspecific, are important stabilizers of the Res subunit. The large N-terminal domain of Res contains numerous functional motifs that are predicted to be involved in ATP-binding and hydrolysis and/or DNA translocation. The C-terminal small domain harbours the catalytic center. Based on our data, we conclude that both structural Res domains are connected by a flexible linker region that spans 23 amino acid residues. To confirm this conclusion, we have investigated several EcoP15I enzyme mutants obtained by insertion mutagenesis in and around the predicted linker region within the Res subunit. All mutants tolerated the genetic manipulation and did not display loss of function or alteration of the DNA cleavage position.
