structure of bacteriophage t gene product   the interface between the baseplate and short tail fibers edited by p e wright
bacteriophage t  like all other viruses is required to be stable while being transmitted from host to host but also is poised to eject efficiently and rapidly its double stranded dna genome to initiate infection the latter is coordinated by the recognition of receptors on escherichia coli cells by the long tail fibers and subsequent irreversible attachment by the short tail fibers these fibers are attached to the baseplate a multi subunit assembly at the distal end of the tail recognition and attachment induce a conformational transition of the baseplate from a hexagonal to a star shaped structure the crystal structure of gene product   gp   a protein that connects the short tail fibers to the baseplate has been determined to    resolution using multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion with se this structure is compared to the trimeric structure of gp  which connects the baseplate with the long tail fibers the structure of gp  is a trimer with each monomer consisting of   residues folded into three domains the n terminal domains form a central trimeric parallel coiled coil surrounded by the middle  finger  domains the fingers emanate from the carboxy terminal  annulus domain which by comparison with the t whisker  fibritin  protein is probably responsible for trimerization the events leading from recognition of the host to the ejection of viral dna must be communicated along the assembled trimeric gp  attached to the long tail fibers via the trimeric baseplate protein gp   to the trimeric gp   and the trimeric short tail fibers
