the crystal structure of a binary complex of two pseudopilins epsi and epsj from the type  secretion system of vibrio vulnificus
type ii secretion systems t ss translocate virulence factors from the periplasmic space of many pathogenic bacteria into the extracellular environment the t ss of vibrio cholerae and related species is called the extracellular protein secretion eps system that consists of a core of multiple copies of  different proteins the pseudopilins epsg epsh epsi epsj and epsk are five t ss proteins that are thought to assemble into a pseudopilus which is assumed to interact with the outer membrane pore and may actively participate in the export of proteins we report here biochemical evidence that the minor pseudopilins epsi and epsj from vibrio species interact directly with one another moreover the     resolution crystal structure of a complex of espi and epsj from vibrio vulnificus represents the first atomic resolution structure of a complex of two different pseudopilin components from the t ss both epsi and epsj appear to be structural extremes within the family of type a pilin structures solved to date with epsi having the smallest and epsj the largest   variable pilin segment  seen thus far a high degree of sequence conservation in the epsi epsj interface indicates that this heterodimer occurs in the t ss of a large number of bacteria the arrangement of epsi and epsj in the heterodimer would correspond to a right handed helical character of proteins assembled into a pseudopilus
