minor structural changes in a mutated human melanoma antigen correspond to dramatically enhanced stimulation of a cd  tumor infiltrating lymphocyte line
while most immunotherapies for cancer have focused on eliciting specific cd  cytotoxic t lymphocyte killing of tumor cells a mounting body of evidence suggests that stimulation of anti tumor cd  t cell help may be required for highly effective therapy several mhc class ii restricted tumor antigens that specifically activate such cd  helper t lymphocytes have now been identified including one from a melanoma tumor that is caused by a single base pair mutation in the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase this mutation results in the conversion of a threonine residue to isoleucine within the antigenic epitope concomitant with a greater than five log fold increase in stimulation of a cd  tumor infiltrating lymphocyte line here we present the crystal structures of hla dr in complex with both wild type and mutant tpi peptide antigens the first structures of tumor peptide antigen mhc class ii complexes recognized by cd  t cells to be reported these structures show that very minor changes in the binding surface for t cell receptor correspond to the dramatic differences in t cell stimulation defining the structural basis by which cd  t cell help is invoked in an anti tumor immune response will likely aid the design of more effective cancer immunotherapies
