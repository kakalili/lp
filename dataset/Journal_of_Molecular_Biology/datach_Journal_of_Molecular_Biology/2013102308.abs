crystal structure of a bioactive pactamycin analog bound to the  s ribosomal subunit
biosynthetically and chemically derived analogs of the antibiotic pactamycin and de  methylsalicylyl msa pactamycin have attracted recent interest as potential antiprotozoal and antitumor drugs here we report a    crystal structure of de  msa pactamycin bound to its target site on the thermus thermophilus  s ribosomal subunit although de  msa pactamycin lacks the msa moiety it shares the same binding site as pactamycin and induces a displacement of nucleic acid template bound at the e site of the  s the structure highlights unique interactions between this pactamycin analog and the ribosome which paves the way for therapeutic development of related compounds
