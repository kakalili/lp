intrasubunit and intersubunit interactions controlling assembly of active synaptic complexes during hin catalyzed dna recombination
serine recombinases which generate double strand breaks in dna must be carefully regulated to ensure that chemically active dna complexes are assembled correctly in the hin catalyzed site specific dna inversion reaction two inversely oriented recombination sites on the same dna molecule assemble into a synaptic complex that uniquely generates inversion products the fis bound recombinational enhancer together with topological constraints directed by dna supercoiling functions to regulate hin synaptic complex formation and activity we have isolated a collection of gain of function mutants in  positions within the catalytic and oligomerization domains of hin using two genetic screens and by site directed mutagenesis one genetic screen measured recombination in the absence of fis and the other assessed sos induction as a readout of increased dna cleavage these mutations together with molecular modeling identify important sites of dynamic intrasubunit and intersubunit interactions that regulate assembly of the active tetrameric recombination complex of particular interest are interactions between the oligomerization helix helix e and the catalytic domain of the same subunit that function to hold the dimer in an inactive state in the absence of the fis enhancer system among these is a relay involving a triad of phenylalanines that are proposed to switch positions during the transition from dimers to the catalytically active tetramer novel hin mutants that generate synaptic complexes that are blocked at steps prior to dna cleavage are also described
