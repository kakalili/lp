solution structure of a mutant of transcription factor  implications for enhanced dna binding edited by m f summers
an nmr solution structure of a mutant of the homodimer protein transcription factor  tf g  i    kda  has been solved to atomic resolution with  final structures that converge to an r m s d of     the overall shape of tf g  i  remains similar to that of the wild type protein and other type ii dna binding proteins each monomer has two n terminal  helices separated by a short loop followed by a three stranded  sheet whose extension between the second and third  strands forms an antiparallel  ribbon arm leading to a c terminal third  helix that is severely kinked in the middle close examination of the structure of tf g  i  reveals why it is more stable and binds dna more tightly than does its wild type counterpart the dimeric core consisting of the n terminal helices and the  sheets is more tightly packed and this might be responsible for its increased thermal stability the dna binding domain composed of the top face of the  sheet the  ribbon arms and the c terminal helices is little changed from wild type tf  rather the enhancement in dna affinity must be due almost exclusively to the creation of an additional dna binding site at the side of the dimer by changes affecting helices  and  helix  of tf g  i  is one residue longer than helix  of the wild type protein bends inward and is both translationally and rotationally displaced relative to helix  this rearrangement creates a longer narrower fissure between the v shaped n terminal helices and exposes additional positively charged surface at each side of the dimer
