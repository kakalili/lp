the role of magnesium ions and   hydroxyl groups in the vs ribozyme  substrate interaction
the minimal substrate of the trans cleaving neurospora vs ribozyme has a stem loop structure and interacts with the ribozyme by rna tertiary interactions that remain only partially defined the magnesium ion dependence of the catalytic parameters of a trans cleaving vs derived ribozyme were studied the turnover number of the catalytic rna was found to depend on the binding of at least three magnesium ions with an apparent magnesium ion dissociation constant of  mm but km was observed to be metal ion independent in the millimolar range to address the role of   hydroxyl groups of the vs substrate rna in interactions with the ribozyme   altered substrates each with a single   deoxyribonucleoside substitution were synthesised and their kinetic properties in the vs ribozyme reaction were analysed the removal of five   hydroxyl groups at positions g   a   u   c  and g  inhibited the reaction whereas at two sites g  and a   reaction was stimulated by the modification substitution of g  with a   deoxynucleoside was expected to inhibit the reaction in line with the critical role of this   hydroxyl group in the transesterification reaction altered substrates in which a   o methyl nucleoside replaced a   u   c  and g  were prepared and characterised although removal of the hydroxyl group of a  inhibited the turnover number of the ribozyme significantly this activity was recovered upon   o methyl adenosine substitution suggesting that the   oxygen atom of this nucleoside forms an important contact within the ribozyme active site a cluster of residues within the loop region of the substrate were more modestly affected by   deoxynucleoside substitution in two cases magnesium binding was impaired suggesting that stem loop i is a possible magnesium ion binding site
