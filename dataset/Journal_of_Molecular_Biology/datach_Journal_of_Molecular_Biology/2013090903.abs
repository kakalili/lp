molecular mechanism of membrane binding of the grp ph domain
the pleckstrin homology ph domain of the general receptor of phosphoinositides  grp  protein selectively binds to a rare signaling phospholipid phosphatidylinositol     trisphosphate pip  in the membrane the specific pip lipid docking of grp ph domain is essential to protein cellular function and is believed to occur in a stepwise process electrostatic driven membrane association followed by the specific pip binding by a combination of all atom molecular dynamics md simulations coarse grained analysis electron paramagnetic resonance epr membrane docking geometry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret kinetic studies we have investigated the search and bind process in the grp ph domain at the molecular scale we simulated the two membrane binding states of the grp ph domain in the pip search process before and after the grp ph domain docks with the pip lipid our results suggest that the background anionic phosphatidylserine lipids which constitute around one fifth of the membrane by composition play a critical role in the initial stages of recruiting protein to the membrane surface through non specific electrostatic interactions our data also reveal a previously unseen transient membrane association mechanism that is proposed to enable a two dimensional  hopping  search of the membrane surface for the rare pip target lipid we further modeled the pip bound membrane  protein system using the epr membrane docking structure for the md simulations quantitatively validating the epr membrane docking structure and augmenting our understanding of the binding interface with atomic level detail several observations and hypotheses reached from our md simulations are also supported by experimental kinetic studies
