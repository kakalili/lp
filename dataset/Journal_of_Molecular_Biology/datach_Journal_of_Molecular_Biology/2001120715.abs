crystal structure of  transcriptional repressor encoded by streptococcus pyogenes plasmid psm   at    resolution edited by r huber
the  amino acid residue  protein encoded by the streptococcus pyogenes non conjugative plasmid psm   is a transcriptional repressor that regulates expression of genes for copy number control and stable maintenance of plasmids the crystal structure of  protein has been determined by multiple isomorphous replacement including anomalous scattering and refined to an r factor of     rfree     at    resolution two monomers related by a non crystallographic  fold axis form a homodimer that occupies the asymmetric unit each polypeptide chain is folded into two  helices and one  strand forming an antiparallel  ribbon in the homodimer the n terminal regions     and    in subunits i and ii respectively are not defined in the electron density due to proteolysis of the n terminal  amino acid residues during crystallisation and partial disorder the  protein belongs to the structural superfamily of metj arc repressors featuring a ribbon helix helix dna binding motif with the  ribbon located in and recognizing the major groove of operator dna according to a modelled  protein dna complex residues arg  and arg   on the  ribbon are in positions to interact with a nucleobase especially guanine
