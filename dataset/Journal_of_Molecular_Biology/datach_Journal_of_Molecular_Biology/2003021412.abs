structure of the intact stem and bulge of hiv   rna stem loop sl
the  rna packaging signal of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genome contains a  nucleotide stem loop termed sl  which is important for efficient genome packaging during virus assembly and for reverse transcription during infectivity the predicted secondary structure of sl consists of an upper stem with a gc rich loop that facilitates dimerization a lower stem and an intervening bulge g  a   g   g  that is both strictly conserved and essential for efficient packaging of the viral genome the structure of the upper stem in both the kissing and duplex dimer forms have been determined recently here we report the structure of an engineered form of sl  sl m that contains a gaga tetraloop substituted for the gc rich loop this construct does not aggregate and remains monomeric at concentrations up to mm enabling structural studies of the intact stems and bulge the structure was refined using h   c residual dipolar couplings the upper stem c  g  c   g  is in close agreement with x ray structures of kissing and duplex dimer forms of related oligoribonucleotides and nucleotides c  g and c   g  form the expected a helical lower stem residues g and a  of the predicted bulge form a g  a mismatch that stacks with the upper stem and residues g  and g  stack between the g  a mismatch and the lower stem in a manner that produces a hole in the center of the bulge and a      bend between the upper and lower stems sl m exhibits relatively poor affinity for the hiv  nucleocapsid protein suggesting that the bulge plays other roles in genome packaging
