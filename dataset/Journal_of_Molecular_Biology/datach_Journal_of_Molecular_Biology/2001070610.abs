micromechanics and ultrastructure of actin filament networks crosslinked by human fascin a comparison with  actinin edited by w baumeister
fascin is an actin crosslinking protein that organizes actin filaments into tightly packed bundles believed to mediate the formation of cellular protrusions and to provide mechanical support to stress fibers using quantitative rheological methods we studied the evolution of the mechanical behavior of filamentous actin f actin networks assembled in the presence of human fascin the mechanical properties of f actin fascin networks were directly compared with those formed by  actinin a prototypical actin filament crosslinking bundling protein gelation of f actin networks in the presence of fascin fascin to actin molar ratio gt    exhibits a non monotonic behavior characterized by a burst of elasticity followed by a slow decline over time moreover the rate of gelation shows a non monotonic dependence on fascin concentration in contrast   actinin increased the f actin network elasticity and the rate of gelation monotonically time resolved multiple angle light scattering and confocal and electron microscopies suggest that this unique behavior is due to competition between fascin mediated crosslinking and side branching of actin filaments and bundles on the one hand and delayed actin assembly and enhanced network micro heterogeneity on the other hand the behavior of f actin fascin solutions under oscillatory shear of different frequencies which mimics the cell  s response to forces applied at different rates supports a key role for fascin mediated f actin side branching f actin side branching promotes the formation of interconnected networks which completely inhibits the motion of actin filaments and bundles our results therefore show that despite sharing seemingly similar f actin crosslinking bundling activity   actinin and fascin display completely different mechanical behavior when viewed in the context of recent microrheological measurements in living cells these results provide the basis for understanding the synergy between multiple crosslinking proteins and in particular the complementary mechanical roles of fascin and  actinin in vivo
