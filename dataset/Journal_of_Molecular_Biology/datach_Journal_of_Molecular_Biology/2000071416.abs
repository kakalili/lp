the c terminal regulatory domain of p  contains a functional docking site for cyclin a edited by j karn
radiation injury to cells enhances c terminal phosphorylation of p  at both ser  and ser  in vivo suggesting the existence of two cooperating dna damage responsive pathways that play a role in stimulating p  dependent gene expression our previous data has shown that cyclin a cdk is the major enzyme responsible for modifying p  at ser  in vivo after irradiation damage and in this report we dissect the mechanism of cyclina cdk binding to and phosphorylation of p  although cyclin b dependent protein kinases can phosphorylate small peptides containing the ser  site cyclin a cdk does not phosphorylate such small peptides suggesting that additional determinants are required for cyclin a cdk interaction with p  peptide competition studies have localized a cyclin a interaction site to a lys  lys  leu  met  phe  sequence within c terminal negative regulatory domain of human p  an alanine mutation at any one of four key positions abrogates the efficacy of a synthetic peptide containing this motif as an inhibitor of cyclin a cdk phosphorylation of p  protein single amino acid mutations of full length p  protein at lys   leu   or phe  decreases cyclin a cdk dependent phosphorylation at ser   cyclin b cdk complexes are not inhibited by kklmf motif containing peptides nor is p  phosphorylation by cyclin b cdk reduced by mutation of the cyclin a interaction site these data identifying a kklmf cyclin a docking site on p  protein highlight a common cyclin a interaction motif that is shared between the tumour suppressor proteins prb and p
