structure and functionality of a designed p  dimer edited by p e wright
p  is a homotetrameric tumor suppressor protein involved in transcriptional control of genes that regulate cell proliferation and death in order to probe the role that oligomerization plays in this capacity we have previously designed and characterized a series of p  proteins with altered oligomeric states through hydrophilc substitution of residues met  or leu  in the normally tetrameric oligomerization domain although such mutations have little effect on the overall secondary structural content of the oligomerization domain both solubility and the resistance to thermal denaturation are substantially reduced relative to that of the wild type domain here we report the design and characterization of a double mutant p  with alterations of residues at positions met  and leu   the double mutations met  glu leu  lys and met  gln leu  arg resulted in distinct dimeric forms of the protein furthermore we have verified by nmr structure determination that the double mutant met  gln leu  arg is essentially a  half tetramer   analysis of the in vivo activities of full length p  oligomeric mutants reveals that while cell cycle arrest requires tetrameric p  transcriptional transactivation activity of monomers and dimers retain roughly background and half of the wild type activity respectively
