modular proteins from the drosophila sallimus sls gene and their expression in muscles with different extensibility
the passive elasticity of the sarcomere in striated muscle is determined by large modular proteins such as titin in vertebrates in insects the function of titin is divided between two shorter proteins projectin and sallimus sls  which are the products of different genes the drosophila sallimus sls gene codes for a protein of  mda the n terminal half of the protein is largely made up of immunoglobulin ig domains and unique sequence the c terminal half has two stretches of sequence similar to the elastic pevk region of titin and at the end of the molecule there is a region of tandem ig and fibronectin domains we have investigated splicing pathways of the sls gene and identified isoforms expressed in different muscle types and at different stages of drosophila development the   half of sls codes for zormin and kettin both proteins contain ig domains and can be expressed as separate isoforms or as larger proteins linked to sequence downstream there are multiple splicing pathways between the kettin region of sls and sequence coding for the two pevk regions all the resulting protein isoforms have sequence derived from the   end of the sls gene splicing of exons varies at different stages of development kettin rna is predominant in the embryo and longer transcripts are expressed in larva pupa and adult sls isoforms in the indirect flight muscle ifm are zormin kettin and sls    in which sequence derived from the end of the gene is spliced to kettin rna zormin is in both m line and z disc kettin and sls   extend from the z disc to the ends of the thick filaments though sls   is only in the myofibril core these shorter isoforms would contribute to the high stiffness of ifm other muscles in the thorax and legs have longer sls isoforms with varying amounts of pevk sequence all span the i band to the ends of the thick filaments in muscles with longer i bands the proportion of pevk sequence would determine the extensibility of the sarcomere alternative sls isoforms could regulate the stiffness of the many fibre types in drosophila muscles
