inter molecular coiled coil formation in human apolipoprotein e c terminal domain
human apolipoprotein e apoe is composed of an n terminal nt domain residues     that bears low density lipoprotein receptor binding sites and a c terminal ct domain residues       which houses lipoprotein binding and apoe self association sites the nt domain is comprised of a four helix bundle while the structural organization of the ct domain is not known secondary structural algorithms predict that the apoe ct domain adopts an amphipathic  helical conformation on the basis of further sequence predictions we identified a segment residues      in the apoe ct domain that bears a high propensity to form a coiled coil helix which coincides with the putative lipoprotein binding surface an apoe construct bearing residues      that encompasses the entire ct domain was designed expressed in escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography circular dichroism cd spectroscopy of the apoe ct domain reveals spectra characteristic of coiled coil helices with the ratio of molar ellipticities at   nm and   nm          of    trifluoroethanol tfe stabilized the secondary structure of the apoe ct domain and disrupted coiled coil helix formation as determined by cd and tryptophan fluorescence analysis analytical ultracentrifugation and lysine specific cross linking analysis of the apoe ct domain revealed predominant formation of dimeric and tetrameric species in aqueous buffers and monomeric forms in   tfe guanidine hydrochloride induced denaturation studies reveal that at low concentrations of denaturant the apoe ct domain maintains the         ratio at    and elicits an altered tertiary environment with a shift in oligomeric state towards a dimer indicative of the role of coiled coil helix formation in inter molecular interactions further coiled coil formation is disrupted by protonation below ph   with a corresponding decrease in trp fluorescence emission intensity demonstrating that salt bridge interactions play a critical role in maintaining the structural integrity of the apoe ct domain the data support the concept that inter molecular coiled coil helix formation is an essential structural feature of the apoe ct domain which likely plays a role in clustering heparin binding sites and or sequestering the lipid binding surface in lipid free states
