protein s  binds two  s rrna sites as assembly is initiated
ribosomal protein s  is a primary binding protein that bridges the   domain and the   minor domain of the  s ribosomal rna rrna in the  s ribosomal subunit using time dependent dimethyl sulfate modification we have determined that as it is bound to  s rrna protein s  causes rapid protection of bases a   a   a   and a  in the stem region of helix  in the   domain and moderately fast modifications of helix  bases a   and a   in the   minor domain at a later time enhancements occur with bases a  and a  in helix  bases a  and a  in helix   and base c  at the distal end of helix  in the   domain of  s rrna the modifications that occur in the stem region of helix  are distant from the binding site of protein s  as determined from the crystal structure simultaneous addition of protein s  with s  to the complex significantly alters the modifications caused by protein s  in the stem region of helix  but does not alter the remaining modifications our results indicate that protein s  is binding to at least two alternate  s rrna sites during the early assembly process
