monomeric complex of human orphan estrogen related receptor  with dna a pseudo dimer interface mediates extended half site recognition
while most nuclear receptors bind dna as homo or heterodimers the human estrogen related receptors herrs are members of a subfamily of orphan receptors that bind dna as monomers we have determined the solution structure of the dna binding domain dbd of herr bound to its cognate dna the structure and base interactions of the core dbd are similar to those of other nuclear receptors however high affinity sequence specific dna binding as a monomer necessitates formation of additional base contacts outside the core dbd this is accomplished using a modified guanosine binding  at hook  within the c terminal extension cte flanking the dbd which makes base specific minor groove interactions the structure of the cte is stabilized both by interactions with the dna and by packing against a region of the core dbd normally reserved for dimerization this pseudo dimer interface provides a basis for the expansion of dna recognition and suggests a mechanism through which dimerization may have evolved from an ancestral monomeric receptor
