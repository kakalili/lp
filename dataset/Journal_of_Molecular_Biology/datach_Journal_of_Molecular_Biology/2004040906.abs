distinct properties of the two putative  globular domains  of the yeast linker histone hho p
the putative linker histone in saccharomyces cerevisiae hho p has two regions of sequence gi and gii that are homologous to the single globular domains of linker histones h and h in higher eukaryotes however the two hho p  domains  differ with respect to the conservation of basic residues corresponding to the two putative dna binding sites sites i and ii on opposite faces of the h globular domain we find that gi can protect chromatosome length dna like the globular domains of h and h  gh and gh  but gii does not protect however gii like gh and gh  binds preferentially and with higher affinity than gi to four way dna junctions in the presence of excess linear dna competitor and binds more tightly than gi to linker histone depleted chromatin surprisingly in  mm sodium phosphate ph    gii is largely unfolded whereas gi like gh and gh  is structured with a high  helical content however in the presence of high concentrations of large tetrahedral anions phosphate sulphate perchlorate gii is also folded the anions presumably mimic dna in screening the positive charge this raises the possibility that chromatin bound hho p may be bifunctional with two folded nucleosome binding domains
