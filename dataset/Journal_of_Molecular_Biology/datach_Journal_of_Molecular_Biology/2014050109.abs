the cleaved n terminus of pvi binds peripentonal hexons in mature adenovirus
mature human adenovirus particles contain four minor capsid proteins in addition to the three major capsid proteins penton base hexon and fiber and several proteins associated with the genomic core of the virion of the minor capsid proteins vi plays several crucial roles in the infection cycle of the virus including hexon nuclear targeting during assembly activation of the adenovirus proteinase avp during maturation and endosome escape following cell entry vi is translated as a precursor pvi that is cleaved at both n and c termini by avp whereas the role of the c terminal fragment of pvi pvic is well established as an important co factor of avp the role of the n terminal fragment pvin is currently elusive in fact the fate of pvin following proteolytic cleavage is completely unknown here we use a combination of proteomics based peptide identification native mass spectrometry and hydrogen  deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to show that pvin is associated with mature human adenovirus where it binds at the base of peripentonal hexons in a ph dependent manner our findings suggest a possible role for pvin in targeting pvi to hexons for proper assembly of the virion and timely release of the membrane lytic mature vi molecule
