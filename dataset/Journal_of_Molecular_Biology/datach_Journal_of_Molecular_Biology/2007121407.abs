molecular and functional mapping of eed motifs required for prc dependent histone methylation
polycomb group proteins represent a conserved family of developmental regulators that mediate heritable transcriptional silencing by modifying chromatin states one polycomb group complex the prc complex is composed of several proteins including the histone h lysine   h k  methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog  and the wd repeat protein embryonic ectoderm development eed  histone h k  can be monomethylated h k me  dimethylated h k me  or trimethylated h k me  however it remains unclear what regulates the number of methyl groups added to h k  in a particular nucleosome in mammalian cells eed is present as four distinct isoforms which are believed to be produced by utilizing four distinct in frame translation start sites in a common eed mrna a mutation that disables all four eed isoforms produces defects in h k  methylation montgomery n d  yee d  chen a  kalantry s  chamberlain s j  otte a p  amp magnuson t     the murine polycomb group protein eed is required for global histone h lysine  methylation curr biol          to assess the roles of individual eed isoforms in h k  methylation we first characterized three of the four eed isoform start sites and then demonstrated that individual isoforms are not necessary for h k me  h k me  or h k me  instead we show that the core wd  motifs and the histone binding region of eed alone are sufficient for the generation of all three marks demonstrating that eed isoforms do not control the number of methyl groups added to h k
