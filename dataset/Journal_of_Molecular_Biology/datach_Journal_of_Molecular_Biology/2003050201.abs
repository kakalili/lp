crystal structure of  methylisocitrate lyase prpb from escherichia coli and modelling of its ligand bound active centre
following acetate propionate is the second most abundant low molecular mass carbon compound found in soil many microorganisms including most if not all fungi as well as several aerobic bacteria such as escherichia coli and salmonella enterica oxidize propionate via the methylcitrate cycle the enzyme  methylisocitrate lyase prpb from escherichia coli catalysing the last step of this cycle the cleavage of  methylisocitrate to pyruvate and succinate was crystallised and its structure determined to a resolution of    the enzyme which strictly depends on mg  for catalysis belongs to the isocitrate lyase protein family a common feature of members of this enzyme family is the movement of a so called  active site loop  from an open into a closed conformation upon substrate binding thus shielding the reactants from the surrounding solvent since in the presented structure prpb contains apart from a mg  no ligand the active site loop is found in an open conformation this conformation however differs significantly from the open conformation present in the so far known structures of ligand free isocitrate lyases a possible impact of this observation with respect to the different responses of isocitrate lyases and prpb upon treatment with the common inhibitor  bromopyruvate is discussed based on the structure of ligand bound isocitrate lyase from mycobacterium tuberculosis a model of the substrate bound prpb enzyme in its closed conformation was created which provides hints towards the substrate specificity of this enzyme
