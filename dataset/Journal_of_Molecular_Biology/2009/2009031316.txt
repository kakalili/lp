The photochemical reaction dynamics of a BLUF (sensors of blue light using FAD) protein, PixD, from a thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 (TePixD, Tll0078) were studied by pulsed laser-induced transient grating method. After the formation of an intermediate species with a red-shifted absorption spectrum, two new reaction phases reflecting protein conformational changes were discovered; one reaction phase manifested itself as expansion of partial molar volume with a time constant of 40 μs, whereas the other reaction phase represented a change in the diffusion coefficient D [i.e., the diffusion-sensitive conformational change (DSCC)]. D decreased from 4.9×10−11 to 4.4×10−11 m2 s−1 upon the formation of the first intermediate, and subsequently showed a more pronounced decrease to 3.2×10−11 m2 s−1 upon formation of the second intermediate. From a global analysis of signals at various grating wavenumbers, the time constant of D-change was determined to be 4 ms. Although the magnitude and rate constant of the faster volume change were independent of protein concentration, the amplitude of the signal that reflects the later DSCC significantly decreased as the protein concentration decreased. This concentration dependence suggests that two species exist in solution: a reactive species exhibiting the DSCC, and a second species that is nonreactive. The fraction of these species was found to be dependent on the concentration. The difference in reactivity was attributed to the different oligomeric states of TePixD (i.e., pentamer and decamer). The equilibrium of these states in the dark was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography at various concentrations. These results demonstrated that only the decamer state is responsible for the conformational change. The results may suggest that the oligomeric state is functionally important in the signal transduction of this photosensory protein.
