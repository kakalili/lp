x ray crystal structure of the rotavirus inner capsid particle at     resolution
the rotavirus inner capsid particle known as the  double layered particle   dlp  is the  payload  delivered into a cell in the process of viral infection its inner and outer protein layers composed of viral protein vp  and vp  respectively package the  segments of the double stranded rna dsrna of the viral genome as well as about the same number of polymerase molecules vp  and capping enzyme molecules vp  we have determined the crystal structure of the bovine rotavirus dlp there is one full particle outer diameter       in the asymmetric unit of the p    unit cell of dimensions a     b      and c      a three dimensional reconstruction from electron cryomicroscopy was used as a molecular replacement model for initial phase determination to about     resolution and the  fold redundancy of icosahedral particle symmetry allowed phases to be extended stepwise to the limiting resolution of the data      the structure of a vp trimer determined previously by others fits the outer layer density with very little adjustment the t  triangulation number of that layer implies that there are four and one third vp trimers per icosahedral asymmetric unit the inner layer has   copies of vp and thus  copies per icosahedral asymmetric unit designated vp a and vp b residues      fold into a relatively thin principal domain comma like in outline shaped such that only rather modest distortions concentrated at two  subdomain  boundaries allow vp a and vp b to form a uniform layer with essentially no gaps at the subunit boundaries except for a modest pore along the  fold axis the vp principal domain resembles those of the corresponding shells and homologous proteins in other dsrna viruses   in orthoreoviruses and vp in orbiviruses residues    of vp a and vp b fold together with four other such pairs into a   fold hub  that projects into the dlp interior along the  fold axis residues     link the  polypeptide chains emerging from a  fold hub to the n termini of their corresponding principal domains clustered into a decameric assembly unit the  fold hub appears to have several distinct functions one function is to recruit a copy of vp  or of a vp  vp complex  potentially along with a segment of plus strand rna as a decamer of vp assembles the second function is to serve as a shaft around which can coil a segment of dsrna the third function is to guide nascent mrna synthesized in the dlp interior by vp and   capped by the action of vp  out through a  fold exit channel we propose a model for rotavirus particle assembly based on known requirements for virion formation together with the structure of the dlp and that of vp  determined earlier
