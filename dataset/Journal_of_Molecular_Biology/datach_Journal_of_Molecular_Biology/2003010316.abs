quaternary structure of the european spiny lobster palinurus elephas    mer hemocyanin from cryoem and amino acid sequence data
arthropod hemocyanins are large respiratory proteins that are composed of up to  subunits    mer in the  kda range a d reconstruction of the   mer hemocyanin from the european spiny lobster palinurus elephas has been performed from   single particles using cryoelectron microscopy an   resolution of the hemocyanin d reconstruction has been obtained from about   final class averages visualisation of structural elements such as  helices has been achieved an amino acid sequence alignment shows the high sequence identity  gt   of the hemocyanin subunits from the european spiny lobster p elephas and the american spiny lobster panulirus interruptus comparison of the p elephas hemocyanin electron microscopy em density map with the known p interruptus x ray structure shows a close structural correlation demonstrating the reliability of both methods for reconstructing proteins by molecular modelling we have found the putative locations for the amino acid sequence       and the c terminal end       which are absent in the available p interruptus x ray data
