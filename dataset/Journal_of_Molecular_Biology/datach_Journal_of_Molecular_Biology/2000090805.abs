statistical alignment computational properties homology testing and goodness of fit edited by j karn
the model of insertions and deletions in biological sequences first formulated by thorne kishino and felsenstein in    the tkf  model  provides a basis for performing alignment within a statistical framework here we investigate this model firstly we show how to accelerate the statistical alignment algorithms several orders of magnitude the main innovations are to confine likelihood calculations to a band close to the similarity based alignment to get good initial guesses of the evolutionary parameters and to apply an efficient numerical optimisation algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimate in addition the recursions originally presented by thorne kishino and felsenstein can be simplified two proteins about   amino acids long can be analysed with this method in less than five seconds on a fast desktop computer which makes this method practical for actual data analysis secondly we propose a new homology test based on this model where homology means that an ancestor to a sequence pair can be found finitely far back in time this test has statistical advantages relative to the traditional shuffle test for proteins finally we describe a goodness of fit test that allows testing the proposed insertion deletion indel process inherent to this model and find that real sequences here globins probably experience indels longer than one contrary to what is assumed by the model
