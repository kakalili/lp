The S100 proteins comprise 25 calcium-signalling members of the EF-hand protein family. Unlike typical EF-hand signalling proteins such as calmodulin and troponin-C, the S100 proteins are dimeric, forming both homo- and heterodimers in vivo. One member of this family, S100B, is a homodimeric protein shown to control the assembly of several cytoskeletal proteins and regulate phosphorylation events in a calcium-sensitive manner. Calcium binding to S100B causes a conformational change involving movement of helix III in the second calcium-binding site (EF2) that exposes a hydrophobic surface enabling interactions with other proteins such as tubulin and Ndr kinase. In several S100 proteins, calcium binding also stabilizes dimerization compared to the calcium-free states. In this work, we have examined the guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl)-induced unfolding of dimeric calcium-free S100B. A series of tryptophan substitutions near the dimer interface and the EF2 calcium-binding site were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and showed biphasic unfolding curves. The presence of a plateau near 1.5 M GuHCl showed the presence of an intermediate that had a greater exposed hydrophobic surface area compared to the native dimer based on increased 4,4-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid fluorescence. Furthermore, 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence analyses as a function of GuHCl showed significant chemical shift changes in regions near the EF1 calcium-binding loop and between the linker and C-terminus of helix IV. Together these observations show that calcium-free S100B unfolds via a dimeric intermediate.
