Archaerhodopsin-2 (aR2), a retinal protein–carotenoid complex found in the claret membrane of Halorubrum sp. aus-2, functions as a light-driven proton pump. In this study, the membrane fusion method was utilized to prepare trigonal P321 crystals (a=b=98.2 Å, c=56.2 Å) and hexagonal P63 crystals (a=b=108.8 Å, c=220.7 Å). The trigonal crystal is made up of stacked membranes in which the aR2 trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice. Similar membranous structures are found in the hexagonal crystal, but four membrane layers with different orientations are contained in the unit cell. In these crystals, the carotenoid bacterioruberin [5,32-bis(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-2,8,12,16,21,25,29,35-octamethylhexatriaconta-6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30-tridecaene-2,35-diol] binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer. Its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about 20° and, on the cytoplasmic side, it is surrounded by helices AB and DE of neighbouring subunits. This peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a striking structural role for the trimerization of aR2. When compared with the aR2 structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin, the proton release channel takes a more closed conformation in the P321 or P63 crystal; i.e., the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein–bacterioruberin complex. Interestingly, most residues participating in the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin, a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure in the absence of bacterioruberin. Despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence, the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between aR2 and bacteriorhodopsin. Since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle, it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity.
