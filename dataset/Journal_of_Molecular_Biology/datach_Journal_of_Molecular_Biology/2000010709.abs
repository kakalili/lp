investigating the binding specificity of u a rna by computational mutagenesis edited by i tinoco
the mammalian spliceosomal protein u a binds a hairpin rna with picomolar affinity to examine the origin of this binding specificity we carried out computational mutagenesis on protein and rna residues in the u a rna binding interface our computational mutagenesis methods calculate the relative binding affinity between mutant and wild type as the sum of molecular mechanical energies and solvation free energies estimated with a continuum solvent model we obtained good agreement with experimental studies and we verified mutations that abolish and improve binding therefore we offer these methods as computationally inexpensive tools for investigating and predicting the effects of site specific mutagenesis
