crystal structure of the ternary complex of the catalytic domain of human phenylalanine hydroxylase with tetrahydrobiopterin and   thienyl l alanine and its implications for the mechanism of catalysis and substrate activation
phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the stereospecific hydroxylation of l phenylalanine the committed step in the degradation of this amino acid we have solved the crystal structure of the ternary complex hpheoh  fe ii  bh  tha of the catalytically active fe ii form of a truncated form  n     c      of human phenylalanine hydroxylase hpheoh  using the catalytically active reduced cofactor  r l erythro     tetrahydrobiopterin bh  and   thienyl l alanine tha as a substrate analogue the analogue is bound in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic iron atom with the thiophene ring stacking against the imidazole group of his   average interplanar distance    and with a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts binding of the analogue to the binary complex hpheoh  fe ii  bh triggers structural changes throughout the entire molecule which adopts a slightly more compact structure the largest change occurs in the loop region comprising residues      where the maximum r m s displacement     is at tyr   this loop is refolded bringing the hydroxyl oxygen atom of tyr      closer to the iron atom and into the active site the iron geometry is highly distorted square pyramidal and glu  adopts a conformation different from that observed in the hpheoh  fe ii  bh structure with bidentate iron coordination bh binds in the second coordination sphere of the catalytic iron atom and is displaced    in the direction of glu  and the iron atom relative to the hpheoh  fe ii  bh structure thus changing its hydrogen bonding network the active site structure of the ternary complex gives new insight into the substrate specificity of the enzyme notably the low affinity for l tyrosine furthermore the structure has implications both for the catalytic mechanism and the molecular basis for the activation of the full length tetrameric enzyme by its substrate the large conformational change moving tyr  from a surface position into the active site may reflect a possible functional role for this residue
