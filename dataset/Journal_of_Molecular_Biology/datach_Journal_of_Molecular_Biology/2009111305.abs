cancer associated mutations in brc domains of brca affect homologous recombination induced by rad
the tumor suppressor brca protein plays a major role in the regulation of rad  catalyzed homologous recombination brca interacts with monomeric rad  primarily via conserved brc domains and coordinates the formation of rad  filaments at double stranded dna dsdna breaks a number of cancer associated mutations in brc and brc domains have been reported to elucidate their effects on homologous recombination we studied rad  filament formation on single stranded dna and dsdna substrates and rad  catalyzed strand exchange in the presence of wild type and mutated peptides of either brc or brc  while the wild type brc and brc peptides inhibited filament formation and thus strand exchange the mutated forms decreased significantly these inhibitory effects these results are consistent with a three dimensional model for the interface between individual brc repeats and rad  we suggest that mutations at sites crucial for the association between rad  and brc domains impair the ability of brca to recruit rad  to dsdna breaks hampering recombinational repair
