hydroxyl groups in the   sandwich of metallo  lactamases favor enzyme activity tyr  and ser  pull down the lid
metallo  lactamases mbls efficiently hydrolyze and thereby inactivate various  lactam antibiotics in clinical use their potential to evolve into more efficient enzymes threatens public health recently we have identified the designed f  y mutant of imp  as an enzyme with superior catalytic efficiency compared to the wild type thus it may be found in clinical isolates in the future in an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in enhanced activity we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of ten mbl variants in complex with a cefotaxime intermediate the stability of these near transition state enzyme substrate intermediate complexes was modeled and compared to the experimental catalytic efficiencies kcat km for each of the ten complexes ten independent simulations were performed in each simulation the temperature was gradually increased and determined upon breakdown of the complex rankings based on the experimental catalytic efficiencies and the data from computer simulations were in good agreement from trajectory analysis of stable simulations the combination of tyr  and ser  was found to lead to an altered hydrogen bonding network which translates into a closing down movement of a  hairpin loop covering the active site these observations may explain the significantly decreased km and increased kcat km values of this variant toward all substrates recently tested in experiment previously we have discovered that mutations g  s yielding imp  and g  a in imp  stabilize the zn ii ligand his  and thus the enzyme substrate intermediate complex through a domino effect which enhances conversion of drugs like ceftazidime penicillins and imipenem together the domino effect and the altered  hairpin loop conformation explain how imp  can evolve through mutations g  s and f  y into an enzyme with up to one order of magnitude increased catalytic efficiencies toward these important antibiotics furthermore the previously proposed binding of a third zinc ion close to the active site of imp  mutant s  g was corroborated by our simulations
