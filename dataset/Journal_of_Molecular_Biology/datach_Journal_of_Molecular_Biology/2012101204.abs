experimental definition of a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic duplicon in escherichia coli
we analyzed sequences of newly inserted repeats in an escherichia coli crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats array in vivo and showed that a base previously thought to belong to the repeat is actually derived from a protospacer based on further experimental results we propose to use the term  duplicon  for a repeated sequence in a crispr array that serves as a template for a new duplicon our findings suggest the possibility of redrawing the borders between repeats spacers and protospacer adjacent motifs
