coenzyme site directed mutants of photosynthetic a gapdh show selectively reduced nadph dependent catalysis similar to regulatory ab gapdh inhibited by oxidized thioredoxin
chloroplast glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh of higher plants uses both nadp h and nad h as coenzyme and consists of one gapa or two types of subunits gapa gapb  ab gapdh is regulated in vivo through the action of thioredoxin and metabolites showing higher kinetic preference for nadph in the light than in darkness due to a specific effect on kcat nadph  previous crystallographic studies on spinach chloroplast a gapdh complexed with nadp or nad showed that residues thr  and ser  are involved in nadp over nad selectivity by interacting with the   phosphate group of nadp this suggested a possible involvement of these residues in the regulatory mechanism mutants of recombinant spinach gapa a gapdh with thr  or ser  replaced by ala t a s  a and double mutant t a s  a were produced expressed in escherichia coli and compared to wild type recombinant a gapdh in terms of crystal structures and kinetic properties affinity for nadph was decreased significantly in all mutants and kcat nadph was lowered in mutants carrying the substitution of ser   nadh dependent activity was unaffected the decrease of kcat km of the nadph dependent reaction in ser  mutants resembles the behaviour of ab gapdh inhibited by oxidized thioredoxin as confirmed by steady state kinetic analysis of native enzyme a significant expansion of size of the a tetramer was observed in the s  a mutant compared to wild type a  we conclude that in the absence of interactions between ser  and the   phosphate group of nadp the enzyme structure relaxes to a less compact conformation which negatively affects the complex catalytic cycle of gadph a model based on this concept might be developed to explain the in vivo light regulation of the gapdh
