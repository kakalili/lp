the zinc finger proteins zxda and zxdc form a complex that binds ciita and regulates mhc ii gene transcription
the transcription of major histocompatibility complex class ii mhc ii genes depends critically upon the activity of the class ii trans activator ciita protein we previously described a novel ciita binding protein named zinc finger x linked duplicated family member c zxdc that contributes to the activity of ciita and the transcription of mhc ii genes here we examined the contribution of a closely related family member of zxdc the zxda protein to mhc ii gene transcription zxda has a domain organization similar to zxdc containing ten zinc fingers and a transcriptional activation domain knockdown and overexpression of zxda demonstrated its importance in the transcriptional activation of mhc ii genes we found that zxda and zxdc can self associate and also form a complex with each other the regions of the two proteins that contain zinc fingers mediate these interactions importantly we found that the zxda zxdc complex interacts with ciita rather than either protein alone given our additional finding that zxdc is present at mhc ii promoters in hela cells prior to and after treatment with ifn   it appears that zxda and zxdc form an important regulatory complex for mhc ii gene transcription
