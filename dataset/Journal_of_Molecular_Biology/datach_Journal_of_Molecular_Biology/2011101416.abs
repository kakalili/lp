archaeal translation initiation factor aif can substitute for eukaryotic eif in ribosomal scanning during mammalian  s complex formation
heterotrimeric translation initiation factor if a eif  archaeal eukaryotic if  is present in both eukarya and archaea despite strong structural similarity between a eif orthologs from the two domains of life their functional relationship is obscure here we show that aif from sulfolobus solfataricus can substitute for its mammalian counterpart in the reconstitution of eukaryotic  s initiation complexes from purified components aif is able to correctly place the initiator met trnai into the p site of the  s ribosomal subunit and accompany the entire set of eukaryotic translation ifs in the process of cap dependent scanning and aug codon selection however it seems to be unable to participate in the following step of ribosomal subunit joining in accordance with this aif inhibits rather than stimulates protein synthesis in mammalian cell free system the ability of recombinant aif protein to direct ribosomal scanning suggests that some archaeal mrnas may utilize this mechanism during translation initiation
