crystal structure of p  a constitutively active splice variant of visual arrestin
visual arrestin specifically binds to photoactivated and phosphorylated rhodopsin and inactivates phototransduction in contrast the p  splice variant can terminate phototransduction by binding to nonphosphorylated light activated rhodopsin here we report the crystal structure of bovine p  at a resolution of      compared to native arrestin the p  structure reveals significant differences in regions crucial for receptor binding namely flexible loop v  vi and polar core regions additionally electrostatic potential is remarkably positive on the n domain and the c domain the p  structure represents an active conformation that serves as a model to explain the  constitutive activity  found in arrestin variants
