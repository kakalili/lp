amyloid  membrane binding and permeabilization are distinct processes influenced separately by membrane charge and fluidity
the  and  residue amyloid   a  peptides are major components of the proteinaceous plaques prevalent in the alzheimer s disease afflicted brain and have been shown to have an important role in instigating neuronal degeneration whereas it was previously thought that a  becomes cytotoxic upon forming large fibrillar aggregates recent studies suggest that soluble intermediate sized oligomeric species cause cell death through membrane permeabilization the present study examines the interactions between a   and lipid membranes using liposomes as a model system to determine how changes in membrane composition influence the conversion of a  into these toxic species a   membrane binding was monitored using fluorescence based assays with a tryptophan substituted peptide a   y w  we extend previous observations that a   interacts preferentially with negatively charged membranes and show that binding of nonfibrillar low molecular mass oligomers of a   to anionic but not neutral membranes involves insertion of the peptide into the bilayer as well as sequential conformational changes corresponding to the degree of oligomerization induced significantly while anionic membranes in the gel liquid crystalline and liquid ordered phases induce these conformational changes equally membrane permeabilization is reduced dramatically as the fluidity of the membrane is decreased these findings demonstrate that binding alone is not sufficient for membrane permeabilization and that the latter is also highly dependent on the fluidity and phase of the membrane we conclude that binding and pore formation are two distinct steps the differences in a  behavior induced by membrane composition may have significant implications on the development and progression of ad as neuronal membrane composition is altered with age
