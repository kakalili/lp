Fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein with broad binding specificity to cell surface receptors, integrins. The tenth fibronectin type III domain (FNfn10) is a small, autonomous domain of fibronectin containing the RGE sequence that is directly involved in integrin binding. However, in isolation FNfn10 only weakly bind to integrins. We reasoned that high-affinity and high-specificity variants of FNfn10 to a particular integrin could be engineered by optimizing residues surrounding the integrin-binding RGD sequence in the flexible FG loop. Affinity maturation of FNfn10 to αvβ3 integrin, an integrin up-regulated in angiogenic endothelial cells and in some metastatic tumor cells, yielded αvβ3-binding FNfn10 mutants with a novel RGDWXE consensus sequence. We characterized one of the RGDWXE-modified clones, FNfn10-3JCLI4, as purified protein. FNfn10-3JCLI4 binds with high affinity and specificity to purified αvβ3 integrin. Alanine scanning mutagenesis suggested that both the tryptophan and glutamic acid residues following the RGD sequence are required for maximal affinity and specificity for αvβ3. FNfn10-3JCLI4 specifically stained αvβ3-positive cells as detected with flow cytometry and it inhibited αvβ3-dependent cell adhesion. As with the anti-αvβ3 antibody LM609, FNfn10-3JCLI4 can interfere with in vitro capillary formation. Taken together, these data show that FNfn10-3JCL14 is a specific, high-affinity αvβ3-binding protein that can inhibit αvβ3-dependent cellular processes similar to an anti-αvβ3 monoclonal antibody. These properties, combined with the small, monomeric, cysteine-free and highly stable structure of FNfn10-3JCLI4, may make this protein useful in future applications involving detection and targeting of αvβ3-positive cells.
