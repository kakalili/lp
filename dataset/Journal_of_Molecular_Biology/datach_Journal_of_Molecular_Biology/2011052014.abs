molecular determinants and thermodynamics of the amyloid precursor protein transmembrane domain implicated in alzheimer s disease
the deposition of toxic amyloid   a  peptide aggregates in the brain is a hallmark of alzheimer s disease the intramembrane proteolysis by  secretase of the amyloid precursor protein  carboxy terminal fragment app  ctf constitutes the final step in the production of a  peptides mounting evidence suggests that app  ctf is a transmembrane domain tmd dimer and that dimerization might modulate the production of a  species that are prone to aggregation and are therefore most toxic we combined experimental and computational approaches to study the molecular determinants and thermodynamics of app  ctf dimerization and we produced a unifying structural model that reconciles much of the published data using a cell assay that exploits a dimerization dependent activator of transcription we identified specific dimerization affecting mutations located mostly at the n terminus of the tmd of app  ctf the ability of selected mutants to affect the dimerization of full length app  ctf was confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments free energy estimates of the wild type and mutants of the tmd of app  ctf derived from enhanced molecular dynamics simulations showed that the dimeric state is composed of different arrangements in which either  gxxxa  or  gxxxg  gxxxg  interaction motifs can engage in symmetric or asymmetric associations mutations along the tmd of app  ctf were found to modulate the relative free energy of the dimeric configurations and to differently affect the distribution of interfaces within the dimeric state this observation might have important biological implications since dimers with a different arrangement of the transmembrane helices are likely to be recognized differently by  secretase and to lead to a variation in a  levels
