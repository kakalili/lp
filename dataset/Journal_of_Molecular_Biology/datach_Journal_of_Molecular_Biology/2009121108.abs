binding modes of thioflavin t to the single layer  sheet of the peptide self assembly mimics
although the amyloid dye thioflavin t tht is among the most widely used tools in the study of amyloid fibrils the mechanism by which tht binds to fibrils and other  rich peptide self assemblies remains elusive the development of the water soluble peptide self assembly mimic psam system has provided a set of ideal model proteins for experimentally exploring the properties and minimal dye binding requirements of amyloid fibrils psams consist of a single layer  sheet slb capped by two globular domains which capture the flat extended  sheet features common among fibril like surfaces recently a psam that binds to tht with amyloid like affinity low micromolar kd has been designed and its crystal structure in the absence of bound tht was determined this psam thus provides a unique opportunity to examine the interactions of tht with a  rich structure here we present molecular dynamics simulations of the binding of tht to this psam  sheet we show that the primary binding site for tht is along a shallow groove formed by adjacent tyr and leu residues on the  sheet surface these simulations provide an atomic scale rationale for this psam s experimentally determined dye binding properties together our results suggest that an aromatic  hydrophobic groove spanning across four consecutive  strands represents a minimal tht binding site on amyloid fibrils grooves formed by aromatic  hydrophobic residues on amyloid fibril surfaces may therefore offer a generic mode of recognition for amyloid dyes
