molecular mechanism of adp ribose hydrolysis by human nudt from structural and kinetic studies
human nudt  hnudt  is an adp ribose adpr pyrophosphatase adprase that plays important roles in controlling the intracellular levels of adpr and preventing non enzymatic adp ribosylation of proteins by hydrolyzing adpr to amp and ribose   phosphate we report the crystal structure of hnudt in complex with a non hydrolyzable adpr analogue    methyleneadenosine diphosphoribose and three mg  ions representing the transition state of the enzyme during catalysis analysis of this structure and comparison with previously reported hnudt structures identify key residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis in the transition state structure three metal ions are bound at the active site and are coordinated by surrounding residues and water molecules a conserved water molecule is at an ideal position for nucleophilic attack on the  phosphate of adpr the side chain of glu  on loop l changes its conformation to interact with the conserved water molecule compared with that in the substrate bound structure and appears to function as a catalytic base mutagenesis and kinetic studies show that trp  and trp  are important for the substrate binding arg  is involved in both the substrate binding and the catalysis and glu  and glu  of the nudix motif glu  on loop l  and arg  are critical for the catalysis the structural and biochemical data together reveal the molecular basis of the catalytic mechanism of adpr hydrolysis by hnudt  specifically glu  functions as a catalytic base to deprotonate a conserved water molecule that acts as a nucleophile to attack the  phosphate of adpr and three mg  ions are involved in the activation of the nucleophile and the binding of the substrate structural comparison of different adprases also suggests that most dimeric adprases may share a similar catalytic mechanism of adpr hydrolysis
