structural basis for the slow dark recovery of a full length lov protein from pseudomonas putida
blue light photoreceptors containing light  oxygen  voltage lov domains regulate a myriad of different physiological responses in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes their light sensitivity is intricately linked to the photochemistry of the non covalently bound flavin mononucleotide fmn chromophore that forms a covalent adduct with a conserved cysteine residue in the lov domain upon illumination with blue light all lov domains undergo the same primary photochemistry leading to adduct formation however considerable variation is found in the lifetime of the adduct state that varies from seconds to several hours the molecular mechanism underlying this variation among the structurally conserved lov protein family is not well understood here we describe the structural characterization of ppsb lov a very slow cycling full length lov protein from the gram negative bacterium pseudomonas putida kt   its crystal structure reveals a novel dimer interface that is mediated by n and c terminal auxiliary structural elements and a unique cluster of four arginine residues coordinating with the fmn phosphate moiety site directed mutagenesis of two arginines r  and r  in ppsb lov resulted in acceleration of the dark recovery reaction approximately by a factor of   the presented structural and biochemical data suggest a direct link between structural features and the slow dark recovery observed for ppsb lov the overall structural arrangement of ppsb lov together with a complementary phylogenetic analysis highlights a common ancestry of bacterial lov photoreceptors and per arnt sim chemosensors
