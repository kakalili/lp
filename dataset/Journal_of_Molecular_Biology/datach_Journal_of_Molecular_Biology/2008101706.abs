integration of small angle x ray scattering data into structural modeling of proteins and their assemblies
a major challenge in structural biology is to determine the configuration of domains and proteins in multidomain proteins and assemblies respectively all available data should be considered to maximize the accuracy and precision of these models small angle x ray scattering saxs efficiently provides low resolution experimental data about the shapes of proteins and their assemblies thus we integrated saxs profiles into our software for modeling proteins and their assemblies by satisfaction of spatial restraints specifically we modeled the quaternary structures of multidomain proteins with structurally defined rigid domains as well as quaternary structures of binary complexes of structurally defined rigid proteins in addition to saxs profiles and the component structures we used stereochemical restraints and an atomic distance dependent statistical potential the scoring function is optimized by a biased monte carlo protocol including quasi newton and simulated annealing schemes the final prediction corresponds to the best scoring solution in the largest cluster of many independently calculated solutions to quantify how well the quaternary structures are determined based on their saxs profiles we used a benchmark of  simulated examples as well as an experimental saxs profile of the homotetramer d xylose isomerase optimization of the saxs dependent scoring function generally results in accurate models if sufficiently precise approximations for the constituent rigid bodies are available otherwise the best scoring models can have significant errors thus saxs profiles can play a useful role in the structural characterization of proteins and assemblies if they are combined with additional data and used judiciously our integration of a saxs profile into modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints will facilitate further integration of different kinds of data for structure determination of proteins and their assemblies
