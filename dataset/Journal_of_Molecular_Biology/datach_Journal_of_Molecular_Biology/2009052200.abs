the predicted structure of the headpiece of the huntingtin protein and its implications on huntingtin aggregation
we have performed simulated tempering molecular dynamics simulations to study the thermodynamics of the headpiece of the huntingtin htt protein n htt  with converged sampling we found this peptide is highly helical as previously proposed interestingly this peptide is also found to adopt two different and seemingly stable states the region from residue  l to residue  k has a strong helicity from our simulations which is supported by experimental studies however contrary to what was initially proposed we have found that simulations predict the most populated state as a two helix bundle rather than a single straight helix although a significant percentage of structures do still adopt a single linear helix the fact that htt aggregation is nucleation dependent infers the importance of a critical transition it has been shown that n htt is involved in this rate limiting step in this study we propose two possible mechanisms for this nucleating event stemming from the transition between two helix bundle state and single helix state for n htt and the experimentally observed interactions between the n htt and polyq domains more strikingly an extensive hydrophobic surface area is found to be exposed to solvent in the dominant monomeric state of n htt we propose the most fundamental role played by n htt would be initializing the dimerization and pulling the polyq chains into adequate spatial proximity for the nucleation event to proceed
