structural comparison of bacterial and human iron dependent phenylalanine hydroxylases similar fold different stability and reaction rates
structure determination of bacterial homologues of human disease related proteins provides an efficient path to understanding the three dimensional fold of proteins that are associated with human diseases however the precise locations of active site residues are often quite different between bacterial and human versions of an enzyme creating significant differences in the biological understanding of enzyme homologs to study this hypothesis phenylalanine hydroxylase from a bacterial source has been structurally characterized at high resolution and comparison is made to the human analog the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pheoh catalyzes the hydroxylation of l phenylalanine into l tyrosine utilizing the cofactors  r l erythro     tetrahydrobiopterin bh  and molecular oxygen previously determined x ray structures of human and rat pheoh with a sequence identity of more than   show that these two structures are practically identical it is thus of interest to compare the structure of the divergent chromobacterium violaceum phenylalanine hydroxylase cvpheoh     sequence identity overall to the related human and rat pheoh structures we have determined crystal structures of cvpheoh to high resolution in the apo form no fe added  fe iii bound form and   dihydro l biopterin   bh  plus fe iii bound form the bacterial enzyme displays higher activity and thermal melting temperature and structurally differences are observed in the n and c termini and in a loop close to the active site iron atom
