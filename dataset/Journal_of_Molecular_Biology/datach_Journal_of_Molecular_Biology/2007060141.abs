mouse   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase akr c  binds steroids differently from other aldo keto reductases identification and characterization of amino acid residues critical for substrate binding
the mouse   hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase m   hsd is the unique known member of the aldo keto reductase akr superfamily able to catalyze efficiently and in a stereospecific manner the conversion of androstenedione    into epi testosterone epi t  the   epimer of testosterone structural and mutagenic studies had already identified one of the residues delineating the steroid binding cavity a  as the major molecular determinant for the stereospecificity of m   hsd we report here a ternary complex crystal structure m   hsd nadp epi t determined at     resolution that confirms this and reveals a unique steroid binding mode for an akr enzyme indeed in addition to the interactions found in all other akrs van der waals contacts stabilizing the core of the steroid and the hydrogen bonds established at the catalytic site by the y  and h  residues with the oxygen atom of the ketone group to be reduced  m   hsd establishes with the other extremity of the steroid nucleus an additional interaction involving k  by combining direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies we found that the elimination of this hydrogen bond did not affect the affinity of the enzyme for its steroid substrate but led to a slight but significant increase of its catalytic efficiency kcat km  suggesting a role for k  in the release of the steroidal product at the end of the reaction this previously unobserved steroid binding mode for an akr is similar to that adopted by other steroid binding proteins the hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases of the short chain dehydrogenases reductases sdr family and the steroid hormone nuclear receptors mutagenesis and structural studies made on the human type    hsd a closely related enzyme that shares   amino acids identity with the m   hsd also revealed that the residue at position  of these two enzymes directly affects the binding and or the release of nadph in addition to its role in their      stereospecificity
