cyclin box structure of the p tefb subunit cyclin t derived from a fusion complex with eiav tat
the positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb is an essential regulator of viral gene expression during the life cycle of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   its cyclin t subunit forms a ternary complex with the viral transcriptional transactivator tat protein and the transactivation response tar rna element thereby activating cyclin dependent kinase  cdk  which stimulates transcription at the level of chain elongation we report the structure of the cyclin box domain of human cyclin t at a resolution of      the structure was obtained by crystallographic analysis of a fusion protein composed of cyclin t linked to the transactivator protein tat from equine infectious anemia virus eiav  which is functionally and structurally related to hiv  tat the conserved cyclin box domain of cyclin t exhibits structural features for interaction with physiological binding partners such as cdk  a recognition site for cdk cyclin substrates is partly covered by a cyclin t specific insert suggesting specific interactions with regulatory factors the previously identified tat tar recognition motif trm forms a c terminal helix that is partly occluded in the cyclin box repeat interface while cysteine   is accessible to form an intermolecular zinc finger with tat residues of the trm contribute to a positively charged groove that may directly attract rna molecules the eiav tat protein instead appeared undefined from the electron density map suggesting that it is highly disordered functional experiments confirmed the tar binding properties of the fusion protein and suggested residues on the second cyclin box repeat to contribute to tat stimulated transcription
