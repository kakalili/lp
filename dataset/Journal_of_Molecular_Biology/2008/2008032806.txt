A novel bacteriophage infecting Escherichia coli was isolated during a large-scale screen for bacteriophages that may be used for therapy of mastitis in cattle. The 77,554-bp genome of the bacteriophage, named phiEco32, was sequenced and annotated, and its virions were characterized by electron microscopy and proteomics. Two phiEco32-encoded proteins that interact with host RNA polymerase were identified. One of them is an ECF family Ïƒ factor that may be responsible for transcription of some viral genes. Another RNA polymerase-binding protein is a novel transcription inhibitor whose mechanism of action remains to be defined.
