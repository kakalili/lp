classification of ligand molecules in pdb with fast heuristic graph match algorithm complig
a fast heuristic graph matching algorithm complig was devised to classify the small molecule ligands in the protein data bank pdb  which are currently not properly classified on structure basis by concurrently classifying proteins and ligands we determined the most appropriate parameter for categorizing ligands to be more than   identity of atoms and bonds between molecules and we classified    types of ligands into   clusters although the large clusters were composed of nucleotides or amino acids a significant presence of drug compounds was also observed application of the system to classify the natural ligand status of human proteins in the current database suggested that at most   of the experimental structures of human proteins were in complex with natural ligands however protein homology and or ligand similarity based modeling was implied to provide models of natural interactions for an additional   of the total which might be used to increase the knowledge of intrinsic protein  metabolite interactions
