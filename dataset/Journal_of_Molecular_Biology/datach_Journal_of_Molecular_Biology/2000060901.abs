selection of homeotic proteins for binding to a human dna replication origin edited by m yaniv
we have previously shown that a cell cycle dependent nucleoprotein complex assembles in vivo on a  bp sequence within the human dna replication origin associated to the lamin b gene here we report the identification using a one hybrid screen in yeast of three proteins interacting with the  bp sequence all of them namely hoxa  hoxc  and hoxc  are orthologues of the abdominal b gene of drosophila melanogaster and are members of the homeogene family of developmental regulators we describe the complete open reading frame sequence of hoxc  and hoxc  along with the structure of the hoxc  gene the specificity of binding of these two proteins to the lamin b origin is confirmed by both band shift and in vitro footprinting assays in addition the ability of hoxc  and hoxc  to increase the activity of a promoter containing the  bp sequence as assayed by cat assay experiments demonstrates a direct interaction of these homeoproteins with the origin sequence in mammalian cells we also show that hoxc  expression is cell type dependent and positively correlates with cell proliferation
