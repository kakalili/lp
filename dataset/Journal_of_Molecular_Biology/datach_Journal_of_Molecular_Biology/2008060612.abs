epitope mapping of conformational monoclonal antibodies specific to nhaa na h antiporter structural and functional implications
the recently determined crystal structure of nhaa the na h antiporter of escherichia coli showed that the previously constructed series of nhaa  alkaline phosphatase phoa fusions correctly predicted the topology of nhaa s  transmembrane segments tms  with the c and n termini pointing to the cytoplasm here we show that these nhaa  phoa fusions provide an excellent tool for mapping the epitopes of three nhaa specific conformational monoclonal antibodies mabs  of which two drastically inhibit the antiporter by identifying which of the nhaa fusions is bound by the respective mab the epitopes were localized to small stretches of nhaa then precise mapping was conducted by targeted cys scanning mutagenesis combined with chemical modifications most interestingly the epitopes of the inhibitory mabs  h and c  were identified in loop x  xi cytoplasmic and loop xi  xii periplasmic  which are connected by tms xi on the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the membrane respectively the revealed location of the mabs suggests that mab binding distorts the unique nhaa tms iv xi assembly and thus inhibits the activity of nhaa the noninhibitory mab f binds to the functionally dispensable c terminus of nhaa
