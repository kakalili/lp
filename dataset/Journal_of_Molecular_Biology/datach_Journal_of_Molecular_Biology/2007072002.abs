prion and non prion amyloids of the het s prion forming domain
het s is a prion protein of the fungus podospora anserina a plausible structural model for the infectious amyloid fold of the het s prion forming domain het s      makes it an attractive system to study structure  function relationships in amyloid assembly and prion propagation here we report on the diversity of het s     amyloids formed in vitro we distinguish two types formed at ph  from fibrils formed at ph  on morphological grounds unlike ph  fibrils the ph  fibrils show very little if any prion infectivity they also differ in tht binding resistance to denaturants assembly kinetics secondary structure and intrinsic fluorescence both contain  nm fibrils either bundled or disordered ph  or as tightly twisted protofibrils ph   we show that electrostatic interactions are critical for the formation and stability of the infectious prion fold given in the current model the altered properties of the amyloid assembled at ph  may arise from a perturbation in the subunit fold or fibrillar stacking
