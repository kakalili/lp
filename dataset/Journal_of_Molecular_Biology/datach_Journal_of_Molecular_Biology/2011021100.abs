crystal structures of the bacterial solute receptor acbh displaying an exclusive substrate preference for  d galactopyranose
solute receptors binding proteins are indispensable components of canonical atp binding cassette importers in prokaryotes here we report on the characterization and crystal structures in the closed and open conformations of acbh the solute receptor of the putative carbohydrate transporter acbfg which is encoded in the acarbose acarviosyl   maltose biosynthetic gene cluster from actinoplanes sp se    binding assays identified acbh as a high affinity monosaccharide binding protein with a dissociation constant kd for  d galactopyranose of      nm neither galactose containing di and trisaccharides such as lactose and raffinose nor monosaccharides including d galacturonic acid l arabinose d xylose and l rhamnose competed with  c galactose for binding to acbh moreover acbh does not bind d glucose which is a common property of all but one d galactose binding proteins characterized to date strikingly determination of the x ray structure revealed that acbh is structurally homologous to maltose binding proteins rather than to glucose binding proteins two helices are inserted in the substrate binding pocket which reduces the cavity size and allows the exclusive binding of monosaccharides specifically  d galactopyranose in the c conformation site directed mutagenesis of three residues from the binding pocket arg  asp  and arg   that interact with the axially oriented o h hydroxyl of the bound galactopyranose and subsequent functional analysis indicated that these residues are crucial for galactose binding to our knowledge this is the first report of the tertiary structure of a solute receptor with exclusive affinity for  d galactopyranose the putative role of a galactose import system in the context of acarbose metabolism in actinoplanes sp is discussed
