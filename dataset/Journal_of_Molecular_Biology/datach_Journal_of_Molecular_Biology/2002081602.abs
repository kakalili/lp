mutational analysis of polynucleotide phosphorylase from escherichia coli
polynucleotide phosphorylase pnpase  a homotrimeric exoribonuclease present in bacteria is involved in mrna degradation in escherichia coli expression of this enzyme is autocontrolled at the translational level we introduced about  mutations in the pnp gene by site directed mutagenesis most of them in phylogenetically conserved residues and determined their effects on the three catalytic activities of pnpase phosphorolysis polymerisation and phosphate exchange as well as on the efficiency of translational repression the data are presented and discussed in the light of the crystallographic structure of pnpase from streptomyces antibioticus the results show that both pnpase activity and the presence of the kh and s rna binding domains are required for autocontrol deletions of these rna binding domains do not abolish any of the three catalytic activities indicating that they are contained in a domain independent of the catalytic centre moreover the catalytic centre was located around the tungsten binding site identified by crystallography some mutations affect the three catalytic activities differently an observation consistent with the presence of different subsites
