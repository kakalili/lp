crystal structure of nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase from staphyloccocus aureus structural basis for naad interaction in functional dimer
bacterial nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase namnat ec      encoded by the nadd gene is essential for cell survival and is thus an attractive target for developing new antibacterial agents the namnat catalyzes the transfer of an adenylyl group of atp to nicotinic acid mononucleotide namn to form nicotinic acid dinucleotide naad  two independently derived high resolution structures of staphylococcus aureus namnat  naad complexes establish the conserved features of the core dinucleotide binding fold with other adenylyltransferases from bacteria to human despite a limited sequence conservation the crystal structures reveal that the nicotinate carboxylates of naad are recognized by interaction with the main chain amides of thr  and tyr   a positive helix dipole and two bridged water molecules unlike other bacterial adenylyltransferases where a partially conserved histidine residue interacts with the nicotinate ring the leu  side chain interacts with the nicotinate ring by van der waals contact importantly the s aureus namnat represents a distinct adenylyltransferase subfamily identifiable in part by common features of dimerization and substrate recognition in the loop connecting   to   residues      and the additional   strand the unique   strand helps orient the residues in the loop connecting   to   for substrate product recognition and allows the   strand structural flexibility to make key dimer interface interactions taken together these structural results provide a molecular basis for understanding the coupled activity and recognition specificity for s aureus namnat and for rational design of selective inhibitors
