hydrophobic surface burial is the major stability determinant of a flat single layer  sheet
formation of a flat  sheet is a fundamental event in  sheet mediated protein self assembly to investigate the contributions of various factors to the stability of flat  sheets we performed extensive alanine scanning mutagenesis experiments on the single layer  sheet segment of borrelia outer surface protein a ospa  this  sheet segment consists of  strands with highly regular geometries that can serve as a building block for self assembly our ala scanning approach is distinct from the conventional host guest method in that it introduces only conservative truncation mutations that should minimize structural perturbation our results showed very weak correlation with experimental  sheet propensity scales statistical  sheet propensity scales or cross strand pairwise correlations in contrast our data showed strong positive correlation with the change in buried non polar surface area polar interactions including prominent glu lys cross strand pairs contribute marginally to the  sheet stability these results were corroborated by results from additional non ala mutations taken together these results demonstrate the dominant contribution of non polar surface burial to flat  sheet stability even at solvent exposed positions the ospa single layer  sheet achieves efficient hydrophobic surface burial without forming a hydrophobic core by a strategic placement of a variety of side chains these findings further suggest the importance of hydrophobic interactions within a  sheet layer in peptide self assembly
