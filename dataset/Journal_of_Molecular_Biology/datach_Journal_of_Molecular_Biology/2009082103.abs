the non canonical hop protein from caenorhabditis elegans exerts essential functions and forms binary complexes with either hsc  or hsp
heat shock protein hsp   hsp  organizing proteins hop sti  are thought to function as adaptor proteins to link the two chaperone machineries hsp  and hsp  during the processing of substrate proteins in eukaryotes hop hsp  hsp  organizing protein is composed of three tetratricopeptide repeat tpr domains of which the first tpr  binds to hsp  the second tpr a binds to hsp  and the third tpr b is of unknown function contrary to most other eukaryotes the homologue closest to the caenorhabditis elegans hop homologue r e   cehop lacks the tpr domain and the short linker region connecting it to tpr a questioning the reported function as an hsp  hsp  adaptor in vitro and in vivo we observed high constitutive expression levels of cehop and detected significant phenotypes upon knockdown linking the protein to functions in gonad development interestingly we observed physical interactions with both chaperones hsp  and hsp  albeit only the interaction with hsp  is strong and inhibition of the hsp  atpase activity can be observed upon binding of cehop however the formation of ternary complexes with both chaperone machineries is impaired as hsp  and hsp  compete for cehop interaction sites in particular as hsp  binds to both tpr domains simultaneously and requires both tpr domains for atpase regulation these results imply that at least in c elegans essential functions of hop exist which apparently do not depend on the simultaneous binding of hsp  and hsp  to hop
