effects of salt concentration on association of the amyloid protofilaments of hen egg white lysozyme studied by time resolved neutron scattering
various proteins have been shown to form various aggregated structures including the filamentous aggregates known as amyloid fibrils depending on the solution conditions hen egg white lysozyme hewl is one of the proteins that form the amyloid fibrils to gain insight into the mechanism of this polymorphism of the aggregated structures we employed a model system consisting of hewl pure water and ethanol and investigated the kinetic process of the fibril formation in various salt concentrations with time resolved neutron scattering it was shown that by addition of nacl in a range between   mm and   mm to hewl solution in   ethanol gelation occurred and this gelation proceeded through a two step process the lateral association of the protofilaments followed by the cross linking of these fibrils formed both the structures of the fibrils and the rate of the gelation depended on nacl concentration the average structures of the fibrils formed at   mm nacl were characterized by the radius of gyration of their cross section         and the number of the protofilaments within the fibril         corresponding to the mature amyloid fibrils a range of intermediate structures was formed below  mm nacl above  mm nacl precipitation occurred because of the formation of amorphous aggregates here the branch point to the formation of the mature amyloid fibrils or to the amorphous aggregates was after the formation of the protofilaments sensitivity of the aggregated structures to salt concentration suggests that electrostatic interaction plays an essential role in the formation of these structures the structural diversity both in the fibrils and the aggregated structures of the fibrils can be interpreted in terms of the difference in the degree of the electrostatic shielding at different salt concentrations
