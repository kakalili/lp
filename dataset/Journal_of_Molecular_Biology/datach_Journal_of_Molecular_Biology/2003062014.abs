crystal structure of the      rna ligase from thermus thermophilus hb
the      rna ligase family members are bacterial and archaeal rna ligases that ligate   and   half trna molecules with      cyclic phosphate and   hydroxyl termini respectively to the product containing the      phosphodiester linkage here the crystal structure of the      rna ligase protein from an extreme thermophile thermus thermophilus hb  was solved at    resolution the structure of the      rna ligase superimposes well on that of the arabidopsis thaliana cyclic phosphodiesterase cpdase  which hydrolyzes adp ribose      cyclic phosphate a product of the trna splicing reaction to the monoester adp ribose   phosphate although the sequence identity between the two proteins is remarkably low     the      rna ligase and cpdase structures have two hx t s x motifs in their corresponding positions the hx t s x motifs play important roles in the cpdase activity and are conserved in both the cpdases and      rna ligases therefore the catalytic mechanism of the      rna ligase may be similar to that of the cpdase on the other hand the electrostatic potential of the cavity of the      rna ligase is positive but that of the cpdase is negative furthermore in the cpdase two loops with low b factors cover the cavity in contrast in the      rna ligase the corresponding loops form an open conformation and are flexible these characteristics may be due to the differences in the substrates trna and adp ribose      cyclic phosphate
