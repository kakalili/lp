an accurate sensitive and scalable method to identify functional sites in protein structures
functional sites determine the activity and interactions of proteins and as such constitute the targets of most drugs however the exponential growth of sequence and structure data far exceeds the ability of experimental techniques to identify their locations and key amino acids to fill this gap we developed a computational evolutionary trace method that ranks the evolutionary importance of amino acids in protein sequences studies show that the best ranked residues form fewer and larger structural clusters than expected by chance and overlap with functional sites but until now the significance of this overlap has remained qualitative here we use  diverse protein structures including  determined by the structural genomics initiative to show that this overlap is a recurrent and statistically significant feature an automated et correctly identifies seven of ten functional sites by the least favorable statistical measure and nine of ten by the most favorable one these results quantitatively demonstrate that a large fraction of functional sites in the proteome may be accurately identified from sequence and structure this should help focus structure  function studies rational drug design protein engineering and functional annotation to the relevant regions of a protein
