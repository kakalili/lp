a combined transmembrane topology and signal peptide prediction method
an inherent problem in transmembrane protein topology prediction and signal peptide prediction is the high similarity between the hydrophobic regions of a transmembrane helix and that of a signal peptide leading to cross reaction between the two types of predictions to improve predictions further it is therefore important to make a predictor that aims to discriminate between the two classes in addition topology information can be gained when successfully predicting a signal peptide leading a transmembrane protein since it dictates that the n terminus of the mature protein must be on the non cytoplasmic side of the membrane here we present phobius a combined transmembrane protein topology and signal peptide predictor the predictor is based on a hidden markov model hmm that models the different sequence regions of a signal peptide and the different regions of a transmembrane protein in a series of interconnected states training was done on a newly assembled and curated dataset compared to tmhmm and signalp errors coming from cross prediction between transmembrane segments and signal peptides were reduced substantially by phobius false classifications of signal peptides were reduced from    to   and false classifications of transmembrane helices were reduced from    to    phobius was applied to the proteomes of homo sapiens and escherichia coli here we also noted a drastic reduction of false classifications compared to tmhmm signalp suggesting that phobius is well suited for whole genome annotation of signal peptides and transmembrane regions the method is available at http  phobius cgb ki se as well as at http  phobius binf ku dk
