specific interactions of the telomeric protein rap p with nucleosomal binding sites edited by a klug
the telomeres of saccharomyces cerevisiae are structurally and functionally well characterized their telomeric dna is packaged by the protein rap p repressor activator protein   rap p is a multifunctional sequence specific dna binding protein which besides participating in the regulation of telomeres structure and length is also involved in transcriptional regulation of genes essential for cell growth and in silencing whereas the long tracts of telomeric dna repeats of higher eukaryotes are mostly organized in closely spaced canonical nucleosomal arrays it has been proposed that the   base pairs of s cerevisiae telomeric dna are organized in a large non nucleosomal structure that has been called the telosome recently nucleosomes have been found also in tetrahymena thermophila telomeres suggesting that in general telomere structural differences between lower and higher eukaryotes could be quantitative rather than qualitative using an in vitro model system we have addressed the question of whether rap p can form a stable ternary complex with nucleosomes containing telomeric binding sites or competes with nucleosome core formation the approach we have taken is to place a single rap p binding site at different positions within a nucleosome core and then test the binding of rap p and its dna binding domain rap p dbd  we show here that both proteins are able to specifically recognize their nucleosomal binding site but that binding is dependent on the location of the site within the nucleosome core structure these results show that a ternary complex between a nucleosome and rap p is stable and could be a possible intermediate between telomeric nucleosomes and telosomes in the dynamics of s cerevisiae telomere organization
