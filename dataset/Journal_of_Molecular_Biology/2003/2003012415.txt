Here we report the gene structure and transcription regulation of the human and mouse G protein-signaling regulator GAIP/RGS19. The GAIP/RGS19 gene is adjacent to and in an opposite orientation to the opioid-receptor-like receptor 1 (ORL1) gene. In both human and mouse, the GAIP/RGS19 gene is composed of seven exons. The first two exons are under the control of two different promoters and are alternatively employed to start the transcription of two 5â€² distinctive mRNAs. The two promoters appear to compete with and inhibit each other. We have also identified in mice an alternatively spliced short GAIP/RGS19 mRNA that lacks the exon 2 region and utilizes an ATG in exon 3 as its translation initiation codon. As a result, the short GAIP/RGS19 protein does not have the N-terminal 22 amino acid residues of a full-length isoform. GAIP/RGS19 alternative splicing patterns are differentially expressed in various tissues. The mRNA alternative splicing to produce multiple isoforms may play a significant role in regulating the function and selectivity of GAIP/RGS19.
