rnase e and polyadenyl polymerase i are involved in maturation of ci rna the p phage immunity factor
bacteriophage p immunity is controlled by a small stable rna ci rna that derives from the processing of primary transcripts in previous works we observed that the endonuclease rnase p is required for the maturation of ci rna   end moreover we found that polynucleotide phosphorylase pnpase  a   to   rna degrading enzyme is required for efficient   end processing of ci rna suggesting that   end degradation of the primary transcript might be involved in the production of proper rnase p substrates here we demonstrate that another escherichia coli nuclease rnase e would appear to be involved in this process we found that transcripts of the p immunity region are modified by the post transcriptional addition of short poly a tails and heteropolymeric tails with prevalence of a residues most oligoadenylated transcripts encompass the whole ci locus and are thus compatible as intermediates in the ci rna maturation pathway on the contrary in a polynucleotide phosphorylase pnpase defective host adenylation occurred most frequently within ci implying that such transcripts are targeted for degradation we did not find polyadenylation in a pcnb mutant suggesting that the pcnb encoded polyadenyl polymerase i pap i is the only enzyme responsible for modification of p immunity transcripts maturation of ci rna   end in such a mutant was impaired further supporting the idea that processing of the   end of primary transcripts is an important step for efficient maturation of ci rna by rnase p
