dissecting the interaction network of multiprotein complexes by pairwise coexpression of subunits in e coli edited by k nagai
using the human basal transcription factors tfiid and tfiih as examples we show that pairwise coexpression of polypeptides in escherichia coli can be used as a tool for the identification of specifically interacting subunits within multiprotein complexes we find that coexpression of appropriate combinations generally leads to an increase in the solubility and stability of the polypeptides involved which means that large amounts of the resulting complexes can immediately be obtained for subsequent biochemical and structural analysis furthermore we demonstrate that the solubilization and or the proper folding of a protein by its natural partner can be used as a monitor for deletion mapping to determine precise interaction domains coexpression can be used as an alternative or complementary approach to conventional techniques for interaction studies such as yeast two hybrid analysis gst pulldown and immunoprecipitation
