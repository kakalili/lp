carboxyl pka values ion pairs hydrogen bonding and the ph dependence of folding the hyperthermophile proteins sac d and sso d
sac d and sso d are homologous hyperthermophile proteins with a high density of charged surface residues and potential ion pairs to determine the relative importance of specific amino acid side chains in defining the stability and function of these archaeal chromatin proteins pka values were measured for the acidic residues in both proteins using  c nmr chemical shifts the stability of sso d enabled titrations to ph  under low salt conditions two aspartate residues in sso d d  and d  and a single glutamate residue g  showed significantly perturbed pka values in low salt indicating that the observed ph dependence of stability was primarily due to these three residues the ph dependence of backbone amide nmr resonances demonstrated that perturbation of all three pka values was primarily the result of side chain to backbone amide hydrogen bonds few of the significantly perturbed acidic pka values in sac d and sso d could be attributed to primarily ion pair or electrostatic interactions a smaller perturbation of e  e  in sac d was ascribed to an ion pair interaction that may be important in defining the dna binding surface the small number three of significantly altered pka values was in good agreement with a linkage analysis of the temperature ph and salt dependence of folding the linkage of the ionization of two or more side chains to protein folding led to apparent cooperativity in the ph dependence of folding although each group titrated independently with a hill coefficient near unity these results demonstrate that the acid ph dependence of protein stability in these hyperthermophile proteins is due to independent titration of acidic residues with pka values perturbed primarily by hydrogen bonding of the side chain to the backbone this work demonstrates the need for caution in using structural data alone to argue the importance of ion pairs in stabilizing hyperthermophile proteins
