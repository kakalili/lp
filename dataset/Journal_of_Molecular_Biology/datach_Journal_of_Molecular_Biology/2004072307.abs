structure of the c terminal ring finger from a ring ibr ring triad motif reveals a novel zinc binding domain distinct from a ring
the really interesting new gene ring family of proteins contains over   members with diverse physiological functions a subset of these domains is found in the context of the ring ibr ring triad motifs which function as e ubiquitin ligases our sequence analysis of the c terminal ring ring  from this motif show that several metal ligating and hydrophobic residues critical for the formation of a classical ring cross brace structure are not present thus we determined the structure of the ring from the ring ibr ring motif of hhari and showed that ring has a completely distinct topology from classical rings notably ring binds only one zinc atom per monomer rather than two and uses a different hydrophobic network to that of classical rings additionally this ring topology is novel bearing slight resemblance to zinc ribbon motifs around the zinc site and is different from the topologies of the zinc binding sites found in ring and phds we demonstrate that ring acts as an e ligase in vitro and using mutational analysis deduce the structural features required for this activity further mutations in the ring ibr ring of parkin cause a rare form of parkinsonism and these studies provide an explanation for those mutations that occur in its ring  from a comparison of the ring structure with those reported for rings we infer sequence determinants that allow discrimination between ring and ring domains at the sequence analysis level
