folding and fibrillogenesis clues from   microglobulin
renal failure impairs the clearance of   microglobulin from the serum with the result that this protein accumulates in joints under the form of amyloid fibrils while the molecular mechanism leading to deposition of amyloid in vivo is not totally understood some organic compounds such as trifluoroethanol tfe  are commonly used to promote the elongation of amyloid fibrils in vitro this article gives some insights into the structural properties and the conformational states of   microglobulin in the presence of tfe using both the wild type protein and the mutant trp gly the structure of the native state of the protein is rather insensitive to the presence of the alcohol but the stability of this state is lowered in comparison to some other conformational states in particular a native like folding intermediate is observed in the presence of moderate concentrations of tfe instead at higher concentrations of the alcohol the population of a disordered native unlike state is dominant and correlates with the ability to elongate fibrils
