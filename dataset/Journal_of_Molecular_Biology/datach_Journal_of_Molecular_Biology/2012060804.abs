linker histone subtypes differ in their effect on nucleosomal spacing in vivo
linker histone h is located on the surface of the nucleosome where it interacts with the linker dna region and stabilizes the  nm chromatin fiber vertebrates have several different relatively conserved subtypes of h  however the functional reason for this is unclear we have previously shown that h can be reconstituted in xenopus oocytes cells that lack somatic h  by cytosolic mrna injection and incorporated into in vivo assembled chromatin using this assay we have expressed individual h subtypes in the oocytes to study their effect on chromatin structure using nucleosomal repeat length nrl as readout we have compared chicken differentiation specific histone h  xenopus differentiation specific xh  and the somatic variant xh a as well as the ubiquitously expressed human somatic subtypes hh   hh   hh  and hh   this shows that all subtypes except for human h   result in a saturable increase in nrl hh  results in an increase of approximately     bp as does xh  and xh a chh gives rise to the same or slightly longer increase compared to hh   interestingly both hh  and hh  show a less extensive increase of only     bp in the nrl thus yielding the shortest increase of the studied subtypes we show for the first time in an in vivo system lacking h background that ubiquitously expressed and redundant h subtypes that coexist in most types of cells of higher eukaryotes differ in their effects on the nucleosomal spacing in vivo this suggests that h subtypes have different roles in the organization and functioning of the chromatin fiber
