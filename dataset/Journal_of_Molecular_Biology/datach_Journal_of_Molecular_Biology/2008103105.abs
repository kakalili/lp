the first structure of a glycoside hydrolase family  member cel b from hypocrea jecorina at     resolution
the glycoside hydrolase gh family  is a long recognized but still recondite class of proteins with little known about the activity mechanism or function of its more than  members the best studied gh family  member cel a of the filamentous fungus hypocrea jecorina is known to be an endoglucanase but it is not clear if this represents the main activity or function of this family in vivo we present here the first structure for this family that of cel b from h jecorina the best quality crystals were formed in the presence of nickel and the crystal structure was solved to     resolution using a single wavelength anomalous dispersion method with nickel as the source of anomalous scatter cel b lacks a carbohydrate binding module and is a single domain protein that folds into a twisted  sandwich a structure aided sequence alignment of all gh family  proteins identified a highly conserved group of residues on the surface of cel b within this patch of mostly polar amino acids was a site occupied by the intramolecular nickel hexacoordinately bound in the solved structure in the cel b structure there is no easily identifiable carbohydrate binding cleft or pocket or catalytic center of the types normally seen in ghs a structural comparison search showed that the known structure most similar to cel b is that of cbp  from the gram negative soil bacterium serratia marcescens a member of the carbohydrate binding module family  proteins a polar surface patch highly conserved in that structural family has been identified in cbp  and shown to be involved in chitin binding and in the protein s enhancement of chitinase activities the analysis of the cel b structure is discussed in light of our continuing research to better understand the activities and function of gh family
