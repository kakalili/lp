The heterotrimeric UmuD′2C complex of Escherichia coli has recently been shown to possess intrinsic DNA polymerase activity (DNA pol V) that facilitates error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (SOS mutagenesis). When overexpressed in vivo, UmuD′2C also inhibits homologous recombination. In both activities, UmuD′2C interacts with RecA nucleoprotein filaments. To examine the biochemical and structural basis of these reactions, we have analyzed the ability of the UmuD′2C complex to bind to RecA-ssDNA filaments in vitro. As estimated by a gel retardation assay, binding saturates at a stoichiometry of approximately one complex per two RecA monomers. Visualized by cryo-electron microscopy under these conditions, UmuD′2C is seen to bind uniformly along the filaments, such that the complexes are completely submerged in the deep helical groove. This mode of binding would impede access to DNA in a RecA filament, thus explaining the ability of UmuD′2C to inhibit homologous recombination. At sub-saturating binding, the distribution of UmuD′2C complexes along RecA-ssDNA filaments was characterized by immuno-gold labelling with anti-UmuC antibodies. These data revealed preferential binding at filament ends (most likely, at one end). End-specific binding is consistent with genetic models whereby such binding positions the UmuD′2C complex (pol V) appropriately for its role in SOS mutagenesis.
