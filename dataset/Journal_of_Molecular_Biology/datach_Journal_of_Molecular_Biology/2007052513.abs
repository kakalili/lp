shape and subunit organisation of the dna methyltransferase m ahdi by small angle neutron scattering
type i restriction modification r m systems encode multisubunit multidomain enzymes two genes m and s are required to form the methyltransferase mtase that methylates a specific base within the recognition sequence and protects dna from cleavage by the endonuclease the dna methyltransferase m ahdi is a   kda tetramer with the stoichiometry m s and has properties typical of a type i mtase the m ahdi enzyme has been prepared with deuterated s subunits to allow contrast variation using small angle neutron scattering sans methods the sans data were collected in a number of h h solvent contrasts to allow matching of one or other of the subunits in the multisubunit enzyme the radius of gyration rg and maximum dimensions dmax of the m subunits in situ in the multisubunit enzyme     and     respectively are close of those of the entire mtase     and      in contrast the s subunits in situ have experimentally determined values of rg    and dmax     indicating their more central location in the enzyme ab initio reconstruction methods yield a low resolution structural model of the shape and subunit organization of m ahdi in which the z shaped structure of the s subunit dimer can be discerned in contrast the m subunits form a much more elongated and extended structure the core of the mtase comprises the two s subunits and the globular regions of the two m subunits with the extended portion of the m subunits most probably forming highly mobile regions at the outer extremities which collapse around the dna when the mtase binds
