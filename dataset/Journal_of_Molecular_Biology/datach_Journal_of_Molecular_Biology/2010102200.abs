determinants of substrate binding and protonation in the flavoenzyme xenobiotic reductase a
xenobiotic reductase a xena from pseudomonas putida  catalyzes the nad p h dependent reduction of various    unsaturated carbonyl compounds and is a member of the old yellow enzyme family the reaction of xena follows a ping pong mechanism implying that its active site has to accommodate and correctly position the various substrates to be oxidized nadh nadph and to be reduced different    unsaturated carbonyl compounds to enable formal hydride transfers between the substrate and the isoalloxazine ring the active site of xena is lined by two tyrosine tyr  tyr   and two tryptophan trp   trp   residues which were proposed to contribute to substrate binding we analyzed the individual contributions of the four residues using site directed mutagenesis steady state and transient kinetics redox potentiometry and crystal structure analysis the y  f substitution decreases the affinity of xena for nadph and reduces the rate of the oxidative half reaction by two to three orders of magnitude the latter being in agreement with its function as a proton donor in the oxidative half reaction upon reduction of the flavin trp  swings into the active site of xena in conformation and decreases the extent of the substrate binding pocket its exchange against alanine induces substrate inhibition at elevated nadph concentrations indicating that the in conformation of trp  helps to disfavor the nonproductive nadph binding in the reduced state of xena our analysis shows that while the principal catalytic mechanism of xena for example type of proton donor is analogous to that of other members of the old yellow enzyme family its strategy to correctly position and accommodate different substrates is unprecedented
