homo oligomerisation and nuclear localisation of mouse histone deacetylase  edited by j karn
reversible histone acetylation changes the chromatin structure and can modulate gene transcription mammalian histone deacetylase  hdac  is a nuclear protein that belongs to a growing family of evolutionarily conserved enzymes catalysing the removal of acetyl residues from core histones and other proteins previously we have identified murine hdac as a growth factor inducible protein in murine t cells here we characterise the molecular function of mouse hdac in more detail co immunoprecipitation experiments with epitope tagged hdac protein reveal the association with endogenous hdac enzyme we show that hdac can homo oligomerise and that this interaction is dependent on the n terminal hdac association domain of the protein furthermore the same hdac domain is also necessary for in vitro binding of hdac and hdac  association with rbap  and for catalytic activity of the enzyme a lysine rich sequence within the carboxy terminus of hdac is crucial for nuclear localisation of the enzyme we identify a c terminal nuclear localisation domain which is sufficient for the transport of hdac and of reporter fusion proteins into the nucleus alternatively hdac can be shuttled into the nucleus by association with another hdac molecule via its n terminal hdac association domain our results define two domains which are essential for the oligomerisation and nuclear localisation of mouse hdac
