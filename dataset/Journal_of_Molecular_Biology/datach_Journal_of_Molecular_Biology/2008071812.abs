structural and mutational analyses of the interaction between the barley  amylase subtilisin inhibitor and the subtilisin savinase reveal a novel mode of inhibition
subtilisins represent a large class of microbial serine proteases to date there are three dimensional structures of proteinaceous inhibitors from three families in complex with subtilisins in the protein data bank all interact with subtilisin via an exposed loop covering six interacting residues here we present the crystal structure of the complex between the bacillus lentus subtilisin savinase and the barley  amylase subtilisin inhibitor basi  this is the first reported structure of a cereal kunitz p family inhibitor in complex with a subtilisin structural analysis revealed that basi inhibits savinase in a novel way as the interacting loop is shorter than loops previously reported mutational analysis showed that thr  is crucial for the inhibition as it stabilises the interacting loop through intramolecular interactions with the basi backbone
