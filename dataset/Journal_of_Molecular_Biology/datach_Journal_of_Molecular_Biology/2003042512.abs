dolastatin  connects two long pitch strands in f actin to stabilize microfilaments
dolastatin   a drug isolated from the indian ocean sea hare dolabella auricularia arrests cytokinesis in vivo and increases the amount of f actin to stabilize f actin in vitro like phalloidin and jasplakinolide however according to the previous biochemical study the binding of dolastatin  to f actin does not compete with that of phalloidin suggesting that the binding sites are different to understand the mechanism of f actin stabilization by dolastatin   we determined the position of bound dolastatin  in f actin using the x ray fiber diffraction from oriented filament sols our analysis shows that the position of dolastatin  is clearly different from that of phalloidin however these bound drugs are present in the gap between the two long pitch f actin strands in a similar way the result suggests that the connection between the two long pitch f actin strands might be a key for the control of f actin stabilization
