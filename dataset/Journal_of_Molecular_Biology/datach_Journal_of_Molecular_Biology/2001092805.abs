structural mechanisms of drug resistance for mutations at codons   and   in hiv  reverse transcriptase and the improved resilience of second generation non nucleoside inhibitors edited by j karn
mutations at either tyr  or tyr  within hiv  reverse transcriptase rt give high level resistance to many first generation non nucleoside inhibitors nnrtis such as the anti aids drug nevirapine by comparison second generation inhibitors for instance the drug efavirenz show much greater resilience to these mutations in order to understand the structural basis for these differences we have determined a series of seven crystal structures of mutant rts in complexes with first and second generation nnrtis as well as one example of an unliganded mutant rt these are tyr  cys rt tnk   to     tyr  cys rt efavirenz to     tyr  cys rt nevirapine to     tyr  cys rt pett  to     tyr  cys rt nevirapine to     tyr  cys rt uc   to    and tyr  cys rt unliganded to    resolution in the two previously published structures of hiv  reverse transcriptase with mutations at   or   no side chain electron density was observed within the p  subunit which contains the inhibitor binding pocket for the mutated residues in contrast the mutated side chains can be seen in the nnrti pocket for all seven structures reported here eliminating the possibility that disordering contributes to the mechanism of resistance in the case of the second generation compounds efavirenz with tyr  cys rt and uc   with tyr  cys rt there are only small rearrangements of either inhibitor within the binding site compared to wild type rt and also for the first generation compounds tnk   pett  and nevirapine with tyr  cys rt for nevirapine with the tyr  cys rt there is however a more substantial movement of the drug molecule we conclude that protein conformational changes and rearrangements of drug molecules within the mutated sites are not general features of these particular inhibitor mutant combinations the main contribution to drug resistance for tyr  cys and tyr  cys rt mutations is the loss of aromatic ring stacking interactions for first generation compounds providing a simple explanation for the resilience of second generation nnrtis as such interactions make much less significant contribution to their binding
