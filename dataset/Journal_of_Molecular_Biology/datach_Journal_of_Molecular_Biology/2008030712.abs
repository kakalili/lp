the atpase domain of the large terminase protein gp  from bacteriophage t binds dna implications to the dna packaging mechanism
translocation of double stranded dna into a preformed capsid by tailed bacteriophages is driven by powerful motors assembled at the special portal vertex the motor is thought to drive processive cycles of dna binding movement and release to package the viral genome in phage t  there is evidence that the large terminase protein gene product   gp   assembles into a multisubunit motor and translocates dna by an inchworm mechanism gp  consists of two domains an n terminal atpase domain amino acids     that powers translocation of dna and a c terminal nuclease domain amino acids      that cuts concatemeric dna to generate a headful size viral genome while the functional motifs of atpase and nuclease have been well defined and the atpase atomic structure has been solved the dna binding motif s responsible for viral dna recognition cutting and translocation are unknown here we report the first evidence for the presence of a double stranded dna binding activity in the gp  atpase domain binding to dna is sensitive to mg  and salt but not the type of dna used dna fragments as short as   bp can bind to the atpase but preferential binding was observed to dna greater than  kb a high molecular weight atpase  dna complex was isolated by gel filtration suggesting oligomerization of atpase following dna interaction dna binding was not observed with the full length gp  or the c terminal nuclease domain the small terminase protein gp  inhibited dna binding which was further accentuated by atp the presence of a dna binding site in the atpase domain and its binding properties implicate a role in the dna packaging mechanism
