three dimensional fold of the human aqp water channel determined at   resolution by electron crystallography of two dimensional crystals embedded in ice edited by w baumeister
here we present a three dimensional  d density map of deglycosylated human erythrocyte aquaporin  aqp  determined at   resolution in plane and     resolution perpendicular to the bilayer the map was calculated by analyzing images and electron diffraction patterns recorded from tilted up to     ice embedded frozen hydrated d crystals of aqp in lipid bilayer membranes this map significantly extends the findings related to the folding of the aqp polypeptide chain determined by us at a lower    by      resolution the solvent accessible volume within a monomer has a vestibular architecture with a narrow      diameter constriction near the center of the bilayer where the location of the water selective channel is postulated to exist the clearly resolved densities for the transmembrane helices display the protrusions expected for bulky side chains the density in the interior of the helix barrel putative npa box region is better resolved compared to our previous map suggesting clearer linkage to some of the helices and it may harbor short stretches of  helix at the bilayer extremities densities for some of the inter helix hydrophilic loops are visible consistent with these observed inter helix connections possible models for the threading of the aqp polypeptide chain are presented a preferred model is deduced that agrees with the putative locations of a group of aromatic residues in the amino acid sequence and in the d density map
