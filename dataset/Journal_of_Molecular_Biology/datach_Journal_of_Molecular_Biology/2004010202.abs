solid state nmr reveals a ph dependent antiparallel  sheet registry in fibrils formed by a  amyloid peptide
we report solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr measurements that probe the supramolecular organization of  sheets in the cross  motif of amyloid fibrils formed by residues     of the  amyloid peptide associated with alzheimer s disease a      fibrils were prepared at ph   and ph   the solid state nmr data indicate that the central hydrophobic segment of a      sequence lvffa adopts a  strand conformation and participates in antiparallel  sheets at both ph values but that the registry of intermolecular hydrogen bonds is ph dependent moreover both registries determined for a     fibrils are different from the hydrogen bond registry in the antiparallel  sheets of a     fibrils at ph   determined in earlier solid state nmr studies in all three cases the hydrogen bond registry is highly ordered with no detectable  registry shift  defects these results suggest that the supramolecular organization of  sheets in amyloid fibrils is determined by a sensitive balance of multiple side chain  side chain interactions recent structural models for a     fibrils based on x ray fiber diffraction data are inconsistent with the solid state nmr data at both ph values
