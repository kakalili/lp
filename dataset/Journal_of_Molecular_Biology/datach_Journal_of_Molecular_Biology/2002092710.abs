site specific discrimination by cyanovirin n for  linked trisaccharides comprising the three arms of man and man
cyanovirin n cvn is a novel cyanobacterial protein that selectively binds with nanomolar affinities the mammalian oligosaccharides man and man  consequently cvn potently blocks hiv entry through highly avid carbohydrate mediated interactions with the hiv envelope glycoprotein gp   and is under preclinical investigation as an anti hiv microbicide cvn contains two non overlapping carbohydrate binding sites that bind the disaccharide man    man  which represents the terminal disaccharide of all three arms of man  with low to sub micromolar affinities the solution structure of a   cvn man    man  complex revealed that cvn recognizes the stacked conformation of man    man  through a deep hydrophilic binding pocket on one side of the protein site  and a semi circular cleft on the other site   with the prominent exception of the c hydroxyl group of the reducing mannopyranose ring the bound disaccharide is positioned so that each hydroxyl group is involved in a direct or water mediated hydrogen bond to the polar or charged side chains comprising the binding pocket thus to determine whether the next most reducing mannopyranose ring will augment cvn affinity and selectivity we have characterized by nmr and itc the binding of cvn to three synthetic trisaccharides representing the full length d  d and d arms of mammalian oligomannosides our findings demonstrate that site  is able to discriminate between the three related trisaccharides methyl man    man    man methyl man    man    man and methyl man    man    man with remarkable selectivity and binds these trisaccharides with ka values ranging from     m   to     m   site  is less selective in that it binds all three trisaccharides with similar ka values ranging from   to        m   but overall binds these trimannosides with higher affinities than site  the diversity of pathogenic organisms that display     linked mannosides on their cell surfaces suggests a broad defensive role for cvn in its cyanobacterial source
