fluid and condensed apoa i phospholipid monolayers provide insights into apoa i membrane insertion
apolipoprotein a i apoa i is a protein implicated in the solubilization of lipids and cholesterol from cellular membranes the study of apoa i in phospholipid pl monolayers brings relevant information about apoa i pl interactions we investigated the influence of pl charge and acyl chain organization on the interaction with apoa i using dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol monolayers coupled to ellipsometric surface pressure atomic force microscopy and infrared polarization modulation infrared reflection  absorption spectroscopy measurements we show that monolayer compressibility is the major factor controlling protein insertion into pl monolayers and show evidence of the requirement of a minimal distance between lipid headgroups for insertion to occur moreover we demonstrate that apoa i inserts deepest at the highest compressibility of the protein monolayer and that the presence of an anionic headgroup increases the amount of protein inserted in the pl monolayer and prevents the steric constrains imposed by the spacing of the headgroup we also defined the geometry of protein clusters into the lipid monolayer by atomic force microscopy and show evidence of the geometry dependence upon the lipid charge and the distance between headgroups finally we show that apoa i helices have a specific orientation when associated to form clusters and that this is influenced by the character of pl charges taken together our results suggest that the interaction of apoa i with the cellular membrane may be driven by a mechanism that resembles that of antimicrobial peptide lipid interaction
