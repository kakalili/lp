human regiv protein adopts a typical c type lectin fold but binds mannan with two calcium independent sites
human regiv protein which contains a sequence motif homologous to calcium dependent c type lectin like domain is highly expressed in mucosa cells of the gastrointestinal tract during pathogen infection and carcinogenesis and may be applied in both diagnosis and treatment of gastric and colon cancers here we provide evidence that unlike other c type lectins human regiv binds to polysaccharides mannan and heparin in the absence of calcium to elucidate the structural basis for carbohydrate recognition by nmr we generated the mutant with pro  replaced by ser hregiv p s and showed that the structural property and carbohydrate binding ability of hregiv p s are almost identical with those of wild type protein the solution structure of hregiv p s was determined showing that it adopts a typical fold of c type lectin based on the chemical shift perturbations of amide resonances two calcium independent mannan binding sites were proposed one site is similar to the calcium independent sugar binding site on human regiii and langerin interestingly the other site is adjacent to the conserved calcium dependent site at position ca  of typical c type lectins moreover model free analysis of  n relaxation parameters and simplified carr  purcell  meiboom  gill relaxation dispersion experiments showed that a slow microsecond to millisecond time scale backbone motion is involved in mannan binding by this site suggesting a potential role for specific carbohydrate recognition our findings shed light on the sugar binding mode of reg family proteins and we postulate that reg family proteins evolved to bind sugar without calcium to keep the carbohydrate recognition activity under low ph environments in the gastrointestinal tract
