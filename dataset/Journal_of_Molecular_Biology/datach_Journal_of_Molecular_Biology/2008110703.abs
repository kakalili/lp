domain ii of thermus thermophilus ribosomal protein l hinders recognition of its mrna
the two domain ribosomal protein l has a dual function as a primary rrna binding ribosomal protein and as a translational repressor that binds its own mrna here we report the crystal structure of a complex between the isolated domain i of l from the bacterium thermus thermophilus and a specific mrna fragment from methanoccocus vannielii in parallel we report kinetic characteristics measured for complexes formed by intact tthl and its domain i with the specific mrna fragment although there is a close similarity between the rna  protein contact regions in both complexes the association rate constant is higher in the case of the complex formed by the isolated domain i this finding demonstrates that domain ii hinders mrna recognition by the intact tthl
