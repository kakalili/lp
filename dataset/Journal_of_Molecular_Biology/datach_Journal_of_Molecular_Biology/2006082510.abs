an interplay between protein disorder and structure confers the ca  regulation of striated muscle
the troponin tn complex regulates the thin filament of striated muscle by transducing ca  fluctuations into conformational changes these changes propagate to tropomyosin tm  which then assumes a new disposition with respect to actin reversibly exposing actin s binding sites for the thick filament motor atpase myosin  to date the structural biology of thin filament regulation has been studied in the context of two equilibrium states corresponding to high contraction activated and low contraction inhibited sarcomeric ca   new electron micrographic reconstructions of the thin filament have resolved tn actin and tm in high and low ca  states integrating high resolution structures of the tn core actin and tm the resultant picture of thin filament regulation does not resolve all of the functionally significant portions of troponin i tni or troponin c tnc  those regions of tn have been shown using nmr relaxation spectroscopy to undergo conformational fluctuations rationalizing the absence of these regions from micrograph based reconstructions the disordered portions of tn are to date being interpreted within a canonical structure  activity paradigm here we present a new mechanism for the regulation of tn having explicit descriptions of the kinetic pathways of activation and inhibition our thesis is that the intrinsic disorder of tni is mechanistically significant as the coupling of folding to binding has been shown to confer an inherent kinetic advantage known as flycasting activity  our thesis accounts for tni s conformational heterogeneity and known structure  activity relationships in a parsimonious fashion we integrate recent nmr structures of the c terminus of tni and nmr observations of the conformational dynamics of the tn complex into high resolution models of the thin filament ways of evaluating the mechanism are discussed the novel conceptual framework presented here prompts new hypotheses regarding the mechanism of ph sensitivity and of pathogenic mutations in troponin
