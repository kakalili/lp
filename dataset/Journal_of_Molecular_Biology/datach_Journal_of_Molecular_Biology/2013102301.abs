the dead box protein dbp functions with the rna binding protein yra to promote mrnp assembly
eukaryotic gene expression involves numerous biochemical steps that are dependent on rna structure and ribonucleoprotein rnp complex formation the dead box class of rna helicases plays fundamental roles in formation of rna and rnp structure in every aspect of rna metabolism in an effort to explore the diversity of biological roles for dead box proteins our laboratory recently demonstrated that the dead box protein dbp associates with actively transcribing genes and is required for normal gene expression in saccharomyces cerevisiae we now provide evidence that dbp interacts genetically and physically with the mrna export factor yra  in addition we find that dbp is required for in vivo assembly of mrna binding proteins yra  nab  and mex  onto poly a  rna strikingly we also show that dbp is an efficient rna helicase in vitro and that yra decreases the efficiency of atp dependent duplex unwinding we provide a model whereby messenger ribonucleoprotein mrnp assembly requires dbp unwinding activity and once the mrnp is properly assembled inhibition by yra prevents further rearrangements both yra and dbp are conserved in multicellular eukaryotes suggesting that this constitutes a broadly conserved mechanism for stepwise assembly of mature mrnps in the nucleus
