elucidating a key intermediate in homologous dna strand exchange structural characterization of the reca  triple stranded dna complex using fluorescence resonance energy transfer
the reca protein of escherichia coli plays essential roles in homologous recombination and restarting stalled dna replication forks in vitro the protein mediates dna strand exchange between single stranded ssdna and homologous double stranded dna dsdna molecules that serves as a model system for the in vivo processes to date no high resolution structure of the key intermediate comprised of three dna strands simultaneously bound to a reca filament reca  tsdna complex  has been reported we present a systematic characterization of the helical geometries of the three dna strands of the reca  tsdna complex using fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret under physiologically relevant solution conditions fret donor and acceptor dyes were used to label different dna strands and the interfluorophore distances were inferred from energy transfer efficiencies measured as a function of the base pair separation between the two dyes the energy transfer efficiencies were first measured on a control reca  dsdna complex and the calculated helical parameters h     h     were consistent with structural conclusions derived from electron microscopy em and other classic biochemical methods measurements of the helical parameters for the reca  tsdna complex revealed that all three dna strands adopt extended and unwound conformations similar to those of reca bound dsdna the structural data are consistent with the hypothesis that this complex is a late post strand exchange intermediate with the outgoing strand shifted by about three base pairs with respect to its registry with the incoming and complementary strands furthermore the bases of the incoming and complementary strands are displaced away from the helix axis toward the minor groove of the heteroduplex and the bases of the outgoing strand lie in the major groove of the heteroduplex we present a model for the strand exchange intermediate in which homologous contacts preceding strand exchange arise in the minor groove of the substrate dsdna
