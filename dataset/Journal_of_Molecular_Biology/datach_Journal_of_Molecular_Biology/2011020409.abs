nmr structure and calcium binding properties of the tellurite resistance protein terd from klebsiella pneumoniae
the tellurium oxyanion teo   has been used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by mycobacteria however many pathogenic bacteria show tellurite resistance several tellurite resistance genes have been identified and these genes mediate responses to diverse extracellular stimuli but the mechanisms underlying their functions are unknown to shed light on the function of kp terd a    kda tellurite resistance protein from a plasmid of klebsiella pneumoniae we have determined its three dimensional structure in solution using nmr spectroscopy kp terd contains a  sandwich formed by two five stranded  sheets and six short helices the structure exhibits two negative clusters in loop regions on the top of the sandwich suggesting that kp terd may bind metal ions indeed thermal denaturation experiments monitored by circular dichroism and nmr studies reveal that kp terd binds ca  inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy shows that the binding ratio of kp terd to ca  is   edta ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid titrations of ca  saturated kp terd monitored by one dimensional nmr yield estimated dissociation constants of   and   nm for the two ca  binding sites of kp terd nmr structures incorporating two ca  ions define a novel bipartite ca  binding motif that is predicted to be highly conserved in terd proteins moreover these ca  binding sites are also predicted to be present in two additional tellurite resistance proteins tere and terz these results suggest that some form of ca  signaling plays a crucial role in tellurite resistance and in other responses of bacteria to multiple external stimuli that depend on the ter genes
