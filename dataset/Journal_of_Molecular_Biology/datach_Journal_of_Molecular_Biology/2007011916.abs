conformation of the hiv  gag protein in solution
a single multi domain viral protein termed gag is sufficient for assembly of retrovirus like particles in mammalian cells we have purified the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  gag protein lacking myristate at its n terminus and the p domain at its c terminus from bacteria this protein is capable of assembly into virus like particles in a defined in vitro system we have reported that it is in monomer  dimer equilibrium in solution and have described a mutant gag protein that remains monomeric at high concentrations in solution we report that the mutant protein retains several properties of wild type gag this mutant enabled us to analyze solutions of monomeric protein hydrodynamic studies on the mutant protein showed that it is highly asymmetric with a frictional ratio of    small angle neutron scattering sans experiments confirmed its asymmetry and yielded an rg value of     atomic level structures of individual domains within gag have previously been determined but these domains are connected in gag by flexible linkers we constructed a series of models of the mutant gag protein based on these domain structures and tested each model computationally for its agreement with the experimental hydrodynamic and sans data the only models consistent with the data were those in which gag was folded over with its n terminal matrix domain near its c terminal nucleocapsid domain in three dimensional space since gag is a rod shaped molecule in the assembled immature virion these findings imply that gag undergoes a major conformational change upon virus assembly
