purification and characterisation of a soluble n terminal fragment of the breast cancer susceptibility protein brca
the brca gene encodes a large multidomain protein of   residues mutations in which lead to breast cancer studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which brca prevents tumour formation have been restricted by the size of the protein unable to purify large amounts of the full length protein we have identified a fragment of brca  amino acid residues      that when cloned into the expression vector pet  b and expressed in escherichia coli is found predominantly in the soluble portion of the cell lysate the resulting protein was purified to homogeneity and studies reveal that brca      binds specifically to four way junction dna when compared to duplex and single stranded dna
