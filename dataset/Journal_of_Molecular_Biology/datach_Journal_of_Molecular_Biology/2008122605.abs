roles of the n and c terminal domains of mammalian mitochondrial initiation factor  in protein biosynthesis
bacterial initiation factor  if  is organized into n and c domains separated by a linker mitochondrial if  if mt has a similar domain organization although both domains have extensions not found in the bacterial factors constructs of the n and c domains of if mt with and without the connecting linker were prepared the kd values for the binding of full length if mt and its c domain with and without the linker to mitochondrial  s subunits are     and   nm respectively indicating that much of the ribosome binding interactions are mediated by the c domain however the n domain binds to  s subunits with only a  fold lower affinity than full length if mt this observation indicates that the n domain of if mt has significant contacts with the protein rich small subunit of mammalian mitochondrial ribosomes the linker also plays a role in modulating the interactions between the  s subunit and the factor it is not just a physical connector between the two domains the presence of the two domains and the linker may optimize the overall affinity of if mt for the ribosome these results are in sharp contrast to observations with escherichia coli if  removal of the n domain drastically reduces the activity of if mt in the dissociation of mitochondrial  s ribosomes although the c domain itself retains some activity this residual activity depends significantly on the linker region the n domain alone has no effect on the dissociation of ribosomes full length if mt reduces the binding of fmet  trna to the  s subunit in the absence of mrna both the c terminal extension and the linker are required for this effect if mt promotes the formation of a binary complex between if mt and fmet  trna that may play an important role in mitochondrial protein synthesis both domains play a role promoting the formation of this complex
