ppr  is associated with polysomes in plant mitochondria
the function of pentatricopeptide repeat ppr proteins has been associated with various post transcriptional steps of organelle gene expression among them translation and its regulation are essential processes however in plant mitochondria they are also the steps of gene expression that are the least understood in this study ppr  was identified as part of a high molecular weight complex in arabidopsis mitochondria ppr  is an unusual representative of the large ppr family because it is relatively short and is characterised by a high expression level compared with other ppr proteins ppr  defines a small subgroup of eight class p ppr proteins that are similar in terms of motif organization among them ppr  like is the closest homolog of ppr   biochemical analysis has indicated that ppr  is a strictly mitochondrial protein extrinsically attached to the inner mitochondrial membrane and part of an rnase sensitive complex sucrose gradients and polysome destabilisation experiments show that ppr  is associated with ribosomes in plant mitochondria moreover in ppr    like mutants mitochondrial polysomes of lower molecular weight accumulate compared with wild type plants polysome association and these unusual features suggest that ppr  could be involved in a distinctive process possibly translation in plant mitochondria
