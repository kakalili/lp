supramodular nature of grip revealed by the structure of its pdz  tandem in complex with the carboxyl tail of fras
the scaffold protein grip  glutamate receptor interacting protein  binds to and regulates both the trafficking and membrane organization of a large number of transmembrane proteins mutation of grip in mice displays essentially the same phenotype of the mutations of fras or frem  which are the animal models of the human genetic disorder fraser syndrome however the molecular basis governing the interaction between grip and fras frem is unknown here we show that interaction between fras and grip requires the first two pdz domains pdz and pdz  to be connected in tandem as the folding of pdz strictly depends on the covalent attachment of pdz  the crystal structure of grip pdz  in complex with the fras c terminal peptide reveals that the pdz  tandem forms a supramodule in which only the peptide binding groove of pdz is bound with the fras peptide the grip pdz  fras peptide complex not only provides a mechanistic explanation of the link between grip and the fraser syndrome but may also serve as a foundation for searching for potential mutations in grip that could lead to the fraser syndrome
