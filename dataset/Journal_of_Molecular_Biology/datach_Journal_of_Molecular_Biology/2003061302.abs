compositional heterogeneity reflects partial dehydration in three dimensional crystals of bacteriorhodopsin
absorption fluorescence and excitation spectra of three dimensional bacteriorhodopsin crystals harvested from a lipidic cubic phase are presented the combination of the spectroscopic experiments performed at room temperature controlled ph and full external hydration reveals the presence of three distinct protein species besides the well known form observed in purple membrane we find two other species with a relative contribution of up to   as the spectra are similar to those of dehydrated or deionized membranes containing bacteriorhodopsin we suggest that amino acid residues located in the vicinity of the retinal chromophore have changed their protonation state we propose partial dehydration during crystallization and or room temperature conditions as the main source of this heterogeneity this assignment is supported by an experiment showing interconversion of the species upon intentional dehydration and by crystallographic data which have indicated an in plane unit cell in d crystals comparable to that of dehydrated bacteriorhodopsin membranes full hydration of the proteins after the water withdrawing crystallization process is hampered we suggest that this hindered water diffusion originates mainly from a closure of hydrophobic crystal surfaces by lipid bilayers the present spectroscopic work complements the crystallographic data due to its ability to determine quantitatively compositional heterogeneity resulting from proteins in different protonation states
