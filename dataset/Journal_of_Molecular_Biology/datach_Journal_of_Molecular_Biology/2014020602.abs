interaction of holoccme with ccmf in heme trafficking and cytochrome c biosynthesis
the periplasmic heme chaperone holoccme is essential for heme trafficking in the cytochrome c biosynthetic pathway in many bacteria archaea and plant mitochondria this pathway called system i involves two steps  i formation and release of holoccme by the abc transporter complex ccmabcd and ii delivery of the heme in holoccme to the putative cytochrome c heme lyase complex ccmfh ccmfh is believed to facilitate the final covalent attachment of heme from holoccme to the apocytochrome c although most models for system i propose that holoccme delivers heme directly to ccmf no interaction between holoccme and ccmf has been demonstrated here a complex between holoccme and ccmf is  trapped   purified and characterized holoccme must be released from the abc transporter complex ccmabcd to interact with ccmf and the holo form of ccme interacts with ccmf at levels at least  fold higher than apoccme two conserved histidines here termed p his and p his  in separate periplasmic loops in ccmf are required for interaction with holoccme and evidence that p his and p his function as heme binding ligands is presented these results show that heme in holoccme is essential for complex formation with ccmf and that the heme of holoccme is coordinated by p his and p his within the wwd domain of ccmf these features are strikingly similar to formation of the ccmc heme ccme ternary complex richard fogal c kranz rg the ccmc heme ccme complex in heme trafficking and cytochrome c biosynthesis j mol biol          and suggest common mechanistic and structural aspects
