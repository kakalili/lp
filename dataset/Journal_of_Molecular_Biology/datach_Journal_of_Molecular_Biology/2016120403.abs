in vitro reconstitution of a membrane switch mechanism for the polarity protein lgl
cell polarity arises from a combination of interactions between biological molecules such as activation inhibition and positive or negative feedback between specific polarity units activation and inhibition often take place in the form of a membrane binding switch lethal giant larvae lgl  a conserved regulator of cell polarity in animals was suggested to function as such a switch lgl localizes to both the cytoplasm and asymmetrically the membrane however the spatial regulation mechanism of lgl membrane localization has remained unclear for systematic elucidation we set out to reconstitute a minimal polarity unit using a model membrane caenorhabditis elegans lgl lgl   and atypical protein kinase c apkc supposed to activate the membrane switch we identified a membrane binding sequence mbs in lgl  by a screen in vivo reconstituted lgl  membrane binding in vitro and successfully implemented the membrane switch by apkc phosphorylation activity detaching lgl from membranes upon membrane binding lgl  mbs folds into an alpha helix in which three regions can be identified a positively charged patch a switch area containing the three apkc phosphorylation sites and a hydrophobic area probably buried in the membrane phosphorylation by apkc dramatically reduces the binding affinity of the lgl  mbs to negatively charged model membranes inducing its detachment specific residues in the mbs are critical for lgl  function in c elegans
