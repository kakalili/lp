a direct substrate  substrate interaction found in the kinase domain of the bifunctional enzyme  phosphofructo  kinase fructose   bisphosphatase
to understand the molecular basis of a phosphoryl transfer reaction catalyzed by the  phosphofructo  kinase domain of the hypoxia inducible bifunctional enzyme  phosphofructo  kinase fructose   bisphosphatase pfkfb  the crystal structures of pfkfb amppcpfructose  phosphate and pfkfb adpphosphoenolpyruvate complexes were determined to     and     resolution respectively kinetic studies on the wild type and site directed mutant proteins were carried out to confirm the structural observations the experimentally varied liganding states in the active pocket cause no significant conformational changes in the pseudo substrate complex a strong direct interaction between amppcp and fructose  phosphate fru  p is found by virtue of this direct substrate  substrate interaction fru  p is aligned with amppcp in an orientation and proximity most suitable for a direct transfer of the  phosphate moiety to  oh of fru  p the three key atoms involved in the phosphoryl transfer the    phosphate bridge oxygen atom the  phosphorus atom and the  oh group are positioned in a single line suggesting a direct phosphoryl transfer without formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate in addition the distance between  oh and  phosphorus allows the  phosphate oxygen atoms to serve as a general base catalyst to induce an  associative  phosphoryl transfer mechanism the site directed mutant study and inhibition kinetics suggest that this reaction will be catalyzed most efficiently by the protein when the substrates bind to the active pocket in an ordered manner in which atp binds first
