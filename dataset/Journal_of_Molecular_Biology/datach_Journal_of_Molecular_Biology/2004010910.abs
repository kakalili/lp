the structure of mycobacterium tuberculosis mpt  fbpc  defines a new family of non catalytic    hydrolases
mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis is known to secrete a number of highly immunogenic proteins that are thought to confer pathogenicity in part by mediating binding to host tissues among these secreted proteins are the trimeric antigen   ag  complex and the related mpt  protein also known as fbpc  while the physiological function of ag  a mycolyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of the cell wall component     trehalose dimycolate or cord factor  has been identified recently the function of the closely related mpt      identity with the ag  components remains to be established the crystal structure of m tuberculosis mpt  determined to    resolution shows that mpt  like the ag  components ag b and ag c  folds as an    hydrolase but it does not contain any of the catalytic elements required for mycolyltransferase activity moreover the absence of a recognizable     trehalose monomycolate binding site and the failure to detect an active site suggest that the function of mpt  is of a non enzymatic nature and that mpt  may in fact represent a new family of non catalytic    hydrolases previous experimental evidence and the structural similarity to some integrins and carbohydrate binding proteins led to the hypothesis that mpt  might have a role in host tissue attachment whereby ligands may include the serum protein fibronectin and small sugars
