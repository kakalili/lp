nucleotide dependent monomer dimer equilibrium of opuaa the nucleotide binding protein of the osmotically regulated abc transporter opua from bacillus subtilis
the opua system of bacillus subtilis is a member of the substrate binding protein dependent abc transporter superfamily and serves for the uptake of the compatible solute glycine betaine under hyperosmotic growth conditions here we have characterized the nucleotide binding protein opuaa of the b subtilis opua transporter in vitro opuaa was overexpressed heterologously in escherichia coli as a hexahistidine tag fusion protein and purified to homogeneity by affinity and size exclusion chromatography sec  dynamic monomer dimer equilibrium was observed for opuaa and the kd value was determined to be   m under high ionic strength assay conditions the monomer dimer interconversion was diminished which enabled separation of both species by sec and separate analysis of both monomeric and dimeric opuaa in the presence of  m nacl monomeric opuaa showed a basal atpase activity km   mm k   min    whereas dimeric opuaa showed little atpase activity under this condition the addition of nucleotides influenced the monomer dimer ratio of opuaa demonstrating different oligomeric states during its catalytic cycle the monomer was the preferred species under post hydrolysis conditions e g adp mg   whereas the dimer dominated the nucleotide free and atp bound states the affinity and stoichiometry of monomeric or dimeric opuaa atp complexes were determined by means of the fluorescent atp analog tnp  atp one molecule of tnp  atp was bound in the monomeric state and two tnp  atp molecules were detected in the dimeric state of opuaa binding of tnp  adp mg  to dimeric opuaa induced a conformational change that led to the decay of the dimer on the basis of our data we propose a model that couples changes in the oligomeric state of opuaa with atp hydrolysis
