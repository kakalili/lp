from structure to function insights into the catalytic substrate specificity and thermostability displayed by bacillus subtilis mannanase bcman
bcman a  mannanase from the plant root beneficial bacterium bacillus subtilis z  has a potential to be used in the production of mannooligosaccharide which shows defense induction activity on both melon and tobacco and plays an important role in the biological control of plant disease here we report the biochemical properties and crystal structure of bcman gh  enzyme kinetic analysis reveals that bcman is an endo  mannanase specific for mannan and has no activity on mannooligosaccharides the catalytic acid base glu  and nucleophile glu  are positioned on the   and   strands respectively the     crystal structure reveals that bcman is a typical     folding type one large difference from the saddle shaped active center of other endo  mannanases is the presence of a shallow dish shaped active center and substrate binding site that are both unique to bcman these differences are mainly due to important changes in the length and position of loop  phe  met   loop  ser  ala   loop  phe  asn   loop  tyr  ile   loop  pro  tyr   and loop  trp  gly   all of which surround the active site data from isothermal titration calorimetry and crystallography indicated only two substrate binding subsites   and    within the active site of bcman these two sites are involved in the enzyme s mannan degradation activity and in restricting the binding capacity for mannooligosaccharides binding and catalysis of bcman to mannan is mediated mainly by a surface containing a strip of solvent exposed aromatic rings of trp   trp   trp   and trp  additionally bcman contains a disulfide bond cys cys  and a special his his  glu  metal binding site this secondary structure is a key factor in the enzyme s stability
