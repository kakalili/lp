membrane transferring sequences of the hiv  gp  ectodomain assemble into an immunogenic complex
the membrane proximal stem region of gp  has been postulated to host the two conserved membrane transferring domains that promote hiv  fusion the amino terminal fusion peptide fp and the highly aromatic pre transmembrane sequence our results confirm that the hydrophobic fp and membrane proximal sequences come into contact and form structurally defined complexes these complexes are immunogenic and evoke responses in rabbits that compete with the recognition of native functional gp  by the f monoclonal antibody we conclude that co assembly of the fp and the pre transmembrane sequences might exert a constraint that helps maintain a gp  stem region pre fusion structure
