the fgfr d domain determines receptor selectivity for fibroblast growth factor
fgf  is a member of a unique subfamily of fibroblast growth factors that function as endocrine hormones and regulate a variety of metabolic activities unlike paracrine fgfs fgf  does not bind heparin and requires  klotho as a co receptor to activate fgfr signaling in the presence of  klotho fgf  is able to activate fgfrs c  c and c but not fgfr  chimeric fgfr c fgfr receptors were constructed to identify domains that confer this specificity and to understand regions important for fgf  induced receptor activation with these chimeras we showed that domain  of the fgfr c extracellular domain plays a critical role in specificity determination and receptor activation by fgf  furthermore we were able to narrow down the sequences important for this function to a six amino acid region within domain  of fgfr c it is interesting to note that this region falls into the  c   e loop which has been shown to be important for receptor specificity determination in paracrine fgfs suggesting a common principle in both endocrine and paracrine fgf receptor interaction and activation
