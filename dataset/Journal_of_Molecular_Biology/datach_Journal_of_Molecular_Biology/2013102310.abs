steric complementarity in the decoding center is important for trna selection by the ribosome
accurate trna selection by the ribosome is essential for the synthesis of functional proteins previous structural studies indicated that the ribosome distinguishes between cognate and near cognate trnas by monitoring the geometry of the codon  anticodon helix in the decoding center using the universally conserved  s ribosomal rna bases g   a   and a   these bases form hydrogen bonds with the   hydroxyl groups of the codon  anticodon helix which are expected to be disrupted with a near cognate codon  anticodon helix however a recent structural study showed that g   a   and a   form hydrogen bonds in a manner identical with that of both cognate and near cognate codon  anticodon helices to understand how the ribosome discriminates between cognate and near cognate trnas we made   deoxynucleotide and   fluoro substituted mrnas which disrupt the hydrogen bonds between the a site codon and g   a   and a   our results show that multiple   deoxynucleotide substitutions in the mrna substantially inhibit trna selection whereas multiple   fluoro substitutions in the mrna have only modest effects on trna selection furthermore the miscoding antibiotics paromomycin and streptomycin rescue the defects in trna selection with the multiple   deoxynucleotide substituted mrna these results suggest that steric complementarity in the decoding center is more important than the hydrogen bonds between the a site codon and g   a   and a   for trna selection
