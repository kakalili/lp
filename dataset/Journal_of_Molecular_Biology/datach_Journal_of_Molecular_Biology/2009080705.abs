mannan binding lectin structure oligomerization and flexibility studied by atomic force microscopy
mannan binding lectin mbl is the archetypical pathogen recognition molecule of the innate immune defense upon binding to microorganisms reactions leading to the destruction of the offender ensue mbl is an oligomer of structural subunits each composed of three identical polypeptides we used atomic force microscopy to reveal tertiary and quaternary structures of mbl the images in both air and buffer show a quaternary structure best described as  sertiform   that is a hub from which the subunits fan out the dimensions conform to those calculated from primary and secondary structures the subunits associate with a preferred angle of   between them this angle is stable with respect to the degree of oligomerization for mbl of four subunits or more due to an interruption in the collagenous sequence the arms of the subunits are expected to form a kink we find that    of the subunits are kinked and the kink angle distributed quite broadly around    the conformation and flexibility of the mbl molecule that we observe differ distinctly from the popular view of a  bouquet like  configuration as that found for related members of the complement system such as c q this structural information will further the understanding of the specific functioning of the mbl pathway of complement activation
