glycosaminoglycans gags suppress the toxicity of hypf n prefibrillar aggregates
a group of diverse human pathologies is associated with proteins unable to retain their native state and convert into prefibrillar and fibrillar amyloid aggregates that are then deposited in the extracellular space glycosaminoglycans gags have been found to physically associate with these deposits and also to promote their formation in vitro however the effect of gags on the toxicity of these aggregates has been investigated in only one protein system the amyloid  peptide associated with alzheimer s disease in this study we investigate whether gags affect the toxicity of the n terminal domain of escherichia coli hypf hypf n oligomers on chinese hamster ovarian cells and the mechanism by which such suppression is mediated the results show that heparin and other gags inhibit the toxicity observed by hypf n oligomers in a dose dependent manner gags were not found to bind preformed hypf n oligomers change their morphological and structural characteristics or disaggregate them nevertheless they were found to bind to the cells surface and prevent the interaction of the oligomers with the cells overall the results indicate that gags have a generic ability to inhibit the toxicity of aberrant protein oligomers and that such toxicity suppression can occur through different mechanisms such as through binding to the oligomers with consequent loss of interaction of the oligomers to the gags present on the cell surface as proposed previously for amyloid  aggregates or through mechanisms independent of direct gag  oligomer binding as shown here for hypf n aggregates
