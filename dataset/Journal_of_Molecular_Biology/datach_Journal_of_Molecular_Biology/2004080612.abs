avian reovirus morphogenesis occurs within viral factories and begins with the selective recruitment of  ns and  a to  ns inclusions
we have recently shown that the avian reovirus non structural protein  ns forms cytoplasmic inclusions in transfected cells and recruits  ns to these structures in the present study we further demonstrate that  ns mediates the association of the major core protein  a but not of  a or  c with inclusions indicating that the recruitment of viral proteins into avian reovirus factories has specificity thus some proteins appear to be initially recruited to factories by association with  ns whereas others are recruited subsequently through interaction with as yet unknown factors we next used metabolic pulse chase radiolabeling combined with cell fractionation and antibody immunoprecipitation to study the recruitment of newly synthesized viral polypeptides into viral factories and virus particles the results of this combined approach revealed that avian reovirus morphogenesis is a complex and temporally controlled process that takes place exclusively within globular viral factories that are not microtubule associated our findings further suggest that cores are assembled within the first  minutes after the synthesis of their polypeptide components and that reovirion morphogenesis is completed over the next  minutes by the subsequent addition of outer capsid proteins
