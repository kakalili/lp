interactions between activating region  of the escherichia coli cyclic amp receptor protein and region  of the rna polymerase   subunit application of suppression genetics edited by r ebright
the escherichia coli cyclic amp receptor protein crp induces transcription at class ii crp dependent promoters by making three different activatory contacts with different surfaces of holo rna polymerase one contact surface of crp known as activating region  ar  is functional in the downstream subunit of the crp dimer and is predicted to interact with region  of the rnap   subunit we have previously shown that a mutant crp derivative that activates transcription primarily via ar  crp hl  ke  kn  requires the positively charged residues k   k  and r  in   for activation here we have used the positive control substitution ek  to disrupt ar dependent activation by crp hl  ke  kn  we then screened random mutant libraries and an alanine scan library of   for candidates that restore activation by crp hl  ke  kn  ek  we found that changes at r  and r  in   can restore activation by crp hl  ke  kn  ek  this suggests that the side chains of both r  and r  in   clash with k  in crp maximal activation by crp hl  ke  kn  ek  is achieved with the substitutions re  or rd  in    we propose that there are specific charge charge interactions between e  or d  in   and k  in ar  thus no increase in activation is observed in the presence of another positive control substitution eg  crp hl  ke  kn  eg   similarly both   re  and   rd  can restore activation by crp ek  but not crp eg  and they both decrease activation by wild type crp we suggest that e  and d  in   can positively interact with k  in ar  thereby enhancing activation but negatively interact with e  thereby decreasing activation the substitution ka  in ar increases class ii crp dependent activation by removing an inhibitory lysine residue however this increase is not observed in the presence of either   re  or   rd   we conclude that the inhibitory side chain k  in ar  clashes with r  in    finally we show that the   re  and rd  substitutions affect crp dependent activation from class ii but not class i promoters
