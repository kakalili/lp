the ribosomal stalk binds to translation factors if  ef tu ef g and rf via a conserved region of the l  c terminal domain
efficient protein synthesis in bacteria requires initiation factor  if  elongation factors tu ef tu and g ef g  and release factor  rf  each of which catalyzes a major step of translation in a gtp dependent fashion previous reports have suggested that recruitment of factors to the ribosome and subsequent gtp hydrolysis involve the dimeric protein l  which forms a flexible  stalk  on the ribosome using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy we demonstrate that l  binds directly to the factors if  ef tu ef g and rf from escherichia coli and map the region of l  involved in these interactions factor dependent chemical shift changes show that all four factors bind to the same region of the c terminal domain of l  this region includes three strictly conserved residues k  l  and e  and a set of highly conserved residues including v  a  v  and g  upon factor binding all nmr signals from the c terminal domain become broadened beyond detection while those from the n terminal domain are virtually unaffected implying that the c terminal domain binds to the factor while the n terminal domain dimer retains its rotational freedom mediated by the flexible hinge between the two domains factor dependent variations in linewidths further reveal that l  binds to each factor with a dissociation constant in the millimolar range in solution these results indicate that the l  factor complexes will be highly populated on the ribosome because of the high local concentration of ribosome bound factor with respect to l
