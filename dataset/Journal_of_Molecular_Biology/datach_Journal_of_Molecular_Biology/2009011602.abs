structural base for enzymatic cyclodextrin hydrolysis
cyclodextrins resist hydrolysis by burying all bridge oxygens at their interior still the rings can be opened by a small group of specialized enzymes the cyclomaltodextrinases among them the enzyme from flavobacterium sp no   was mutated crystallized and soaked with cyclodextrins giving rise to four complex structures one of them showed an  cyclodextrin at the outer rim of the active center pocket in the other complexes     and  cyclodextrins were bound in a competent mode in the active center the structures suggest that arg  functions as a chaperone guiding the substrates from the solvent into the active center over the last part of this pathway the cyclodextrins bump on phe   which rotates the glucosyl group at subsite   by about    and fixes it in the new conformation this induced fit was observed with all three major cyclodextrins it makes the bridging oxygen between subsites   and    available for protonation by glu   which starts the hydrolysis the mechanism resembles a spring lock the structural data were supplemented by activity measurements quantifying the initial ring opening reaction for the major cyclodextrins and the transglucosylation activity for maltotetraose further activity data were collected for mutants splitting the tetrameric enzyme into dimers and for active center mutants
