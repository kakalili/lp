hairpin stability and folding molecular dynamics studies of the first  hairpin of tendamistat edited by a r fersht
the stability and un folding of the  residue peptide scvtlyqswrysqadngca corresponding to the first  hairpin residues  to   of the  amylase inhibitor tendamistat pdb entry ait has been studied by molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water under periodic boundary conditions at several temperatures   k   k and   k  starting from various conformations for simulation lengths ranging from  to  ns comparison of trajectories of the reduced and oxidized native peptides reveals the importance of the disulphide bridge closing the  hairpin in maintaining a proper turn conformation thereby insuring a proper side chain arrangement of the conserved turn residues this allows rationalization of the conservation of those cysteine residues among the family of  amylase inhibitors high temperature simulations starting from widely different initial configurations native  hairpin   and left handed helical and extended conformations begin sampling similar regions of the conformational space within tens of nanoseconds and both native and non native  hairpin conformations are recovered transitions between conformational clusters are accompanied by an increase in energy fluctuations which is consistent with the increase in heat capacity measured experimentally upon protein folding the folding events observed in the various simulations support a model for  hairpin formation in which the turn is formed first followed by hydrogen bond formation closing the hairpin and subsequent stabilization by side chain hydrophobic interactions
