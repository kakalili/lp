galectin  interactions with glycosphingolipids
galectins have essential roles in pathological states including cancer inflammation angiogenesis and microbial infections endogenous receptors include members of the lacto and neolacto series glycosphingolipids present on mammalian cells and contain the tetrasaccharides lacto n tetraose lnt and lacto n neotetraose lnnt that form their core structural components and also ganglio series glycosphingolipids we present crystallographic structures of the carbohydrate recognition domain of human galectin  both wild type and a mutant k  l that influenced ligand affinity in complex with lnt lnnt and acetamido ganglioside a gm     sialyllactose  key structural features revealed include galectin  s demonstration of a binding mode towards gangliosides distinct from that to the lacto neolacto glycosphingolipids with its capacity for recognising the core  galactoside region being challenged when the core oligosaccharide epitope of ganglio series glycosphingolipids gm  is embedded within particular higher molecular weight glycans the lacto and neolacto glycosphingolipids revealed different orientations of their terminal galactose in the galectin  bound lnt and lnnt structures that has significant ramifications for the capacity of galectin  to interact with higher order lacto neolacto series glycosphingolipids such as abh blood group antigens and the hnk  antigen that is common on leukocytes lnnt also presents an important model for poly n acetyllactosamine containing glycans and provides insight into galectin  s accommodation of extended oligosaccharides such as the poly n acetyllactosamine modified n and o glycans that via galectin  interaction facilitate progression of lung and bladder cancers respectively these findings provide the first atomic detail of galectin  s interactions with the core structures of mammalian glycosphingolipids providing information important in understanding the capacity of galectin  to engage with receptors identified as facilitators of major disease
