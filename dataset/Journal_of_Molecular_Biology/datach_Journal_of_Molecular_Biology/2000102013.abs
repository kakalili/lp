identification of an allosteric anion binding site on o acetylserine sulfhydrylase structure of the enzyme with chloride bound edited by r huber
a new crystal structure of o acetylserine sulfhydrylase oass has been solved with chloride bound at an allosteric site and sulfate bound at the active site the bound anions result in a new  inhibited  conformation that differs from the  open  native or  closed  external aldimine conformations the allosteric site is located at the oass dimer interface the new inhibited structure involves a change in the position of the  moveable domain   residues     to a location that differs from that in the open or closed forms formation of the external aldimine with substrate is stabilized by interaction of the  carboxyl group of the substrate with a substrate binding loop that is part of the moveable domain the inhibited conformation prevents the substrate binding loop from interacting with the  carboxyl group and hinders formation of the external schiff base and thus subsequent chemistry chloride may be an analog of sulfide the physiological inhibitor finally these results suggest that oass represents a new class of plp dependent enzymes that is regulated by small anions
