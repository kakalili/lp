definition of transcriptional promoters in the human  globin locus control region
our previous studies on the human  globin gene cluster revealed the presence of intergenic transcripts throughout the locus and demonstrated that transcription of the locus control region lcr initiates within an erv endogenous retroviral long terminal repeat ltr upstream of dnase i hypersensitive site  we show using a combination of assays that there are additional sites of transcription initiation within the lcr at hypersensitive sites  and  we have defined sites of transcription initiation which occurs at discrete positions in a direction towards the globin genes in addition we show that mutation of specific transcription factor binding sites within hs leads to a reduction in transcription levels from within this site we propose that these initiation events within the lcr can account for the observed orientation dependence of lcr function and contribute to the open chromatin configuration of the  globin locus in addition transcription from within the lcr hypersensitive sites could compensate for the absence of the erv ltr in many transgenic mice lines which nevertheless regulate their globin clusters correctly
