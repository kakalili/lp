the crystal structure of human cytosolic  glucosidase unravels the substrate aglycone specificity of a family  glycoside hydrolase
human cytosolic  glucosidase hcbg is a xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme that hydrolyses certain flavonoid glucosides with specificity depending on the aglycone moiety the type of sugar and the linkage between them in this study the substrate preference of this enzyme was investigated by mutational analysis x ray crystallography and homology modelling the crystal structure of hcbg was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined at     resolution the main chain fold of the enzyme belongs to the     barrel structure which is common to family  glycoside hydrolases the active site is located at the bottom of a pocket about    deep formed by large surface loops surrounding the c termini of the barrel of  strands as for all the clan of gh a enzymes the two catalytic glutamate residues are located on strand  the acid base glu   and on strand  the nucleophile glu   although many features of hcbg were shown to be very similar to previously described enzymes from this family crucial differences were observed in the surface loops surrounding the aglycone binding site and these are likely to strongly influence the substrate specificity the positioning of a substrate molecule quercetin   glucoside by homology modelling revealed that hydrophobic interactions dominate the binding of the aglycone moiety in particular val   trp   phe   phe   phe  and phe  were identified as likely to be important in determining substrate specificity in hcbg and site directed mutagenesis supported a key role for some of these residues
