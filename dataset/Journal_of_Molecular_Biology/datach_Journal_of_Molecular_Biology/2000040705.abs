sequences in   region i required for binding to early melted dna and their involvement in sigma dna isomerisation edited by j karn
the bacterial   rna polymerase functions in a transcription activation mechanism that fully relies upon nucleotide hydrolysis by an enhancer binding activator protein to stimulate open complex formation here we describe results of dna binding assays used to probe the role of the   amino terminal region i in activation of the  region i alanine substitution mutants assayed several specifically failed to bind to a dna structure representing an early conformation in dna melting the same mutants are defective in activated transcription and in forming an isomerised sigma dna complex on the early opened dna the mechanism of activation may therefore require tight binding of   to particular early melted dna structures where mutant   binding to early melted dna was detected activator dependent isomerisation generally occurred as efficiently as with the wild type protein suggesting that certain region i sequences are largely uninvolved in sigma isomerisation dna binding sigma isomerisation and transcription activation assays allow formulation of a functional map of region i
