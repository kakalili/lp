crystal structure and novel recognition motif of rho adp ribosylating c exoenzyme from clostridium botulinum structural insights for recognition specificity and catalysis edited by d rees
clostridium botulinum c exoenzyme inactivates the small gtp binding protein family rho by adp ribosylating asparagine   which depolymerizes the actin cytoskeleton c thus represents a major family of the bacterial toxins that transfer the adp ribose moiety of nad to specific amino acids in acceptor proteins to modify key biological activities in eukaryotic cells including protein synthesis differentiation transformation and intracellular signaling the    resolution c exoenzyme structure establishes the conserved features of the core nad binding  sandwich fold with other adp ribosylating toxins despite little sequence conservation importantly the central core of the c exoenzyme structure is distinguished by the absence of an active site loop observed in many other adp ribosylating toxins unlike the adp ribosylating toxins that possess the active site loop near the central core the c exoenzyme replaces the active site loop with an  helix    moreover structural and sequence similarities with the catalytic domain of vegetative insecticidal protein  vip  an actin adp ribosyltransferase unexpectedly implicates two adjacent protruding turns which join   and   of the toxin core fold as a novel recognition specificity motif for this newly defined toxin family turn  evidently positions the solvent exposed aromatic side chain of phe  to interact with the hydrophobic region of rho adjacent to its gtp binding site turn  evidently both places the gln  side chain for hydrogen bonding to recognize rho asn  for nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon of nad ribose and holds the key glu  catalytic side chain in the adjacent catalytic pocket this proposed bipartite adp ribosylating toxin turn turn artt motif places the vip and c toxin classes into a single artt family characterized by analogous target protein recognition via turn  aromatic and turn  hydrogen bonding side chain moieties turn  centrally anchors the catalytic glu  within the artt motif and furthermore distinguishes the c toxin class by a conserved turn  gln and the vip binary toxin class by a conserved turn  glu for appropriate target side chain hydrogen bonding recognition taken together these structural results provide a molecular basis for understanding the coupled activity and recognition specificity for c and for the newly defined artt toxin family which acts in the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton this   to   region of the toxin fold represents an experimentally testable and potentially general recognition motif region for other adp ribosylating toxins that have a similar  structure framework
