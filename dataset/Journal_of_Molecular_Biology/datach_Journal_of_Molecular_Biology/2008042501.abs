peptide based interactions with calnexin target misassembled membrane proteins into endoplasmic reticulum derived multilamellar bodies
oligomeric assembly of neurotransmitter transporters is a prerequisite for their export from the endoplasmic reticulum er and their subsequent delivery to the neuronal synapse we previously identified mutations e g  in the  aminobutyric acid gaba transporter  gat  which disrupted assembly and caused retention of the transporter in the er using one representative mutant gat e  d we showed here that er retention was due to association of the transporter with the er chaperone calnexin interaction with calnexin led to accumulation of gat in concentric bodies corresponding to previously described multilamellar er derived structures the transmembrane domain of calnexin was necessary and sufficient to direct the protein into these concentric bodies both yellow fluorescent protein tagged versions of wild type gat and of the gat e  d mutant remained in disperse i e  non aggregated form in these concentric bodies because fluorescence recovered rapidly t      ms upon photobleaching fluorescence energy resonance transfer microscopy was employed to visualize a tight interaction of gat e  d with calnexin recognition by calnexin occurred largely in a glycan independent manner and at least in part at the level of the transmembrane domain our findings are consistent with a model in which the transmembrane segment of calnexin participates in chaperoning the inter and intramolecular arrangement of hydrophobic segment in oligomeric proteins
