evidence of a thermal unfolding dimeric intermediate for the escherichia coli histone like hu proteins thermodynamics and structure
the escherichia coli histone like hu protein pool is composed of three dimeric forms two homodimers echu  and echu   and a heterodimer echu   the relative abundance of these dimeric forms varies during cell growth and in response to environmental changes suggesting that each dimer plays different physiological roles here differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism cd were used to study the thermal stability of the three e coli hu dimers and show that each of them has its own thermodynamic signature unlike the other hu proteins studied so far which melt through a single step n   d  this present thermodynamic study shows that the three e coli dimers melt according to a two step mechanism n  i   d  the native dimer n  melts partially into a dimeric intermediate i  which in turn yields the unfolded monomers d in addition the crystal structure of the echu  dimer has been solved comparative thermodynamic and structural analysis between echu  and the hu homodimer from bacillus stearothermophilus suggests that the e coli dimer is constituted by two subdomains of different energetic properties the cd study indicates that the intermediate i  corresponds to an hu dimer having partly lost its  helices the partially unfolded dimer i is unable to complex with high affinity single stranded break containing dna these structural thermodynamic and functional results suggest that the n  i equilibrium plays a central role in the physiology of e coli hu the i molecular species seems to be the echu  preferential conformation possibly related to its role in the e coli cold shock adaptation besides i might be required in e coli for the hu chain exchange which allows the heterodimer formation from homodimers
