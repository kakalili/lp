amyloidogenic unfolding intermediates differentiate sheep prion protein variants
sheep is a unique example among mammalian species to present a strong correlation between genotype and prion disease susceptibility phenotype indeed a well defined set of prp polymorphisms at positions     and   sheep numbering govern scrapie susceptibility ranging from very high susceptibility for v  r  q  variant vrq to resistance for a  r  r  variant arr to get better insight into the molecular mechanisms of scrapie susceptibility resistance the unfolding pathways of the different full length recombinant sheep prion protein variants were analysed by differential scanning calorimetry in a wide range of ph in the ph range      thermal unfolding occurs through a reversible one step process while at ph lt   and gt   unfolding intermediates are formed which are stable in the temperature range     c while these general behaviours are shared by all variants vrq and arq susceptibility variants show higher thermal stability than ahq and arr resistance variants and the formation of their unfolding intermediates requires higher activation energy than in the case of ahq and arr furthermore secondary structures of the unfolding intermediates differentiate variants arr unfolding intermediate exhibits random coil structure contrasting with the  sheet structure of vrq and arq unfolding intermediates the rate of the unfolding intermediate formation allows us to classify genetic variants along increasing scrapie susceptibility at ph   vrq and arq rates being the highest rather poor correlation is observed at ph   upon cooling these intermediates refold into stable species which are rich in  type secondary structures and as revealed by thioflavin t fluorescence and electron microscopy share amyloid characteristics these results highlight the prion protein plasticity genetically modulated in sheep and might provide a molecular basis for sheep predisposition to scrapie taking into account both thermodynamic stability and transconformation rate of prion protein
