Protein targeting into mitochondria from the cytoplasm is fundamental to the cell biology of all eukaryotes. Our understanding of this process is heavily biased towards “model” organisms, such as animals and fungi, and it is less clear how conserved this process is throughout diverse eukaryotes. In this study, we have surveyed mitochondrial protein sorting signals from a representative of the dinoflagellate algae. Dinoflagellates are a phylum belonging to the group Alveolata, which also includes apicomplexan parasites and ciliates. We generated 46 mitochondrial gene sequences from the dinoflagellate Karlodinium micrum and analysed these for mitochondrial sorting signals. Most of the sequences contain predicted N-terminal peptide extensions that conform to mitochondrial targeting peptides from animals and fungi in terms of length, amino acid composition, and propensity to form amphipathic α-helices. The remainder lack predicted mitochondrial targeting peptides and represent carrier proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane that have internal targeting signals in model eukaryotes. We tested for functional conservation of the dinoflagellate mitochondrial sorting signals by expressing K. micrum mitochondrial proteins in the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both the N-terminal and internal targeting signals were sufficiently conserved to operate in this distantly related system. This study indicates that the character of mitochondrial sorting signals was well established prior to the radiation of major eukaryotic lineages and has shown remarkable conservation during long periods of evolution.
