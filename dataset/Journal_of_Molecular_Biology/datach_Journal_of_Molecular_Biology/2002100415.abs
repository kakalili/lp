a cytochrome b origin of photosynthetic reaction centers an evolutionary link between respiration and photosynthesis
the evolutionary origin of photosynthetic reaction centers has long remained elusive here we use sequence and structural analysis to demonstrate an evolutionary link between the cytochrome b subunit of the cytochrome bc complex and the core polypeptides of the photosynthetic bacterial reaction center in particular we have identified an area of significant sequence similarity between a three contiguous membrane spanning domain of cytochrome b which contains binding sites for two hemes and a three contiguous membrane spanning domain in the photosynthetic reaction center core subunits which contains binding sites for cofactors such as bacterio chlorophylls  bacterio pheophytin and a non heme iron three of the four heme ligands in cytochrome b are found to be conserved with the cofactor ligands in the reaction center polypeptides since cytochrome b and reaction center polypeptides both bind tetrapyrroles and quinones for electron transfer the observed sequence functional and structural similarities can best be explained with the assumption of a common evolutionary origin statistical analysis further supports a distant but significant homologous relationship on the basis of previous evolutionary analyses that established a scenario that respiration evolved prior to photosynthesis we consider it likely that cytochrome b is the evolutionary precursor for type ii reaction center apoproteins with a structural analysis confirming a common evolutionary origin of both type i and type ii reaction centers we further propose a novel  reaction center apoprotein early  hypothesis to account for the development of photosynthetic reaction center holoproteins
