a novel dimer interface and conformational changes revealed by an x ray structure of b subtilis seca
the seca atpase moves polypeptides post translationally across the plasma membrane of eubacteria but the mechanism of transport is still unclear we describe the crystal structure of a novel dimeric form of bacillus subtilis seca dimerization of seca occurs at the prominent groove formed by the nucleotide binding domain  nbd  and the preprotein cross linking ppx domain the dimer interface is very large burying approximately      of solvent accessible surface per monomer single cysteine disulfide cross linking shows the presence of this novel seca dimer in solution in addition other dimers also exist in solution arguing that they all are in equilibrium with monomeric seca and supporting the idea that the monomer may be the functional species dimerization of seca causes an  helix of one subunit to convert to a short  strand that participates in  sheet formation with strands in the other subunit this conversion of secondary structure elements occurs close to the connection between the nbd and ppx domains a potential site of interaction with translocation substrate comparing the different x ray structures of b subtilis seca suggests that small changes in the nucleotide binding domains could be amplified via helix  of the helical scaffold domain hsd to generate larger movements of the domains involved in polypeptide binding
