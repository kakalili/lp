solution structure and dynamics of the dna binding domain of the adipocyte transcription factor freac   edited by p e wright
transcription factors of the forkhead type share a highly conserved dna binding domain of about   amino acid residues freac   expressed in adipocytes belongs to this class here we report on nmr studies that established the three dimensional structure of the freac   dna binding domain although apparent similarities to the structures of other members within the forkhead family are observed the structure also reveals some remarkable differences along with the complementary dynamics the data provide insight into the fundamentals of sequence specificity within a highly conserved motif
