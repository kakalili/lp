the highly repetitive region of the helicobacter pylori cagy protein comprises tandem arrays of an  helical repeat module
the cag pathogenicity island encoded type iv secretion system of helicobacter pylori functions to translocate the effector protein caga directly through the plasma membrane of gastric epithelial cells similar to other secretion systems the cag type iv secretion system elaborates a surface filament structure which is unusually sheathed by the large cag pathogenicity island encoded protein cagy cagy is distinguished by unusual amino acid composition and extensive repetitive sequence organised into two defined repeat regions the second and major repeat region cagyrpt  has a regular disposition of six repetitive motifs which are subject to deletion and duplication facilitating the generation of cagy size and phenotypic variants in this study we show cagyrpt to comprise two highly thermostable and acid stable  helical structural motifs the most abundant of which motif a occurs in tandem arrays of one to six repeats terminally flanked by single copies of the second repeat motif b  isolated motifs demonstrate hetero and homomeric interactions suggesting a propensity for uniform assembly of discrete structural subunit motifs within the larger cagyrpt structure consistent with this cagy proteins comprising substantially different repeat  motif organisations demonstrate equivalent caga translocation competence illustrating a remarkable structural and functional tolerance for precise deletion and duplication of motif subunits we provide the first insight into the structural basis for cagyrpt assembly that accommodates both the variable motif sequence composition and the extensive contraction expansion of repeat modules within the cagyrpt region
