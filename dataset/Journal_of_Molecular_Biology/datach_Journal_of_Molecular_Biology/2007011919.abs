the folding pathway of t lysozyme the high resolution structure and folding of a hidden intermediate
folding intermediates have been detected and characterized for many proteins however their structures at atomic resolution have only been determined for two small single domain proteins rd apocytochrome b  and engrailed homeo domain t lysozyme has two easily distinguishable but energetically coupled domains the n and c terminal domains an early native state hydrogen exchange experiment identified an intermediate with the c terminal domain folded and the n terminal domain unfolded we have used a native state hydrogen exchange directed protein engineering approach to populate this intermediate and demonstrated that it is on the folding pathway and exists after the rate limiting step here we determined its high resolution structure and the backbone dynamics by multi dimensional nmr methods we also characterized the folding behavior of the intermediate using stopped flow fluorescence protein engineering and native state hydrogen exchange unlike the folding intermediates of the two single domain proteins which have many non native side chain interactions the structure of the hidden folding intermediate of t lysozyme is largely native like it folds like many small single domain proteins these results have implications for understanding the folding mechanism and evolution of multi domain proteins
