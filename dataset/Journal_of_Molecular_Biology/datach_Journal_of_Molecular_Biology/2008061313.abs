effect of lipid composition on the topography of membrane associated hydrophobic helices stabilization of transmembrane topography by anionic lipids
to investigate the effect of lipid structure upon the membrane topography of hydrophobic helices the behavior of hydrophobic peptides was studied in model membrane vesicles to define topography fluorescence and fluorescence quenching methods were used to determine the location of a trp at the center of the hydrophobic sequence for peptides with cationic residues flanking the hydrophobic sequence the stability of the transmembrane tm configuration relative to a membrane bound non tm state increased as a function of lipid composition on the order    mol mol  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine popc  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphoethanolamine    popc cholesterol lt popc  dioleoylphosphatidylcholine dopc lt   dioleoyl sn glycero  phospho rac  glycerol  sodium salt dopg    dioleoyl sn glycero  phospho l serine sodium salt dops  indicating that the anionic lipids dopg and dops most strongly stabilized the tm configuration tm stabilization was near maximal at     mol anionic lipid which are physiologically relevant values tm stabilization by anionic lipid was observed for hydrophobic sequences with a diverse set of sequences including polyala  diverse lengths from  to  residues  and various cationic flanking residues h r or k  but not when the flanking residues were uncharged tm stabilization by anionic lipid was also dependent on the number of cationic residues flanking the hydrophobic sequence but was still significant with only one cationic residue flanking each end of the peptide these observations are consistent with tm stabilizing effects being electrostatic in origin however trp located more deeply in dops vesicles relative to dopg vesicles and peptides in dops vesicles showed increased helix formation relative to dopg and all other lipid compositions these observations fit a model in which dops anchors flanking residues near the membrane surface more strongly than does dopg and or increases the stability of the tm state to a greater degree than dopg we conclude that anionic lipids can have significant and headgroup structure specific effects upon membrane protein topography
