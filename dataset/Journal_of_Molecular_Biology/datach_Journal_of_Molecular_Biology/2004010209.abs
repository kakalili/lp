a human synthetic combinatorial library of arrayable single chain antibodies based on shuffling in vivo formed cdrs into general framework regions
we describe a novel approach for high throughput screening of recombinant antibodies based on their immobilization on solid cellulose based supports we constructed a large human synthetic single chain fv antibody library where in vivo formed complementarity determining regions were shuffled combinatorially onto germline derived human variable region frameworks the arraying of library derived scfvs was facilitated by our unique display expression system where scfvs are expressed as fusion proteins with a cellulose binding domain cbd  escherichia coli cells expressing library derived scfv cbds are grown on a porous master filter on top of a second cellulose based filter that captures the antibodies secreted by the bacteria the cellulose filter is probed with labeled antigen allowing the identification of specific binders and the recovery of the original bacterial clones from the master filter these filters may be simultaneously probed with a number of antigens allowing the isolation of a number of binding specificities and the validation of specificity of binders we screened the library against a number of cancer related peptides proteins and peptide  protein complexes and yielded antibody fragments exhibiting dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range we expect our new antibody phage library to become a valuable source of antibodies to many different targets and to play a vital role in facilitating high throughput target discovery and validation in the area of functional cancer genomics
