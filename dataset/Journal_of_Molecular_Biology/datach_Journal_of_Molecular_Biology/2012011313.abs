teaching an old scaffold new tricks monobodies constructed using alternative surfaces of the fn scaffold
the fibronectin type iii domain fn  has become one of the most widely used non antibody scaffolds for generating new binding proteins because of its structural homology to the immunoglobulin domain combinatorial libraries of fn designed to date have primarily focused on introducing amino acid diversity into three loops that are equivalent to antibody complementarity determining regions here we report an fn library that utilizes alternative positions for presenting amino acid diversity we diversified positions on a  sheet and surface loops that together form a concave surface the new library produced binding proteins termed  monobodies   to multiple target proteins generally with similar efficacy as the original loop focused library the crystal structure of a monobody generated from the new library in complex with its target the abl sh domain revealed that a concave surface of the monobody as intended in our design bound to a convex surface of the target with the interface area being among the largest of published structures of monobody  target complexes this mode of interaction differs from a common binding mode for single domain antibodies and antibody mimics in which recognition loops recognize clefts in targets together this work illustrates the utilization of different surfaces of a single immunoglobulin like scaffold to generate binding proteins with distinct characteristics
