localization of fe  at an rtgr sequence within a dna duplex explains preferential cleavage by fe  and h o  edited by m f summers
nicking of duplex dna by the iron mediated fenton reaction occurs preferentially at a limited number of sequences of these purine t g purine rtgr is of particular interest because it is a required element in the upstream regulatory regions of many genes involved in iron and oxidative stress responses in order to study the basis of this preferential nicking nmr studies were undertaken on the rtgr containing duplex oligonucleotide d cgcgatatgacactag d ctagtgtcatatcgcg  one dimensional and two dimensional h nmr measurements show that fe  interacts preferentially and reversibly at the atga site within the duplex at a rate that is rapid relative to the chemical shift timescale while selective paramagnetic nmr line broadening of the atga guanine h suggests that fe  interacts with the guanine n moiety localization at this site is supported by fe  titrations of a duplex containing a  deazaguanine substitution in place of the guanine in the atga sequence the addition of a   fold excess of mg  over fe  does not affect the fe  dependent broadening when the atga site in the duplex is replaced by atgt an rtgr site gtga is created on the opposite strand preferential iron localization then takes place at the   guanine in gtga but no longer at the guanine in atgt consistent with the lack of preferential cleavage of atgt sites relative to atga sites
