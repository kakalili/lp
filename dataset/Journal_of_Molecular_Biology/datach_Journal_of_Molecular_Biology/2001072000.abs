the three dimensional structure of  actinin obtained by cryoelectron microscopy suggests a model for ca  dependent actin binding edited by w baumeister
the three dimensional structure of  actinin from rabbit skeletal muscle was determined by cryoelectron microscopy in combination with homology modeling of the separate domain structures based on results previously determined by x ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy   actinin was induced to form two dimensional arrays on a positively charged lipid monolayer and micrographs were collected from unstained frozen hydrated specimens at tilt angles from   to    interpretation of the    resolution three dimensional structure was done by manually docking homologous models of the three key domains actin binding three helix motif and the c terminal calmodulin like domains the initial model was refined quantitatively to improve its fit to the experimental reconstruction the molecular model of  actinin provides the first view of the overall structure of a complete actin cross linking protein the structure is characterized by close proximity of the c terminal calmodulin like domain to the linker between the two calponin homology domains that comprise the actin binding domain this location suggests a hypothesis to explain the involvement of the c terminal domain in ca  dependent actin binding of non muscle isoforms
