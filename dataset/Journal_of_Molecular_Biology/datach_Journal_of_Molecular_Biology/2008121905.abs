structural basis of the role of the nika ribbon helix helix domain in initiating bacterial conjugation
conjugation is a fundamental process for the rapid evolution of bacteria enabling them for example to adapt to various environmental conditions or to acquire multi drug resistance nika is one of the relaxosomal proteins that initiate the intercellular transfer of the r  conjugative plasmid with the p type origin of transfer orit the three dimensional structure of the n terminal  residue fragment of nika nika     which binds to the  bp repeat a sequence in r  orit was determined by nmr to be a homodimer composed of two identical ribbon helix helix rhh domains which are commonly found in transcriptional repressors the structure determination of nika     was achieved using automated noe assignment with cyana without measuring filtered noesy experiments to distinguish between the intra and intermolecular noes and without any a priori assumption on the tertiary or quaternary structure of the protein mutational experiments revealed that the dna binding region of the nika     dimer is an anti parallel  sheet composed of one  strand from each of the n terminal ends of the two domains various biochemical experiments have indicated that the full length nika     exists as a homotetramer formed through an  helical domain at the c terminus and that the anti parallel  sheets of both dimeric domains bind to two homologous  bp internal repeats within repeat a as a tetramer the full length nika     showed higher affinity to repeat a and bent the orit duplex more strongly than nika     did many rhh proteins are involved in specific dna recognition and in protein  protein interactions the discovery of the rhh fold in nika suggests that nika binds to orit and interacts with the relaxase nikb which is unable to bind to the nick region in orit without nika
