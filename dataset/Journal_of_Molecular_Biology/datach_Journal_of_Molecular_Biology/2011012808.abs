a feedback circuit between transcriptional activation and self destruction of gcn separates its metabolic and morphogenic response in diploid yeasts
the basic zipper gcn protein activates transcription in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to amino acid starvation this includes numerous metabolic genes of amino acid or purine biosynthesis and the developmental cell surface flocculin gene flo  which is required for diploid pseudohyphae formation and for adhesion upon nutrient starvation we separated the metabolic from the developmental response by screening for gcn alleles that allow growth during amino acid starvation but are impaired in adhesion and are unable to form pseudohyphae the identified gcn l  s variant carries an amino acid substitution in the third of the four conserved leucines of the zipper dimerization domain this mutation abolished flo  expression and results in reduced but sufficient transcriptional activity for amino acid biosynthetic genes the leu  ser substitution impairs gcn homodimer formation and is a significantly more stable protein than the wild type protein a helix breaker substitution in leu  results in a transcriptionally inactive but highly stable protein variant this is due to a feedback circuit between transcriptional activity of gcn and its own stability which depends on the gcn controlled cyclin pcl  gcn l  g reduces the expression of pcl and therefore reduces its own degradation this self controlled buffer system to restrict transcriptional activity results in a reciprocal correlation between gcn transcriptional activity and protein stability
