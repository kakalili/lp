hsp  and hsp  of e coli directly interact for collaboration in protein remodeling
hsp  is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that remodels hundreds of client proteins many involved in the progression of cancer and other diseases it functions with the hsp  chaperone and numerous cochaperones the bacterial hsp  functions with an hsp  chaperone dnak but is independent of hsp  cochaperones we explored the collaboration between escherichia coli hsp  and dnak and found that the two chaperones form a complex that is stabilized by client protein binding a j domain protein cbpa facilitates assembly of the hsp ec  dnak  client complex we identified e coli hsp  mutants defective in dnak interaction in vivo and show that the purified mutant proteins are defective in physical and functional interaction with dnak understanding how hsp  and hsp  collaborate in protein remodeling will provide the groundwork for the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting multiple chaperones and cochaperones
