steric and electrostatic effects at the c atom substituent influence replication and miscoding of the dna deamination product deoxyxanthosine and analogs by dna polymerases
deoxyinosine di and deoxyxanthosine dx are both formed in dna at appreciable levels in vivo by deamination of deoxyadenosine da and deoxyguanosine dg  respectively and can miscode structure  activity relationships for da pairing have been examined extensively using analogs but relatively few studies have probed the roles of the individual hydrogen bonding atoms of dg in dna replication the replicative bacteriophage t dna polymerase exonuclease and the translesion dna polymerase sulfolobus solfataricus pol iv were used as models to discern the mechanisms of miscoding by dna polymerases removal of the  amino group from the template dg i e  di had little impact on the catalytic efficiency of either polymerase as judged by either steady state or pre steady state kinetic analysis although the misincorporation frequency was increased by an order of magnitude dx was highly miscoding with both polymerases and incorporation of several bases was observed the addition of an electronegative fluorine atom at the  position of di lowered the oligonucleotide tm and strongly inhibited incorporation of dctp the addition of bromine or oxygen dx at c lowered the tm further strongly inhibited both polymerases and increased the frequency of misincorporation linear activity models show the effects of oxygen dx and the halogens at c on both dna polymerases as mainly due to a combination of both steric and electrostatic factors producing a clash with the paired cytosine o atom as opposed to either bulk or perturbation of purine ring electron density alone
