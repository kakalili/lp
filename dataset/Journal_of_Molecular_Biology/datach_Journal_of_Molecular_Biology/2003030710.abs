active site copper and zinc ions modulate the quaternary structure of prokaryotic cu zn superoxide dismutase
the influence of the constitutive metal ions on the equilibrium properties of dimeric photobacterium leiognathi cu zn superoxide dismutase has been studied for the wild type and for two mutant protein forms bearing a negative charge in the amino acid clusters at the dimer association interface depletion of copper and zinc dissociates the two mutant proteins into monomers which reassemble toward the dimeric state upon addition of stoichiometric amounts of zinc pressure dependent dissociation is observed for the copper depleted wild type and mutated enzymes as monitored by the fluorescence shift of a unique tryptophan residue located at the subunit association interface the spectral shift occurs slowly reaching a plateau after     minutes and is fully reversible the recovery of the original fluorescence properties after decompression is fast less than four minutes  suggesting that the isolated subunit has a relatively stable structure and excluding the presence of stable intermediates during the dimer  monomer transition the dimer dissociation process is still incomplete at  kbar for the copper depleted wild type and mutated enzymes at variance with what is generally observed for oligomeric proteins that dissociate below kbar measurement of the degree of dissociation at two different protein concentrations allows us to calculate the standard volume variation upon association  v and the dissociation constant kd  at atmospheric pressure   ml mol and     m respectively  the holoprotein is fully dimeric even at  kbar which allows us to evaluate a lower  g  limit of   kcal mol corresponding to a dissociation constant kd lt    m
