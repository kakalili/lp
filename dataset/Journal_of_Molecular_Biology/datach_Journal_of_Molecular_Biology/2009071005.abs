high resolution mapping of sequence directed nucleosome positioning on genomic dna
we have mapped in vitro nucleosome positioning on the sheep  lactoglobulin gene using high throughput sequencing to characterise the dna sequences recovered from reconstituted nucleosomes this methodology surpasses previous approaches for coverage accuracy and resolution and most importantly offers a simple yet rapid and relatively inexpensive method to characterise genomic dna sequences in terms of nucleosome positioning capacity we demonstrate an unambiguous correspondence between in vitro and in vivo nucleosome positioning around the promoter of the gene identify discrete sequence specific nucleosomal structures above the level of the canonical core particle  a feature that has implications for regulatory protein access and higher order chromatin packing and reveal new insights into the involvement of periodically organised dinucleotide sequence motifs of the type gg and cc and not aa and tt as determinants of nucleosome positioning  an observation that supports the idea that the core histone octamer can exploit different patterns of sequence organisation or structural potential in the dna to bring about nucleosome positioning
