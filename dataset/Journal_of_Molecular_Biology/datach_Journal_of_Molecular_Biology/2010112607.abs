dynamic interactions between clathrin and locally structured elements in a disordered protein mediate clathrin lattice assembly
assembly of clathrin lattices is mediated by assembly adaptor proteins that contain domains that bind lipids or membrane bound cargo proteins and clathrin binding domains cbds that recruit clathrin here we characterize the interaction between clathrin and a large fragment of the cbd of the clathrin assembly protein ap   mutational nmr chemical shift and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses allowed us to precisely define two clathrin binding sites within this fragment each of which is found to bind weakly to the n terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain td  the locations of the two clathrin binding sites are consistent with predictions from sequence alignments of previously identified clathrin binding elements and by extension indicate that the complete ap  cbd contains    degenerate repeats each containing a single clathrin binding site sequence and circular dichroism analyses have indicated that the ap  cbd is predominantly unstructured and our nmr analyses confirm that this is largely the case for the ap  fragment characterized here unexpectedly unlike the many proteins that undergo binding coupled folding upon interaction with their binding partners the ap  fragment is similarly unstructured in its bound and free states instead we find that this fragment exhibits localized  turn like structures at the two clathrin binding sites both when free and when bound to clathrin these observations are incorporated into a model in which weak binding by multiple pre structured clathrin binding elements regularly dispersed throughout a largely unstructured cbd allows efficient recruitment of clathrin to endocytic sites and dynamic assembly of the clathrin lattice
