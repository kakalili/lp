structure of hibiscus latent singapore virus by fiber diffraction a nonconserved his  contributes to coat protein stability
hibiscus latent singapore virus hlsv is a rigid rod shaped plant virus and a new member of the tobamovirus family unlike all other tobamoviruses the hlsv genome contains a unique poly a tract in its   untranslated region the virion is composed of a monomeric coat protein cp unit of   kda arranged as a right handed helix around the virus axis we have determined the structure of hlsv at     by x ray fiber diffraction and refined it to an r factor of    while the overall structure of the hlsv cp resembles that of other tobamoviruses there are a few unique differences there is a kink in the lr helix due to the presence of his   also the adjacent lys  may further destabilize the helix by positive charge repulsion making the kink more pronounced the his  asp  salt bridge provides significant stability to the loop adjacent to the rr helix carboxyl  carboxylate interactions that drive viral disassembly are also different in hlsv the nucleotide recognition mechanisms for virus assembly between hlsv and ribgrass mosaic virus are similar but different between tobacco mosaic virus and cucumber green mottle mosaic virus
