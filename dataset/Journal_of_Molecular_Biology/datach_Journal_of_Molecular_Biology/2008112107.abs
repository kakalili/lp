x ray crystal structure of a trpm assembly domain reveals an antiparallel four stranded coiled coil
transient receptor potential trp channels comprise a large family of tetrameric cation selective ion channels that respond to diverse forms of sensory input earlier studies showed that members of the trpm subclass possess a self assembling tetrameric c terminal cytoplasmic coiled coil domain that underlies channel assembly and trafficking here we present the high resolution crystal structure of the coiled coil domain of the channel enzyme trpm  the crystal structure together with biochemical experiments reveals an unexpected four stranded antiparallel coiled coil architecture that bears unique features relative to other antiparallel coiled coils structural analysis indicates that a limited set of interactions encode assembly specificity determinants and uncovers a previously unnoticed segregation of trpm assembly domains into two families that correspond with the phylogenetic divisions seen for the complete subunits together the data provide a framework for understanding the mechanism of trpm channel assembly and highlight the diversity of forms found in the coiled coil fold
