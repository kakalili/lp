the     groove is an atp interactive site in the  crystallin core domain of the small heat shock protein human  b crystallin
the site for atp interactions in human  b crystallin the archetype of small heat shock proteins was identified and characterized to resolve the controversial role of atp in the function of small heat shock proteins comparative sequence alignments identified the  b crystallin sequence  khfspeelkvkvlgd  as a walker b atp binding motif that is found in several atp binding proteins including five molecular chaperones fluorescence resonance energy transfer and mass spectrometry using a novel fluorescent atp analog  azido atp    naphthalenesulfonic acid   aminoethylamide  azido atp edans and a cysteine mutant of human  b crystallin s  c conjugated with a fluorescent acceptor eosin  maleimide ema identified the     groove as the atp interactive site in  b crystallin a   decrease in the emitted fluorescence of azido atp edans at the absorption maximum of s  c ema and a corresponding   increase in the fluorescence emission of s  c ema indicated a close spatial relationship between azido atp edans and the center of the   strand   ltitssls   liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry identified two peptide fragments of the  b crystallin walker b motif photo affinity labeled with azido atp edans confirming the     groove as an atp interactive site the results presented here clearly establish the     groove as the atp interactive region in  b crystallin and are in contrast to the existing paradigm that classifies small heat shock proteins as atp independent chaperones
