supramolecular assembly of vdac in native mitochondrial outer membranes
the voltage dependent anion channel vdac is the most abundant protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane mom  due to its localization vdac is involved in a wide range of processes such as passage of atp out of mitochondria and particularly plays a central role in apoptosis importantly the assembly of vdac provides interaction with a wide range of proteins some implying oligomerization however many questions remain as to the vdac structure its supramolecular assembly packing density and oligomerization in the mom is unknown here we report the so far highest resolution view of vdac and its native supramolecular assembly we have studied yeast mom by high resolution atomic force microscopy afm in physiological buffer and found vdac in two distinct types of membrane domains we found regions where vdac was packed at high density      rendering the membrane a voltage dependent molecular sieve in other domains vdac has a low surface density     and the pore assembly ranges from single molecules to groups of up to   we assume that these groups are mobile in the lipid bilayer and allow association and dissociation with the large assemblies vdac has no preferred oligomeric state and no long range order was observed in densely packed domains high resolution topographs show an eye shaped vdac with   nm    nm pore dimensions based on the observed vdac structure and the pair correlation function pcf analysis of the domain architectures we propose a simple model that could explain the phase behavior of vdac and illustrates the sensitivity of the molecular organization to conditions in the cell and the possibility for modulation of its assembly the implication of vdac in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria during cell apoptosis has made it a target in cancer research
