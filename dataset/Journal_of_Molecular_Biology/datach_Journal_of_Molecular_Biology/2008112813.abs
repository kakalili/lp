variable oligomerization modes in coronavirus non structural protein
non structural protein  nsp  of coronaviruses is believed to bind single stranded rna in the viral replication complex the crystal structure of nsp of human coronavirus hcov   e reveals a novel disulfide linked homodimer which is very different from the previously reported nsp dimer of sars coronavirus in contrast the structure of the cys ala mutant of hcov  e nsp shows the same dimer organization as the sars cov protein in the crystal the wild type hcov  e protein forms a trimer of dimers whereas the mutant and sars cov nsp are organized in rod like polymers chemical cross linking suggests similar modes of aggregation in solution in zone interference gel electrophoresis assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments the hcov  e wild type protein is found to bind oligonucleotides with relatively high affinity whereas binding by the cys ala and cys ser mutants is observed only for the longest oligonucleotides the corresponding mutations in sars cov nsp do not hamper nucleic acid binding from the crystal structures a model for single stranded rna binding by nsp is deduced we propose that both forms of the nsp dimer are biologically relevant the occurrence of the disulfide bonded form may be correlated with oxidative stress induced in the host cell by the viral infection
