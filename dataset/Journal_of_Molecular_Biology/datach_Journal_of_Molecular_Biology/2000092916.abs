ii structure and specificity of the interaction between the fha domain of rad  and phosphotyrosyl peptides    paper i in this series is liao et al     edited by p wright
the forkhead associated fha domain is a protein module found in many proteins involved in cell signaling in response to dna damage it has been suggested to bind to pthr sites of its target protein recently we have determined the first structure of an fha domain fha from the yeast protein rad  and demonstrated that fha binds to a ptyr containing peptide  edi py yld  from rad  with a moderate affinity kd ca    m  we now report the solution structure of the complex of fha bound with this ptyr peptide the structure shows that the phosphate group of ptyr interacts directly with three arginine residues      and    and that the leucine residue at the  position from the ptyr interacts with a hydrophobic surface on fha  the sequence specificity of fha was determined by screening a combinatorial ptyr library the results clearly show that fha recognizes specific sequences c terminal to ptyr with the following consensus xx py n n n  where n  leu met phe or ile n  tyr phe leu or met and n  phe leu or met two of the selected peptides gf py lyfir and dv py fymir bind fha with kd values of   and    m respectively the results along with other recent reports demonstrate that the fha domain is a new class of phosphoprotein binding domain capable of binding both ptyr and pthr sequences
