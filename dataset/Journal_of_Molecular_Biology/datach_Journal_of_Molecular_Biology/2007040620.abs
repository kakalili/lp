sequence characteristics required for cooperative binding and efficient invivo titration of the replication initiator protein dnaa in e coli
plasmids carrying the mioc promoter region which contains two dnaa boxes r and r with one misfit to the consensus tta ttncaca are as efficient in in vivo titration of the dnaa protein as plasmids carrying a replication inactivated oric region with its eight dnaa boxes three additional dnaa boxes around the promoter proximal r dnaa box were identified and shown by mutational analysis to be necessary for the cooperative binding of dnaa required for titration these four dnaa boxes are located in the same orientation and with a spacing of two or three base pairs the cooperative binding was eliminated by insertion of half a helical turn between any of the dnaa boxes titration strongly depends on the presence and orientation of the promoter distal r dnaa box located   bp upstream of the r box as well as neighbouring sequences downstream of r  titration depends on the integrity of a   bp region containing the r dnaa box while repression of mioc transcription by dnaa which is dependent on the r dnaa box was independent of the two dnaa boxes downstream of r  repression was also independent of the spacing between the two upstream dnaa boxes and the promoter as long as a dnaa box was located less than   bp upstream of the    sequence thus the architectural requirements for titration and for repression of transcription are different a new set of rules for identifying efficiently titrating dnaa box regions was formulated and used to analyse sequences for which good titration data are available
