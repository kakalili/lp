design and signaling mechanism of light regulated histidine kinases
signal transduction proteins are organized into sensor input domains that perceive a signal and in response regulate the biological activity of effector output domains we reprogrammed the input signal specificity of a normally oxygen sensitive light inert histidine kinase by replacing its chemosensor domain by a light oxygen voltage photosensor domain illumination of the resultant fusion kinase yf reduced net kinase activity by     fold in vitro yf also controls gene expression in a light dependent manner in vivo signals are transmitted from the light oxygen voltage sensor domain to the histidine kinase domain via a       rotational movement within an  helical coiled coil linker light is acting as a rotary switch these signaling principles are broadly applicable to domains linked by  helices and to chemo and photosensors conserved sequence motifs guide the rational design of light regulated variants of histidine kinases and other proteins
