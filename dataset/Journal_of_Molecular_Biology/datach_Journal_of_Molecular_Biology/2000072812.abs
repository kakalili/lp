the protofilament substructure of amyloid fibrils edited by f e cohen
tissue deposition of normally soluble proteins or their fragments as insoluble amyloid fibrils causes the usually fatal acquired and hereditary systemic amyloidoses and is associated with the pathology of alzheimer  s disease type  diabetes and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies although each type of amyloidosis is characterised by a specific amyloid fibril protein the deposits share pathognomonic histochemical properties and the structural morphology of all amyloid fibrils is very similar we have previously demonstrated that transthyretin amyloid fibrils contain four constituent protofilaments packed in a square array here we have used cross correlation techniques to average electron microscopy images of multiple cross sections in order to reconstruct the sub structure of ex vivo amyloid fibrils composed of amyloid a protein monoclonal immunoglobulin  light chain leu arg variant apolipoprotein ai and asp his variant lysozyme as well as synthetic fibrils derived from a ten residue peptide corresponding to the a strand of transthyretin all the fibrils had an electron lucent core but the packing arrangement comprised five or six protofilaments rather than four the structural similarity that defines amyloid fibres thus exists principally at the level of  sheet folding of the polypeptides within the protofilament while the different types vary in the supramolecular assembly of their protofilaments
