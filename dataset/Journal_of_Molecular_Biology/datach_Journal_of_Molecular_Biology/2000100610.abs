characterization of halted t rna polymerase elongation complexes reveals multiple factors that contribute to stability edited by m gottesman
we have constructed a series of plasmid templates that allow t rna polymerase rnap to be halted at defined intervals downstream from its promoter in a preserved sequence context while transcription complexes halted at  to  are highly unstable complexes halted at   to   dissociate very slowly and gradually lose their capacity to extend transcripts complexes halted at   and beyond dissociate more readily but the stability of the these complexes is enhanced significantly in the presence of the next incoming nucleotide unexpectedly the stability of complexes halted at   and beyond was found to be lower on supercoiled templates than on linear templates to explore this further we used synthetic dna templates in which the nature of the non template nt strand was varied whereas initiation complexes are less stable in the presence of a complementary nt strand elongation complexes are more stable in the presence of a complementary nt strand and the presence of a non complementary nt strand a mismatched bubble results in even greater stability the results suggest that the nt strand plays an important role in displacing the nascent rna allowing its interaction with an rna product binding site in the rnap the nt strand may also contribute to stabilization by interacting directly with the enzyme a mutant rnap that has a deletion in the flexible  thumb  domain responds to changes in template topology in a manner that is similar to that of the wild type wt enzyme but halted complexes formed by the mutant enzyme are particularly dependent upon the presence of the nt strand for stability in contrast an n terminal rnap mutant that has a decreased capacity to bind single stranded rna forms halted complexes with much lower levels of stability than the wt enzyme and these complexes are not stabilized by the presence of the nt strand the distinct responses of the mutant rnaps to changes in template structure indicate that the n terminal and thumb domains have quite different functions in stabilizing the transcription complex
