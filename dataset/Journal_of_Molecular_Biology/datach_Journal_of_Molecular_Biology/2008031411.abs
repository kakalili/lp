crystal structures of streptococcus mutans   deoxycytidylate deaminase and its complex with substrate analog and allosteric regulator dctp mg
deoxycytidylate deaminase or deoxycytidine   monophosphate dcmp deaminase dcd catalyzes the deamination of dcmp to deoxyuridine   monophosphate to provide the main nucleotide substrate for thymidylate synthase which is important in dna synthesis the activity of this homohexameric enzyme is allosterically regulated by deoxycytidine   triphosphate dctp as an activator and by deoxythymidine   triphosphate as an inhibitor in this article we report the crystal structures of dcmp deaminase from streptococcus mutans and its complex with dctp and an intermediate analog at resolutions of   and      the protein forms a hexamer composed of subunits adopting a three layer     sandwich fold the positive allosteric regulator dctp mainly binds at the interface between two monomers in a molar ratio of   and rearranges the neighboring interaction networks structural comparisons and sequence alignments revealed that dcmp deaminase from streptococcus mutans belongs to the cytidine deaminase superfamily wherein the proteins exhibit a similar catalytic mechanism in addition to the two conserved motifs involved in the binding of zn  a new conserved motif  g yng   related to the binding of dctp was also identified n terminal arg  a key residue located between two monomers binds strongly to the  phosphate group of dctp the regulation signal was transmitted by arg from the allosteric site to the active site via modifications in the interactions at the interface where the substrate binding pocket was involved and the relocations of arg  his  tyr   and arg  to envelope the active site in order to stabilize substrate binding in the complex based on the enzyme  regulator complex structure observed in this study we propose an allosteric mechanism for dcd regulation
