identification of a dimeric intermediate in the unfolding pathway for the calcium binding protein s  b
the s  proteins comprise   calcium signalling members of the ef hand protein family unlike typical ef hand signalling proteins such as calmodulin and troponin c the s  proteins are dimeric forming both homo and heterodimers in vivo one member of this family s  b is a homodimeric protein shown to control the assembly of several cytoskeletal proteins and regulate phosphorylation events in a calcium sensitive manner calcium binding to s  b causes a conformational change involving movement of helix iii in the second calcium binding site ef  that exposes a hydrophobic surface enabling interactions with other proteins such as tubulin and ndr kinase in several s  proteins calcium binding also stabilizes dimerization compared to the calcium free states in this work we have examined the guanidine hydrochloride guhcl induced unfolding of dimeric calcium free s  b a series of tryptophan substitutions near the dimer interface and the ef calcium binding site were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and showed biphasic unfolding curves the presence of a plateau near   m guhcl showed the presence of an intermediate that had a greater exposed hydrophobic surface area compared to the native dimer based on increased   dianilino    binaphthyl    disulfonic acid fluorescence furthermore  h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence analyses as a function of guhcl showed significant chemical shift changes in regions near the ef calcium binding loop and between the linker and c terminus of helix iv together these observations show that calcium free s  b unfolds via a dimeric intermediate
