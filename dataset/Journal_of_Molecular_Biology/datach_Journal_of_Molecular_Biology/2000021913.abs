energetics of a strongly ph dependent rna tertiary structure in a frameshifting pseudoknot edited by i tinoco
retroviruses employ   translational frameshifting to regulate the relative concentrations of structural and non structural proteins critical to the viral life cycle the    crystal structure of the   frameshifting pseudoknot from beet western yellows virus reveals in addition to watson crick base pairing many loop stem rna tertiary structural interactions and a bound na  investigation of the thermodynamics of unfolding of the beet western yellows virus pseudoknot reveals strongly ph dependent loop stem tertiary structural interactions which stabilize the molecule contributing a net of  h     kcal mol   and  g   of    kcal mol   to a total  h and  g   of    and    kcal mol   respectively at ph     m k by dsc characterization of mutant rnas supports the presence of a c  g  c  loop  stem  base triple pka    protonation of which contributes nearly    kcal mol   in net stability in the presence of a wild type loop  substitution of the nucleotides in loop  with uridine bases which would eliminate the minor groove triplex destroys pseudoknot formation an examination of the dependence of the monovalent ion and type on melting profiles suggests that tertiary structure unfolding occurs in a manner quantitatively consistent with previous studies on the stabilizing effects of k  nh  and na on other simple duplex and pseudoknotted rnas
