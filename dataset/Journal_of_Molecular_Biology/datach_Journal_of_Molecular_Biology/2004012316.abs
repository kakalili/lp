identification of the subunit  subunit interface of xenopus rad   protein similarity to reca
rad  like its prokaryotic homolog reca forms a helical filament for homologous dna recombination and recombinational dna repair comparison of the three dimensional structures of human rad  and escherichia coli reca indicated that the tyrosine residue at position   in human rad  lies at the centre of a putative subunit  subunit contact interface we inserted a tryptophan residue as a fluorescent probe at the corresponding position in xenopus rad   and found that its fluorescence depended upon the protein concentration indicating that the residue is truly in the subunit  subunit interface we also found that  m urea which promoted the dissociation of rad  filament without complete unfolding of the protein exposed the tryptophan residue to solvent the fluorescence was not modified by binding to dna and only slightly modified by atp indicating that the same site is used for formation of the active atp rad  dna filament the slight changes in fluorescence caused by atp and adp suggest that the subunit  subunit contact is altered leading to the elongation of the filament by these nucleotides as with the reca filament thus rad  forms filaments by subunit  subunit contact much like reca does
