three layer oniom studies of the dark state of rhodopsin the protonation state of glu
a computational three layer oniom qm high qm low mm hybrid scheme has been applied to analyze the protonation state of the glu  amino acid residue in rhodopsin which is vital to determining the rhodopsin photoactivation mechanism due to conflicting evidence from previous studies it has yet to be conclusively resolved in this study we fully optimize dark state rhodopsin model structures differing only at the   residue site  protonated and unprotonated glu   and calculate several experimentally observable properties comparison of calculated structures excitation energies and nmr chemical shifts for the two models with values from the literature allows a reevaluation of previously reported conclusions a key finding is that the s  s energy level splitting previously used as evidence for a neutral glu   is found to be almost identical for the two protonation states we highlight a need for caution when interpreting experimental data small differences in the properties of the two model structures are also identified which may be useful targets for future high resolution experimental approaches
