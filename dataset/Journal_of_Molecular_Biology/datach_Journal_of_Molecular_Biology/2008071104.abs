capsid size determination by staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island sapi involves specific incorporation of sapi proteins into procapsids
the staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity island sapi carries the gene for the toxic shock syndrome toxin tsst  and can be mobilized by infection with s aureus helper phage    sapi depends on the helper phage for excision replication and genome packaging the sapi transducing particles comprise proteins encoded by the helper phage but have a smaller capsid commensurate with the smaller size of the sapi genome previous studies identified only   encoded proteins in mature sapi virions implying that the presumptive sapi capsid size determination function s must act transiently during capsid assembly or maturation in this study    and sapi procapsids were produced by induction of phage mutants lacking functional   or sapi small terminase subunits by cryo electron microscopy these procapsids were found to have a round shape and an internal scaffolding core mass spectrometry was used to identify all   encoded structural proteins in   and sapi procapsids including several that had not previously been found in the mature capsids in addition sapi procapsids contained at least one sapi encoded protein that has been implicated genetically in capsid size determination mass spectrometry on full length phage proteins showed that the major capsid protein and the scaffolding protein are n terminally processed in both   and sapi procapsids
