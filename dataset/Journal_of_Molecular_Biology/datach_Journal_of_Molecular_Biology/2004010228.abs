analysis of thermal adaptation in the hsl enzyme family
the recently solved three dimensional  d structures of two thermostable members of the carboxylesterase lipase hsl family namely the alicyclobacillus formerly bacillus acidocaldarius and archaeoglobus fulgidus carboxylesterases est and afest respectively were compared with that of the mesophilic homologous counterpart brefeldine a esterase from bacillus subtilis since the d homology models of other members of the hsl family were also available we performed a structural alignment with all these sequences the resulting alignment was used to assess the amino acid  traffic rule  in the hsl family quite surprisingly the data were in very good agreement with those recently reported from two independent groups and based on the comparison of a huge number of homologous sequences from the genus bacillus methanococcus and deinococcus thermus taken as a whole the data point to the statistical meaning of defined amino acid conversions going from psychrophilic to hyperthermophilic sequences we identified and mapped several such changes onto the est structure and observed that such mutations were localized mostly in loops regions or  helices and were mostly excluded from the active site a site directed mutagenesis of two of the identified residues confirmed they were involved in thermal stability
