positively cooperative binding of zinc ions to bacillus cereus   h   lactamase ii suggests that the binuclear enzyme is the only relevant form for catalysis
metallo  lactamases catalyze the hydrolysis of most  lactam antibiotics and hence represent a major clinical concern while enzymes belonging to subclass b have been shown to display maximum activity as dizinc species the actual metal to protein stoichiometry and the affinity for zinc are not clear we have further investigated the process of metal binding to the  lactamase ii from bacillus cereus   h  known as bcii  zinc binding was monitored using complementary biophysical techniques including circular dichroism in the far uv enzymatic activity measurements competition with a chromophoric chelator mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance most noticeably mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments together with catalytic activity measurements demonstrate that two zinc ions bind cooperatively to the enzyme active site with k k    and hence that catalysis is associated with the dizinc enzyme species only furthermore competitive experiments with the chromophoric chelator mag fura  indicates k lt   nm this contrasts with cadmium binding which is clearly a noncooperative process with the mono form being the only species significantly populated in the presence of  molar equivalent of cd ii  interestingly optical measurements reveal that although the apo and dizinc species exhibit undistinguishable tertiary structural organizations the metal depleted enzyme shows a significant decrease in its  helical content presumably associated with enhanced flexibility
