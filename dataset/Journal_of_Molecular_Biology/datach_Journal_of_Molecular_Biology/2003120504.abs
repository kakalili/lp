structural characterization of the  nucleotide potato spindle tuber viroid left terminal domain by nmr and thermodynamic analysis
the  nucleotide left terminal domain tl of the potato spindle tuber rna viroid pstvd constitutes one of its five structural elements due to a twofold complementary sequence repeat two possible conformations are proposed for the tl secondary structure an elongated rod and a bifurcated form in the present study two tl mutants were designed that remove the symmetry of the sequence repeats and ensure that either the bifurcated or the elongated rod conformation is thermodynamically favored imino h and  n resonances were assigned for both mutants and the native tl domain based on h  h noesy and heteronuclear h   n hsqc high resolution nmr spectra the nmr secondary structure analysis of all constructs establishes unambiguously the elongated rod form as the secondary structure of the native tl domain temperature gradient gel electrophoresis and uv melting experiments corroborate these results a combined secondary structure and sequence analysis of tl domains of other pospiviroidae family members indicates that the elongated rod form is thermodynamically favored for the vast majority of these viroids
