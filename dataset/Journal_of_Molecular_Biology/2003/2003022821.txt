HPr kinase/phosphatase (HPrK/P) modifies serine 46 of histidine-containing protein (HPr), the phosphorylation state of which is the control point of carbon catabolite repression in low G+C Gram-positive bacteria. To understand the structural mechanism by which HPrK/P carries out its dual, competing activities we determined the structure of full length HPrK/P from Mycoplasma pneumoniae (PD8 ID, 1KNX) to 2.5Ã… resolution. The enzyme forms a homo-hexamer with each subunit containing two domains connected by a short loop. The C-terminal domain contains the well-described P-loop (Walker A box) ATP binding motif and takes a fold similar to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) from Escherichia coli as recently described in other HPrK/P structures. As expected, the C-terminal domain is very similar to the C-terminal fragment of Lactobacillus casei HPrK/P and the C-terminal domain of Staphylococcus xylosus HPrK/P; the N-terminal domain is very similar to the N-terminal domain of S.xylosus HPrK/P. Unexpectedly, the N-terminal domain resembles UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-d-glutamate:meso-diaminopimelate ligase (MurE), yet the function of this domain is unclear. We discuss these observations as well as the structural significance of mutations in the P-loop and HPrK/P family sequence motif.
