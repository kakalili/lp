crystal structure of vascular endothelial growth factor b in complex with a neutralising antibody fab fragment
vascular endothelial growth factor vegf b effects blood vessel formation by binding to vegf receptor  to study the specifics of the biological profile of vegf b in both physiological and pathological angiogenesis a neutralising anti vegf b antibody  h  that functions by inhibiting the binding of vegf b to vegf receptor  was developed here we present the structural features of the  highly ordered  interaction of the fab fragment of this antibody fab h  with vegf b two molecules of fab h  bind to symmetrical binding sites located at each pole of the vegf b homodimer giving a unique u shaped topology to the complex that has not been previously observed in the vegf family vegf b residues essential for binding to the antibody are contributed by both monomers of the cytokine our detailed analysis reveals that the neutralising effect of the antibody occurs by virtue of the steric hindrance of the receptor binding interface these findings suggest that functional complementarity between vegf b and h  can be harnessed both in analysing the therapeutic potential of vegf b and as an antagonist of receptor activation
