Human cytidine deaminase apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like 3F (APOBEC3F, or A3F), like APOBEC3G, has broad antiviral activity against diverse retroelements, including Vif-deficient human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. Its antiviral functions are known to rely on its virion encapsidation and be suppressed by HIV-1 Vif, which recruits Cullin5-based E3 ubiquitin ligases. However, the factors that mediate A3F virion packaging have not yet been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that A3F specifically interacts with cellular signal recognition particle (SRP) RNA (7SL RNA), which is selectively packaged into HIV-1 virions. Efficient packaging of 7SL RNA as well as A3F was mediated by the RNA-binding nucleocapsid domain of HIV-1 Gag. Reducing 7SL RNA packaging by overexpression of SRP19 protein inhibited A3F virion packaging. Although A3F has been shown to interact with P bodies and viral genomic RNA, our data indicated that P bodies and HIV-1 genomic RNA were not required for A3F packaging. Thus, in addition to its well-known function in SRPs, 7SL RNA, which is encapsidated into diverse retroviruses, also participates in the innate antiviral function of host cytidine deaminases.
