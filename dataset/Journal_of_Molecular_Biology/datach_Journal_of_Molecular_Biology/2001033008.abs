phosphorylation induced structural changes in the amyloid precursor protein cytoplasmic tail detected by nmr edited by p e wright
the cytoplasmic tail of the amyloid precursor protein appc interacts with several cellular factors implicated in intracellular signaling or proteolytic production of amyloid  peptide found in senile plaques of alzheimer  s disease patients appc contains two threonine residues   and   relative to app   or  and  relative to appc and a serine residue   or  respectively that are known to be phosphorylated in vivo and may play regulatory roles in these events we show by solution nmr spectroscopy of a  residue cytoplasmic tail peptide app c that in all three cases phosphorylation induces changes in backbone dihedral angles that can be attributed to formation of local hydrogen bonds between the phosphate group and nearby amide protons phosphorylation of s also induces chemical shift changes in the hydrophobic cluster residues i v   indicating additional medium range effects the most pronounced changes occur upon phosphorylation of t  a neuron specific phosphorylation site where the n terminal helix capping box previously characterized for this region is altered characterization of torsion angles and transient hydrogen bonds indicates that prolyl isomerization of the pthr pro peptide bond results from both destabilization of the n terminal helix capping box and stabilization of the cis isomer by transient hydrogen bonds the significant population of the cis isomer    present after phosphorylation of t  suggests a potential role of selective recognition of cis versus trans isomers in response to phosphorylation of app together these structural changes indicate that phosphorylation may act as a conformational switch in the cytoplasmic tail of app to alter specificity and affinity of binding to cytosolic partners particularly in response to the abnormal phosphorylation events associated with alzheimer  s disease
