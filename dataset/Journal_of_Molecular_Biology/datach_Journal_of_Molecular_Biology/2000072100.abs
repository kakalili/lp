crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of the h subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor
the human asialoglycoprotein receptor asgpr  also called hepatic lectin is an integral membrane protein and is responsible for the clearance of desialylated galactose terminal glycoproteins from the circulation by receptor mediated endocytosis it can be subdivided into four functional domains the cytosolic domain the transmembrane domain the stalk and the carbohydrate recognition domain crd  the galactose binding domains belong to the superfamily of c type calcium dependent lectins in particular to the long form subfamily with three conserved intramolecular disulphide bonds it is able to bind terminal non reducing galactose residues and n acetyl galactosamine residues of desialated tri or tetra antennary n linked glycans the asgpr is a potential liver specific receptor for hepatitis b virus and marburg virus and has been used to target exogenous molecules specifically to hepatocytes for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes here we present the x ray crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of the major subunit h at    resolution while the overall fold of this and other known c type lectin structures are well conserved the positions of the bound calcium ions are not indicating that the fold is stabilised by alternative mechanisms in different branches of the c type lectin family it is the first crd structure where three calcium ions form an intergral part of the structure in addition the structure provides direct confirmation for the conversion of the ligand binding site of the mannose binding protein to an asialoglycoprotein receptor like specificity suggested by drickamer and colleagues in agreement with the prediction that the coiled coil domain of the asgpr is separated from the crd and its n terminal disulphide bridge by several residues these residues are indeed not  helical while in tetranectin they form an  helical coiled coil
