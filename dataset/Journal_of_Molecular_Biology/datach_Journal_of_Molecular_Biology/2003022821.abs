crystal structure of hpr kinase phosphatase from mycoplasma pneumoniae
hpr kinase phosphatase hprk p modifies serine  of histidine containing protein hpr  the phosphorylation state of which is the control point of carbon catabolite repression in low g c gram positive bacteria to understand the structural mechanism by which hprk p carries out its dual competing activities we determined the structure of full length hprk p from mycoplasma pneumoniae pd id  knx to    resolution the enzyme forms a homo hexamer with each subunit containing two domains connected by a short loop the c terminal domain contains the well described p loop walker a box atp binding motif and takes a fold similar to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pepck from escherichia coli as recently described in other hprk p structures as expected the c terminal domain is very similar to the c terminal fragment of lactobacillus casei hprk p and the c terminal domain of staphylococcus xylosus hprk p the n terminal domain is very similar to the n terminal domain of s xylosus hprk p unexpectedly the n terminal domain resembles udp n acetylmuramoyl l alanyl d glutamate meso diaminopimelate ligase mure  yet the function of this domain is unclear we discuss these observations as well as the structural significance of mutations in the p loop and hprk p family sequence motif
