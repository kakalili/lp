prion proof  for pin  infection with in vitro made amyloid aggregates of rnq p       induces pin
prions are self propagating infectious protein conformations the mammalian prion prpsc responsible for neurodegenerative diseases like bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse   mad cow  disease and creutzfeldt jakob s disease appears to be a  sheet rich amyloid conformation of prpc that converts prpc into prpsc however an unequivocal demonstration of  protein only  infection by prpsc is still lacking so far protein only infection has been proven for three prions  psi   ure  and het s  all of fungal origin considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that another protein the yeast rnq p can form a prion  pin  while rnq p does not lose any known function upon prionization  pin  has interesting positive phenotypes facilitating the appearance and destabilization of other prions as well as the aggregation of polyglutamine extensions of the huntingtin protein here we polymerize a gln asn rich recombinant fragment of rnq p into  sheet rich amyloid like aggregates while the method used for psi  and ure  infectivity assays did not yield protein only infection for the rnq p aggregates we did successfully obtain protein only infection by modifying the protocol this work proves that pin  is a prion mediated by amyloid like aggregates of rnq p and supports the hypothesis that heterologous prions affect each other s appearance and propagation through interaction of their amyloid like regions
