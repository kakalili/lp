identification of a residue critical for maintaining the functional conformation of bpti
the effects of amino acid replacements on the backbone dynamics of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti were examined using  n nmr relaxation experiments previous studies have shown that backbone amide groups within the trypsin binding region of the wild type protein undergo conformational exchange processes on the  s time scale and that replacement of tyr  with gly greatly increases the number of backbone atoms involved in such motions in order to determine whether these mutational effects are specific to the replacement of this residue with gly six additional replacements were examined in the present study in two of these tyr  was replaced with either ala or leu and the other four were single replacements of tyr  phe  asn  or asn  all of which are highly buried in the native structure and conserved in homologous proteins the y a and y l mutants displayed dynamic properties very similar to those of the y g mutant with the backbone segments including residues     and     undergoing motions revealed by enhanced  n transverse relaxation rates on the other hand the y l n g and n a substitutions caused almost no detectable changes in backbone dynamics on either the ns  ps or ms   s time scales even though each of these replacements significantly destabilizes the native conformation replacement of phe  with leu caused intermediate effects with several residues that have previously been implicated in motions in the wild type protein displaying enhanced transverse relaxation rates these results demonstrate that destabilizing amino acid replacements can be accommodated in a native protein with dramatically different effects on conformational dynamics and that tyr  plays a particularly important role in defining the conformation of the trypsin binding site of bpti
