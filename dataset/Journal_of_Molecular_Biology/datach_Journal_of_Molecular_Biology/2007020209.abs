action of transcription factors in the control of transferrin receptor expression in human brain endothelium
brain endothelium has a distinctive phenotype including high expression of transferrin receptor p glycoprotein claudin  and occludin dermal endothelium expresses lower levels of the transferrin receptor and it is absent from lung endothelium all three endothelia were screened for transcription factors that bind the transferrin receptor promoter and show different patterns of binding between the endothelia the transcription factor yy has distinct dna binding activities in brain endothelium and non brain endothelium the target sites on the transferrin receptor promotor for yy lie in close proximity to those of the transcription initiation complex containing tfiid so the two transcription factors potentially compete or interfere notably the dna binding activity of tfiid was the converse of yy  in different endothelia yy knockdown reduced transferrin receptor expression in brain endothelium but not in dermal endothelium implying that yy is involved in tissue specific regulation of the transferrin receptor moreover a distinct yy variant is present in brain endothelium and it associates with sp  a model is presented in which expression from the transferrin receptor gene in endothelium requires the activity of both tfiid and sp  but whether the gene is transcribed in different endothelia is related to the balance between activating and suppressive forms of yy
