exploring the linkage dependence of polyubiquitin conformations using molecular modeling
posttranslational modification of proteins by covalent attachment of a small protein ubiquitin ub or a polymeric chain of ub molecules called polyubiquitin is involved in controlling a vast variety of processes in eukaryotic cells the question of how different polyubiquitin signals are recognized is central to understanding the specificity of various types of polyubiquitination in polyubiquitin monomers are linked to each other via an isopeptide bond between the c terminal glycine of one ub and a lysine of the other the functional outcome of polyubiquitination depends on the particular lysine involved in chain formation and appears to rely on linkage dependent conformation of polyubiquitin thus k  linked chains a universal signal for proteasomal degradation under physiological conditions adopt a closed conformation where functionally important residues l  i  and v  are sequestered at the interface between two adjacent ub monomers by contrast k  linked chains which act as a nonproteolytic regulatory signal adopt an extended conformation that lacks hydrophobic interubiquitin contact little is known about the functional roles of the so called  noncanonical  chains linked via k  k  k  k  or k  or linked head to tail  and no structural information on these chains is available except for information on the crystal structure of the head to tail linked diubiquitin ub  in this study we use molecular modeling to examine whether any of the noncanonical chains can adopt a closed conformation similar to that in k  linked polyubiquitin our results show that the eight possible ub chains can be divided into two groups chains linked via k  k  k  or k  are predicted to form a closed conformation whereas chains linked via k  k  or k  or linked head to tail are unable to form such a contact due to steric occlusion these predictions are validated by the known structures of k   k   and head to tail linked chains our study also predicts structural models for ub chains linked via k  k  or k  the implications of these findings for linkage selective recognition of noncanonical polyubiquitin signals by various receptors are discussed
