crystal structure of inulosucrase from lactobacillus insights into the substrate specificity and product specificity of gh  fructansucrases
fructansucrases fss catalyze a transfructosylation reaction with sucrose as substrate to produce fructo oligosaccharides and fructan polymers that contain either    glycosidic linkages inulin or    linkages levan  levan synthesizing fss levansucrases have been most extensively investigated while detailed information on inulosucrases is limited importantly the molecular basis of the different product specificities of levansucrases and inulosucrases is poorly understood we have elucidated the three dimensional structure of a truncated active bacterial gh  inulosucrase inuj of lactobacillus johnsonii ncc   residues       in its apo form with a bound substrate sucrose  and with a transfructosylation product the sucrose binding pocket and the sucrose binding mode are virtually identical with those of gh  levansucrases confirming that both enzyme types use the same fully conserved structural framework for the binding and cleavage of the donor substrate sucrose in the active site the binding mode of the first transfructosylation product  kestose fru      fru      glc where fru fructose and glc glucose in subsites   to  shows for the first time how inulin type fructo oligosaccharide bind in gh  fs and how an inulin type linkage can be formed surprisingly observed interactions with the sugar in subsites  and  are provided by residues that are also present in levansucrases the binding mode of  kestose and the presence of a more distant sucrose binding site suggest that residues beyond the  subsite in particular residues from the nonconserved b  c loop determine product linkage type specificity in gh  fss
