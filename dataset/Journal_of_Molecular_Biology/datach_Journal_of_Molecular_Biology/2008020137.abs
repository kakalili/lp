an adp atp specific mitochondrial carrier protein in the microsporidian antonospora locustae
the mitochondrion is one of the defining characteristics of eukaryotic cells and to date no eukaryotic lineage has been shown to have lost mitochondria entirely in certain anaerobic or microaerophilic lineages however the mitochondrion has become severely reduced that it lacks a genome and no longer synthesizes atp one example of such a reduced organelle called the mitosome is found in microsporidian parasites only a handful of potential mitosomal proteins were found to be encoded in the complete genome of the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi and significantly no proteins of the mitochondrial carrier family were identified these carriers facilitate the transport of solutes across the inner mitochondrial membrane are a means of communication between the mitochondrion and cytosol and are abundant in organisms with aerobic mitochondria here we report the characterization of a mitochondrial carrier protein in the microsporidian antonospora locustae and demonstrate that the protein is heterologously targeted to mitochondria in saccharomyces cerevisiae the protein is phylogenetically allied to the nad transporter of s cerevisiae but we show that it has high specificity for atp and adp when expressed in escherichia coli an adp atp carrier may provide atp for essential atp dependent mitosomal processes such as hsp  dependent protein import and export of iron  sulfur clusters to the cytosol
