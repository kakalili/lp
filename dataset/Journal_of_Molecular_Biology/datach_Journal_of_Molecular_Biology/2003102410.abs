tertiary structure of thiopurine methyltransferase from pseudomonas syringae a bacterial orthologue of a polymorphic drug metabolizing enzyme
in humans the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase tpmt metabolizes  thiopurine  tp medications including  thioguanine  mercaptopurine and azathioprine commonly used for immune suppression and for the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies s methylation by tpmt prevents the intracellular conversion of these drugs into active  thioguanine nucleotides  tgns  genetic polymorphisms in the tpmt protein sequence have been associated with decreased tissue enzymatic activities and an increased risk of life threatening myelo suppression from standard doses of  tp medications biochemical studies have demonstrated that tpmt deficiency is primarily associated with increased degradation of the polymorphic proteins through an ubiquitylation and proteasomal dependent pathway we have now determined the tertiary structure of the bacterial orthologue of tpmt from pseudomonas syringae using nmr spectroscopy bacterial tpmt similarly catalyzes the s adenosylmethionine sam dependent transmethylation of  tps and shares   similarity   identity with the human enzyme initial studies revealed an unstructured n terminus which was removed for structural studies and subsequently determined to be required for enzymatic activity despite lacking sequence similarity to any protein of known three dimensional structure the tertiary structure of bacterial tpmt reveals a classical sam dependent methyltransferase topology consisting of a seven stranded  sheet flanked by  helices on both sides however some deviations from the consensus topology along with multiple insertions of structural elements are evident a review of the many experimentally determined tertiary structures of sam dependent methyltransferases demonstrates that such structural deviations from the consensus topology are common and often functionally important
