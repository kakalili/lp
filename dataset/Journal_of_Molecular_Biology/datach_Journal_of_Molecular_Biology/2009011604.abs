kinetic analysis of late steps of eukaryotic translation initiation
little is known about the molecular mechanics of the late events of translation initiation in eukaryotes we present a kinetic dissection of the transition from a preinitiation complex after start codon recognition to the final  s initiation complex the resulting framework reveals that eukaryotic initiation factor eif b actually accelerates the rate of ribosomal subunit joining and this acceleration is influenced by the conformation of the gtpase active site of the factor mediated by the bound nucleotide eif a accelerates joining through its c terminal interaction with eif b and eif a release from the initiating ribosome which occurs only after subunit joining is accelerated by gtp hydrolysis by eif b following subunit joining gtp hydrolysis by eif b alters the conformation of the final initiation complex and clears a path to promote rapid release of eif a our data coupled with previous work indicate that eif a is present on the ribosome throughout the entire initiation process and plays key roles at every stage
