single stranded dna binding protein complex from helicobacter pylori suggests an ssdna binding surface
single stranded dna ssdna binding protein ssb plays an important role in dna replication recombination and repair ssb consists of an n terminal ssdna binding domain with an oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding fold and a flexible c terminal tail involved in protein  protein interactions ssb from helicobacter pylori hpssb was isolated and the ssdna binding characteristics of hpssb were analyzed by fluorescence titration and electrophoretic mobility shift assay tryptophan fluorescence quenching was measured as   and the calculated cooperative affinity was      m   with an ssdna binding length of     nt the crystal structure of the c terminally truncated protein hpssbc in complex with  mer ssdna hpssbc  dt   was determined at a resolution of     the hpssbc monomer folds as an oligonucleotide oligosaccharide binding fold with a y shaped conformation the ssdna wrapped around the hpssbc tetramer through a continuous binding path comprising five essential aromatic residues and a positively charged surface formed by numerous basic residues
