molecular structure of the n terminal domain of the apc c subunit cdc  reveals a homo dimeric tetratricopeptide repeat architecture
the anaphase promoting complex cyclosome apc c is a large multi subunit e ubiquitin ligase that targets specific cell cycle regulatory proteins for ubiquitin dependent degradation thereby controlling cell cycle events such as the metaphase to anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis biochemical and genetic studies are consistent with the notion that subunits of apc c are organised into two distinct sub complexes a catalytic sub complex including the cullin domain and ring finger subunits apc and apc  respectively and a tetratricopeptide repeat tpr sub complex composed of the tpr subunits cdc  cdc  and cdc  apc  here we describe the crystal structure of the n terminal domain of encephalitozoon cuniculi cdc  cdc nterm  revealing a homo dimeric structure composed predominantly of successive tpr motifs mutation of the cdc nterm dimer interface destabilises the protein disrupts dimerisation in solution and abolishes the capacity of e cuniculi cdc  to complement saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc  in vivo these results establish the existence of functional apc c genes in e cuniculi the evolutionarily conserved dimeric properties of cdc  and provide a framework for understanding the architecture of full length cdc
