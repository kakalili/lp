the  scr flexible extracellular domains of human complement receptor type  can mediate multiple ligand and antigen interactions
complement receptor type  cr  cd  is a cell surface protein that links the innate and adaptive immune response during the activation of b cells the extracellular portion of cr comprises  or  short complement regulator scr domains for which the overall arrangement in solution is unknown this was determined by constrained scattering and ultracentrifugation modelling the radius of gyration of cr scr   was determined to be    nm by both x ray and neutron scattering and that of its cross section was   nm the distance distribution function p r showed that the overall length of cr scr   was   nm sedimentation equilibrium curve fits gave a mean molecular weight of           da in agreement with a fully glycosylated structure velocity experiments using the g s derivative method gave a sedimentation coefficient of       s in order to construct a model of cr scr   for constrained fitting homology models for the  scr domains were combined with randomised linker peptides generated by molecular dynamics simulations using an automated procedure the analysis of    possible cr scr   models showed that only those models in which the  scr domains were flexible but partially folded back accounted for the scattering and sedimentation data the best fit cr models provided a visual explanation for the versatile interaction of cr with four ligands c d cd  gp  and ifn   the flexible location of cr scr   is likely to facilitate interactions of c d  antigen complexes with the b cell receptor
