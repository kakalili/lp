differential turnover of myosin chaperone unc  a isoforms increases in metastatic human breast cancer
unc  a is a molecular chaperone targeted to non muscle myosins and is essential for cell division here we show that unc  a mrna and protein expression was elevated in human breast carcinomas and cell lines derived from breast carcinoma metastases moreover small hairpin rna knockdowns of endogenously overexpressed unc  a in the most metastatic cell line led to significant decreases in the rates of cell proliferation and invasion concomitant with reduction in the interaction of myosin ii with actin filaments exploring the mechanism of these findings further we found that unc  a is alternatively expressed at the mrna and protein levels as two isoforms the two isoforms differ only by a proline rich  amino acid sequence near the amino terminus in the increased expression with metastatic activity the ratio of the isoform mrnas remained constant but the   amino acid protein isoform showed increases up to about  fold in comparison to the   amino acid isoform the differential accumulation was explained by cellular labeling experiments that showed that the   isoform is degraded at a  fold greater rate than the   isoform and that this degradation required the ubiquitin  proteasome system
