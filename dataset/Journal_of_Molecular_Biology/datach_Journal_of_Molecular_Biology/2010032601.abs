structure of the mads box mef domain of mef a bound to dna and its implication for myocardin recruitment
myocyte enhancer factor  mef  regulates specific gene expression in diverse developmental programs and adaptive responses mef recognizes dna and interacts with transcription cofactors through a highly conserved n terminal domain referred to as the mads box mef domain here we present the crystal structure of the mads box mef domain of mef a bound to dna in contrast to previous structural studies showing that the mef domain of mef a is partially unstructured the present study reveals that the mef domain participates with the mads box in both dimerization and dna binding as a single domain the sequence divergence at and immediately following the c terminal end of the mef domain may allow different mef dimers to recognize different dna sequences in the flanking regions the current structure also suggests that the ligand binding pocket previously observed in the cabin  mef b  dna complex and the hdac  histone deacetylase   mef b  dna complex is not induced by cofactor binding but rather preformed by intrinsic folding however the structure of the ligand binding pocket does undergo subtle but significant conformational changes upon cofactor binding on the basis of these observations we generated a homology model of mef bound to a myocardin family protein mastr that acts as a potent coactivator of mef dependent gene expression the model shows excellent shape and chemical complementarity at the binding interface and is consistent with existing mutagenesis data the apo structure presented here can also serve as a target for virtual screening and soaking studies of small molecules that can modulate the function of mef as research tools and therapeutic leads
