characterization of the small antisense ci rna that regulates bacteriophage p immunity edited by m gottesman
in the immune state bacteriophage p prevents expression of the replication functions by premature termination of transcription a small rna the ci rna is the trans acting factor that regulates p immunity by pairing to complementary target sequences and causing premature transcription termination the ci rna is matured by rnase p and pnpase from the leader region of the same operon it regulates in this work we better characterize this molecule ci rna copy number was determined to be around   molecules per lysogenic cell by s mapping we defined the   end at      thus ci rna is     nt long the minimum region for correct processing requires two bases upstream of the ci rna   end and the cca sequence at the   end computer analysis by fold rna of ci rna sequence predicts a cloverleaf like structure formed by a double stranded stalk a minor and a major stem loop and a single stranded bulge we analysed several ci mutations which fall either in the single or double stranded ci rna regions base substitutions in the main loop and in the single stranded bulge apparently did not change ci rna structure but affected its activity by altering the complementarity with the target sequences whereas a mutation in the secondary stem had a disruptive effect on ci rna secondary structure the effects of this latter mutation were suppressed by a base substitution that restored the complementarity with the corresponding base in the stem base substitutions in the main stem caused only local alterations in the secondary structure of ci however when the substitutions concerned either g   or its complementary base at the bottom of the stem ci rna was not correctly processed
