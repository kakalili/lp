dna polymerase residue phe  of the highly conserved s t lx h motif is required for a stable and functional interaction with the terminal protein
bacteriophage   encodes a dna dependent dna polymerase belonging to the eukaryotic type family b subgroup of dna polymerases that use a protein as primer for initiation of dna replication by multiple sequence alignments of dna polymerases from such a family we have been able to identify two amino acid residues specifically conserved in the protein priming subgroup of dna polymerases a phenylalanine contained in the s t lx h motif and a glutamate belonging to the exo iii motif here we have studied the functional role of these residues in reactions that are specific for dna polymerases that use a protein primed dna replication mechanism by site directed mutagenesis in the corresponding amino acid residues phe  and glu  of   dna polymerase mutations introduced at residue phe  severely impaired the protein primed replication capacity of the polymerase being the interaction with the terminal protein tp moderately mutant f  a or severely mutant f  y diminished as a consequence very few initiation products were obtained and essentially no transition products were detected interestingly    dna polymerase mutant f  y showed a decreased binding affinity for short template dna molecules these results together with the high degree of conservation of phe  residue among protein primed dna polymerases suggest a functional role for this amino acid residue in making contacts with the tp during the first steps of genome replication and with dna in the further replication steps
