identification and characterization of single chain anti cocaine catalytic antibodies
cocaine is a powerful and addictive stimulant whose abuse remains a prevalent health and societal crisis unfortunately no pharmacological therapies exist and therefore alternative protein based therapies have been examined one such approach is immunopharmacotherapy wherein antibodies are utilized to either bind or hydrolyze cocaine thereby blocking it from exerting its euphoric effect towards this end antibodies capable of binding and hydrolyzing cocaine were identified by phage display from a biased single chain antibody library generated from the spleens of mice previously immunized with a cocaine phosphonate transition state analog hapten two classes of antibodies emerged based on sequence homology and mode of action alanine scanning mutagenesis and kinetic analysis revealed that residues h  h  and l  are crucial for antibodies f and h to accelerate the hydrolysis of cocaine antibodies f through f  which are similar to our previously identified a class of antibodies catalyze hydrolysis through transition state stabilization by tyrosine or histidine residues h  and l  mutation of either one or both tyrosine residues to histidine conferred hydrolytic activity on previously inactive antibody f  mutational analysis of residue h  of antibody f resulted in a glutamine mutant with a rate enhancement three times greater than wild type a double mutant containing glutamineh  and lysineh  showed a tenfold rate enhancement over wild type these results indicate the power of initial selection of catalytic antibodies from a biased antibody library in both rapid generation and screening of mutants for improved catalysis
