role of e coli transcription repair coupling factor mfd in nun mediated transcription termination
phage hk  nun protein excludes phage  by binding nascent  nut rna and inducing termination and transcript release in contrast in a purified in vitro system nun arrests transcription on  dna templates without dissociation of the transcription elongation complex tec  our evidence indicates that transcription repair coupling factor mfd frees nun arrested rna polymerase the activity of nun is enhanced in an mfd null mutant consistent with prolonged association of nun with the tec furthermore expression of  nut rna in the mfd mutant titrates nun allowing superinfecting  to form plaques finally addition of mfd releases a nun arrested transcription complex in vitro
