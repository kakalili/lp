thermotoga maritima iscu structural characterization and dynamics of a new class of metallochaperone
members of the iscu family of proteins are among the most conserved of all protein groups extending across all three kingdoms of life iscu serves as a scaffold for the assembly of intermediate iron  sulfur cluster centers and further mediates delivery to apo protein targets several proteins that mediate delivery of single metal ions to apo targets termed metallochaperones have recently been characterized structurally each displays a ferredoxin like       motif as a structural core assembly and delivery of a polynuclear iron  sulfur cluster is however a more complex pathway and presumably would demand a distinctive protein mediator here we demonstrate thermotoga maritima iscu tm iscu to display unique structural and motional characteristics that distinguish it from other members of this class of proteins in particular iscu adopts a mobile physiologically relevant molten globule like state that is vastly different from the previously identified ferredoxin like fold that has thus far been characterized for other metallochaperones the secondary structural content of tm iscu is consistent with previous circular dichroism measurements on apo and holo protein consisting of six  helices and three  strands the latter forming an anti parallel  sheet extensive dynamics studies are consistent with a protein that has reasonably well defined secondary structural elements but with a tertiary structure that is fluxional among widely different conformational arrangements analogous conformational flexibility does not exist in other structurally characterized metallochaperones however such a dynamic molecule may account for the lack of long range noes and allow both for the flexibility that is necessary for the multiple roles of fe  s cluster assembly and recognition and delivery of that cluster to a target protein additionally the fluxionality of iscu is unique in that the protein appears to be more compact based on h h exchange r  r  and noe data but yet more fluid lack of long range noes than typical molten globule proteins
