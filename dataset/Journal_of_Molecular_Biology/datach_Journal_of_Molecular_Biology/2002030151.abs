protein splicing reaction via a thiazolidine intermediate crystal structure of the vma derived endonuclease bearing the n and c terminal propeptides
protein splicing excises an internal intein segment from a protein precursor precisely and concomitantly ligates flanking n and c extein polypeptides at the respective sides of the precursor here a series of precursor recombinants bearing  n extein and ten c extein residues is prepared for the intein of the saccharomyces cerevisiae vma derived homing endonuclease referred to as vde and as pi scei the recombinant with replacements of c  s h  n n  s and c  s is chosen as a spliceable precursor model and is then subjected to a    resolution crystallographic analysis the crystal structure shows that the introduced extein polypeptides are located in the vicinity of the splicing site and that each of their peptide bonds is in the trans conformation the s  o  atom located at a distance of    from the g  c atom in the n terminal junction suggests that a nucleophilic attack of the c  s  atom on the g  c atom forms a tetrahedral intermediate containing a five membered thiazolidine ring the tetrahedral intermediate is supposedly resolved into a thioester acyl group upon the cleavage of the linkage between the g  c and c  n atoms and this thioester acyl formation completes the initial steps of n  s acyl shift at the junction between the n extein and intein the s  o  atom in the c terminal junction is placed in close proximity to the s  o  atom at a distance of    and is well suited for another nucleophilic attack on the resultant thioester acyl group that is then subjected to the transesterification in the next step the reaction steps proposed for the acyl shift are driven entirely by protonation and deprotonation in which proton ingress and egress is balanced within the splicing site
