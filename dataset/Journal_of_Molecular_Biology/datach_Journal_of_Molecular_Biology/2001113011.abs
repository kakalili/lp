the crystal structure of a hyper thermophilic carboxylesterase from the archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus edited by r huber
the crystal structure of afest a novel hyper thermophilic carboxylesterase from the archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus complexed with a sulphonyl derivative has been determined and refined to    resolution this enzyme which has recently been classified as a member of the hormone sensitive lipase h group of the esterase lipase superfamily presents a canonical    hydrolase core shielded on the c terminal side by a cap region composed of five  helices it contains the catalytic triad ser   his  and asp   whereby the nucleophile is covalently modified and the oxyanion hole formed by gly  gly  and ala   a structural comparison of afest with its mesophilic and thermophilic homologues brefeldin a esterase from bacillus subtilis bfae and est from alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius reveals an increase in the number of intramolecular ion pairs and secondary structure content as well as a significant reduction in loop extensions and ratio of hydrophobic to charged surface area the variety of structural differences suggests possible strategies for thermostabilization of lipases and esterases with potential industrial applications
