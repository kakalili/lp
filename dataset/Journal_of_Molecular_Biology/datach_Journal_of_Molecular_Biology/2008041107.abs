conformational changes and reaction of clostridial glycosylating toxins
the crystal structures of the catalytic fragments of  lethal toxin  from clostridium sordellii and of    toxin  from clostridium novyi have been established almost half of the residues follow the chain fold of the glycosyl transferase type a family of enzymes the other half forms large  helical protrusions that are likely to confer specificity for the respective targeted subgroup of rho proteins in the cell in the crystal the active center of  toxin contained no substrates and was disassembled whereas that of lethal toxin which was ligated with the donor substrate udp glucose and cofactor mn  was catalytically competent surprisingly the structure of lethal toxin with ca  instead of mn  at the cofactor position showed a bound donor substrate with a disassembled active center indicating that the strictly octahedral coordination sphere of mn  is indispensable to the integrity of the enzyme the homologous structures of  toxin without substrate distorted lethal toxin with ca  plus donor active lethal toxin with mn  plus donor and the homologous clostridium difficile toxin b with a hydrolyzed donor have been lined up to show the geometry of several reaction steps interestingly the structural refinement of one of the three crystallographically independent molecules of ca  ligated lethal toxin resulted in the glucosyl half chair conformation expected for glycosyl transferases that retain the anomeric configuration at the c   atom a superposition of six acceptor substrates bound to homologous enzymes yielded the position of the nucleophilic acceptor atom with a deviation of lt    the resulting donor  acceptor geometry suggests that the reaction runs as a circular electron transfer in a six membered ring which involves the deprotonation of the nucleophile by the  phosphoryl group of the donor substrate udp glucose
