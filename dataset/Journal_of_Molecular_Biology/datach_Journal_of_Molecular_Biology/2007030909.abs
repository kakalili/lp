mutational analyses define helix organization and key residues of a bacterial membrane energy transducing complex
in gram negative bacteria many biological processes are coupled to inner membrane ion gradients ions transit at the interface of helices of integral membrane proteins generating mechanical energy to drive energetic processes to better understand how ions transit through these channels we used a model system involved in two different processes one of which depends on inner membrane energy the tol machinery of the escherichia coli cell envelope is dedicated to maintaining outer membrane stability a process driven by the proton motive force the tol system is parasitized by bacterial toxins called colicins which are imported through the outer membrane using an energy independent process herein we mutated tolq and tolr transmembrane residues and we analyzed the mutants for outer membrane stability colicin import and protein complex formation we identified residues involved in the assembly of the complex and a new class of discriminative mutations that conferred outer membrane destabilization identical to a tol deletion mutant but which remained fully sensitive to colicins further genetic approaches revealed transmembrane helix interactions and organization in the bilayer and suggested that most of the discriminative residues are located in a putative aqueous ion channel we discuss a model for the function of related bacterial molecular motors
