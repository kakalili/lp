the crystal structure of the active form of the c terminal kinase domain of mitogen and stress activated protein kinase
mitogen and stress activated protein kinase  msk  is a growth factor stimulated serine threonine kinase that is involved in gene transcription regulation and proinflammatory cytokine stimulation msk is a dual kinase possessing two nonidentical protein kinase domains in one polypeptide we present the active conformation of the crystal structures of its c terminal kinase domain in apo form and in complex with a nonhydrolyzable atp analogue at     and     resolutions respectively structural analysis revealed substantial differences in the contacts formed by the c terminal helix which is responsible for the inactivity of other autoinhibited kinases in the c terminal kinase domain of msk  the c terminal  l helix is located in the surface groove but forms no hydrogen bonds with the substrate binding loop or nearby helices and does not interfere with the protein s autophosphorylation activity mutational analysis confirmed that the  l helix is inherently nonautoinhibitory overexpression of the single c terminal kinase domain in jb cells resulted in tumor promoter induced neoplastic transformation in a manner similar to that induced by the full length msk protein the overall results suggest that the c terminal kinase domain of msk is regulated by a novel  l helix independent mechanism suggesting that a diverse mechanism of autoinhibition and activation might be adopted by members of a closely related protein kinase family
