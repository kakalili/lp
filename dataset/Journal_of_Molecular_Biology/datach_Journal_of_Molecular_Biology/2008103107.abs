the crystal and molecular structures of a cathepsin k chondroitin sulfate complex
cathepsin k is the major collagenolytic enzyme produced by bone resorbing osteoclasts we showed earlier that the unique triple helical collagen degrading activity of cathepsin k depends on the formation of complexes with bone or cartilage resident glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin  sulfate c s  here we describe the crystal structure of a  n complex of cathepsin k c s inhibited by e  at a resolution of     the overall structure reveals an unusual  beads on a string  like organization multiple cathepsin k molecules bind specifically to a single cosine curve shaped strand of c s with each cathepsin k molecule interacting with three disaccharide residues of c s one of the more important sets of interactions comes from a single turn of helix close to the n terminus of the proteinase containing a basic amino acid triplet arg lys lys  that forms multiple hydrogen bonds either to the caboxylate or to the  sulfate groups of c s altogether the binding sites with c s are located in the r domain of cathepsin k and are distant from its active site this explains why the general proteolytic activity of cathepsin k is not affected by the binding of chondroitin sulfate biochemical analyses of cathepsin k and c s mixtures support the presence of a  n complex in solution a dissociation constant kd of about   nm was determined for the interaction between cathepsin k and c s
