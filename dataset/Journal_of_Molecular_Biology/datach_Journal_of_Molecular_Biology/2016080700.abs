ribonucleotides and transcription associated mutagenesis in yeast
high levels of transcription stimulate mutation rates in microorganisms and this occurs primarily through an enhanced accumulation of dna damage the major source of transcription associated damage in yeast is topoisomerase i top  an enzyme that removes torsional stress that accumulates when dna strands are separated top relieves torsional stress by nicking and resealing one dna strand and some top dependent mutations are due to trapping and processing of the covalent cleavage intermediate most however reflect enzyme incision at ribonucleotides which are the most abundant noncanonical component of dna in either case top generates a distinctive mutation signature composed of short deletions in tandem repeats in the specific case of ribonucleotide initiated events mutations reflect sequential cleavage by the enzyme top dependent mutations do not require highly activated transcription but their levels are greatly increased by transcription which partially reflects an interaction of top with rna polymerase recent studies have demonstrated that top dependent mutations exhibit a strand bias with the nature of the bias differing depending on the transcriptional status of the underlying dna under low transcription conditions most top dependent mutations arise in the context of replication and reflect incision at ribonucleotides incorporated during leading strand synthesis under high transcription conditions most top dependent events arise when the enzyme cleaves the non transcribed strand of dna in addition to increasing genetic instability in growing cells top activity in transcriptionally active regions may be a source of mutations in quiescent cells
