projection structure of the secondary citrate sodium symporter cits at    resolution by electron crystallography
cits from klebsiella pneumoniae acts as a secondary symporter of citrate and sodium ions across the inner membrane of the host the protein is the best characterized member of the  hydroxycarboxylate transporter family while no experimental structural information at sub nanometer resolution is available on this class of membrane proteins here we applied electron crystallography to two dimensional crystals of cits carbon film adsorbed tubular two dimensional crystals were studied by cryo electron microscopy producing the   resolution projection structure of the membrane embedded protein in the p   symmetrized projection map the predicted dimeric structure is clearly visible each monomeric unit can tentatively be interpreted as being composed of  transmembrane  helices in projection cits shows a high degree of structural similarity to nhap  the na h antiporter of methanococcus jannaschii we discuss possible locations for the dimer interface and models for the helical arrangements and domain organizations of the symporter based on existing models
