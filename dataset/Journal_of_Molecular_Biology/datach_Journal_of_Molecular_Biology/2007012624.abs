the mechanism of discrimination between cognate and non specific dna by dimeric b hlh lz transcription factors
the myc max mad proteins are basic region helix loop helix leucine zipper b hlh lz transcription factors that regulate the transcription of numerous genes involved in cell growth and proliferation the max protein is the obligate heterodimeric partner of the myc and mad proteins heterodimerization and dna binding to target gene promoters are mediated by the b hlh lz domains max can also form a homodimeric b hlh lz the enhanced expression of myc and binding to promoters of target genes contribute to almost every aspect of tumor biology however the detailed mechanism by which dimeric and heterodimeric b hlh lzs discriminate cognate dna e box cacgtg from non specific sequences in the target gene promoters is still unknown here we use the max b hlh lz homodimer as a model for this class of transcription factors in the characterization and understanding of the mechanism of discrimination between the e box and non specific dna sequences we report the characterization of a cognate and a non specific max b hlh lz dna complex by emsa cd and nmr our results support a detailed mechanism by which dimeric b hlh lz transcription factors can discriminate e box sequences from non specific dna the mechanism proceeds via the conformational selection of fitting b hlh lz homodimers with the basic region only partially helical next the basic region undergoes a dna assisted folding or induced fit it is this step that provides the discrimination by stabilizing and destabilizing the  helical conformation of the basic region in the cognate and non specific complexes respectively this leads to a low affinity complex with a higher probability of being dissociated and hence to discrimination a description of the side chains and nucleotides proposed to be involved in the discrimination process is provided
