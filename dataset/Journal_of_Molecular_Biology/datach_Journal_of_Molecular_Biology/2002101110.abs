nmr structure of bacterial ribosomal protein l  implications for ribosome assembly and translational control
l  is a specific protein of the bacterial ribosome which is involved in the early assembly steps of the  s subunit and in the feedback control of the expression of its own gene this dual function involves specific interactions with either the  s rrna or its messenger rna the solution structure of the free aquifex aeolicus l  has been solved it is composed of an unstructured n terminal domain comprising residues    and a c terminal  helical domain this is in contrast with what is observed in the bacterial  s subunit where the n terminal region folds as an elongated  helical region the solution structure of the c terminal domain shows that several solvent accessible conserved residues are clustered on the surface of the molecule and are probably involved in rna recognition in vivo studies show that this domain is sufficient to repress the expression of the cistrons encoding l  and l  in the if operon the ability of l  c terminal domain to specifically recognise rna suggests an assembly mechanism for l  into the ribosome the pre folded c terminal domain would make a primary interaction with a specific site on the  s rrna the n terminal domain would then fold within the ribosome participating in its correct d assembly
