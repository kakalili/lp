a comparison of in vitro nucleosome positioning mapped with chicken frog and a variety of yeast core histones
using high throughput sequencing we have mapped sequence directed nucleosome positioning in vitro on four plasmid dnas containing dna fragments derived from the genomes of sheep drosophila human and yeast chromatins were prepared by reconstitution using chicken frog and yeast core histones we also assembled yeast chromatin in which histone h was replaced by the centromere specific histone variant cse  the positions occupied by recombinant frog and native chicken histones were found to be very similar in contrast nucleosomes containing the canonical yeast octamer or in particular the cse octamer were assembled at distinct populations of locations a property that was more apparent on particular genomic dna fragments the factors that may contribute to this variation in nucleosome positioning and the implications of the behavior are discussed
