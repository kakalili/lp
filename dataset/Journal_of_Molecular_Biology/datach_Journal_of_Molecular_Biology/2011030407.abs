site specific coupling and sterically controlled formation of multimeric antibody fab fragments with unnatural amino acids
immunoconjugates and multispecific antibodies are rapidly emerging as highly potent experimental therapeutics against cancer we have developed a method to incorporate an unnatural amino acid p acetylphenylalanine pacphe into an antibody antigen binding fragment fab targeting her  human epidermal growth factor receptor   allowing site specific labeling without disrupting antigen binding expression levels of the pacphe containing proteins were comparable to that of wild type protein in shake flask and fermentation preparations the pacphe  fabs were labeled by reaction with hydroxylamine dye and biotin species to produce well  defined singly conjugated fabs we then coupled a hydroxylamine biotin to the pacphe  fab and demonstrated controlled assembly of fabs in the presence of the tetrameric biotin binding protein neutravidin the position of fab biotinylation dictates the geometry of multimer assembly producing unique multimeric fab structures these assembled fab multimers differentially attenuate her phosphorylation in breast cancer cells that overexpress the her receptor thus an encoded unnatural amino acid produces a chemical  handle  by which immunoconjugates and multimers can be engineered
