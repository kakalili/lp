crystal structure of the ly i natural killer cell receptor reveals variability in dimerization mode within the ly  family
natural killer nk cells play a crucial role in the detection and destruction of virally infected and tumor cells during innate immune responses the cytolytic activity of nk cells is regulated through a balance of inhibitory and stimulatory signals delivered by nk receptors that recognize classical major histocompatabilty complex class i mhc i molecules or mhc i homologs such as mica on target cells the ly  family of nk receptors ly a through w  which includes both inhibitory and activating receptors are homodimeric type ii transmembrane glycoproteins with each subunit composed of a c type lectin like domain tethered to the membrane by a stalk region we have determined the crystal structure at    resolution of the murine inhibitory nk receptor ly i the ly i monomer adopts a fold similar to that of other c type lectin like nk receptors including ly a nkg d and cd  however the ly i monomers associate in a manner distinct from that of these other nk receptors forming a more open dimer as a result the putative mhc binding surfaces of the ly i dimer are spatially more distant than the corresponding surfaces of ly a or nkg d these structural differences probably reflect the fundamentally different ways in which ly  and nkg d receptors recognize their respective ligands whereas the single mica binding site of nkg d is formed by the precise juxtaposition of two monomers each ly  monomer contains an independent binding site for mhc i hence the structural constraints on dimerization geometry may be relatively relaxed within the ly  family such variability may enable certain ly  receptors like ly i to bind mhc i molecules bivalently thereby stabilizing receptor  ligand interactions and enhancing signal transmission to the nk cell
