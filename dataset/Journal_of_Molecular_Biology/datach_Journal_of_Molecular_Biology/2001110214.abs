trypanosoma brucei   ets a  cleavage is directed by   adjacent sequences but not two u snorna binding elements which are all required for subsequent pre small subunit rrna processing events edited by d draper
trypanosoma brucei pre rrna processing commences by cleavage near the   end of   s sequences the   external transcribed spacer   ets is removed from pre small subunit ssu rrnas by sequential cleavages at internal a  and a sites and a at the   end of ssu rrna the a  and a sites positionally resemble the u small nucleolar rna dependent primary pre rrna cleavages of vertebrates and yeast respectively uniquely in t brucei two u crosslinkable   ets sites are essential for ssu rrna production site b is novel in its   location to the a  site and site lies upstream of a in a position analogous to the yeast u binding site here in vivo analysis of mutated   ets sequences shows that sequences   to the a  site are not needed for a  cleavage or ssu rrna production a  cleavage is linked to but is not sufficient to trigger downstream pre ssu rrna processing events these events require an intact  nt sequence    adjacent to a   which directs efficient and accurate a  cleavage neither the a  nearby site b nor the site u binding elements affect a  processing yet each is required for a and a cleavage and ssu rrna production the same u    hinge bases evidently bind a core element uguu gggu within site a and site  the u site b interaction is less reliant on base pairing than the u site interaction as yeast u    hinge bases pair to   ets sequences it is clear that distinct u hinge regions can interact at both novel and related   ets sites to promote   proximal   ets processing events in diverse organisms the t brucei data fit a model wherein processing factors assemble at the   ets site a to affect a  cleavage and stabilize a u site b complex which may work in concert with the downstream u site complex to assist processing events leading to ribosomal ssu production
