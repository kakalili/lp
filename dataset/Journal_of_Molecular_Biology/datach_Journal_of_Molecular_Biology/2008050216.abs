amino acid starvation and colicin d treatment induce a site mrna cleavage in escherichia coli
escherichia coli possesses a unique rnase activity that cleaves stop codons in the ribosomal aminoacyl trna binding site a site during inefficient translation termination this a site mrna cleavage allows recycling of arrested ribosomes by facilitating recruitment of the tmrna  smpb ribosome rescue system to test whether a site nuclease activity also cleaves sense codons we induced ribosome pausing at each of the six arginine codons using three strategies rare codon usage arginine starvation and inactivation of arginine trnas with colicin d in each instance ribosome pausing induced mrna cleavage within the target arginine codons and resulted in tmrna mediated ssra peptide tagging of the nascent polypeptide a site mrna cleavage did not require the stringent factor ppgpp or bacterial toxins such as rele which mediates a similar nuclease activity however the efficiency of a site cleavage was modulated by the identity of the two codons immediately upstream    side of the a site codon starvation for histidine and tryptophan also induced a site cleavage at histidine and tryptophan codons respectively thus a site mrna cleavage is a general response to ribosome pausing capable of cleaving a variety of sense and stop codons the induction of a site cleavage during amino acid starvation suggests this nuclease activity may help to regulate protein synthesis during nutritional stress
