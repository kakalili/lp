three dimensional structure of vertebrate muscle z band the small square lattice z band in rat cardiac muscle
the z band in vertebrate striated muscle crosslinks actin filaments of opposite polarity from adjoining sarcomeres and transmits tension along myofibrils during muscular contraction it is also the location of a number of proteins involved in signalling and myofibrillogenesis mutations in these proteins lead to myopathies understanding the high resolution structure of the z band will help us understand its role in muscle contraction and the role of these proteins in the function of muscle the appearance of the z band in transverse section electron micrographs typically resembles a small square lattice or a basketweave appearance in longitudinal sections the z band width varies more with muscle type than species slow skeletal and cardiac muscles have wider z bands than fast skeletal muscles as the z band is periodic fourier methods have previously been used for three dimensional structural analysis to cope with variations in the periodic structure of the z band we have used subtomogram averaging of tomograms of rat cardiac muscle in which subtomograms are extracted and compared and similar ones are averaged we show that the z band comprises four to six layers of links presumably  actinin linking antiparallel overlapping ends of the actin filaments from the adjoining sarcomeres the reconstruction shows that the terminal   nm of the actin filaments within the z band is devoid of any  actinin links and is likely to be the location of capping protein capz
