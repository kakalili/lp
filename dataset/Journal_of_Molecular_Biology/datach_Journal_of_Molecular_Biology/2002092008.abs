evaluation of c  h  o hydrogen bonds in native and misfolded proteins
non traditional c  h  y hydrogen bonds in which a carbon atom acts as the hydrogen donor and an electronegative atom y y n o or s acts as the acceptor have been reported in proteins but their importance in protein structures is not well established here we present the results of three computational tests that examine the significance of c  h  y bonds involving the c  in proteins first we compared the number of c   h  y bonds in native structures with two sets of compact energy minimized decoy structures the decoy structures contain about as many c   h  y bonds as the native structures indicating that the constraints of chain connectivity and compactness can lead to incidental formation of c   h  y bonds secondly we examined whether short c   h  y bonds have a tendency to be linear as is expected for a cohesive hydrogen bonding interaction the native structures do show this trend but so does one of the decoy sets suggesting that this criterion is also not sufficient to indicate a stabilizing interaction finally we examined the preference for c   h  y bond donors to be near to strong hydrogen bond acceptors in the native proteins the alpha protons attract strong acceptors like oxygen atoms more than weak acceptors in contrast hydrogen bond donors in the decoy structures do not distinguish between strong and weak acceptors thus any individual c   h  y bond may be fortuitous and occur due to the polypeptide connectivity and compactness taken collectively however c   h  y bonds provide a weakly cohesive force that stabilizes proteins
