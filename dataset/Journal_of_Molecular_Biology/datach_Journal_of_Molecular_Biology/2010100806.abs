crystal structures of the substrate bound forms of red chlorophyll catabolite reductase implications for site specific and stereospecific reaction
red chlorophyll catabolite reductase rccr catalyzes the ferredoxin dependent reduction of the c  c double bond of red chlorophyll catabolite rcc  the catabolic intermediate produced in chlorophyll degradation the crystal structure of substrate free arabidopsis thaliana rccr atrccr demonstrated that rccr folds into a characteristic     sandwich similar to that observed in the ferredoxin dependent bilin reductase fdbr family here we have determined the crystal structures of rcc bound atrccr rcc bound f  v atrccr and substrate free f  v atrccr a mutant protein that produces the stereoisomer of primary fluorescent chlorophyll catabolites at the c position rcc is bound to the pocket between the  sheet and the c terminal  helices as seen in substrate bound fdbrs but rcc binding to rccr is much looser than substrate binding to fdbrs the loose binding seems beneficial to the large conformational change in rcc upon reduction two conserved acidic residues glu  and asp   sandwich the c  c double bond of rcc suggesting that these two residues are involved in site specific reduction the rcc in f  v atrccr rotates slightly compared with that in wild type to fill in the space generated by the substitution of phe  with valine concomitantly the two carboxy groups of glu  and asp  move slightly away from the c  c double bond the geometrical arrangement of rcc and the carboxy groups of glu  and asp  in rccr would appear to be essential for the stereospecificity of the rccr reaction
