the terminal inverted repeats of is   requirements for synaptic complex assembly and activity edited by i b holland
the bacterial insertion sequence is  transposes via a covalently closed circular intermediate circle formation involves transposase mediated pairing of both insertion sequence ends while full length transposase orfab binds poorly in vitro to is  dna fragments carrying a copy of the is  end truncated protein derivatives carrying the first   orfab      or   orfab      amino acid residues bind efficiently they generate a paired end complex containing two such fragments which resembles that expected for the first synaptic complex shorter protein derivatives lacking a region involved in multimerisation do not form these complexes but modify the binding of orfab     and orfab      dnasei footprinting demonstrated that orfab     protects a sub terminal internal region of the inverted repeats which includes two blocks of sequence   and   conserved between the left irl and right irr ends dna binding assays in vitro and measurement of recombination activity in vivo of sequential deletion derivatives of the two inverted repeats suggested a model in which the n terminal region of orfab binds the conserved boxes  and  in a sequence specific manner and anchors the two insertion sequence ends into a paired end complex the external region of the inverted repeat is proposed to contact the c terminal transposase domain carrying the catalytic site
