functional characterization of the enhancer blocking element of the sea urchin early histone gene cluster reveals insulator properties and three essential cis acting sequences
insulator elements can be functionally identified by their ability to shield promoters from regulators in a position dependent manner or their ability to protect adjacent transgenes from position effects we have previously reported the identification of a  bp sns dna fragment at the   end of the sea urchin h a early histone gene that blocked expression of a reporter gene in transgenic embryos when placed between the enhancer and the promoter here we show that sns interferes with enhancer promoter interaction in a directional manner when sns is placed between the h a modulator and the inducible tet operator the modulator is barred from interaction with the basal promoter however the tet activator tta can still activate the promoter even in the presence of sns demonstrating that sns does not interfere with activity of a downstream enhancer in addition the h a modulator can still drive expression of a divergently oriented transcription unit suggesting that sns does not inhibit binding of transcription factor s to the enhancer to identify cis acting sequence elements within sns which are responsible for insulator activity we have performed in vitro dnase i footprinting and emsa analysis and in vivo functional assays by microinjection into sea urchin embryos we have identified three binding sites for protein complexes a palindrome a direct repeat and a c t sequence that corresponds to seven gaga motifs on the transcribed strand insulator function requires all three cis acting elements based on these results we conclude that sns displays properties similar to the best characterized insulators and suggest that directional blocking of enhancer activated transcription by sns depends on the assembly of distinct dna protein complexes
