the phd finger of p  influences its ability to acetylate histone and non histone targets
in enzymes that regulate chromatin structure the combinatorial occurrence of modules that alter and recognise histone modifications is a recurrent feature in this study we explored the functional relationship between the acetyltransferase domain and the adjacent bromodomain phd finger bromo phd region of the transcriptional coactivator p   we found that the bromo phd region of p  can bind to the acetylated catalytic domain in vitro and augment the catalytic activity of the enzyme deletion of the phd finger but not the bromodomain impaired the ability of the enzyme to acetylate histones in vivo whilst it enhanced p  self acetylation a point mutation in the p  phd finger that is related to the rubinstein taybi syndrome resulted in increased self acetylation but retained the ability to acetylate histones hence the phd finger appears to negatively regulate self acetylation furthermore our data suggest that the phd finger has a role in the recruitment of p  to chromatin
