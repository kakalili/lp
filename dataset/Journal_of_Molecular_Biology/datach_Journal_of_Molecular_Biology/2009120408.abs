crystal structures of leishmania mexicana phosphoglycerate mutase suggest a one metal mechanism and a new enzyme subclass
the structures of leishmania mexicana cofactor independent phosphoglycerate mutase lm ipgam crystallised with the substrate  phosphoglycerate at high and low cobalt concentrations have been solved at    and     resolutions both structures are very similar and the active site contains both  phosphoglycerate and  phosphoglycerate at equal occupancies    lm ipgam co crystallised with the product  phosphoglycerate yields the same structure two co  are coordinated within the active site with different geometries and affinities the cobalt at the m site has a distorted octahedral geometry and is present at   occupancy the m site co  binds with distorted tetrahedral geometry with only partial occupancy and coordinates with ser  the residue involved in phosphotransfer when the m site is occupied the side chain of ser  adopts a position that is unfavourable for catalysis indicating that this site may not be occupied under physiological conditions and that catalysis may occur via a one metal mechanism the geometry of the m site suggests that it is possible for ser  to be activated for phosphotransfer by h bonding to nearby residues rather than by metal coordination the  active site residues of lm ipgam are conserved in the mn dependent ipgam from bacillus stearothermophilus   overall sequence identity  however lm ipgam has an inserted tyrosine tyr   that causes the m site to diminish in size consistent with its reduced metal affinity tyr  is present in trypanosomatid and plant ipgams but not in the enzymes from other organisms indicating that there are two subclasses of ipgams
