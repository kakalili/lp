origin of unusual  values in protein folding evidence against specific nucleation sites
f value analysis is one of the most common methods to characterize the structure of protein folding transition states it compares the effects of mutations on the folding kinetics with the respective effects on equilibrium stability the interpretation of the results usually focuses on a few unusual  f values which are either particularly high or which are larger than  or smaller than  these mutations are believed to affect the most important regions for the folding process a major uncertainty in experimental  f values is introduced by the commonly used analysis of only a single mutant at various positions in a protein two point analysis  to test the reliability of two point  f values we used reference data from three positions in two different proteins at which multiple mutations have been introduced the results show that two point  f values are highly inaccurate if the difference in stability between two variants is less than  kj mol corresponding to a  fold difference in equilibrium constant comparison with reported  f values for  proteins shows that most unusual  f values are observed in mutants which show changes in protein stability that are too small to allow a reliable analysis the results argue against specific nucleation sites in protein folding and give a picture of transition states as distorted native states for the major part of a protein or for large substructures
