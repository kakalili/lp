structural and dynamic determinants of ligand binding and regulation of cyclin dependent kinase  by pathological activator p  and inhibitory peptide cip
the crystal structure of the cdk p  complex has provided information on possible molecular mechanisms of the ligand binding specificity and regulation of the kinase comparative molecular dynamics simulations are reported here for physiological conditions this study provides new insight on the mechanisms that modulate such processes which may be exploited to control pathological activation by p  the structural changes observed in the kinase are stabilized by a network of interactions involving highly conserved residues within the cyclin dependent kinase cdk family collective motions of the proteins cdk  p  and cip and their complexes are identified by principal component analysis revealing two conformational states of the activation loop upon p  complexation which are absent in the uncomplexed kinase and not apparent from the crystal simulations of the uncomplexed inhibitor cip show structural rearrangements and increased flexibility of the interfacial loop containing the critical residue e   which becomes fully hydrated and available for interactions with one of several positively charged residues in the kinase these changes provide a rationale for the observed high affinity and enhanced inhibitory action of cip when compared to either p  or the physiological activators of cdk
