extracellular regulated kinase  is activated by the enhancement of hinge flexibility
protein motions underlie conformational and entropic contributions to enzyme catalysis however relatively little is known about the ways in which this occurs studies of the mitogen activated protein kinase erk  extracellular regulated protein kinase  by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry suggest that activation enhances backbone flexibility at the linker between n and c terminal domains while altering nucleotide binding mode here we address the hypothesis that enhanced backbone flexibility within the hinge region facilitates kinase activation we show that hinge mutations enhancing flexibility promote changes in the nucleotide binding mode consistent with domain movement without requiring phosphorylation they also lead to the activation of monophosphorylated erk  a form that is normally inactive the hinge mutations bypass the need for ptyr but not pthr suggesting that tyr phosphorylation controls hinge motions in agreement monophosphorylation of ptyr enhances both hinge flexibility and nucleotide binding mode measured by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry our findings demonstrate that regulated protein motions underlie kinase activation our working model is that constraints to domain movement in erk are overcome by phosphorylation at ptyr which increases hinge dynamics to promote the active conformation of the catalytic site
