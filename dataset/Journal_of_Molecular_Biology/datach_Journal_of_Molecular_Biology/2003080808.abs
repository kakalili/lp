the trna like domains of e coli and a aeolicus transfer  messenger rna structural and functional studies
transfer  messenger rna tmrna  sa rna or ssra acts to rescue stalled bacterial ribosomes while encoding a peptide tag added trans translationally to the nascent peptide targeting it for proteolysis the understanding at molecular level of this ubiquitous quality control system in eubacteria requires structural information here we describe the purification and structural analysis of a functional fragment of both aquifex aeolicus and escherichia coli tmrna recapitulating their trna like domain which were expressed in vivo from synthetic genes both recombinant rna are correctly processed at both   and   ends and are produced in quantities suitable for structural analysis by nmr and or x ray crystallography the sequence and solution structure of the trna like domains were analysed by various methods including structural mapping with chemical and enzymatic probes and d nmr spectroscopy the minimalist rnas contain two post transcriptional base modifications  methyluridine and pseudouridine as the full length tmrna both rnas fold into three stems a d analogue a t loop and a gaaa tetra loop  d nmr analysis of the imino proton resonances of both rnas allowed the assignment of the three stems and of a number of tertiary interactions it shows the existence of interactions between the t c loop and the d analogue exhibiting a number of similarities and also differences with the canonical trna fold indicating that rna tertiary interactions can be modulated according to the sequence and secondary structure contexts furthermore the e coli minimalist rna is aminoacylatable with alanine with a catalytic efficiency an order of magnitude higher than that for full length tmrna
