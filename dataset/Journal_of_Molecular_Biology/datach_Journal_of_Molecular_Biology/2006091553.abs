crystal structure and mechanism of tripeptidyl activity of prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from porphyromonas gingivalis
the crystal structure of prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from porphyromonas gingivalis was determined prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase consists of  propeller and catalytic domains and a large cavity between the domains this structure is similar to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase iv a catalytic triad ser   his   and asp   was located in the catalytic domain this triad was virtually identical to that of the enzymes belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family the structure of an inactive s  a mutant enzyme complexed with a substrate was also determined the pyrrolidine ring of the proline residue appeared to fit into a hydrophobic pocket composed of tyr   val   trp   tyr   tyr   val   and val   there were characteristic differences in the residues of the  propeller domain and these differences were related to the substrate specificity of tripeptidyl activity the n terminal amino group was recognized by salt bridges with two carboxyl groups of glu  and glu  from a helix in dipeptidyl aminopeptidase iv in prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase however the glu   located in the loop and glu  were found to carry out this function the loop structure provides sufficient space to accommodate three n terminal residues xaa xaa pro of substrates this is the first report of the structure and substrate recognition mechanism of tripeptidyl peptidase
