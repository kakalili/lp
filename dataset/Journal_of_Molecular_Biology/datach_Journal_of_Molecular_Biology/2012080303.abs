molecular effects of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related mutations in the tnt domain of ctnt
familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy fhc is one of the most common genetic causes of heart disease approximately   of fhc related mutations are found in ctnt cardiac troponin ctn t  most of the ctnt fhc related mutations are in or flanking the n tail tnt domain that directly interacts with overlapping tropomyosin tm  we investigate two sets of ctnt mutations at opposite ends of tnt  mutations in residue  in the tm  tm overlap region of tnt and mutations in residues   and   in the c terminal portion of tnt adjacent to the ctnt h  h linker though all the mutations are located within tnt  they have widely different phenotypes clinically and biophysically using a complete atomistic model of the ctn  tm complex we identify mechanisms by which the effects of tnt mutations propagate to the ctn core and site ii of ctnc where calcium binding and dissociation occurs we find that mutations in tnt alter the flexibility of tnt  which is inversely proportional to the cooperativity of calcium activation of the thin filament further we identify a pathway of propagation of structural and dynamic changes from tnt to site ii of ctnc including tnt  ctnt linker i t arm regulatory domain of ctni the d e linker of ctnc and site ii ctnc mutationally induced changes at site ii of ctnc alter calcium coordination that corresponds to biophysical measurements of calcium sensitivity finally we compare this pathway of mutational propagation with that of the calcium activation of the thin filament and find that they are identical but opposite in direction
