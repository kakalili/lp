defining the molecular basis of arf and hdm interactions edited by f cohen
understanding the interaction of arf and hdm has recently become a central issue in cancer biology in response to hyperproliferative signals p arf stabilizes p  by binding to hdm and inhibits the ubiquitination and subsequent proteosome dependent degradation of p  the medical importance of the arf hdm p  regulatory system is highlighted by the finding that either p  or p arf are lost or modified in virtually all human cancers isolated arf and hdm domains are dynamically disordered in solution yet they retain the ability to interact in vitro and in cellular assays upon binding domains of both arf and hdm undergo a dramatic transition from disordered conformations to extended structures comprised of  strands the presence of domains from both proteins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of the highly stable extended  structures we have mapped sites within arf and hdm that interact at a resolution of five amino acid residues using surface plasmon resonance surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry confirm the presence of multiple interaction domains within each protein both p arf human and p arf mouse interact with hdm through two short motifs present in their n termini the arf interacting region of hdm is also composed of two short sequences located in the central acidic domain between residues      and      the binding induced structural transition is also induced by short peptides   amino acids in length that contain the binding motifs micro injection and live cell imaging of proteins tagged with fluorescent labels was used to confirm the in vivo function of the interaction domains arf and hdm thus appear to interact through a novel mechanism that exerts control over the cell division cycle the novel molecular mechanism of interaction and the limited size of the protein domains involved provide opportunities for the development of anticancer therapeutics
