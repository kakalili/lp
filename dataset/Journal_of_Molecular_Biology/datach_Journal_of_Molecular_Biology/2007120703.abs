transcription coupled hypernegative supercoiling of plasmid dna by t rna polymerase in escherichia coli topoisomerase i deficient strains
transcription by rna polymerase can stimulate negative dna supercoiling in escherichia coli topa strains this phenomenon has been explained by a  twin supercoiled domain  model of transcription in which positive dna supercoils are generated in front of a translocating rna polymerase and negative supercoils behind it however since there is lack of a specific system to study the factors governing this biologically important process the parameters regulating transcription coupled dna supercoiling tcds in e coli still remain elusive here we describe our efforts to study tcds in e coli using a newly developed system this system consists of a topa strain vs  de  or dm  de  in which a  de prophage containing a t rna polymerase gene under the control of lacuv promoter has been integrated into the cell chromosome along with a set of plasmids producing rna transcripts of various lengths by t rna polymerase using this system we found that transcription by t rna polymerase strikingly induced the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid dna we also discovered for the first time that tcds was dependent on the length of rna transcripts in vivo precisely predicted by the twin supercoiled domain model of transcription furthermore our results demonstrated that hypernegative supercoiling of plasmid dna by t rna polymerase did not require anchoring of dna to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane these results indicate that a transcribing rna polymerase alone is sufficient to cause a change in local dna superhelicity which can have a powerful impact on the conformation and function of critical dna sequence elements such as promoters and dna replication origins
