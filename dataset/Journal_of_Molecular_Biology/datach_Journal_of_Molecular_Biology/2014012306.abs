novel interaction between the major bacterial heat shock chaperone groesl and an rna chaperone cspc
the heat shock response is one of the main global regulatory networks in all organisms and involves an increased cellular level of chaperones and proteases to enable correct protein folding and balanced growth one of the major heat shock chaperones in escherichia coli is groesl composed of groes and groel the bacterial hsp  and hsp  homologues  which is essential for refolding of misfolded proteins groesl was previously shown to play a role in the regulation of the heat shock response by promoting the proteolysis of the regulatory protein  sigma  rpoh  the heat shock transcription activator here we show the involvement of groesl in another proteolytic process this of the major rna chaperone  cspc  that specifically stabilizes the transcripts of several stress related genes evidence is provided for an interaction between groesl and cspc that results in enhanced temperature dependent proteolysis of the latter this interaction is of regulatory importance as reduction in the cellular levels of cspc leads to a decrease in stability of the major heat shock gene transcripts
