high resolution structure of hla a    in complex with a tumour specific antigenic peptide encoded by the mage a gene edited by r huber
the heterotrimeric complex of the human major histocompatibity complex mhc molecule hla a       microglobulin and the decameric peptide gvydgrehtv derived from the melanoma antigen mage a protein has been determined by x ray crystallography at    resolution mage a belongs to a family of genes that are specifically expressed in a variety of tumours mage a derived peptides are presented by mhc molecules at the cell surface to cytotoxic t lymphocytes as the hla a    mage a complex occurs only on tumour cells it is considered to be an appropriate target for immunotherapy the structure presented here reveals potential epitopes specific to the complex and indicates which peptide residues could be recognised by t cell receptors in addition as the structure could be refined anisotropically it was possible to describe the movements of the bound peptide in more detail
