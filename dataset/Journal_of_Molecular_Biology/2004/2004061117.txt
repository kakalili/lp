The structural determinants of electrostatics of ion stabilization within EcClC, a ClC-type chloride channel homologue from Escherichia coli, are studied using a continuum dielectric approximation. Specifically, the ion occupancy is investigated in the wild-type protein and a mutant thereof, and the contribution to the electrostatic binding free energy of local and non-local interactions is characterized at the single-residue level. This analysis shows that, in spite of the desolvation cost and the strong ion–ion repulsion, all previously reported binding sites can be occupied simultaneously. The stabilizing effect of the protein arises from hydrogen bonding as well as from longer-range favorable interactions, such as with the strictly conserved Lys131 side-chain. The latter is involved in the stabilization of the conserved GSGIP motif that delimits two of the binding sites. Interestingly, an additional low-affinity binding site, mediated by a structurally analogous motif including the side-chain of Arg340, can be identified on the extracellular side of the permeation pathway. Finally, it is shown that, in contrast to K-channels, and in analogy to the SBP/PBP sulfate/phosphate-binding proteins, the contribution of helix macrodipoles to chloride binding in EcClC is only marginal.
