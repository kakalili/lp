crystal structure of the human carboxypeptidase n kininase i catalytic domain
human carboxypeptidase n cpn  a member of the cpn e subfamily of  regulatory  metallo carboxypeptidases is an extracellular glycoprotein synthesized in the liver and secreted into the blood where it controls the activity of vasoactive peptide hormones growth factors and cytokines by specifically removing c terminal basic residues normally cpn circulates in blood plasma as a hetero tetramer consisting of two   kda cpn  domains each flanked by a  to   kda catalytic cpn  domain we have prepared and crystallized the recombinant c terminally truncated catalytic domain of human cpn  and have determined and refined its     crystal structure the structural analysis reveals that cpn has a pear like shape consisting of a   residue n terminal catalytic domain and an abutting cylindrically shaped  residue c terminal  sandwich transthyretin tt domain more resembling cpd  than cpm like these other cpn e members two surface loops surrounding the active site groove restrict access to the catalytic center offering an explanation for why some larger protein carboxypeptidase inhibitors do not inhibit cpn modeling of the pro phe arg c terminal end of the natural substrate bradykinin into the active site shows that the s   pocket of cpn might better accommodate p   lys than arg residues in agreement with cpn s preference for cleaving off c terminal lys residues three thr residues at the distal tt edge of cpn are o linked to n acetyl glucosamine sugars equivalent sites in the membrane anchored cpm are occupied by basic residues probably involved in membrane interaction in tetrameric cpn each cpn subunit might interact with the central leucine rich repeat tandem of the cognate cpn subunit via a unique hydrophobic surface patch wrapping around the catalytic domain  tt interface exposing the two active centers
