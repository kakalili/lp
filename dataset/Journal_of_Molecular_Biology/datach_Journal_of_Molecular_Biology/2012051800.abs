kinetic basis for the competitive recruitment of tolb by the intrinsically disordered translocation domain of colicin e
tolb and pal are members of the tol  pal system that spans the cell envelope of gram negative bacteria and contributes to the stability and integrity of the bacterial outer membrane om  lipoylated pal is tethered to the om and binds the  propeller domain of periplasmic tolb which as recent evidence suggests disengages tolb from its interaction with other components of the tol system in the inner membrane antibacterial nuclease colicins such as colicin e  cole  also bind the  propeller domain of tolb in order to catalyze their translocation across the bacterial om in contrast to pal however colicin binding to tolb promotes its interaction with other components of the tol system here through a series of pre steady state kinetic experiments utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer pairs within the individual protein  protein complexes we establish the kinetic basis for such  competitive recruitment  by the tolb binding epitope tbe of cole  surprisingly the  residue disordered cole tbe associates more rapidly with tolb than pal a folded  kda protein moreover we demonstrate that calcium ions which bind within the confines of the tolb  propeller domain tunnel and are known to increase the affinity of the tolb  cole complex do not exert their influence through long range electrostatic effects as had been predicted but through short range effects that slow the dissociation rate of cole tbe from its complex with tolb our study demonstrates that an intrinsically disordered protein undergoing binding induced folding can compete effectively with a globular protein for a common target by associating more rapidly than the globular protein
