conformational switching of the diphtheria toxin t domain
the diphtheria toxin t domain translocates the catalytic c domain across the endosomal membrane in response to acidification to elucidate the role of histidine protonation in modulating ph dependent membrane action of the t domain we have used site directed mutagenesis coupled with spectroscopic and physiological assays replacement of h  with an arginine but not with a glutamine resulted in dramatic unfolding of the protein at neutral ph accompanied by a substantial loss of helical structure and greatly increased exposure of the buried residues w  and w   this unfolding and spectral shift could be reversed by the interaction of the h  r mutant with model lipid membranes remarkably this greatly unfolded mutant exhibited wild type like activity in channel formation n terminus translocation and cytotoxicity assays moreover membrane permeabilization caused by the h  r mutant occurs already at ph   where wild type protein is inactive we conclude that protonation of h  acts as a major component of the ph dependent conformational switch resulting in destabilization of the folded structure in solution and thereby promoting the initial membrane interactions necessary for translocation
