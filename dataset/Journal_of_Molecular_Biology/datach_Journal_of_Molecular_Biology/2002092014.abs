the trtgn motif stabilizes the transcription initiation open complex
the effect on transcription initiation by the extended    motif    trtgn    positioned upstream of the    region was investigated using a series of base substitution mutations in the  amylase promoter amyp  the extended    motif previously referred to as the    region is found frequently in gram positive bacterial promoters and several extended    promoters from escherichia coli the inhibitory effects of the non productive promoter site amyp  which overlaps the upstream region of amyp were eliminated by mutagenesis of the    region and the trtg motif of amyp  removal by mutagenesis of the competitive effects of amyp resulted in a reduced dependence of amyp on the trtg motif in the absence of the second promoter mutations in the trtg motif of amyp destabilized the open complex and prevented the maintenance of open complexes at low temperatures the open complex half life was up to  fold shorter in the mutant trtg motif promoters than in the wild type promoter we demonstrate that the amyp trtg motif dramatically stabilizes the open complex intermediate during transcription initiation even though the open complex is less stable in the mutant promoters the region of melted dna is the same in the wild type and mutant promoters however upon addition of the first three nucleotides which trap rnap rna polymerase in a stable initiating complex the melted dna region contracts at the   end in a trtg motif promoter mutant but not at the wild type promoter indicating that the motif contributes to maintaining dna strand separation
