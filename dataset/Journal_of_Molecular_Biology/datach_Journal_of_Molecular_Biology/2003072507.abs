crystal structures of the t phage  glucosyltransferase and the d  a mutant in complex with udp glucose glucose binding and identification of the catalytic base for a direct displacement mechanism
t phage  glucosyltransferase bgt is an inverting glycosyltransferase gt that transfers glucose from uridine diphospho glucose udp glucose to an acceptor modified dna bgt belongs to the gt b structural superfamily represented so far by five different inverting or retaining gt families here we report three high resolution x ray structures of bgt and a point mutant solved in the presence of udp glucose the two co crystal structures of the d  a mutant show that unlike the wild type enzyme this mutation prevents glucose hydrolysis this strongly indicates that asp  is the catalytic base we obtained the wild type bgt  udp glucose complex by soaking substrate free bgt crystals comparison with a previous structure of bgt solved in the presence of the donor product udp and an acceptor analogue provides the first model of an inverting gt b enzyme in which both the donor and acceptor substrates are bound to the active site the structural analyses support the in line displacement reaction mechanism previously proposed locate residues involved in donor substrate specificity and identify the catalytic base
