electrostatic dependence of the thrombin thrombomodulin interaction edited by j a wells
the rate constants for the binding interaction between thrombin and a fully active fragment of its anticoagulant cofactor thrombomodulin have been determined by surface plasmon resonance at physiological ionic strength the ka was      m   s   and the dissociation rate constant was    s   these extremely fast association and dissociation rates resulted in an overall binding equilibrium constant of   nm which is similar to previously reported values changing the ionic strength from   mm to   mm nacl caused a tenfold decrease in the association rate while the dissociation rate did not change significantly a similar effect was observed with tetramethylammonium chloride a debye h ckel plot of the data had a slope of   and an intercept at  ionic strength of   m   s   the same slope and intercept were obtained for data that was collected in the presence of glycerol to slow the association rates these results show that the thrombin tm  interaction is extremely rapid and nearly completely electrostatically steered an association model is presented in which tm  approaches thrombin along the direction of the thrombin molecular dipole
