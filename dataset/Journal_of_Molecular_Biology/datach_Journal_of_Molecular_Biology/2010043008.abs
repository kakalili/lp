nmr solution structure and dna binding model of the dna binding domain of competence protein a
competence protein a coma is a response regulator protein involved in the development of genetic competence in the gram positive spore forming bacterium bacillus subtilis as well as the regulation of the production of degradative enzymes and antibiotic synthesis coma belongs to the narl family of proteins which are characterized by a c terminal transcriptional activator domain that consists of a bundle of four helices where the second and third helices   and   form a helix turn helix dna binding domain using nmr spectroscopy the high resolution d solution structure of the c terminal dna binding domain of coma comac has been determined in addition surface plasmon resonance and nmr protein  dna titration experiments allowed for the analysis of the interaction of comac with its target dna sequences combining the solution structure and biochemical data a model of comac bound to the coma recognition sequences on the srfa promoter has been developed the model shows that for dna binding coma uses the conserved helix turn helix motif present in other narl family members however the model reveals also that coma might use a slightly different part of the helix turn helix motif and there appears to be some associated domain re orientation these observations suggest a basis for dna binding specificity within the narl family
