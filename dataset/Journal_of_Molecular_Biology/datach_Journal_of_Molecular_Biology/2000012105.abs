nmr structure of the sterol carrier protein  implications for the biological role edited by p e wright
the determination of the nmr structure of the sterol carrier protein  scp  analysis of backbone  n spin relaxation parameters and nmr studies of nitroxide spin labeled substrate binding are presented as a new basis for investigations of the mode of action of scp  the scp fold is formed by a five stranded  sheet and four  helices fatty acid binding to a hydrophobic surface area formed by amino acid residues of the first and third helices and the  sheet which are all located in the polypeptide segment    was identified with the use of the spin labeled substrate  doxylstearic acid in the free protein the lipid binding site is covered by the c terminal segment     suggesting that this polypeptide segment which carries the peroxisomal targeting signal pts  might be involved in the regulation of ligand binding
