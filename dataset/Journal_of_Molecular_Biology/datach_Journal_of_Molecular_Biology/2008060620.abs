dlk specifically interacts with insulin like growth factor binding protein  to modulate adipogenesis of t l cells
dlk is an epidermal growth factor egf like homeotic protein containing an intracellular region a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular region possessing six egf like repeats and a protease target sequence dlk functions as a modulator of adipogenesis and other differentiation processes the molecular mechanisms by which dlk regulates these processes are unclear it has been reported that different dlk mrna spliced variants encoding for isoforms possessing the protease target sequence or not determine the production of membrane associated or soluble secreted extracellular dlk proteins that appear to affect adipogenesis of t l cells differently in particular only soluble variants inhibit this process some recent evidence suggest that dlk may modulate extracellular stimuli inducing differentiation thus an enforced decrease of dlk expression in balb c t cells which results in an increase of their adipogenic potential in response to insulin like growth factor  igf   modifies the kinetics and levels of activation of erk  triggered by it in this work we identified a strong and specific interaction between the protease target dlk region and the non igf binding region of igf binding protein  igfbp  a protein that binds to igfs and modulates their action we also observed that the increased adipogenic potential of t l cells caused by diminishing dlk expression through transfection with an antisense dlk expression construct was inhibited by the presence of igfbp in the differentiation medium on the other hand the presence of igfbp in the culture medium slightly increased the adipogenic potential of control t l cells expressing regular levels of dlk  these data suggest that membrane dlk variants bind to extracellular igfbp igf  complexes which may favor the release of igf  and increase the local concentration of free igf  that can enhance igf receptor signaling leading to adipogenesis
