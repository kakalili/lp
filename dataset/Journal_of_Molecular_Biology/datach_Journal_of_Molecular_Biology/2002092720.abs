a c  h  o hydrogen bond stabilized polypeptide chain reversal motif at the c terminus of helices in proteins
the serendipitous observation of a c  h  o hydrogen bond mediated polypeptide chain reversal in synthetic peptide helices has led to a search for the occurrence of a similar motif in protein structures from a dataset of   proteins    helices terminating in a schellman motif have been examined the c  h  o interaction between the t   c h and t  c  o group c  o     becomes possible only when the t  residue adopts an extended  conformation t is defined as the helix terminating residue adopting an  l conformation  in all   examples of this chain reversal motif have been identified and the compositional and conformational preferences at positions t   t and t  determined a marked preference for residues like ser glu and gln is observed at t   position with the motif being further stabilized by the formation of a side chain  backbone o  h  n hydrogen bond involving the side chain of residue t   and the n  h group of residue t  in as many as  examples the segment following the helix was extended with three to four successive residues in  conformation in a majority of these cases the succeeding  strand lies approximately antiparallel with the helix suggesting that the backbone c  h  o interactions may provide a means of registering helices and strands in an antiparallel orientation two examples were identified in which extended registry was detected with two sets of c  h  o hydrogen bonds between t   c h  c  o t  and t   c h  c  o t
