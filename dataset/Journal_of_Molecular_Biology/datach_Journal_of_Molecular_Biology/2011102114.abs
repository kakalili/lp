structural and thermodynamic comparison of the catalytic domain of amsh and amsh lp nearly identical fold but different stability
amsh plays a critical role in the escrt endosomal sorting complexes required for transport machinery which facilitates the down regulation and degradation of cell surface receptors it displays a high level of specificity toward cleavage of lys  linked polyubiquitin chains the structural basis of which has been understood recently through the crystal structure of a highly related but escrt independent protein amsh lp amsh like protein  we have determined the x ray structure of two constructs representing the catalytic domain of amsh amsh   the jamm jab mpn mov  domain containing polypeptide segment from residues   to   and amsh  e  a an active site mutant glu  to ala of the segment from   to   in addition to confirming the expected zinc coordination in the protein the structures reveal that the catalytic domains of amsh and amsh lp are nearly identical however guanidine hydrochloride induced unfolding studies show that the catalytic domain of amsh is thermodynamically less stable than that of amsh lp indicating that the former is perhaps structurally more plastic much to our surprise in the amsh  e  a structure the catalytic zinc was still held in place by the compensatory effect of an aspartate from a nearby loop moving into a position where it could coordinate with the zinc once again suggesting the plasticity of amsh additionally a model of amsh  bound to lys  linked diubiquitin reveals a type of interface for the distal ubiquitin significantly different from that seen in amsh lp altogether we believe that our data provide important insight into the structural difference between the two proteins that may translate into the difference in their biological function
