the    resolution structure of the con a dimannose complex edited by i a wilson
the complex between concanavalin a con a and     mannobiose mannose     mannose has been refined to    resolution this is the highest resolution structure reported for any sugar lectin complex as the native structure of con a to     resolution is already in the database this gives us a unique opportunity to examine sugar protein binding at high resolution these data have allowed us to model a number of hydrogen atoms involved in the binding of the sugar to con a using the difference density map to place the hydrogen atoms this map reveals the presence of the protonated form of asp  involved in binding asp  is not protonated in the     native structure our results clearly show that this residue is protonated and hydrogen bonds to the sugar the structure accounts for the higher affinity of the     linked sugar when compared to other disaccharides this structure identifies different interactions to those predicted by previous modelling studies we believe that the additional data presented here will enable significant improvements to be made to the sugar protein modelling algorithms
