psoralen adducts induced by triplex forming oligonucleotides are refractory to repair in hela cells edited by m yaniv
the use of triple helix forming oligonucleotides constitutes an attractive strategy to regulate gene expression by inhibition of transcription psoralen oligonucleotide conjugates form upon irradiation covalent triplexes and thereby modify the specific target sequence the processing of such photoproducts on the promoter of the gene coding for the interleukin  receptor  chain was investigated in hela cells and hela nuclear extracts we demonstrate that psoralen cross links are not repaired within the cell extracts nor inside cells the mechanism of repair inhibition was elucidated in vitro the presence of the third strand oligonucleotide inhibits the incision step of the damaged target by repair endonucleases these results demonstrate the possibility of using this approach to induce a persistent intracellular dna damage at a specific site and to afford prolonged transcription inhibition
