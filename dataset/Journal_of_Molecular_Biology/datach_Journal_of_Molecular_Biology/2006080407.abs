the structure of bovine complement component  reveals the basis for thioester function
the third component of complement c  is a   kda glycoprotein essential for eliciting the complement response the protein consists of two polypeptide chains   and   held together with a single disulfide bridge the  chain is composed of six mg domains one of which is shared with the  chain the disulfide bridge connecting the chains is positioned in the shared mg domain the  chain consists of the anaphylatoxin domain three mg domains a cub domain an     barrel domain and the c terminal c  c domain an internal thioester in the  chain of c  present in c but not in c  is cleaved during complement activation this mediates covalent attachment of the activated c b to immune complexes and invading microorganisms thereby opsonizing the target we present the structure of bovine c determined at    resolution the structure shows that the ester is buried deeply between the thioester domain and the properdin binding domain in agreement with the human structure this domain interface is broken upon activation allowing nucleophile access the structure of bovine c clearly demonstrates that the main chain around the thioester undergoes a helical transition upon activation this rearrangement is proposed to be the basis for the high level of reactivity of the thioester group a strictly conserved glutamate residue is suggested to function catalytically in thioester proteins structure based design of inhibitors of c activation may target a conserved pocket between the  chain and the  chain of c  which appears essential for conformational changes in c
