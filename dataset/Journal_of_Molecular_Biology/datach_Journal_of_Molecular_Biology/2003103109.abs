a metal  ligand mediated intersubunit allosteric switch in related smtb arsr zinc sensor proteins
the origin of metal ion selectivity by members of the smtb arsr family of bacterial metal sensing transcriptional repressors and the mechanism of negative allosteric regulation of dna binding is poorly understood here we report that two homologous zinc sensors staphylococcus aureus czra and cyanobacterial smtb are  winged  helix homodimeric dna binding proteins that bind zn ii to a pair of tetrahedral interhelical binding sites with two ligands derived from the   helix of one subunit asp  o   asp  in smtb  his  n   his   and two derived from the   helix of the other his   n   his    and his    n   glu     formation of the metal chelate drives a quaternary structural switch mediated by an intersubunit hydrogen binding network that originates with the non liganding n  face of his  in czra his  in smtb that stabilizes a low affinity dna binding conformation the structure of the zn smtb homodimer shows that both metal binding sites of the dimer must be occupied for the quaternary structural switch to occur thus a critical zinc ligating histidine residue obligatorily couples formation of the metal sensing coordination chelate to changes in the conformation and dynamics of the putative dna binding helices
