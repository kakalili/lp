life s simple measures unlocking the proteome
using modified nucleotides and selecting for slow off rates in the selex procedure we have evolved a special class of aptamers called somamers slow off  rate modified aptamers  which bind tightly and specifically to proteins in body fluids we use these in a novel assay that yields   complexes of the somamers with their cognate proteins in body fluids measuring the somamer concentrations of the resultant complexes reflects the concentration of the proteins in the fluids this is simply done by hybridization to complementary sequences on solid supports but it can also be done by any other dna quantification technology including nexgen sequencing  we use measurements of over   proteins in under   l of serum or plasma to answer important medical questions two of which are reviewed here a number of bioinformatics methods have guided our discoveries including principal component analysis we use various methods to evaluate sample handling procedures in our clinical samples and can identify many parameters that corrupt proteomics analysis
