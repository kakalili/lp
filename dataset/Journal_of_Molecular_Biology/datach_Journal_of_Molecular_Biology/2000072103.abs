structure of coenzyme f  dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase from two methanogenic archaea
coenzyme f  dependent methylenetetrahydromethanopterin reductase mer is an enzyme of the cl metabolism in methanogenic and sulfate reducing archaea it is composed of identical   kda subunits and lacks a prosthetic group the crystal structure of mer from methanopyrus kandleri kmer revealed in one crystal form a dimeric and in another a tetrameric oligomerisation state and that from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum tmer a dimeric state each monomer is primarily composed of a tim barrel fold enlarged by three insertion regions insertion regions  and  contribute to intersubunit interactions insertion regions  and  together with the c terminal end of the tim barrel core form a cleft where the binding sites of coenzyme f  and methylene tetrahydromethanopterin are postulated close to the coenzyme f  binding site lies a rarely observed non prolyl cis peptide bond it is surprising that mer is structurally most similar to a bacterial fmn dependent luciferase which contains a non prolyl cis peptide bond at the equivalent position the structure of mer is also related to that of nadp dependent fad harbouring methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase metf  however mer and metf do not show sequence similarities although they bind related substrates and catalyze an analogous reaction
