linker histone dependent organization and dynamics of nucleosome entry exit dnas
a dna sequence dependent nucleosome structural and dynamic polymorphism was recently uncovered through topoisomerase i relaxation of mononucleosomes on two homologous       bp dna minicircle series one originating from pbr   the other from the s nucleosome positioning sequence whereas both pbr and s nucleosomes had access to the closed negatively crossed conformation only the pbr nucleosome had access to the positively crossed conformation simulation suggested this discrepancy was the result of a reorientation of entry exit dnas itself proposed to be the consequence of specific dna untwistings occurring in pbr nucleosome where h b n terminal tails pass between the two gyres the present work investigates the behavior of the same two nucleosomes after binding of linker histone h  its globular domain gh  and engineered h c tail deletion mutants nucleosome access to the open uncrossed conformation was suppressed and more surprisingly the ability of s nucleosome to positively cross was largely restored this together with the paradoxical observation of a less extensive crossing in the negative conformation with gh than without favored an asymmetrical location of the globular domain in interaction with the central gyre and only entry or exit dna and raised the possibility of the domain physical rotation as a mechanism assisting nucleosome fluctuation from one conformation to the other moreover both negative and positive conformations showed a high degree of loop conformational flexibility in the presence of the full length h c tail which the simulation suggested to reflect the unique feature of the resulting stem to bring entry exit dnas in contact and parallel the results point to the stem being a fundamental structural motif directing chromatin higher order folding as well as a major player in its dynamics
