solution structures of the yap  ww domain and the variant l  k in complex with the peptides gtppppytvg n n octyl gpppy and plppy and the application of peptide libraries reveal a minimal binding epitope edited by m f summers
the single mutation l  k in the hu yap  ww domain increased the stability of the complex with the peptide gtppppytvg kd       m  here we report the refined solution structure of this complex by nmr spectroscopy and further derived structure activity relationships by using ligand peptide libraries with truncated sequences and a substituion analysis that yielded acetyl ppppy as the smallest high affinity binding peptide kd    m  the structures of two new complexes with weaker binding ligands chosen based on these results n n octyl gpppynh and ac plppy comprising the wild type ww domain of hu yap  were determined comparison of the structures of the three complexes were useful for identifying the molecular basis of high affinity hydrophobic and specific interactions between the side chains of y  and w  and p   and p   respectively and hydrogen bonds between t  donnor and p   acceptor and between w  donnor and t   acceptor stabilize the complex the structure of the complex l  k hu yap  ww domain gtppppytvg is compared to the published crystal structure of the dystrophin ww domain bound to a segment of the  dystroglycan protein and to the solution structure of the first nedd ww domain and its prolin rich ligand suggesting that ww sequences bind proline rich peptides in an evolutionary conserved fashion the position equivalent to t  in the hu yap  ww domain sequence is seen as responsible for differentiation in the binding mode among the ww domains of group i
