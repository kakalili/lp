structures of p   active mutants reveal conformational changes in l  loop that induce autophosphorylation and activation
p  mitogen activated protein map kinases function in numerous signaling processes and are crucial for normal functions of cells and organisms abnormal p  activity is associated with inflammatory diseases and cancers making the understanding of its activation mechanisms highly important p s are commonly activated by phosphorylation catalyzed by map kinase kinases mkks  moreover it was recently revealed that the p   is also activated via alternative pathways which are mkk independent the structural basis of p  activation especially in the alternative pathways is mostly unknown this lack of structural data hinders the study of p  s biology as well as the development of novel strategies for p  inhibition we have recently discovered and optimized a novel set of intrinsically active p  mutants whose activities are independent of any upstream activation the high resolution crystal structures of the intrinsically active p   mutants reveal that local alterations in the l  loop region promote kinase activation the l  loop can be thus regarded as a molecular switch that upon conformational changes promotes activation we suggest that similar conformational changes in l  loop also occur in natural activation mechanisms of p   in t cells our biochemical studies reveal novel mechanistic insights into the activation process of p  in this regard the results indicate that the activation mechanism of the mutants involves dimerization and subsequent trans autophosphorylation on thr   on the phosphorylation lip  finally we suggest a model of in vivo p   activation induced by the l  switch with auto regulatory characteristics
