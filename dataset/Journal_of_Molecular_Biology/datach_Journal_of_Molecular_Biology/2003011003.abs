evidence for structural integrity in the undecameric c rings isolated from sodium atp synthases
the na translocating atp synthases from ilyobacter tartaricus and propionigenium modestum contain undecameric c subunit rings of unusual stability these c  rings have been isolated from both atp synthases and crystallized in two dimensions cryo transmission electron microscopy projection maps of the c rings from both organisms were identical at   resolution different crystal contacts were induced after treatment of the crystals with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide dccd  which is consistent with the binding of the inhibitor to glutamate  in the c terminal helix on the outside of the ring the c subunits of the isolated c  ring of i tartaricus were modified specifically by incubation with dccd with kinetics that were indistinguishable from those of the f fo holoenzyme the reaction rate increased with decreasing ph but was lower in the presence of na  from the ph profile of the second order rate constants the pk of glutamate  was deduced to be   or   in the absence or presence of  mm nacl respectively these pk values are identical with those determined for the f fo complex the results indicate that the isolated c ring retains its native structure and that the glutamate   including binding sites near the middle of the membrane are accessible to na from the cytoplasm through access channels within the c ring itself
