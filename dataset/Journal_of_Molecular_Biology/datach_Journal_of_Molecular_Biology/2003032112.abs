the crystal structure of r specific alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis suggests the structural basis of its metal dependency
the crystal structure of the apo form of an r specific alcohol dehydrogenase from lactobacillus brevis lb radh was solved and refined to    resolution lb radh is a member of the short chain dehydrogenase reductase sdr enyzme superfamily it is a homotetramer with   amino acid residues per subunit and uses nadp h as co enzyme nadph and the substrate acetophenone were modelled into the active site the enantiospecificity of the enzyme can be explained on the basis of the resulting hypothetical ternary complex in contrast to most other sdr enzymes the catalytic activity of lb radh depends strongly on the binding of mg  mg  removal by edta inactivates the enzyme completely in the crystal structure the mg  binding site is well defined the ion has a perfect octahedral coordination sphere and occupies a special position concerning crystallographic and molecular point symmetry meaning that each radh tetramer contains two magnesium ions the magnesium ion is no direct catalytic cofactor however it is structurally coupled to the putative c terminal hinge of the substrate binding loop and via an extended hydrogen bonding network to some side chains forming the substrate binding region therefore the presented structure of apo radh provides plausible explanations for the metal dependence of the enzyme
