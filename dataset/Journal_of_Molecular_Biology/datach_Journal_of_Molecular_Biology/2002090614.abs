structural and biological characterisation of the gut associated cyclophilin b isoforms from caenorhabditis elegans
the free living nematode caenorhabditis elegans expresses  cyclophilin isoforms eight of which are conserved single domain forms comprising two closely related secreted or type b forms cyp  and cyp   recombinant cyp  has been purified crystallised and the x ray structure solved to a resolution of     the detailed molecular architecture most strongly resembles the structure of human cyclophilin b with conserved changes in loop structure and n and c terminal extensions interestingly the active site pocket is occupied by a molecule of dithiothreitol though this has little effect on the geometry of the active site which is similar to other cyclophilin structures the peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity of cyp  has been characterised against the substrate n succinyl ala ala pro phe p nitroanilide and gives a kcat km value of     m  s   that compares with a value of     m  s   for human cyclophilin b the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin a binds and inhibits cyp  with an ic  value of  nm which is comparable to the value of  nm found for human cyclophilin b cyp  has   sequence identity with cyp  and a molecular model was built based on the cyp  crystal structure the model shows that cyp  and cyp  are likely to have very similar structures but with a markedly increased number of negative charges distributed around the surface of cyp  the spatial expression patterns of the cyclophilin b isoforms were examined using transgenic animals carrying a lacz reporter fusion to these genes and both cyp  and cyp  are found to be expressed in an overlapping fashion in the nematode gut the temporal expression pattern of cyp  was further determined and revealed a constitutive expression pattern with highest abundance levels being found in the embryo
