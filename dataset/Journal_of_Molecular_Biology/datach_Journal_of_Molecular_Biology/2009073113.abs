solution and membrane bound conformations of the tandem c a and c b domains of synaptotagmin  evidence for bilayer bridging
synaptotagmin  syt  is a synaptic vesicle membrane protein that functions as the ca  sensor in neuronal exocytosis here site directed spin labeling was used to generate models for the solution and membrane bound structures of a soluble fragment of syt containing its two c domains c a and c b in solution distance restraints between the two c domains of syt were measured using double electron  electron resonance and used in a simulated annealing routine to generate models for the structure of the tandem c a  c b fragment the data indicate that the two c domains are flexibly linked and do not interact with each other in solution with or without ca  however the favored orientation is one where the ca  binding loops are oriented in opposite directions a similar approach was taken for membrane associated c a  c b combining both distances and bilayer depth restraints with simulated annealing the restraints can only be satisfied if the ca  and membrane binding surfaces of the domains are oriented in opposite directions so that c a and c b are docked to opposing bilayers the result suggests that syt functions to bridge across the vesicle and plasma membrane surfaces in a ca  dependent manner
