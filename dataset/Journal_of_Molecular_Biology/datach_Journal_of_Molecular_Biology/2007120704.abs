backbone dynamics in an intramolecular prolylpeptide  sh complex from the diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr
the diphtheria toxin repressor contains an sh like domain that forms an intramolecular complex with a proline rich pr peptide segment and stabilizes the inactive state of the repressor upon activation of diphtheria toxin repressor dtxr by transition metals this intramolecular complex must dissociate as the sh domain and pr segment form different interactions in the active repressor here we investigate the dynamics of this intramolecular complex using backbone amide nuclear spin relaxation rates determined using nmr spectroscopy and molecular dynamics trajectories the sh domain in the unbound and bound states showed typical dynamics in that the secondary structures were fairly ordered with high generalized order parameters and low effective correlation times while residues in the loops connecting  strands exhibited reduced generalized order parameters and required additional motional terms to adequately model the relaxation rates residues forming the pr segment exhibited low order parameters with internal rotational correlation times on the order of   ns   ns further analysis showed that the sh domain was rich in millisecond time scale motions while the pr segment exhibited motions on the    s time scale molecular dynamics simulations indicated structural rearrangements that may contribute to the observed relaxation rates and together with the observed relaxation rate data suggested that the pr segment exhibits a binding  unbinding equilibrium the results here provide new insights into the nature of the intramolecular complex and provide a better understanding of the biological role of the sh domain in regulating dtxr activity
