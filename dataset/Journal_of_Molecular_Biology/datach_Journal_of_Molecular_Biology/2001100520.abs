promoter suppression in cultured mammalian cells can be blocked by the chicken  globin chromatin insulator   hs and matrix scaffold attachment regions edited by m yaniv
studies have indicated that two transcriptionally active units can repress one another when they lie adjacent in head to tail tandem on a chromosome repression of a downstream    unit by an upstream    unit is known as  transcriptional interference   whereas repression of a   unit by a   unit is termed  promoter suppression   these two processes can occur between head to tail tandem copies of a transgene or between transgenes and adjacent chromosomal genes interference can be blocked by inserting a transcription terminator between adjacent units here we report that  promoter suppression  could be blocked by the insulator   dnasei hypersensitive site  or matrix scaffold attachment regions mar sars  when these elements were interposed between adjacent units because intergenic spacers of many repeated eukaryotic genes contain mar sars and insulators our observations suggest that these elements have the ability to segregate repeated genes into domains that act independently of one another our observations also suggest strategies to design transgenes that can act as autonomous units of expression
