structural evidence for effectiveness of darunavir and two related antiviral inhibitors against hiv  protease
no drug has been targeted specifically for hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  infection despite its increasing prevalence worldwide the antiviral hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  protease pr inhibitor darunavir and the chemically related grl   and grl   a were designed with the same chemical scaffold and different substituents at p and p   to optimize polar interactions for hiv  pr pr  these inhibitors are also effective antiviral agents for hiv  infected cells therefore crystal structures of hiv  pr pr  complexes with the three inhibitors have been solved at    resolution to analyze the molecular basis for their antiviral potency unusually the crystals were grown in imidazole and zinc acetate buffer which formed interactions with the pr and the inhibitors overall the structures were very similar to the corresponding inhibitor complexes of pr with an rmsd of     on main chain atoms most hydrogen bond and weaker c  h  o interactions with inhibitors were conserved in the pr and pr complexes except for small changes in interactions with water or disordered side chains small differences were observed in the hydrophobic contacts for the darunavir complexes in agreement with relative inhibition of the two prs these near atomic resolution crystal structures verify the inhibitor potency for pr and pr and will provide the basis for the development of antiviral inhibitors targeting pr
