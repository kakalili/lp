direct observation of different surface structures on high resolution images of native halorhodopsin edited by j karn
halorhodopsin hr was investigated with atomic force microscopic techniques afm in aqueous solution two dimensional  d crystals of hr were obtained by purifying an hr membrane fraction with the same buoyant density as the purple membrane hr pm from the overexpressing strain halobacterium salinarum d  the membrane patches of hr were immobilized on mica images with a resolution up to    were recorded crystals showed an orthogonal structure and the orientation of the molecules showed p   symmetry thus alternate tetramers are inverted in the membrane the crystal surface was found to display different structures depending on the imaging force used indicating that some parts of the hr molecule are more rigid but others more compressible from samples with single tetramers missing in the crystalline patches dimensions of the unit cell could be determined helix connecting loops in single molecules of halorhodopsin were assigned the images indicate that the large extracellular bc loop covers the whole molecule and is very flexible
