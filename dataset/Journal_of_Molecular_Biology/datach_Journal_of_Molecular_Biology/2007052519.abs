solution structure of the mid b box chc d c c h zinc binding domain insights into an evolutionarily conserved ring fold
the b box type  domain is a prominent feature of a large and growing family of ring b box coiled coil rbcc domain containing proteins and is also present in more than   additional proteins most proteins usually contain a single b box domain although some proteins contain tandem domains consisting of both type  and type  b boxes which actually share little sequence similarity recently we determined the solution structure of b box from mid  a putative e ubiquitin ligase that is mutated in x linked opitz g bbb syndrome and showed that it adopted a    ring like fold here we report the tertiary structure of the b box  chc d c c h  domain from mid using multidimensional nmr spectroscopy this mid b box domain consists of a short  helix and a structured loop with two short anti parallel  strands and adopts a tertiary structure similar to the b box and ring structures even though there is minimal primary sequence similarity between these domains by mutagenesis esi fticr and icp mass spectrometry we show that the b box domain coordinates two zinc atoms with a  cross brace  pattern one by cys   his   cys  and cys  and the other by cys   asp   his   and his   interestingly this is the first case that an aspartic acid is involved in zinc atom coordination in a zinc finger domain although aspartic acid has been shown to coordinate non catalytic zinc in matrix metalloproteinases in addition the finding of a cys  phe substitution identified in a patient with x linked opitz gbbb syndrome supports the importance of proper zinc coordination for the function of the mid b box domain notably however our structure differs from the only other published b box structure that from xnf  which was shown to coordinate one zinc atom finally the similarity in tertiary structures of the b box  b box and ring domains suggests these domains have evolved from a common ancestor
