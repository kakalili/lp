mad interacts with dna repair proteins and negatively regulates dna damage repair
mad  mitotic arrest deficient  is a key regulator of mitosis recently it had been suggested that mad induced mitotic arrest mediates dna damage response and that upregulation of mad confers sensitivity to dna damaging anticancer drug induced apoptosis in this study we report a potential novel role of mad in mediating dna nucleotide excision repair through physical interactions with two dna repair proteins xpd xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group d and ercc  first overexpression of mad resulted in decreased nuclear accumulation of xpd a crucial step in the initiation of dna repair second immunoprecipitation experiments showed that mad was able to bind to xpd which led to competitive suppression of binding activity between xpd and xpa resulting in the prevention of physical interactions between dna repair proteins third unlike its role in mitosis the n terminus domain seemed to be more important in the binding activity between mad and xpd fourth phosphorylation of h ax a process that is important for recruitment of dna repair factors to dna double strand breaks was suppressed in mad overexpressing cells in response to dna damage these results suggest a negative role of mad in dna damage response which may be accounted for its previously reported role in promoting sensitivity to dna damaging agents in cancer cells however the interaction between mad and ercc did not show any effect on the binding activity between ercc and xpa in the presence or absence of dna damage our results suggest a novel function of mad by interfering with dna repair proteins
