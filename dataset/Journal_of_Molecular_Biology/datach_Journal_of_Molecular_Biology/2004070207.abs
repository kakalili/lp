an evolutionarily conserved network of amino acids mediates gating in voltage dependent potassium channels
a novel sequence analysis technique for detecting correlated amino acid positions in intermediate size protein families      sequences was developed and applied to study voltage dependent gating of potassium channels most contemporary methods for detecting amino acid correlations within proteins use very large sets of data typically comprising hundreds or thousands of evolutionarily related sequences to overcome the relatively low signal to noise ratio in the analysis of co variations between pairs of amino acid positions such methods are impractical for voltage gated potassium kv channels and for many other protein families that have not yet been sequenced to that extent here we used a phylogenetic reconstruction of paralogous kv channels to follow the evolutionary history of every pair of amino acid positions within this family thus increasing detection accuracy of correlated amino acids relative to contemporary methods in addition we used a bootstrapping procedure to eliminate correlations that were statistically insignificant these and other measures allowed us to increase the method s sensitivity and opened the way to reliable identification of correlated positions even in intermediate size protein families principal component analysis applied to the set of correlated amino acid positions in kv channels detected a network of inter correlated residues a large fraction of which were identified as gating sensitive upon mutation mapping the network of correlated residues onto the d structure of the kv channel from aeropyrum pernix disclosed correlations between residues in the voltage sensor paddle and the pore region including regions that are involved in the gating transition we discuss these findings with respect to the evolutionary constraints acting on the channel s various domains the software is available on our website http  ashtoret tau ac il sarel corrmut html
