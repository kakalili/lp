crystal structure of the ig domain of the neural cell adhesion molecule ncam displays domain swapping
the crystal structure of the first immunoglobulin ig  domain of neural cell adhesion molecule  ncam ocam rncam is presented at a resolution of     ncam is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules igcams  in the structure two ig domains interact by domain swapping as the two n terminal  strands are interchanged   strand swapping at the terminal domain is the accepted mechanism of homophilic interactions amongst the cadherins another class of cams but it has not been observed within the igcam superfamily gel filtration chromatography demonstrated the ability of ncam ig to form dimers in solution taken together these observations suggest that  strand swapping could have a role in the molecular mechanism of homophilic binding for ncam
