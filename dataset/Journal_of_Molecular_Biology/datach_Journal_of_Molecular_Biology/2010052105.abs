molecular architecture of the mn  dependent lactonase ulag reveals an rnase like metallo  lactamase fold and a novel quaternary structure
the ulag gene located in the ula regulon is crucial for the catabolism of l ascorbate under anaerobic conditions and it has been proposed to encode for the putative l ascorbate  p lactonase the ulag gene is widespread among eubacteria including human commensal and pathogenic genera such as escherichia shigella klebsiella and salmonella here we report the three dimensional structures of the apoenzyme and mn  holoenzyme of ulag from e coli to     resolution determined using single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and molecular replacement respectively the structures reveal a highly specialized metallo  lactamase like fold derived from an ancient structural template that was involved in rna maturation and dna repair this fold has a novel quaternary architecture consisting of a hexameric ring formed by a trimer of ulag dimers a mononuclear mn  binding site resides at the core of the active site which displays micromolar affinity for mn  and a distorted trigonal bipyramidal coordination the active site mn  ion can be replaced by co  or zn  but not by fe  we further show that the mn  or co  loaded enzyme exhibits lactonase activity towards l ascorbate  p thereby providing the first direct evidence of its catalytic role in the l ascorbate catabolic pathway guided by the structural homology we show that ulag is able to cleave phosphodiester linkages in cyclic nucleotides suggesting that the conservation of the fold and of the key catalytic residues allows for the evolutionary acquisition of substrate specificity for novel but related substrates
