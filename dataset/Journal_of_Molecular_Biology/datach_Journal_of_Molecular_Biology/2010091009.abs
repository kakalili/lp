hiv fusion peptide penetrates disorders and softens t cell membrane mimics
this work investigates the interaction of n terminal gp  fusion peptide fp of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  with model membranes in order to elucidate how fp leads to fusion of hiv and t cell membranes fp constructs were i wild type fp    n terminal amino acids of gp   ii water soluble monomeric fp that adds six lysines on the c terminus of fp  fpwsm  and iii the c terminus covalently linked trimeric version fptri of fpwsm model membranes were i lm  a t cell mimic  ii   dioleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine  iii   dioleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine   mol cholesterol  iv   dierucoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine and v   dierucoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine   mol cholesterol diffuse synchrotron low angle x ray scattering from fully hydrated samples supplemented by volumetric data showed that fp  and fptri penetrate into the hydrocarbon region and cause membranes to thin depth of penetration appears to depend upon a complex combination of factors including bilayer thickness presence of cholesterol and electrostatics x ray data showed an increase in curvature in hexagonal phase   dioleoyl sn glycero  phosphoethanolamine which further indicates that fp  penetrates into the hydrocarbon region rather than residing in the interfacial headgroup region low angle x ray scattering data also yielded the bending modulus kc a measure of membrane stiffness and wide angle x ray scattering yielded the sxray orientational order parameter both fp  and fptri decreased kc and sxray considerably while the weak effect of fpwsm suggests that it did not partition strongly into lm model membranes our results are consistent with the hiv fp disordering and softening the t cell membrane thereby lowering the activation energy for viral membrane fusion
