crystal structure of hsc  a j type co chaperone from escherichia coli
hsc  is a  kda j protein that regulates the atpase activity and peptide binding specificity of hsc  an hsp  class molecular chaperone we report herein the crystal structure of hsc  from escherichia coli determined to a resolution of    using a combination of single isomorphous replacement sir and multi wavelength anomalous diffraction mad  the overall structure of hsc  consists of two distinct domains an n terminal j domain containing residues   connected by a short loop to a c terminal domain containing residues     the structure of the j domain involved in interactions with hsc  resembles the  topology of j domain fragments of escherichia coli dnaj and human hdj previously determined by solution nmr methods the c terminal domain implicated in binding and targeting proteins to hsc  consists of a three helix bundle in which two helices comprise an anti parallel coiled coil the two domains make contact through an extensive hydrophobic interface       suggesting that their relative orientations are fixed thus hsc  in addition to its role in the regulation of the atpase activity of hsc  may also function as a rigid scaffold to facilitate positioning of the protein substrates targeted to hsc
