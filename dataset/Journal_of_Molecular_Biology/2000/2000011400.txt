To elucidate early nucleation stages in protein folding, multi-probed thermodynamic characterization was applied to the β-hairpin structural formation of G-peptide, which is a C-terminal fragment of the B1 domain of streptococcal protein G. The segment corresponding to the sequence of G-peptide is believed to act as a nucleus during the folding process of the B1 domain. In spite of the broad thermal transition of G-peptide, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) melting measurements combined with our original analytical theory enabled us to obtain the thermodynamic properties of the β-hairpin formation with considerable accuracy. Additionally, all the thermodynamic properties determined by every NMR probe on both the main-chain and the side-chains were quite similar, and also comparable to the values that were independently determined by calorimetric analysis of G-peptide. These results demonstrate that G-peptide folds cooperatively throughout the molecule. In other words, the formation of the β-hairpin is interpreted as the fashion of a first-order phase transition between two states without any distinguishable intermediates. This cooperative formation of the short linear peptide consisting of only 16 residues provides insight into not only the first folding events of the B1 domain, but also the general principles of proteins in terms of structural hierarchy, stability and folding mechanism.
