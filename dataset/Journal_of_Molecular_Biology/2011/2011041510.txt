We used FRET to examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of structural changes associated with ADP release in myosin V, which is thought to be a strain-sensitive step in many muscle and non-muscle myosins. We also explored essential dynamics using FIRST/FRODA starting with three different myosin V X-ray crystal structures to examine intrinsic flexibility and correlated motions. Our steady-state and time-resolved FRET analysis demonstrates a temperature-dependent reversible conformational change in the nucleotide-binding pocket (NBP). Our kinetic results demonstrate that the NBP goes from a closed to an open conformation prior to the release of ADP, while the actin-binding cleft remains closed. Interestingly, we find that the temperature dependence of the maximum actin-activated myosin V ATPase rate is similar to the pocket opening step, demonstrating that this is the rate-limiting structural transition in the ATPase cycle. Thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that the transition from the open to closed NBP conformation is unfavorable because of a decrease in entropy. The intrinsic flexibility analysis is consistent with conformational entropy playing a role in this transition as the MV.ADP structure is highly flexible compared to the MV.APO structure. Our experimental and modeling studies support the conclusion of a novel post-power-stroke actomyosin.ADP state in which the NBP and actin-binding cleft are closed. The novel state may be important for strain sensitivity as the transition from the closed to open NBP conformation may be altered by lever arm position.
