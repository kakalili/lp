the atp operated clamp of human dna topoisomerase ii  hyperstimulation of atpase by  piggy back  binding
we have constructed a series of clones encoding n terminal fragments of human dna topoisomerase ii  all fragments exhibit dna dependent atpase activity fragment     shows hyperbolic dependence of atpase on dna concentration whereas fragment     shows hyperstimulation at low ratios of dna to enzyme a phenomenon found previously with the full length enzyme the minimum length of dna found to stimulate the atpase activity was   bp fragments   bp manifest the hyperstimulation phenomenon molecular mass studies show that fragment     is a monomer in the absence of nucleotides and a dimer in the presence of nucleotide triphosphate the results are consistent with the role of the n terminal domain of topoisomerase ii as an atp operated clamp that dimerises in the presence of atp the hyperstimulation effect can be interpreted in terms of a  piggy back binding  model for protein  dna interaction
