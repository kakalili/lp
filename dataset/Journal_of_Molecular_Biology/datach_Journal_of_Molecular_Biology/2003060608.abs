structural insights into the activation of p vivax plasmepsin
the malarial aspartic proteinases plasmepsins have been discovered in several species of plasmodium including all four of the human malarial pathogens in p falciparum plasmepsins i ii iv and hap have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection and are now considered targets for anti malarial drug design the plasmepsins are produced from inactive zymogens proplasmepsins having unusually long n terminal prosegments of more than   amino acids structural and biochemical evidence suggests that the conversion process of proplasmepsins to plasmepsins differs substantially from the gastric and plant aspartic proteinases instead of blocking substrate access to a pre formed active site the prosegment enforces a conformation in which proplasmepsin cannot form a functional active site we have determined crystal structures of plasmepsin and proplasmepsin from p vivax the three dimensional structure of p vivax plasmepsin is typical of the monomeric aspartic proteinases and the structure of p vivax proplasmepsin is similar to that of p falciparum proplasmepsin ii a dramatic refolding of the mature n terminus and a large    reorientation of the n domain between p vivax proplasmepsin and plasmepsin results in a severe distortion of the active site region of the zymogen relative to that of the mature enzyme the present structures confirm that the mode of inactivation observed originally in p falciparum proplasmepsin ii i e an incompletely formed active site is a true structural feature and likely represents the general mode of inactivation of the related proplasmepsins
