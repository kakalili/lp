extrusion of an imperfect palindrome to a cruciform in superhelical dna complete determination of energetics using a statistical mechanical model edited by i tinoco
we present a detailed study of the extrusion of an imperfect palindrome derived from the terminal regions of vaccinia virus dna and contained in a superhelical plasmid into a cruciform containing bulged bases we monitor the course of extrusion by two dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments as a function of temperature and linking number we find that extrusion pauses at partially extruded states as negative superhelicity increases to understand the course of extrusion with changes in linking number  lk we present a rigorous semiempirical statistical mechanical analysis that includes complete coupling between  lk cruciform extrusion formation of extrahelical bases and temperature dependent denaturation the imperfections in the palindrome are sequentially incorporated into the cruciform arms as hairpin loops single unpaired bases and complex local regions containing several unpaired bases we analyze the results to determine the free energies enthalpies and entropies of formation of all local structures involved in extrusion we find that for each unpaired structure the  g  h and  s of formation are all approximately proportional to the number of unpaired bases contained therein this surprising result holds regardless of the arrangement or composition of unpaired bases within a particular structure imperfections have major effects on the overall energetics of cruciform extrusion and on the course of this transition in particular the extent of the  lk change necessary to extrude an imperfect palindrome is considerably greater than that required for extrusion of the underlying perfect palindrome our analysis also suggests that at higher temperatures significant denaturation at the base of an imperfect cruciform can successfully compete with extension of the cruciform arms
