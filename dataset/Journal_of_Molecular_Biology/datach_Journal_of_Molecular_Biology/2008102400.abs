structural basis of poly  hydroxybutyrate hydrolysis by phaz depolymerase from paucimonas lemoignei
the crystal structure of poly  hydroxybutyrate  phb depolymerase phaz purified from paucimonas lemoignei was determined at     resolution the structure consists of a single domain with an    hydrolase fold in its core the active site is analogous to that of serine esterases lipases and is characterized by the presence of a catalytic triad comprising ser   asp   and his   comparison with other structures in the protein data bank showed a high level of similarity with the bacillus subtilis lipase lipa rmsd       structural comparison with penicillium funiculosum phb depolymerase the only phb depolymerase whose structure is already known revealed significant differences resulting in an rmsd of         the two enzymes appear to utilize different types of solvent exposed residues for biopolymer binding with aliphatic and hydroxyl residues used in p funiculosum phb depolymerase and aromatic residues in phaz  moreover the active site of p funiculosum phb depolymerase is accessible to the substrate in contrast to the active site of phaz  which is buried hence considerable conformational changes are required in phaz for the creation of a channel leading to the active site taken together the structural data suggest that phaz and p funiculosum phb depolymerase have adopted different strategies for effective substrate binding in response to their diverse substrate specificity and the lack of a substrate binding domain
