structure of cytochrome c a a novel dithio cytochrome of arabidopsis thaliana and its reactivity with plastocyanin implications for function
cytochrome c a is a unique dithio cytochrome present in land plants and some green algae its sequence and occurrence in the thylakoid lumen suggest that it is derived from cytochrome c  which functions in photosynthetic electron transfer between the cytochrome b f complex and photosystem i its known properties however and a strong indication that the disulfide group is not purely structural indicate that it has a different unidentified function to help in the elucidation of this function the crystal structure of cytochrome c a from arabidopsis thaliana has been determined in the two redox states of the heme group at resolutions of     ferric and     ferrous  these two structures were virtually identical leading to the functionally important conclusion that the heme and disulfide groups do not communicate by conformational change they also show however that electron transfer between the reduced disulfide and the heme is feasible we therefore suggest that the role of cytochrome c a is to use its disulfide group to oxidize dithiol disulfide groups of other proteins of the thylakoid lumen followed by internal electron transfer from the dithiol to the heme and re oxidation of the heme by another thylakoid oxidant consistent with this model we found a rapid electron transfer between ferro cytochrome c a and plastocyanin with a second order rate constant k      m  s
