the noxo  px domain preferentially targets ptdins   p and ptdins    p
noxo   noxo  nox organizer    is a cytosolic protein that in conjunction with noxa  nox activator   regulates generation of reactive oxygen species by the nadph oxidase  nox  enzyme complex noxo  is targeted to membranes through an n terminal px phox homology domain we have used nmr spectroscopy to solve the structure of the noxo  px domain and surface plasmon resonance spr to assess phospholipid specificity the solution structure of the noxo  px domain shows greatest similarity to that of the phosphatidylinositol  kinase c  px domain with regard to the positions and types of residues that are predicted to interact with phosphatidylinositol phosphate ptdinsp head groups spr experiments identify ptdins   p and ptdins    p as preferred targets of noxo  px these findings contrast with previous lipid overlay experiments showing strongest binding to monophosphorylated ptdinsp and phosphatidylserine our data suggest that localized membrane accumulation of ptdins   p or ptdins    p may serve to recruit noxo  and activate nox
