two nuclear localization signals in the hiv  matrix protein regulate nuclear import of the hiv  pre integration complex edited by m gottesman
replication of hiv  in non dividing and slowly proliferating cell populations depends on active import of the viral pre integration complex pic into the cell nucleus while it is commonly accepted that this process is mediated by an interaction between the hiv  pic and the cellular nuclear import machinery controversial results have been reported concerning the mechanisms of this interaction here we demonstrate that a recently identified nuclear localization signal within the hiv  matrix protein ma  ma nls  together with previously described ma nls  mediates nuclear import of the hiv  pic inactivation of both ma nlss precluded nuclear translocation of ma and rendered the virus defective in nuclear import and replication in non dividing macrophage cultures even when functional vpr and integrase in  two more viral proteins implicated in hiv  nuclear import were present taken together these results indicate that vpr does not function as an independent nuclear import factor and demonstrate that hiv  ma by virtue of its two nuclear localization signals regulates hiv  nuclear import
