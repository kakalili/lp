glutamate versus glutamine exchange swaps substrate selectivity in trna guanine transglycosylase insight into the regulation of substrate selectivity by kinetic and crystallographic studies
bacterial trna guanine transglycosylase tgt catalyses the exchange of guanine in the wobble position of particular trnas by the modified base preq  in vitro however the enzyme is also able to insert the immediate biosynthetic precursor preq  into those trnas this substrate promiscuity is based on a peptide switch in the active site gated by the general acid base glu   the switch alters the properties of the binding pocket to allow either the accommodation of guanine or preq  the peptide conformer recognising guanine however is also able to bind preq  to investigate selectivity regulation kinetic data for zymomonas mobilis tgt were recorded they show that selectivity in favour of the actual substrate preq over preq is not achieved by a difference in affinity but via a higher turnover rate moreover a tgt glu  gln variant was constructed the mutation was intended to stabilise the peptide switch in the conformation favouring guanine and preq binding kinetic characterisation of the mutated enzyme revealed that the glu  gln exchange has with respect to all substrate bases no significant influence on kcat in contrast km preq  is drastically increased while km preq  seems to be decreased hence regarding kcat km as an indicator for catalytic efficiency selectivity of tgt in favour of preq is abolished or even inverted in favour of preq for tgt glu  gln  crystal structures of the mutated enzyme confirm that the mutation strongly favours the binding pocket conformation required for the accommodation of guanine and preq  the way this is achieved however significantly differs from that predicted based on crystal structures of wild type tgt
