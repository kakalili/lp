groel es buffering and compensatory mutations promote protein evolution by stabilizing folding intermediates
maintaining stability is a major constraint in protein evolution because most mutations are destabilizing buffering and or compensatory mechanisms that counteract this progressive destabilization during functional adaptation are pivotal for protein evolution as well as protein engineering however the interplay of these two mechanisms during a full evolutionary trajectory has never been explored here we unravel such dynamics during the laboratory evolution of a phosphotriesterase into an arylesterase a controllable groel es chaperone co expression system enabled us to vary the selection environment between buffering and compensatory which smoothened the trajectory along the fitness landscape to achieve a gt   increase in arylesterase activity biophysical characterization revealed that in contrast to prevalent models of protein stability and evolution the variants soluble cellular expression did not correlate with in vitro stability and compensatory mutations were linked to a stabilization of folding intermediates thus folding kinetics in the cell are a key feature of protein evolvability
