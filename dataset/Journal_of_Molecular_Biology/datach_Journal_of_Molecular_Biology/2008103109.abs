conservation of transition state structure in fast folding peripheral subunit binding domains
value analysis was used to characterise the structure of the transition state ts for folding of pob l  a y  w a peripheral subunit binding domain that folds in microseconds helix  was structured in the ts with consolidating interactions from the structured loop that connects the two  helices this distribution of  values was very similar to that determined for e bd f  w a homologue with high sequence and structural similarity the extrapolated folding rate constants in water at   k were     s   for pob and     s   for e bd a contribution to the faster folding of pob came from its having significantly greater helical propensity in helix  the folding nucleus the folding rate also appeared to be influenced by differences in the sequence and structural properties of the loop connecting the two helices unimodal downhill folding has been proposed as a conserved biologically important property of peripheral subunit binding domains pob folds five times faster and e bd folds slower than a proposed limit of     s   for barrier limited folding however experimental evidence strongly suggests that both pob l  a y  w and e bd f  w fold in a barrier limited process through a very similar ts ensemble
