overcoming hysteresis to attain reversible equilibrium folding for outer membrane phospholipase a in phospholipid bilayers
the free energy of unfolding of a membrane protein from lipids into water  gow l describes its equilibrium thermodynamic stability knowing this parameter gives insight into a membrane protein s sequence  structure  energy relationships however there are few measures of membrane protein stability because of the technical difficulties associated with unfolded and partially folded states here we describe the experimental process that allowed us to measure the  gow l of the outer membrane phospholipase a into large unilamellar vesicles luvs of   dilauroyl sn glycero  phosphocholine to arrive at this reversible folding condition we screened a large number of experimental variables temperature incubation time salt concentration ph lipid composition and liposome morphology the principal challenge we encountered under most conditions was hysteresis between folding and unfolding titrations a second factor that compromised reversible folding was the observation that a fraction of the protein population tended to aggregate we found that hysteresis could be completely eliminated on a feasible timescale by conducting experiments at acidic ph by the slow dilution of the protein in the initial titration setup and by utilizing a low concentration of a detergent as a temporary  holdase  to solubilize the protein upon its initial dilution into folding conditions we confirmed that the detergent did not disrupt the luvs using fluorescence emission of lipid sensitive dyes and light scattering the results of our parameter search should be generally useful for efforts to measure  gow l for other membrane proteins
