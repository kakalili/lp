thermodynamic measurements of bilayer insertion of a single transmembrane helix chaperoned by fluorinated surfactants
accurate determination of the free energy of transfer of a helical segment from an aqueous into a transmembrane tm conformation is essential for understanding and predicting the folding and stability of membrane proteins until recently direct thermodynamically sound measurements of free energy of insertion of hydrophobic tm peptides were impossible due to peptide aggregation outside the lipid bilayer here we overcome this problem by using fluorinated surfactants that are capable of preventing aggregation but unlike detergents do not themselves interact with the bilayer we have applied the fluorescence correlation spectroscopy methodology to study surfactant chaperoned insertion into preformed popc palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles of the two well studied dye labeled tm peptides of different lengths walp  and walp  extrapolation of the apparent free energy values measured in the presence of surfactants to a zero surfactant concentration yielded free energy values of       and        kcal mol for insertion of walp  and walp  respectively circular dichroism measurements confirmed helical structure of peptides in lipid bilayer in the presence of surfactants and in aqueous mixtures of organic solvents from a combination of thermodynamic and conformational measurements we conclude that the partitioning of a four residue l  a  l  a segment in the context of a continuous helical conformation from an aqueous environment into the hydrocarbon core of the membrane has a favorable free energy of  kcal mol our measurements combined with the predictions of two independent experimental hydrophobicity scales indicate that the per residue cost of transfer of the helical backbone from water to the hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer is unfavorable and is equal to       kcal mol
