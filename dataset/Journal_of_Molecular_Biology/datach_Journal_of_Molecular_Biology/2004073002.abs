multi state unfolding of the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase a tim barrel protein insights into the secondary structure of the stable equilibrium intermediates by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry
the urea induced unfolding of the  subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts from escherichia coli an eight stranded     tim barrel protein has been shown to involve two stable equilibrium intermediates i and i  well populated at   m and  m urea respectively the characterization of the i intermediate by circular dichroism cd spectroscopy has shown that i retains a significant fraction of the native ellipticity the far uv cd signal for the i species closely resembles that of the fully unfolded form to obtain detailed insight into the disruption of secondary structure in the urea induced unfolding process a hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry study was performed on  ts the full length protein was destabilized in increasing concentration of urea the amide hydrogen atoms were pulse labeled with deuterium the labeled samples were quenched in acid and the products were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry consistent with the cd results the i intermediate protects up to    amide hydrogen atoms against exchange while the i intermediate offers no protection electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the peptic fragments derived from  ts labeled at  m urea indicates that most of the region between residues      which constitutes the first four  strands and three  helices          is structured the         module appears to represent the minimum sub core of stability of the i intermediate a    folding model is proposed as a likely alternative to the earlier   folding mechanism for  ts
