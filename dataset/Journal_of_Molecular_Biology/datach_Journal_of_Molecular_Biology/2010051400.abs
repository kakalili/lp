key amino acid residues involved in multi point binding interactions between brazzein a sweet protein and the t r  t r human sweet receptor
the sweet protein brazzein recombinant protein with sequence identical with the native protein lacking the n terminal pyroglutamate the numbering system used has asp as the n terminal residue  activates the human sweet receptor a heterodimeric g protein coupled receptor composed of subunits taste type  receptor  t r  and taste type  receptor  t r  in order to elucidate the key amino acid s responsible for this interaction we mutated residues in brazzein and each of the two subunits of the receptor the effects of brazzein mutations were assayed by a human taste panel and by an in vitro assay involving receptor subunits expressed recombinantly in human embryonic kidney cells the effects of the receptor mutations were assayed by in vitro assay we mutated surface residues of brazzein at three putative interaction sites site  loop   site  n and c termini and adjacent glu  loop   and site  loop     basic residues in site  and acidic residues in site  were essential for positive responses from each assay mutation of y a site  greatly reduced positive responses a bulky side chain at position   site   rather than a side chain with hydrogen bonding potential was required for positive responses as was the presence of the native disulfide bond in loop    site   results from mutagenesis and chimeras of the receptor indicated that brazzein interacts with both t r and t r and that the venus flytrap module of t r is important for brazzein agonism with one exception all mutations of receptor residues at putative interaction sites predicted by wedge models failed to yield the expected decrease in brazzein response the exception ht r  human t r subunit of the sweet receptor r  a ht r  human t r subunit of the sweet receptor  which contained a substitution in lobe  at the interface between the two subunits exhibited a small selective decrease in brazzein activity however because the mutation was found to increase the positive cooperativity of binding by multiple ligands proposed to bind both t r subunits brazzein monellin and sucralose but not those that bind to a single subunit neotame and cyclamate  we suggest that this site is involved in subunit  subunit interaction rather than in direct brazzein binding results from this study support a multi point interaction between brazzein and the sweet receptor by some mechanism other than the proposed wedge models
