increasing methotrexate resistance by combination of active site mutations in human dihydrofolate reductase
methotrexate resistant forms of human dihydrofolate reductase have the potential to protect healthy cells from the toxicity of methotrexate mtx  to improve prognosis during cancer therapy it has been shown that synergistic mtx resistance can be obtained by combining two active site mutations that independently confer weak mtx resistance in order to obtain more highly mtx resistant human dihydrofolate reductase hdhfr variants for this application we used a semi rational approach to obtain combinatorial active site mutants of hdhfr that are highly resistant towards mtx we created a combinatorial mutant library encoding various amino acids at residues phe  phe  and gln  in vivo library selection was achieved in a bacterial system on medium containing high concentrations of mtx we characterized ten novel mtx resistant mutants with different amino acid combinations at residues    and   kinetic and inhibition parameters of the purified mutants revealed that higher mtx resistance roughly correlated with a greater number of mutations the most highly resistant mutants containing three active site mutations kimtx      nm wild type kimtx lt    nm  an inverse correlation was observed between resistance and catalytic efficiency which decreased mostly as a result of increased km toward the substrate dihydrofolate we verified that the mtx resistant hdhfrs can protect eukaryotic cells from mtx toxicity by transfecting the most resistant mutants into dhfr knock out cho cells the transfected variants conferred survival at concentrations of mtx between   fold and gt   fold higher than the wild type enzyme the most resistant triple mutant offering protection beyond the maximal concentration of mtx that could be included in the medium these highly resistant variants of hdhfr offer potential for myeloprotection during administration of mtx in cancer treatment
