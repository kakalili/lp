transcriptional profiling of kr ppel like factor  reveals a function in cell cycle regulation and epithelial differentiation
kr ppel like factor  klf  is an epithelially enriched zinc finger containing transcription factor the expression of which is associated with growth arrest constitutive expression of klf inhibits g s transition of the cell cycle but the manner by which it accomplishes this effect is unclear to better understand the biochemical function of klf  we identified its target genes using cdna microarray analysis in an established human cell line containing inducible klf  rna extracted from induced and control cells were hybridized differentially to microarray chips containing   human cdnas in all   genes with significantly increased expression and   genes with significantly reduced expression due to klf induction were identified the affected genes are sorted to several clusters on the basis of functional relatedness a major cluster belongs to genes involved in cell cycle control within this cluster many up regulated genes are inhibitors of the cell cycle and down regulated genes are promoters of the cell cycle another up regulated gene cluster includes nine keratin genes of which seven are located in a specific region on chromosome   the results indicate that klf is involved in the control of cell proliferation and does so by eliciting changes in expression of numerous cell cycle regulatory genes in a concerted manner furthermore klf regulates expression of a group of epithelial specific keratin genes in a manner consistent with a potential locus control region function
