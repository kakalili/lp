full length rat amylin forms fibrils following substitution of single residues from human amylin
pancreatic amyloid deposits composed of the  amino acid residue peptide amylin represent an integral part of type  diabetes mellitus pathology human amylin ha forms fibrils in vitro and is toxic to cultured pancreatic islet  cells in contrast rat amylin ra which differs from ha by only six amino acid residues in the central region of the peptide residues    does not form fibrils and is not cytotoxic to elucidate the role of individual residues in fibril formation we have generated a series of full length ra variants and examined their ability to form fibrils in vitro single residue substitutions with amino acids from corresponding positions of the ha sequence i e r h l f or v i were sufficient to render ra competent for fibril formation albeit at a small yield combining two or three of these substitutions generally increased the ability to produce fibrils variant ra fibril morphologies were examined by negative stain electron microscopy and found to be similar to those generated by ha itself bulk assays i e involving thioflavin t fluorescence and sedimentation showed that the amount of fibril formation was relatively small for these ra variants when compared to ha under the same conditions fibril growth was demonstrated by time lapse atomic force microscopy and maldi tof mass spectrometry was used to verify that fibrils consisted of full length peptide our observations confirm previous reports that the three proline residues play a dominant negative role in fibril formation however their presence is not sufficient to completely abolish the ability of ra to form fibrils as each of the other three implicated residues i e r  l  and v  also has a dominant modulating effect
