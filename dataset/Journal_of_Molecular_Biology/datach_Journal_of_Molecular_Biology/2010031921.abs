interactions between ptb rrms induce slow motions and increase rna binding affinity
polypyrimidine tract binding protein ptb participates in a variety of functions in eukaryotic cells including alternative splicing mrna stabilization and internal ribosomal entry site mediated translation initiation its mechanism of rna recognition is determined in part by the novel geometry of its two c terminal rna recognition motifs rrm and rrm  which interact with each other to form a stable complex ptb    this complex itself is unusual among rrms suggesting that it performs a specific function for the protein in order to understand the advantage it provides to ptb the fundamental properties of ptb   are examined here as a comparative study of the complex and its two constituent rrms both rrm and rrm adopt folded structures that nmr data show to be similar to their structure in prb   the rna binding properties of the domains differ dramatically the affinity of each separate rrm for polypyrimidine tracts is far weaker than that of ptb   and simply mixing the two rrms does not create an equivalent binding platform  n nmr relaxation experiments show that ptb   has slow microsecond motions throughout both rrms including the interdomain linker this is in contrast to the individual domains rrm and rrm  where only a few backbone amides are flexible on this time scale the slow backbone dynamics of ptb   induced by packing of rrm and rrm  could be essential for high affinity binding to a flexible polypyrimidine tract rna and also provide entropic compensation for its own formation
