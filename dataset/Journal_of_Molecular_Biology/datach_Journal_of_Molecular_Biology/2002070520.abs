comprehensive functional maps of the antigen binding site of an anti erbb antibody obtained with shotgun scanning mutagenesis
shotgun scanning combinatorial mutagenesis was used to study the antigen binding site of fab c  a humanized monoclonal antibody fragment that binds to the extracellular domain of the human oncogene product erbb  essentially all the residues in the fab c complementarity determining regions cdrs were alanine scanned using phage displayed libraries that preferentially allowed side chains to vary as the wild type or alanine a separate homolog scan was performed using libraries that allowed side chains to vary only as the wild type or a similar amino acid residue following binding selections to isolate functional clones dna sequencing was used to determine the wild type mutant ratios at each varied position and these ratios were used to assess the contributions of each side chain to antigen binding the alanine scan revealed that most of the side chains that contribute to antigen binding are located in the heavy chain and the fab c three dimensional structure revealed that these residues fall into two groups the first group consists of solvent exposed residues which likely make energetically favorable contacts with the antigen and thus comprise the functional binding epitope the second group consists of buried residues with side chains that pack against other cdr residues and apparently act as scaffolding to maintain the functional epitope in a binding competent conformation the homolog scan involved subtle mutations and as a result only a subset of the side chains that were intolerant to alanine substitutions were also intolerant to homologous substitutions in particular the    functional epitope surface revealed by alanine scanning shrunk to only    when mapped with homologous substitutions suggesting that this smaller subset of side chains may be involved in more precise contacts with the antigen the results validate shotgun scanning as a rapid and accurate method for determining the functional contributions of individual side chains involved in protein  protein interactions
