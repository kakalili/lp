the  x  protein j mediates dna packaging and viral attachment to host cells
packaging of viral genomes into their respective capsids requires partial neutralization of the highly negatively charged rna or dna many viruses including the microviridae bacteriophages  x   g  and   have solved this problem by coding for a highly positively charged nucleic acid binding protein that is packaged along with the genome the  x  dna binding protein j is  amino acid residues longer than the   and g j proteins by virtue of an additional nucleic acid binding domain at the amino terminus chimeric  x  particles containing the smaller dna binding protein cannot be generated due to procapsid instability during dna packaging however chimeric   and g phages containing the  x  dna binding protein in place of the endogenous j protein assemble and are infectious but are less dense than the respective wild type species in addition host cell attachment and native gel migration assays indicate surface variations of these viruses that are controlled by the nature of the j protein the structure of   packaged with  x  j protein was determined to    resolution and compared with the previously determined structures of  x  and   the structures of the capsid and spike proteins in the chimeric particle remain unchanged within experimental error when compared to the wild type   virion proteins the amino terminal region of the  x  j protein which is missing from wild type   virions is mostly disordered in the   chimera the differences observed between solution properties of wild type  x   wild type   and   chimera including their ability to attach to host cells correlates with the degree of order in the amino terminal domain of the j protein when ordered this domain binds to the interior of the viral capsid and thus might control the flexibility of the capsid in addition the properties of the  x  j protein in the chimera and the results of mutational analyses suggest that an evolutionary correlation may exist between the size of the j protein and the stoichiometry of the dna pilot protein h required in the initial stages of infection hence the function of the j protein is to facilitate dna packaging as well as to mediate surface properties such as cell attachment and infection
