crystal structure of a transcarbamylase like protein from the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis at    resolution
a transcarbamylase like protein essential for arginine biosynthesis in the anaerobic bacterium bacteroides fragilis has been purified and crystallized in space group p    a b     c     the structure was solved using a single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering siras and was refined at    resolution to an r factor of    r free     the molecular model is trimeric and comprises   amino acid residues two phosphate groups and   water molecules the monomer has the consensus transcarbamylase fold with two structural domains linked by two long interdomain helices the putative carbamoyl phosphate binding domain and a binding domain for the second substrate each domain has a central parallel  sheet surrounded by  helices and loops with    topology the putative carbamoyl phosphate binding site is similar to those in ornithine transcarbamylases otcases and aspartate transcarbamylases atcases  however the second substrate binding site is strikingly different this site has several insertions and deletions and residues critical to substrate binding and catalysis in other known transcarbamylases are not conserved the three dimensional structure and the fact that this protein is essential for arginine biosynthesis suggest strongly that it is a new member of the transcarbamylase family a similar protein has been found in xylella fastidiosa a bacterium that infects grapes citrus and other plants
