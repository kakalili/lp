dynamic conformations of the cd  mediated nad cyclization captured in a single crystal
the extracellular domain of human cd  is a multifunctional enzyme involved in the metabolism of two ca  messengers cyclic adp ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate when nad is used as substrate cd  predominantly hydrolyzes it to adp ribose with a trace amount of cyclic adp ribose produced through cyclization of the substrate however mutation of a key residue at the active site e   inhibits the hydrolysis activity of cd  but greatly increases its cyclization activity to understand the role of the residue e  in the catalytic process we determined the crystal structure of the e  a mutant protein with a substrate analogue arabinosyl   fluoro deoxy nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide the structure captured the enzymatic reaction intermediates in six different conformations in a crystallographic asymmetric unit the structural results indicate a folding back process for the adenine ring of the substrate and provide the first multiple snapshots of the process our approach of utilizing multiple molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit should be generally applicable for capturing the dynamic nature of enzymatic catalysis
