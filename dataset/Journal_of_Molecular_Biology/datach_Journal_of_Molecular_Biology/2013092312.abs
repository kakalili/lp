dissection of conformational conversion events during prion amyloid fibril formation using hydrogen exchange and mass spectrometry
a molecular understanding of prion diseases requires an understanding of the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation by the prion protein in particular it is necessary to define the sequence of the structural events describing the conformational conversion of monomeric prp to aggregated prp in this study the sequence of the structural events in the case of amyloid fibril formation by recombinant mouse prion protein at ph has been characterized by hydrogen  deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry the observation that fibrils are substantially more stable to hydrogen  deuterium exchange than is native monomer allows both forms to be quantified during the course of the aggregation reaction under the aggregation conditions utilized native monomeric protein and amyloid fibrils are the only forms of the protein detectable during the course of the fibril formation reaction suggesting that monomer directly adds on to the fibril template conformational conversion is shown to occur in two steps after the binding of monomer to fibril with helix  unfolding only after helices  and  transform into  sheet local stability in the  sheet core region residues       of the fibrils is shown to be sequence dependent in that it varies along the length of the core and local stability in protein molecules that are ordered in the structurally heterogeneous sequence segment      is shown to be similar to that in the core this new understanding of the structural events during prion protein aggregation has important bearing on our comprehension of the molecular basis of prion pathogenesis
