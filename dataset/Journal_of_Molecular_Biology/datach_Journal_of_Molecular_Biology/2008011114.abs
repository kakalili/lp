molecular crowding inhibits intramolecular breathing motions in proteins
in aqueous solution some proteins undergo large scale movements of secondary structures subunits or domains referred to as protein  breathing   that define a native state ensemble of structures these fluctuations are sensitive to the nature and concentration of solutes and other proteins and are thereby expected to be different in the crowded interior of a cell than in dilute solution here we use a combination of wide angle x ray scattering waxs and computational modeling to derive a quantitative measure of the spatial scale of conformational fluctuations in a protein solution concentration dependent changes in the observed scattering intensities are consistent with a model of structural fluctuations in which secondary structures undergo rigid body motions relative to one another this motion increases with decreasing protein concentration or increasing temperature analysis of a set of five structurally and functionally diverse proteins reveals a diversity of kinetic behaviors proteins with multiple disulfide bonds exhibit little or no increase in breathing in dilute solutions the spatial extent of structural fluctuations appears highly dependent on both protein structure and concentration and is universally suppressed at very high protein concentrations
