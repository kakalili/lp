trans cooperativity by a split dna recombinase the central and catalytic domains of bacteriophage lambda integrase cooperate in cleaving dna substrates when the two domains are not covalently linked
site specific recombinases of the  integrase family recognize and cleave their cognate dna sites through cooperative binding to opposite sides of the dna substrate by a c terminal catalytic domain and a flexibly linked  core binding  domain regulation of this cleavage is achieved via the formation of higher order complexes we report that the core binding domain of  integrase is able to stimulate the activity of the catalytic domain even when the two domains are not linked this trans stimulation is accomplished without significantly increasing the affinity of the catalytic domain for its dna substrate moreover we show that mutations in the dna substrate can abrogate this effect while retaining specificity determinants for cleavage since the domains do not significantly interact directly this finding implies that trans activation is achieved via the dna substrate in a manner that may be mechanistically important in this and similar dna binding and cleaving enzymes
