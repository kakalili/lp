contact dependent growth inhibition cdi and cdib cdia two partner secretion proteins
bacteria have developed several strategies to communicate and compete with one another in complex environments one important mechanism of inter bacterial competition is contact dependent growth inhibition cdi  in which gram negative bacteria use cdib cdia two partner secretion proteins to suppress the growth of neighboring target cells cdib is an omp  outer membrane protein that exports and assembles cdia exoproteins onto the inhibitor cell surface cdia binds to receptors on susceptible bacteria and subsequently delivers its c terminal toxin domain cdia ct into the target cell cdi systems also encode cdii immunity proteins which specifically bind to the cdia ct and neutralize its toxin activity thereby protecting cdi cells from auto inhibition remarkably cdia ct sequences are highly variable between bacteria as are the corresponding cdii immunity proteins variations in cdi toxin immunity proteins suggest that these systems function in bacterial self non self recognition and thereby play an important role in microbial communities in this review we discuss recent advances in the biochemistry structural biology and physiology of cdi
