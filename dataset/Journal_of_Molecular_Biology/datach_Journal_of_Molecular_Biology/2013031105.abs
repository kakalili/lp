a  mechanistic  explanation of the multiple helical forms adopted by bacterial flagellar filaments
the corkscrew like flagellar filaments emerging from the surface of bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium propel the cells toward nutrient and away from repellents this kind of motility depends upon the ability of the flagellar filaments to adopt a range of distinct helical forms a filament is typically constructed from     identical flagellin molecules which self assemble into a tubular structure containing  near longitudinal protofilaments a  mechanical  model in which the flagellin building block has the capacity to switch between two principal interfacial states predicts that the filament can assemble into a  canonical  family of  distinct helical forms each having unique curvature and twist these include two  extreme  straight forms having left and right handed twists respectively and  intermediate helical forms measured shapes of the filaments correspond well with predictions of the model this report is concerned with two unanswered questions first what properties of the flagellin determine which of the  discrete forms is preferred second how does the interfacial  switch  work at a molecular level our proposed solution of these problems is based mainly on a detailed examination of differences between the available electron cryo microscopy structures of the straight l and r filaments respectively
