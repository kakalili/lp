contribution of myosin rod protein to the structural organization of adult and embryonic muscles in drosophila
myosin rod protein mrp is a naturally occurring   kda protein in drosophila that includes the myosin heavy chain mhc rod domain but contains a unique  amino acid residue n terminal region that replaces the motor and light chain binding domains of s  mrp is a major component of myofilaments in certain direct flight muscles dfms and it is present in other somatic cardiac and visceral muscles in adults larvae and embryos where it is coexpressed and polymerized into thick filaments along with mhc dfm  has a relatively high content of mrp and is characterized by an unusually disordered myofibrillar ultrastructure which has been attributed to lack of cross bridges in the filament regions containing mrp here we characterize in detail the structural organization of myofibrils in adult and embryonic drosophila muscles containing various mrp mhc ratios and in embryos carrying a null mutation for the single mhc gene we examined mrp in embryonic body wall and intestinal muscles as well as in dfms with consistent findings in dfms numbers    and   mrp is expressed at a high level relative to mhc and is associated with disorder in the positioning of thin filaments relative to thick filaments in the areas of overlap embryos that express mrp in the absence of mhc form thick filaments that participate in the assembly of sarcomeres suggesting that myofibrillogenesis does not depend on strong myosin  actin interactions further although thick filaments are not well ordered the relative positioning of thin filaments is fairly regular in mrp only containing sarcomeres confirming the hypothesis that the observed disorder in mrp mhc containing wild type muscles is due to the combined action between the functional behavior of mrp and mhc myosin heads our findings support the conclusion that mrp has an active function to modulate the contractile activity of muscles in which it is expressed
