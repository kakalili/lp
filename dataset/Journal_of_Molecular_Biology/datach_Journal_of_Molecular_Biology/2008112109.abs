localization of the n terminus of minor coat protein iiia in the adenovirus capsid
minor coat protein iiia is conserved in all adenoviruses ads and is required for correct viral assembly but its precise function in capsid organization is unknown the latest ad capsid model proposes that iiia is located underneath the vertex region to obtain experimental evidence on the location of iiia and to further define its role we engineered the iiia gene to encode heterologous n terminal peptide extensions recombinant ad variants with iiia encoding six histidine  his tag  his and flag peptides or with his linked to flag with a gly ser  linker were rescued and analyzed for virus yield capsid incorporation of heterologous peptides and capsid stability longer extensions could not be rescued western blot analysis confirmed that the modified iiia proteins were expressed in infected cells and incorporated into virions in the ad encoding the his  linker  flag  iiia gene the his tag was present in light particles but not in mature virions immunoelectron microscopy of this virus showed that the flag epitope is not accessible to antibodies on the viral particles three dimensional electron microscopy and difference mapping located the iiia n terminal extension beneath the vertex complex wedged at the interface between the penton base and peripentonal hexons therefore supporting the latest proposed model the position of the iiia n terminus and its low tolerance for modification provide new clues for understanding the role of this minor coat protein in ad capsid assembly and disassembly
