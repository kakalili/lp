x ray crystallographic studies of serotonin n acetyltransferase catalysis and inhibition edited by d rees
the structure of serotonin n acetyltransferase also known as arylalkylamine n acetyltransferase aanat bound to a potent bisubstrate analog inhibitor has been determined at    resolution using a two edge se br multiwavelength anomalous diffraction mad experiment this acetyl coa dependent enzyme is a member of the gcn related family of n acetyltransferases gnats  which share four conserved sequence motifs a d  in serotonin n acetyltransferase motif a adopts an    conformation characteristic of the phylogenetically invariant cofactor binding site seen in all previously characterized gnats motif b displays a significantly lower level of conservation among family members giving rise to a novel    structure for the serotonin binding slot utilization of a brominated coa s acetyl tryptamine bisubstrate analog inhibitor and the mad method permitted conclusive identification of two radically different conformations for the tryptamine moiety in the catalytic site cis and trans  a second high resolution x ray structure of the enzyme bound to a bisubstrate analog inhibitor with a longer tether between the acetyl coa and tryptamine moieties demonstrates only the trans conformation given a previous proposal that aanat can catalyze an alkyltransferase reaction in a conformationally altered active site relative to its acetyltransferase activity it is possible that the two conformations of the bisubstrate analog observed crystallographically correspond to these alternative reaction pathways our findings may ultimately lead to the design of analogs with improved aanat inhibitory properties for in vivo applications
