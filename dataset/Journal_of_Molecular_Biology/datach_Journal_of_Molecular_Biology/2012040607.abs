membrane protein insertion of variant mscl proteins occurs at yidc and secyeg of escherichia coli
the mechanosensitive channel mscl in the inner membrane of escherichia coli is a homopentameric complex involved in homeostasis when cells are exposed to hypoosmotic conditions the e coli mscl protein is synthesized as a polypeptide of   amino acid residues and uses the bacterial signal recognition particle for membrane targeting the protein is inserted into the membrane independently of the sec translocon but requires yidc depletion of yidc inhibits translocation of the protein across the membrane insertion of mscl occurs primarily in a proton motive force independent manner the hydrophilic loop region of mscl has  residues that include  charged residues altering the charges in the periplasmic loop of mscl affects the requirements for membrane insertion the introduction of one two or three negatively charged amino acids makes the insertion dependent on the electrochemical membrane potential and gradually dependent on the sec translocon whereas the addition of five negatively charged residues as well as the addition of three positively charged residues inhibits membrane insertion of mscl however we find that the mutant with three uncharged residues requires both the secyeg complex and yidc but not seca for membrane insertion in vivo cross linking data showed that the newly synthesized mscl interacts with yidc and with secy therefore the mscl mutants use a membrane insertion mechanism that involves secyeg and yidc simultaneously
