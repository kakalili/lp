cryoem structure and molecular model of the myriapod scutigera   mer hemocyanin understanding a giant oxygen transport protein
oxygen transport in myriapoda is maintained by a unique   mer hemocyanin that is   subunits arranged as six hexamers   mers  in the sluggish diplopod spirostreptus the   mers seem to operate as almost or fully independent allosteric units h    p    torr  whereas in the swift centipede scutigera they intensively cooperate allosterically h    p     torr  here we show the chemomechanical basis of this differential behavior as deduced from hybrid   mer structures obtained by single particle cryo electron microscopy of the scutigera   mer      resolution according to the   criterion and docking of homology modeled subunits from scutigera and two diplopods spirostreptus and polydesmus the scutigera   mer hemocyanin is a trigonal antiprism assembled from six smaller trigonal antiprisms   mers  thereby exhibiting d point group symmetry it can be described as two staggered   mers or three oblique   mers topologically the   mer is subdivided into six subunit zones thereby exhibiting a mantle   subunits and a core   subunits  the six hexamers are linked by  bridges subdivided into five types two within each   mer and three between both   mers the molecular models of the   mer reveal intriguing amino acid appositions at these inter hexamer interfaces besides opportunities for salt bridges we found pairs of carboxylate residues for possible bridging via a ca  or mg  ion moreover we detected histidine clusters notably in scutigera allowing us to advance hypotheses as to how the hexamers are allosterically coupled in centipede hemocyanin and why they act more independently in diplopod hemocyanin
