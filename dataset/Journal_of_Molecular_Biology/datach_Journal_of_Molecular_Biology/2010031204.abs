the effects of capz peptide trtk   binding to s  b  ca  as examined by nmr and x ray crystallography
structure based drug design is underway to inhibit the s  b  p  interaction as a strategy for treating malignant melanoma x ray crystallography was used here to characterize an interaction between ca   s  b and trtk   a target that binds to the p  binding site on s  b the structures of ca   s  b     resolution and s  b  ca   trtk      resolution determined here indicate that the s  b  ca   trtk  complex is dominated by an interaction between trp of trtk  and a hydrophobic binding pocket exposed on ca   s  b involving residues in helices  and  and loop  as with an s  b  ca   p  peptide complex trtk  binding to ca   s  b was found to increase the protein s ca  binding affinity one explanation for this effect was that peptide binding introduced a structural change that increased the number of ca  ligands and or improved the ca  coordination geometry of s  b this possibility was ruled out when the structures of s  b  ca   trtk  and s  b  ca  were compared and calcium ion coordination by the protein was found to be nearly identical in both ef hand calcium binding domains rmsd    on the other hand b factors for residues in ef of ca   s  b were found to be significantly lowered with trtk  bound this result is consistent with nmr  n relaxation studies that showed that trtk  binding eliminated dynamic properties observed in ca   s  b such a loss of protein motion may also provide an explanation for how calcium ion binding affinity is increased upon binding a target lastly it follows that any small molecule inhibitor bound to ca   s  b would also have to cause an increase in calcium ion binding affinity to be effective therapeutically inside a cell so these data need to be considered in future drug design studies involving s  b
