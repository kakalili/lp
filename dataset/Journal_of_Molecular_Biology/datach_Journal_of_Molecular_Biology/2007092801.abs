heat induced conversion of   microglobulin and hen egg white lysozyme into amyloid fibrils
thermodynamic parameters characterizing protein stability can be obtained for a fully reversible folding unfolding system directly by differential scanning calorimetry dsc  however the reversible dsc profile can be altered by an irreversible step causing aggregation here to obtain insight into amyloid fibrils ordered and fibrillar aggregates responsible for various amyloidoses we studied the effects on human   microglobulin and hen egg white lysozyme of a combination of agitation and heating aggregates formed by mildly agitating protein solutions in the native state in the presence of nacl were heated in the cell of the dsc instrument for   microglobulin with an increase in the concentration of nacl at neutral ph the thermogram began to show an exothermic transition accompanied by a large decrease in heat capacity followed by a kinetically controlled thermal response similarly the aggregated lysozyme at a high concentration of nacl revealed a similar distinct transition in the dsc thermogram over a wide ph range electron microscopy demonstrated the conformational change into amyloid fibrils taken together the combined use of agitation and heating is a powerful way to generate amyloid fibrils from two proteins   microglobulin and hen egg white lysozyme and to evaluate the effects of heat on fibrillation in which the heat capacity is crucial to characterizing the transition
