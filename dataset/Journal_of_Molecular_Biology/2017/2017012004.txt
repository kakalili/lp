Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) is a stress granule-associated RNA-binding protein that plays a role in apoptosis and cellular stress recovery. HnRNP A1 is a major non-histone target of protein arginine methyltransferase 1, which asymmetrically dimethylates hnRNP A1 at several key arginine residues within its arginine–glycine–glycine (RGG)-motif region. Although arginine methylation is known to regulate general RNA binding of hnRNP A1 in vitro, the functional role of arginine methylation in hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic activity is unknown. To test the impact of key methylarginine residues on hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic activity and stress granule association, cytoplasmically restricted Flag-tagged mutants of hnRNP A1 were generated in which key methylarginine residues within the RGG-motif region were changed to either lysine or alanine. Lysine substitution, which mimics unmethylated arginine, resulted in a 40% increase in internal ribosome entry site trans-acting factor (ITAF) activity and the protein readily associates with stress granules. Alanine substitution resulted in a loss of ITAF activity and reduced mRNA binding. The alanine mutant also displays reduced stress granule association and suppresses stress granule formation. Our data suggest that arginine residues within the RGG-motif region are critical for hnRNP A1 cytoplasmic activities and that endogenous asymmetric dimethylation of the RGG-motif region suppresses hnRNP A1 ITAF activity in cells. Our findings indicate that methylarginine residues within the RGG-motif region of hnRNP A1 are important for its cytoplasmic activities and that hypomethylation and/or mutation of the RGG-motif region may contribute to the role of hnRNP A1 in diseases such as cancer.
