the escherichia coli motab proton channel unplugged
the mota and motb proteins of escherichia coli serve two functions the mota motb complex attaches to the cell wall via motb to form the stator of the flagellar motor the complex also couples the flow of hydrogen ions across the cell membrane to movement of the rotor the tm and tm transmembrane helices of mota and the single tm of motb comprise the proton channel which is inactive until the complex assembles into a motor here we identify a segment of the motb protein that acts as a plug to prevent premature proton flow the plug is in the periplasm just c terminal to the motb tm it consists of an amphipathic  helix flanked by pro  and pro  when mota is over expressed with motb deleted for residues     a massive influx of protons acidifies the cytoplasm without significantly depleting the proton motive force either that acidification or some sequela thereof such as potassium or water efflux from the cells inhibits growth the pro residues and ile  tyr  and phe  are essential for plug function cys substituted motb proteins form a disulfide bond between the two plugs that hold the channels open and the plugs function in trans within the mota motb complex we present a model in which the mota motb complex forms in the bulk membrane before association with a motor we propose the plugs insert into the cell membrane parallel with its periplasmic face and interfere with channel formation when a complex incorporates into a motor the plugs leave the membrane and associate with each other via their hydrophobic faces to hold the proton channel open
