solution structure of histone chaperone anp b interaction with core histones h  h through its acidic concave domain
eukaryotic gene expression is regulated by histone deposition onto and eviction from nucleosomes which are mediated by several chromatin modulating factors among them histone chaperones are key factors that facilitate nucleosome assembly acidic nuclear phosphoprotein  b anp b belongs to the anp  family which shares n terminal leucine rich repeats lrrs and a c terminal variable anionic region the c terminal region functions as an inhibitor of histone acetylation but the functional roles of the lrr domain in chromatin regulation have remained elusive here we report that the lrr domain of anp b possesses histone chaperone activity and forms a curved structure with a parallel  sheet on the concave side and mostly helical elements on the convex side our analyses revealed that the interaction of anp b with the core histones h  h occurs on its concave side and both the acidic and hydrophobic residues that compose the concave surface are critical for histone binding these results provide a structural framework for understanding the functional mechanisms of acidic histone chaperones
