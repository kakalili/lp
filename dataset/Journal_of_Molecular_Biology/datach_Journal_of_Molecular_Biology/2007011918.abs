crystal structure of the bifunctional atp sulfurylase   aps kinase from the chemolithotrophic thermophile aquifex aeolicus
the thermophilic chemolithotroph aquifex aeolicus expresses a gene product that exhibits both atp sulfurylase and adenosine   phosphosulfate aps kinase activities these enzymes are usually segregated on two separate proteins in most bacteria fungi and plants the domain arrangement in the aquifex enzyme is reminiscent of the fungal atp sulfurylase which contains a c terminal domain that is homologous to aps kinase yet displays no kinase activity rather in the fungal enzyme the motif serves as a sulfurylase regulatory domain that binds the allosteric effector   phosphoadenosine   phosphosulfate paps  the product of true aps kinase therefore the aquifex enzyme may represent an ancestral homolog of a primitive bifunctional enzyme from which the fungal atp sulfurylase may have evolved in heterotrophic sulfur assimilating organisms such as fungi atp sulfurylase catalyzes the first committed step in sulfate assimilation to produce aps which is subsequently metabolized to generate all sulfur containing biomolecules in contrast atp sulfurylase in sulfur chemolithotrophs catalyzes the reverse reaction to produce atp and sulfate from aps and pyrophosphate here the     resolution x ray crystal structure of aquifex atp sulfurylase  aps kinase bifunctional enzyme is presented the protein dimerizes through its aps kinase domain and contains adp bound in all four active sites comparison of the aquifex atp sulfurylase active site with those from sulfate assimilators reveals similar dispositions of the bound nucleotide and nearby residues this suggests that minor perturbations are responsible for optimizing the kinetic properties for the physiologically relevant direction the aps kinase active site lid adopts two distinct conformations where one conformation is distorted by crystal contacts additionally a disulfide bond is observed in one atp binding p loop of the aps kinase active site this linkage accounts for the low kinase activity of the enzyme under oxidizing conditions the thermal stability of the aquifex enzyme can be explained by the   decreased cavity volume found within the protein core
