multiple unfolding events during native folding of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme
despite the ubiquitous nature of misfolded intermediates in rna folding little is known about their physical properties or the folding transitions that allow them to continue folding productively folding of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme includes sequential accumulation of two intermediates termed itrap and misfolded m  here we probe the structure and folding transition of itrap and compare them to those of m hydroxyl radical and dimethyl sulfate footprinting show that both itrap and m are extensively structured and crudely resemble the native rna however regions of the core p  p domain are more exposed to solvent in itrap than in m itrap rearranges to continue folding nearly   fold faster than m and urea accelerates folding of itrap much less than m thus the rate limiting transition from itrap requires a smaller increase in exposed surface mutations that disrupt peripheral tertiary contacts give large and nearly uniform increases in re folding of m whereas the same mutations give at most modest increases in folding from itrap intriguingly mutations within the peripheral element p abc give  to  fold accelerations in escape from itrap whereas ablation of p  which lies on the opposite surface in the native structure near the p  p domain has no effect thus the unfolding required from itrap appears to be local whereas the unfolding of m appears to be global further the modest effects from several mutations suggest that there are multiple pathways for escape from itrap and that escape is aided by loosening nearby native structural constraints presumably to facilitate local movements of nucleotides or segments that have not formed native contacts overall these and prior results suggest a model in which the global architecture and peripheral interactions of the rna are achieved relatively early in folding multiple folding and re folding events occur on the predominant pathway to the native state with increasing native core interactions and cooperativity as folding progresses
