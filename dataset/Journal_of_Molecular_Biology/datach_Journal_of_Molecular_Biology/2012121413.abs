structural insights on the plant salt overly sensitive  sos  na h antiporter
the arabidopsis thaliana na h antiporter salt overly sensitive  sos  is essential to maintain low intracellular levels of toxic na under salt stress available data show that the plant sos protein kinase and its interacting activator the sos calcium binding protein function together in decoding calcium signals elicited by salt stress and regulating the phosphorylation state and the activity of sos  molecular genetic studies have shown that the activation implies a domain reorganization of the antiporter cytosolic moiety indicating that there is a clear relationship between function and molecular structure of the antiporter to provide information on this issue we have carried out in vivo and in vitro studies on the oligomerization state of sos  in addition we have performed electron microscopy and single particle reconstruction of negatively stained full length and active sos  our studies show that the protein is a homodimer that contains a membrane domain similar to that found in other antiporters of the family and an elongated large and structured cytosolic domain both the transmembrane tm and cytosolic moieties contribute to the dimerization of the antiporter the close contacts between the tm and the cytosolic domains provide a link between regulation and transport activity of the antiporter
