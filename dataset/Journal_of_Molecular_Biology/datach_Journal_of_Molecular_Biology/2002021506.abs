molecular modelling of the c terminal domains of factor h of human complement a correlation between haemolytic uraemic syndrome and a predicted heparin binding site edited by r huber
factor h fh of the complement system acts as a regulatory cofactor for the factor i mediated cleavage of c b and binds to polyanionic substrates fh is composed of  short consensus complement repeat scr domains a set of  missense mutations in the c terminal domains between scr  to scr  is associated with haemolytic uraemic syndrome recent structural models for intact fh permit the molecular interpretation of these amino acid substitutions as all nine scr  substitutions correspond to normal amounts of fh in plasma and were localised in mostly surface exposed positions these are inferred to lead to a functional defect in fh the nine substitutions occur in the same spatial region of scr   as this surface coincides with conserved basic residues in the c terminal scr  domain the substitutions provide direct evidence for a polyanionic binding surface the positions of these conserved basic residues coincide with those of heparin binding residues in the crystal structure of the acidic fibroblast growth factor heparin complex a tenth substitution and another conserved basic residue in scr  are proximate to this binding site as the remaining fh substitutions could also be correlated with their proximity to conserved basic residues haemolytic uraemic syndrome may result from a failure of fh to interact with polyanions at cell surfaces in the kidney
