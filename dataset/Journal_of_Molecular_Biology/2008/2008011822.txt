SRC homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase substrate 1 (SHPS-1 or SIRPα/BIT) is an immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily transmembrane receptor and a member of the signal regulatory protein (SIRP) family involved in cell–cell interaction. SHPS-1 binds to its ligand CD47 to relay an inhibitory signal for cellular responses, whereas SIRPβ, an activating member of the same family, does not bind to CD47 despite sharing a highly homologous ligand-binding domain with SHPS-1. To address the molecular basis for specific CD47 recognition by SHPS-1, we present the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of murine SHPS-1 (mSHPS-1). Folding topology revealed that mSHPS-1 adopts an I2-set Ig fold, but its overall structure resembles IgV domains of antigen receptors, although it has an extended loop structure (C′E loop), which forms a dimer interface in the crystal. Site-directed mutagenesis studies of mSHPS-1 identified critical residues for CD47 binding including sites in the C′E loop and regions corresponding to complementarity-determining regions of antigen receptors. The structural and functional features of mSHPS-1 are consistent with the human SHPS-1 structure except that human SHPS-1 has an additional β-strand D. These results suggest that the variable complementarity-determining region-like loop structures in the binding surface of SHPS-1 are generally required for ligand recognition in a manner similar to that of antigen receptors, which may explain the diverse ligand-binding specificities of SIRP family receptors.
