heparin binds to the laminin   chain lg domain at a site different from that found for other laminins
we previously reported that the lg domain of the laminin   chain is responsible for high affinity heparin binding to specify the amino acid residues involved in this activity we produced a series of   lg fusion proteins in which each of the  basic residues arginine r histidine lysine k were replaced one by one with alanine a  when the effective residues r  a k  a k  a and k  a are mapped on a structural model they form a track on the concave surface of the  sandwich suggesting that they interact with adjacent sulfate groups along the heparin chain whereas low affinity heparin binding sites of other lg domains have been located at the top of the  sheet sandwich opposite the n and c termini the residues for high affinity heparin binding of   lg reveal a new topological area of the lg module
