a complex rna cleaving dnazyme that can efficiently cleave a pyrimidine  pyrimidine junction
several rna cleaving deoxyribozymes dnazymes have been reported for efficient cleavage of purine containing junctions but none is able to efficiently cleave pyrimidine  pyrimidine pyr  pyr junctions we hypothesize that a stronger pyr  pyr cleavage activity requires larger dnazymes with complex structures that are difficult to isolate directly from a dna library one possible way to obtain such dnazymes is to optimize dna sequences with weak activities to test this we carried out an in vitro selection study to derive dnazymes capable of cleaving an rc t junction in a chimeric dna rna substrate from dna libraries constructed through chemical mutagenesis of five previous dnazymes with a kobs of      min   for the rc t junction after several rounds of selective amplification dnazyme descendants with a kobs of     min   were obtained from a dnazyme pool the most efficient motif denoted  ct      was found to have a catalytic core of    nt larger than other known rna cleaving dnazymes and its secondary structure contains five short duplexes confined by a four way junction several variants of ct    exhibit a kobs of      min   against the rc t junction ct    also shows strong activity kobs gt   min   for ru a and ru t junctions medium activity  gt    min   for rc a and ra t junctions and weak activity  gt    min   for ra a rg t and rg a junctions interestingly a single point mutation within the catalytic core of ct    altered the pattern of junction specificity with a significantly decreased ability to cleave rc t and rc a junctions and a substantially increased ability to cleave ra a ra t rg a rg t ru a and ru t junctions this observation illustrates the intricacy and plasticity of this rna cleaving dnazyme in dinucleotide junction selectivity the current study shows that it is feasible to derive efficient dnazymes for a difficult chemical task and reveals that dnazymes require more complex structural solutions for such a task
