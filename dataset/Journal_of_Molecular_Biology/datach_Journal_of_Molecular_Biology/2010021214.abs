the effect of hydrophilic substitutions and anionic lipids upon the transverse positioning of the transmembrane helix of the erbb  neu protein incorporated into model membrane vesicles
the sequence of the transmembrane tm helix of erbb  a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor erbb family can influence its activity in this report the sequence and lipid dependence of the transverse position of a model membrane inserted peptides containing the erbb tm helix and some of the juxtamembrane jm residues were studied for the erbb tm helix inserted into phosphatidylcholine vesicles the activating v  e mutation was found to induce a transverse shift involving the movement of the e residue toward the membrane surface this shortened the effective length of the tm spanning portion of the sequence the transverse shift was observed with the e  residue in both the uncharged and charged states but the extent of the shift was larger when the e residue was charged when a series of hydrophilic residues was substituted for v   the resulting transverse shifts at ph   decreased in the order d h gt e gt q gt k gt g gt v except for his this order is strongly correlated to that reported for the degree to which these substitutions induce cellular transformation when introduced into full length erbb  to examine the effect of lipid on transverse shift we studied the uncharged v  q mutation the presence of   of the anionic lipid dops dioleoylphosphatidylserine in the model membrane vesicles which introduces a physiologically relevant level of anionic lipid did not affect the degree of transverse shift however in the case of a peptide containing a v  q substitution in which the q is closer to the c terminus of the erbb tm helix than the n terminus transverse shift was suppressed in vesicles containing   dops this suggests that the interaction of the cationic jm residues flanking the c terminus of the erbb tm helix interact with anionic lipids to anchor the c terminal end of the tm helix this anchoring site may act as a pivot that amplifies transverse movements of the erbb tm segment to induce a large swinging type motion in the extracellular domain of the protein affecting erbb activity interactions interrupting c terminal jm residue association with anionic lipid might partly impact erbb activity by disrupting this pivoting
