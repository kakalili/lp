crucial points within the pore as determinants of k channel conductance and gating
while selective for k  k channels vary significantly among their rate of ion permeation here we probe the effect of steric hindrance and electrostatics within the ion conduction pathway on k permeation in the mthk k channel using structure based mutagenesis combined with single channel electrophysiology and x ray crystallography we demonstrate that changes in side chain size and polarity at ala  which forms the constriction point of the open mthk pore have profound effects on single channel conductance as well as open probability we also reveal that the negatively charged glu s at the intracellular entrance of the open pore form an electrostatic trap which stabilizes a hydrated k and facilitates ion permeation this electrostatic attraction is also responsible for intracellular divalent blockage which renders the channel inward rectified in the presence of ca  in light of the high structural conservation of the selectivity filter the size and chemical environment differences within the portion of the ion conduction pathway other than the filter are likely the determinants for the conductance variations among k channels
