experimental validation of plant peroxisomal targeting prediction algorithms by systematic comparison of in vivo import efficiency and in vitro pts binding affinity
most peroxisomal matrix proteins possess a c terminal targeting signal type  pts  accurate prediction of functional pts sequences and their relative strength by computational methods is essential for determination of peroxisomal proteomes in silico but has proved challenging due to high levels of sequence variability of non canonical targeting signals particularly in higher plants and low levels of availability of experimentally validated non canonical examples in this study in silico predictions were compared with in vivo targeting analyses and in vitro thermodynamic binding of mutated variants within the context of one model targeting sequence there was broad agreement between the methods for entire pts domains and position specific single amino acid residues including residues upstream of the pts tripeptide the hierarchy leu gt met gt ile gt val at the c terminal position was determined for all methods but both experimental approaches suggest that tyr is underweighted in the prediction algorithm due to the absence of this residue in the positive training dataset a combination of methods better defines the score range that discriminates a functional pts  in vitro binding to the pex receptor could discriminate among strong targeting signals while in vivo targeting assays were more sensitive allowing detection of weak functional import signals that were below the limit of detection in the binding assay together the data provide a comprehensive assessment of the factors driving pts efficacy and provide a framework for the more quantitative assessment of the protein import pathway in higher plants
