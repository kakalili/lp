location of high and low affinity fatty acid binding sites on human serum albumin revealed by nmr drug competition analysis
human serum albumin hsa is an abundant plasma protein that transports a wide variety of drugs and endogenous compounds the complex binding capacity of hsa has made it a challenging system to study in detail but in order to develop our understanding of the interactions between ligands for hsa the locations and relative affinities of different ligand binding sites must be determined albumin possesses multiple binding sites for its primary physiological ligand non esterified fatty acids fa  previously titration of bsa with  c labeled fa revealed multiple chemical shifts and allowed identification of a subset of three chemical shifts that were associated with high affinity fa binding recent crystallographic studies of hsa have mapped at least seven fa binding sites for long chain fa and delineated the overlap with binding sites for drugs and other endogenous compounds we aim to correlate nmr and structural data for fa to provide a more complete description of the binding capacity of hsa our recent mutagenesis studies allowed us to identify two high affinity binding sites in domain iii of hsa here we use nmr to study the binding of  c carboxyl labeled palmitate to hsa in the presence and absence of competitor ligands to complete the correlation of nmr chemical shifts with specific structural binding sites we carefully selected ligands with specific binding sites identified by crystallography and used them either singly or in combination to compete with  c palmitate for binding to hsa we show that fa sites   and  bind fa with high affinity while sites     and  exhibit low affinity for fa thus providing the first complete determination of relative affinities of all seven long chain fa sites on hsa our results also yield direct insights into the interactions between fa and other ligands
