solution structure of the module x  of unknown function of the cellulosomal scaffolding protein cipc of clostridium cellulolyticum edited by r huber
multidimensional homo and heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with dynamical annealing has been used to determine the structure of a  residue module x   of the scaffolding protein cipc from the anaerobic bacterium clostridium cellulolyticum an experimental data set comprising   nuclear overhauser effect derived restraints   hydrogen bond restraints and    torsion angle restraints was used to calculate  converging final solutions the calculated structures have an average rmsd about the mean structure of         for backbone atoms and         for all heavy atoms when fitted over the secondary structural elements the x  module has an immunoglobulin like fold with two  sheets packed against each other one sheet contains three strands the second contains four strands an additional strand is intercalated between the  sandwich as well as two turns of a   helix x  has a surprising conformational stability and may act as a conformational linker and solubility enhancer within the scaffolding protein the fold of x  is very similar to that of telokin titin ig domain hemolin d domain twitchin immunoglobulin domain and the first four domains of the igsf portion of transmembrane cell adhesion molecule as a consequence the x  module is the first prokaryotic member assigned to the i set of the immunoglobulin superfamily even though no sequence similarity with any member of this superfamily could be detected
