crystal structure of a rigid four spectrin repeat fragment of the human desmoplakin plakin domain
the plakin protein family serves to connect cell  cell and cell  matrix adhesion molecules to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton desmoplakin dp is an integral part of desmosomes where it links desmosomal cadherins to the intermediate filaments the   amino acid n terminal region of dp contains a plakin domain common to members of the plakin family plakin domains contain multiple copies of spectrin repeats srs  we determined the crystal structure of a fragment of dp residues      consisting of four srs and an inserted sh domain the four repeats form an elongated rigid structure the sh domain is present in a loop between two helices of an sr and interacts extensively with the preceding sr in a manner that appears to limit inter repeat flexibility the intimate intramolecular association of the sh domain with the preceding sr is also observed in plectin another plakin protein but not in  spectrin suggesting that the sh domain of plakins contributes to the stability and rigidity of this subfamily of sr containing proteins
