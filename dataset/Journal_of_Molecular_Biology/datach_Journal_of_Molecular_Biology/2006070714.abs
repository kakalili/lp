sticky dna in vivo formation in e coli and in vitro association of long gaa  ttc tracts to generate two independent supercoiled domains
the expanded gaa  ttc repeat sequence associated with friedreich  s ataxia frda adopts non b dna structures  triplexes and sticky dna  sticky dna is formed in plasmids by the association of two long gaa  ttc tracts at lengths that are found in the sequence of the frataxin gene in patients most frda patients have expanded gaa  ttc repeats up to   triplets  which inhibit the transcription of the gene thus diminishing the synthesis of frataxin a mitochondrial protein involved in iron sulfur cluster biogenesis negative supercoiling and mgcl  or mncl  are required to stabilize sticky dna a dumbbell shaped structure in plasmids with a pair of repeat tracts where n   in the direct repeat orientation in vitro since the triplet repeat sequences trs were symmetrically positioned in the plasmids and because a number of unique restriction sites were present in the vector studies were conducted to evaluate the influence of selectively linearizing one or the other supercoiled domains created by the dna  dna associated region i e the stable complex at the pair of trs  s the two domains behave independently thus confirming the association of the two tracts and the dumbbell shaped plasmid in our model for sticky dna linking number investigations were performed on a family of plasmids harboring different lengths     or   repeats  orientations and number of tracts one or two of a gaa  ttc repeat in escherichia coli to evaluate the in vivo role if any of sticky dna unexpectedly this non b dna conformation elicited the formation of a trs length dependent change in the global topology of the plasmids indicative of an apparent compression of the primary helices thus linking number determinations confirm that sticky dna has an important consequence in vivo
