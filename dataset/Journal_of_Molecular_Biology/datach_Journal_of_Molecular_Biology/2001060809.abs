the b  binding subunit of glutamate mutase from clostridium tetanomorphum traps the nucleotide moiety of coenzyme b
glutamate mutase from clostridium tetanomorphum binds coenzyme b  in a base off his on form in which the nitrogenous ligand of the b  nucleotide function is displaced from cobalt by a conserved histidine the effect of binding the b  nucleotide moiety to muts the b  binding subunit of glutamate mutase was investigated using nmr spectroscopic methods binding of the b  nucleotide to muts was determined to occur with kd      mm and to be accompanied by a specific conformational change in the protein the nucleotide binding cleft of the apo protein which is formed by a dynamic segment with propensity for partial  helical conformation the  nascent    helix  becomes completely structured upon binding of the b  nucleotide with formation of helix   in contrast the segment containing the conserved residues of the b  binding asp x his x x gly motif remains highly dynamic in the protein b  nucleotide complex from relaxation studies the time constant   which characterizes the time scale for the formation of helix   was estimated to be about   s  n and was the same in both apo protein and nucleotide bound protein thus the binding of the b  nucleotide moiety does not significantly alter the kinetics of helix formation but only shifts the equilibrium towards the structured fold these results indicate muts to be structured in such a way as to be able to trap the nucleotide segment of the base off form of coenzyme b  and provide accordingly the first structural clues as to how the process of b  binding occurs
