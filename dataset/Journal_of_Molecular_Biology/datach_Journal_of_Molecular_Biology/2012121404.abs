lipid molecules induce p   activation via a novel molecular switch
p   mitogen activated protein kinase mapk is generally activated by dual phosphorylation but has also been shown to exhibit alternative activation modes one of these modes included a direct interaction with phosphatidylinositol ether lipid analogues pia inducing p   autoactivation and apoptosis perifosine an akt inhibitor in phase ii clinical trials also showed p   activation properties similarly to those of pias the crystal structures of p   in complex with pia  pia  and perifosine provide insights into this unique activation mode the activating molecules bind a unique hydrophobic binding site in the kinase c  lobe formed in part by the mapk insert region in addition there are conformational changes in the short  ef  f loop region that acts as an activation switch inducing autophosphorylation structural and biochemical characterization of the  ef  f loop identified trp  as a key residue in the lipid binding and in p   catalytic activity the lipid binding site also accommodates hydrophobic inhibitor molecules and thus can serve as a novel p   target for specific activation or inhibition with novel therapeutic implications
