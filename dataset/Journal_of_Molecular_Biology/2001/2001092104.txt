The nitrite reductase (NIR) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NIR-Pa) is a soluble enzyme catalysing the reduction of nitrite (NO2−) to nitric oxide (NO). The enzyme is a 120kDa homodimer, in which the monomers carry a c-heme domain and a d1-heme domain. The structures of the enzyme in both the oxidised and reduced state were solved previously and indicate His327 and His369 as putative catalytic residues. The kinetic characterisation of site-directed mutants has shown that the substitution of either one of these two His with Ala dramatically reduces the physiologically relevant reactivity towards nitrite, leaving the reactivity towards oxygen unaffected.The three-dimensional structures of P.aeruginosa NIR mutant H327A, and H369A in complex with NO have been solved by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), using the iron anomalous signal, and molecular replacement techniques. In both refined crystal structures the c-heme domain, whilst preserving its classical c-type cytochrome fold, has undergone a 60° rigid-body rotation around an axis parallel with the pseudo 8-fold axis of the β-propeller, and passing through residue Gln115. Even though the distance between the Fe ions of the c and d1-heme remains 21Å, the edge-to-edge distance between the two hemes has increased by 5Å. Furthermore the distal side of the d1-heme pocket appears to have undergone structural re-arrangement and Tyr10 has moved out of the active site. In the H369A-NO complex, the position and orientation of NO is significantly different from that of the NO bound to the reduced wild-type structure.Our results provide insight into the flexibility of the enzyme and the distinction between nitrite and oxidase reduction mechanisms. Moreover they demonstrate that the two histidine residues play a crucial role in the physiological activity of nitrite reduction, ligand binding and in the structural organisation of nitrite reductase from P.aeruginosa.
