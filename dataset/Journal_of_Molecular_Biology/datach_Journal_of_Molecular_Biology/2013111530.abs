activation of clpp protease by adep antibiotics insights from hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry
the bacterial protease clpp consists of  subunits that assemble into two stacked heptameric rings the central degradation chamber can be accessed via axial pores in free clpp these pores are obstructed by the n terminal regions of the seven subunits at either end of the barrel acyldepsipeptides adeps are antibacterial compounds that bind in hydrophobic clefts surrounding the pore region causing the pores to open up the ensuing uncontrolled degradation of intracellular proteins is responsible for the antibiotic activity of adeps recently published x ray structures yielded conflicting models regarding the conformation adopted by the n terminal regions in the open state here we use hydrogen deuterium exchange hdx mass spectrometry to obtain complementary insights into the clpp behavior with and without adep  ligand binding causes rigidification of the equatorial belt accompanied by destabilization in the vicinity of the binding clefts the n terminal regions undergo rapid deuteration with only minor changes after adep binding revealing a lack of stable h bonding our data point to a mechanism where the pore opening mechanism is mediated primarily by changes in the packing of n terminal nonpolar side chains we propose that a  hydrophobic plug  causes pore blockage in ligand free clpp adep binding provides new hydrophobic anchor points that nonpolar n terminal residues can interact with in this way adep triggers the transition to an open conformation where nonpolar moieties are clustered around the rim of the pore this proposed mechanism helps reconcile the conflicting models that had been put forward earlier
