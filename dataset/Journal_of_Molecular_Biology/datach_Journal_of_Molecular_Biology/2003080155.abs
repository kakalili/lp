protein  protein docking with simultaneous optimization of rigid body displacement and side chain conformations
protein  protein docking algorithms provide a means to elucidate structural details for presently unknown complexes here we present and evaluate a new method to predict protein  protein complexes from the coordinates of the unbound monomer components the method employs a low resolution rigid body monte carlo search followed by simultaneous optimization of backbone displacement and side chain conformations using monte carlo minimization up to   independent simulations are carried out and the resulting  decoys  are ranked using an energy function dominated by van der waals interactions an implicit solvation model and an orientation dependent hydrogen bonding potential top ranking decoys are clustered to select the final predictions small perturbation studies reveal the formation of binding funnels in  of  cases using coordinates derived from the bound complexes and in  of  cases using independently determined coordinates of one or both monomers experimental binding affinities correlate with the calculated score function and explain the predictive success or failure of many targets global searches using one or both unbound components predict at least   of the native residue  residue contacts in  of the  cases where binding funnels exist the results suggest that the method may soon be useful for generating models of biologically important complexes from the structures of the isolated components but they also highlight the challenges that must be met to achieve consistent and accurate prediction of protein  protein interactions
