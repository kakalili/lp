host factor titration by chromosomal r loops as a mechanism for runaway plasmid replication in transcription termination defective mutants of escherichia coli
two escherichia coli genes rnha and recg encode products that disrupt r loops by hydrolysis and unwinding respectively it is known that the propensity for r loop formation in vivo is increased during growth at   c we have identified several links between rnha recg and r loop dependent plasmid replication on the one hand and genes rho and nusg involved in factor dependent transcription termination on the other a novel nusg g  d mutation phenocopied a rho a  e mutation in conferring global deficiency in transcription termination and both mutants were killed at   c following overexpression of rnha  mutant combinations rnha nusg or recg rho were synthetically lethal at   c with the former being suppressed by recg overexpression rho and nusg mutants were killed following transformation with plasmids such as pacyc  or puc  which have r loop replication intermediates even at   c or   c and the lethality was correlated with greatly increased content of supercoiled monomer species of these and other co resident r loop dependent plasmids plasmid mediated lethality in the mutants was suppressed by overexpression of rnha or recg  two additional categories of trans acting suppressors of the plasmid mediated lethality were identified whose primary effects were respectively a reduction in plasmid copy number even in the wild type strain and a restoration of the proficiency of in vivo transcription termination in the nusg and rho mutant strains the former category of suppressors included rom  and mutations in rpob q  l  pcnb and pola whereas the latter included a mutation in rho r  c and several non null mutations e k l p and      in the gene encoding the nucleoid protein h ns we propose that an increased occurrence of chromosomal r loops in the rho and nusg mutants leads to titration of a cyloplasmic host factor s that negatively modulates the stability of plasmid r loop replication intermediates and consequently to runaway plasmid replication
