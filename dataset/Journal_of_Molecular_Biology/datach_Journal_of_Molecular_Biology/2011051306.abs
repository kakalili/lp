structural basis for the allosteric regulation and substrate recognition of human cytosolic   nucleotidase ii
cytosolic   nucleotidase ii cn ii catalyzes the dephosphorylation of  hydroxypurine nucleoside   monophosphates and participates in the regulation of purine nucleotide pools within the cell it interferes with the phosphorylation dependent activation of nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of cancer and viral diseases it is allosterically activated by a number of phosphate containing cellular metabolites such as atp diadenosine polyphosphates and   bisphosphoglycerate which couple its activity with the metabolic state of the cell we present seven high resolution structures of human cn ii including a ligand free form and complexes with various substrates and effectors these structures reveal the structural basis for the allosteric activation of cn ii uncovering a mechanism where an effector induced disorder to order transition generates rearrangements within the catalytic site and the subsequent coordination of the catalytically essential magnesium central to the activation is the large transition of the catalytically essential asp   this study also provides the structural basis for the substrate specificity of cn ii where arg   asp   and phe  seem to be important residues for purine pyrimidine selectivity these structures provide a comprehensive structural basis for the design of cn ii inhibitors they also contribute to the understanding of how the nucleotide salvage pathway is regulated at a molecular level
