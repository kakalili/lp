edge interactions in a pentadecameric human antibody v  domain
antibodies are the archetypal molecules of the ig fold superfamily their highly conserved  sheet architecture has evolved to avoid aggregation by protecting edge strands however the crystal structure of a human v  domain described here reveals an exposed  edge strand which mediates assembly of a helical pentadecameric oligomer this edge strand is highly conserved in v  domains but is both shortened and capped by the use of two sequential trans proline residues in v  domains we suggest that the exposure of this  edge in v  domains may explain why light chain deposition disease is mediated predominantly by  antibodies
