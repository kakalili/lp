structural rearrangements linked to global folding pathways of the azoarcus group i ribozyme
stable rnas must fold into specific three dimensional structures to be biologically active yet many rnas form metastable structures that compete with the native state our previous time resolved footprinting experiments showed that azoarcus group i ribozyme forms its tertiary structure rapidly   lt   ms without becoming significantly trapped in kinetic intermediates here we use stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy to probe the global folding kinetics of a ribozyme containing  aminopurine in the loop of p  the modified ribozyme was catalytically active and exhibited two equilibrium folding transitions centered at   and   mm mg  consistent with previous results stopped flow fluorescence revealed four kinetic folding transitions with observed rate constants of       and   s   at    c from comparison with time resolved fe ii ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid footprinting of the modified ribozyme under the same conditions these folding transitions were assigned to formation of the ic intermediate tertiary folding and docking of the nicked p tetraloop reorganization of the p pseudoknot and refolding of nonnative conformers respectively the footprinting results show that     of the modified ribozyme folds in less than   ms while the rest of the rna population undergoes slow structural rearrangements that control the global folding rate the results show how small perturbations to the structure of the rna such as a nick in p  populate kinetic folding intermediates that are not observed in the natural ribozyme
