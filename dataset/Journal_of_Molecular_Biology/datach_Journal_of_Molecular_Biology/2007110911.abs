adomet dependent methyl transfer glu  is essential for dna c cytosine methyltransferase m hhai
the role of glu  in s adenosyl l methionine dependent dna methyltransferase m hhai catalyzed dna methylation was studied glu  belongs to the highly conserved glu asn val motif found in all dna c cytosine methyltransferases and its importance for m hhai function remains untested we show that formation of the covalent intermediate between cys  and the target cytosine requires glu   since conversion to ala asp or gln lowers the rate of methyl transfer      fold further unlike the wild type m hhai these mutants are not trapped by the substrate in which the target cytosine is replaced with the mechanism based inhibitor  fluorocytosine the dna binding affinity for the glu  asp mutant is decreased   fold thus the ability of the enzyme to stabilize the extrahelical cytosine is coupled directly to tight dna binding the structures of the ternary protein dna adohcy complexes for both the glu  ala and glu  gln mutants      and      respectively show that the flipped base is positioned nearly identically with that observed in the wild type m hhai complex a single water molecule in the glu  ala structure between ala  and the extrahelical cytosine n is lacking in the glu  gln and wild type m hhai structures and most likely accounts for this mutant s partial activity glu  has essential roles in activating the target cytosine for nucleophilic attack and contributes to tight dna binding
