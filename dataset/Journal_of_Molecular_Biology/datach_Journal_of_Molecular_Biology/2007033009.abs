visualization of functional rotor proteins of the bacterial flagellar motor in the cell membrane
the bacterial flagellar motor is a rotary motor driven by the electrochemical potentials of specific ions across the cell membrane direct interactions between the rotor protein flig and the stator protein mota are thought to generate the rotational torque here we used total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy to observe the localization of green fluorescent protein gfp fused flig in escherichia coli cells we identified three types of fluorescent punctate signals immobile dots mobile dots that exhibited simple diffusion and mobile dots that exhibited restricted diffusion when gfp  flig was expressed in a  flig background most of the cells were not mobile when the cells were tethered to a glass side however rotating cells were commonly observed and a single fluorescent dot was always observed at the rotational center of the tethered cell these fluorescent dots were likely positions at which functional gfp  flig had been incorporated into a flagellar motor our results suggest that flagellar basal bodies diffuse in the cytoplasmic membrane until the axial structure and or other structures assemble
