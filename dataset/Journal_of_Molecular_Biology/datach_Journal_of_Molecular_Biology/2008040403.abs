accurate genetic switch in escherichia coli novel mechanism of regulation by co repressor
understanding a biological module involves recognition of its structure and the dynamics of its principal components in this report we present an analysis of the dynamics of the repression module within the regulation of the trp operon in escherichia coli we combine biochemical data for reaction rate constants for the trp repressor binding to trp operator and in vivo data of a number of tryptophan repressors trprs that bind to the operator the model of repression presented in this report greatly differs from previous mathematical models one two or three trprs can bind to the operator and repress the transcription moreover reaction rates for detachment of trprs from the operator strongly depend on tryptophan trp concentration since trp can also bind to the repressor  operator complex and stabilize it from the mathematical modeling and analysis of reaction rates and equilibrium constants emerges a high quality accurate and effective module of trp repression this genetic switch responds accurately to fast consumption of trp from the interior of a cell it switches with minimal dispersion when the concentration of trp drops below a thousand molecules per cell
