relative domain folding and stability of a membrane transport protein
there is a limited understanding of the folding of multidomain membrane proteins lactose permease lacy of escherichia coli is an archetypal member of the major facilitator superfamily of membrane transport proteins which contain two domains of six transmembrane helices each we exploit chemical denaturation to determine the unfolding free energy of lacy and employ trp residues as site specific thermodynamic probes single trp lacy mutants are created with the individual trps situated at mirror image positions on the two lacy domains the changes in trp fluorescence induced by urea denaturation are used to construct denaturation curves from which unfolding free energies can be determined the majority of the single trp tracers report the same stability and an unfolding free energy of approximately  kcal mol   there is one exception the fluorescence of w  at the cytoplasmic end of helix i on the n domain is unaffected by urea in contrast the equivalent position on the first helix vii of the c terminal domain exhibits wild type stability with the single trp tracer at position   on helix vii reporting an unfolding free energy of  kcal mol   this indicates that the region of the n domain of lacy at position  on helix i has enhanced stability to urea when compared the corresponding location at the start of the c domain we also find evidence for a potential network of stabilising interactions across the domain interface which reduces accessibility to the hydrophilic substrate binding pocket between the two domains
