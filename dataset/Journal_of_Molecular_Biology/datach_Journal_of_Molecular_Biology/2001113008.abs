transcription attenuation associated with bacterial repetitive extragenic bime elements edited by i b holland
transcription attenuation comprises several processes that affect transcript elongation and transcription termination and has an important role in regulating gene expression in most cases transcription attenuation is used as a regulatory mechanism that allows the cell to adjust protein synthesis levels in response to a specific signal here by using a trna gene as a transcriptional reporter we characterize a new type of transcription attenuation mechanism in escherichia coli that involves bacterial interspersed mosaic elements bimes  the main family of repetitive extragenic elements the transcription termination factor rho is required for attenuation in association with bimes thus revealing a new role for rho as a bimes dependent global regulator of gene expression by mutational analyses we identified nucleotide determinants of bimes that are required for attenuation and showed that this process relies on a sequence specific mechanism our data are consistent with a model in which bimes provoke a pause in rna polymerase movement and rho acts ultimately to terminate transcription bime dependent transcription attenuation may be used as a means to differentially regulate expression of adjacent genes belonging to a single operon bimes are dispersed in more than   operons such that attenuation can simultaneously affect expression of a large number of genes encoding unrelated proteins this attenuation phenomenon together with the known ability of bimes to stabilize upstream mrna reveals how dispersion of these abundant repetitive elements may affect gene regulation at the genome level
