crystal structure of the homer  family conserved region reveals the interaction between the evh domain and own proline rich motif
psd zip  also named homer c vesl l is a synaptic scaffolding protein which interacts with neurotransmitter receptors and other scaffolding proteins to target them into post synaptic density psd  a specialized protein complex at the synaptic junction binding of the psd zip  to the receptors and scaffolding proteins results in colocalization and clustering of its binding partners in psd it has an ena vasp homology  evh  domain in the n terminus for receptor binding two leucine zipper motifs in the c terminus for clustering and a linking region whose function is unclear despite the high level of conservation within the homer  family the x ray crystallographic analysis of the largest fragment of residues     including an evh domain reported here demonstrates that the evh domain contains an  helix longer than that of the previous models and that the linking part included in the conserved region of homer  crh  of the psd zip  interacts with the evh domain of the neighbour crh molecule in the crystal the results suggest that the evh domain recognizes the ppxxf motif found in the binding partners and the spltp sequence p motif in the linking region of the crh  the two types of binding are partly overlapped in the evh domain implying a mechanism to regulate multimerization of homer  family proteins
