design and evolution of artificial m  coat proteins edited by g von heijne
using simple design and selective pressure we have evolved an artificial m  bacteriophage coat protein m  coat proteins first reside in the bacterial inner membrane and subsequently surround the dna core of the assembled virus the artificial coat protein acp was designed and evolved to mimic both functions of the natural m  coat proteins but with an inverted orientation acp is a non functional coat protein because it is not required for the production of phage particles instead it incorporates into a phage coat which still requires all the natural coat proteins for structural integrity in contrast with other m  coat proteins which can display polypeptides as amino terminal fusions acp permits the carboxy terminal display of large polypeptides the results suggest that viruses can co opt host membrane proteins to acquire new coat proteins and thus new functions in particular m  bacteriophage can be engineered for new functions such as carboxy terminal phage display
