clustering of protein structural fragments reveals modular building block approach of nature
structures of peptide fragments drawn from a protein can potentially occupy a vast conformational continuum we co ordinatize this conformational space with the help of geometric invariants and demonstrate that the peptide conformations of the currently available protein structures are heavily biased in favor of a finite number of conformational types or structural building blocks this is achieved by representing a peptides backbone structure with geometric invariants and then clustering peptides based on closeness of the geometric invariants this results in    clusters of which   are made up of peptides drawn from functionally and or structurally related proteins these are termed  functional  clusters and provide clues about potential functional sites the rest of the clusters including the largest few are made up of peptides drawn from unrelated proteins and are termed  structural  clusters the largest clusters are of regular secondary structures such as helices and beta strands as well as of beta hairpins several categories of helices and strands are discovered based on geometric differences in addition to the known classes of loops we discover several new classes which will be useful in protein structure modeling our algorithm does not require assignment of secondary structure and therefore overcomes the limitations in loop classification due to ambiguity in secondary structure assignment at loop boundaries
