a second symmetry mismatch at the portal vertex of bacteriophage t   fold symmetry in the procapsid core
like other bacteriophages t has a singular vertex that is the site of a symmetry mismatch involving the portal connector protein a  fold ring at the vertex site which is also a  fold axis for the icosahedral capsid in the mature virion a  fold symmetric tail extends outwards from the connector t also has a cylindrical  core  that assembles on the inner surface of the connector during procapsid formation is retained in the mature virion and is required for infectivity we have investigated the core structure by cryo electron microscopy and image analysis of procapsids and find that it observes  fold symmetry stoichiometry data indicate that its major constituent is an octamer of gp
