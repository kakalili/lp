interaction with capsid protein alters rna structure and the pathway for in vitro assembly of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus
viruses use sophisticated mechanisms to allow the specific packaging of their genome over that of host nucleic acids we examined the in vitro assembly of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus ccmv and observed that assembly with viral rna follows two different mechanisms initially ccmv capsid protein cp dimers bind rna with low cooperativity and form virus like particles of  cp dimers and one copy of rna longer incubation reveals a different assembly path at a stoichiometry of about ten cp dimers per rna the cp slowly folds the rna into a compact structure that can be bound with high cooperativity by additional cp dimers this folding process is exclusively a function of cp quaternary structure and is independent of rna sequence cp induced folding is distinct from rna folding that depends on base pairing to stabilize tertiary structure we hypothesize that specific encapsidation of viral rna is a three step process specific binding by a few copies of cp rna folding and then cooperative binding of cp to the  labeled  nucleoprotein complex this mechanism observed in a plant virus may be applicable to other viruses that do not halt synthesis of host nucleic acid including hiv
