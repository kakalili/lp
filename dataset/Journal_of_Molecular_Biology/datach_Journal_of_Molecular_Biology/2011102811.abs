the mechanical role of vasp in an arp  complex based motility assay
the comet motility assay inspired by listeria locomotion has been used extensively as an in vitro model to study the structural and motile properties of the actin cytoskeleton however there are no quantitative measurements of the mechanical properties of these actin comets in this work we use nanoindentation based on atomic force microscopy to measure the elastic modulus of actin comets grown on    m diameter beads in an arp   actin related proteins  and  complex dependent fashion in the absence and in the presence of vasp vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein  recruitment of vasp to the bead surface had no effect on the initial velocity or morphology of the comets instead we observed an improved contact of the comets with the beads and an increased elastic modulus of the comets the vasp mediated increase in elastic modulus was dependent on both concentration and ionic strength in conclusion we propose that vasp plays a mechanical role in arp  complex dependent motility by amplifying the elastic modulus of the thus assembled actin network and consequently by strengthening its cohesion for persistent protrusion
