molecular interplay between rna polymerase and two transcriptional regulators in promoter switch
transcription regulation relies in the molecular interplay between the rna polymerase rnap and regulatory factors phage   promoters a c a b and a are coordinately regulated by the transcriptional regulator protein p and the histone like protein p  this study shows that protein p binds simultaneously to four sites sites  and  located between promoters a c and a b and sites  and  between promoters a b and a  placed in such a way that bound p is equidistant from promoters a c and a b and one helix turn further upstream from promoter a  the p molecules bound to sites  and  reorganise the binding of protein p  giving rise to the nucleoprotein complex responsible for the switch from early to late transcription we identify the positioning of the  ctd rnap domain at these promoters and demonstrate that the domains are crucial for promoter a b recognition and required for full activity of promoter a c since binding of rnap overlaps with p and p binding repression of the early transcription relies on the synergy of the regulators able to antagonize the stable binding of the rnap through competition for the same target while activation of late transcription is carried out through the stabilization of the rnap by the p p nucleoprotein complex the control of promoters a c and a b by feed back regulation is discussed
