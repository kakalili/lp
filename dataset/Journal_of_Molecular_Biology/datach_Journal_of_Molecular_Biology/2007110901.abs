molecular dynamic simulations of cisplatin and oxaliplatin d gg intrastand cross links reveal differences in their conformational dynamics
mismatch repair proteins dna damage recognition proteins and translesion dna polymerases discriminate between pt gg adducts containing cis diammine ligands formed by cisplatin cp and carboplatin and trans rr diaminocyclohexane ligands formed by oxaliplatin ox  and this discrimination is thought to be important in determining differences in the efficacy toxicity and mutagenicity of these platinum anticancer agents we have postulated that these proteins recognize differences in conformation and or conformational dynamics of the dna containing the adducts we have previously determined the nmr solution structure of ox dna cp dna and undamaged duplex dna in the   d cctcaggcctcc    sequence context and have shown the existence of several conformational differences in the vicinity of the pt gg adduct here we have used molecular dynamics simulations to explore differences in the conformational dynamics between ox dna cp dna and undamaged dna in the same sequence context twenty five   ns unrestrained fully solvated molecular dynamics simulations were performed starting from two different dna conformations using amber v   all  simulations reached equilibrium within  ns were independent of the starting structure and were in close agreement with previous crystal and nmr structures our data show that the cis diammine cp ligand preferentially forms hydrogen bonds on the   side of the pt gg adduct while the trans rr diaminocyclohexane ox ligand preferentially forms hydrogen bonds on the   side of the adduct in addition our data show that these differences in hydrogen bond formation are strongly correlated with differences in conformational dynamics specifically the fraction of time spent in different dna conformations in the vicinity of the adduct for cp and ox dna adducts we postulate that differential recognition of cp and ox gg adducts by mismatch repair proteins dna damage recognition proteins and dna polymerases may be due in part to differences in the fraction of time that the adducts spend in a conformation favorable for protein binding
