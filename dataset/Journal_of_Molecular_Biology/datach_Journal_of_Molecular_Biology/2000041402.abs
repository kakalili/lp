the  s rrna environment of ribosomal protein l in the  s ribosomal subunit edited by d e draper
ribosomal protein l consists of two globular    domains separated by a nine turn  helix we examined the rrna environment of l by chemical footprinting and directed hydroxyl radical probing we reconstituted l  or individual domains of l  with l deficient  s subunits or with deproteinized  s rrna a footprint was identified in domain v of  s rrna that was mainly attributable to n domain binding fe ii was tethered to l via cysteine residues introduced at positions along the  helix and in the c domain and derivatized proteins were reconstituted with l deficient subunits directed hydroxyl radical probing targeted regions of domains i iii iv and v of  s rrna reinforcing the view that  s subunit architecture is typified by interwoven rrna domains there was a striking correlation between the cleavage patterns from the fe ii probes attached to the  helix and their predicted orientations constraining both the position and orientation of l  as well as the arrangement of specific elements of  s rrna in the  s subunit
