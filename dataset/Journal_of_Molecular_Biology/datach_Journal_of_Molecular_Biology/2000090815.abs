the saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue ypa of the mammalian phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator of protein phosphatase a controls progression through the g phase of the yeast cell cycle edited by j karn
the saccharomyces cerevisiae gene ypa encodes a protein homologous to the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator ptpa of the mammalian protein phosphatase type a pp a  in order to examine the biological role of ptpa we disrupted ypa and characterised the phenotype of the ypa  mutant comparison of the growth rate of the wild type strain and the ypa  mutant on glucose rich medium after nutrient depletion showed that the ypa  mutant traversed the lag period more rapidly this accelerated progression through  start  was also observed after release from  factor induced g arrest as evidenced by a higher number of budding cells a faster increase in cln mrna expression and a more rapid reactivation of cdc  kinase activity this phenotype was specific for deletion of ypa since it was not observed when ypa  the second ptpa gene in budding yeast was deleted reintroduction of ypa or the human ptpa cdna in the ypa  mutant suppressed this phenotype as opposed to overexpression of ypa  disruption of both ypa genes is lethal since sporulation of heterozygous diploids resulted in at most three viable spores none of them with a ypa  ypa  genotype this observation indicates that ypa and ypa share some essential functions we compared the ypa  mutant phenotype with a pp a double deletion mutant and a pp a temperature sensitive mutant the pp a deficient yeast strain also showed accelerated progression through the g phase in addition both pp a and ypa  mutants show similar aberrant bud morphology this would support the notion that ypa may act as a positive regulator of pp a in vivo
