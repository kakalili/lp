heterogeneity of z band structure within a single muscle sarcomere implications for sarcomere assembly
the vertebrate striated muscle z band connects actin filaments of opposite polarity from adjacent sarcomeres and allows tension to be transmitted along a myofibril during contraction z bands in different muscles have a modular structure formed by layers of  actinin molecules cross linking actin filaments successive layers occur at  nm intervals and have   rotations between them  d reconstruction from electron micrographs show a two layer  simple  z band in fish body fast muscle a three layer z band in fish fin fast muscle and a six layer z band in mammalian slow muscle related to the number of these layers longitudinal sections of the z band show a number of zigzag connections between the oppositely oriented actin filaments the number of layers also determines the axial width of the z band which is a useful indicator of fibre type fast fibres have narrow       nm z bands slow and cardiac fibres have wide        nm z bands here we report the first observation of two different z band widths within a single sarcomere by comparison with previous studies the narrower z band comprises three layers since the increase in width of the wider z band is about  nm we conclude that it comprises four layers this finding is consistent with a z band assembly model involving molecular control mechanisms that can add additional layers of  nm periodicity these multiple z band structures suggest that different isoforms of nebulin and titin with a variable number of z repeats could be present within a single sarcomere
