inhibition of human  thrombin by a phosphonate tripeptide proceeds via a metastable pentacoordinated phosphorus intermediate  edited by r huber
x ray crystallographic studies of human  thrombin with a novel synthetic inhibitor an acyl   aminoalkyl phosphonate reveal the existence of a pentacovalent phosphorus intermediate state crystal structures of the complex of  thrombin with the phosphonate compound were determined independently using crystals of different ages the first structure solved from a crystal less than seven days old showed a pentacoordinated phosphorus moiety the second structure determined from a crystal that was  weeks old showed a tetracoordinated phosphorus moiety in the first structure a water molecule made nucleophilic by coordination to his  of  thrombin is bonded to the pentacoordinated phosphorus atom its position is approximately equivalent to that occupied by the water molecule responsible for hydrolytic deacylation during normal hydrolysis the pentacoordinated phosphorus adduct collapses to give the expected pseudo tetrahedral complex where the phosphorus atom is covalently bonded to ser  o  the crystallographic data presented here therefore suggest that the covalent bond formed between the inhibitor  s phosphorus atom and o  of ser  proceeds via an addition elimination mechanism which involves the formation of a pentacoordinate intermediate
