detection of intermediates and kinetic control during assembly of bacteriophage p  procapsid
bacteriophage p  serves as a model for the assembly and maturation of other icosahedral double stranded dna viruses p  coat and scaffolding proteins assemble in vitro into an icosahedral procapsid which then expands during dna packaging maturation  efficient in vitro assembly makes this system suitable for design and production of monodisperse spherical nanoparticles diameter    nm  in this work we explore the possibility of controlling the outcome of assembly by scaffolding protein engineering the scaffolding protein exists in monomer  dimer  tetramer equilibrium we address the role of monomers and dimers in assembly by using three different scaffolding proteins with altered monomer  dimer equilibrium weak dimer covalent dimer monomer  the progress and outcome of assembly was monitored by time resolved x ray scattering which allowed us to distinguish between closed shells and incomplete assembly intermediates binding of scaffolding monomer activates the coat protein for assembly excess dimeric scaffolding protein resulted in rapid nucleation and kinetic trapping yielding incomplete shells addition of monomeric wild type scaffold with excess coat protein completed these metastable shells thus the monomeric scaffolding protein plays an essential role in the elongation phase by activating the coat and effectively lowering its critical concentration for assembly
