structural characterization of the rnase e s domain and identification of its oligonucleotide binding and dimerization interfaces
s domains occur in four of the major enzymes of mrna decay in escherichia coli rnase e pnpase rnase ii and rnase g here we report the structure of the s domain of rnase e determined by both x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy the rnase e s domain adopts an ob fold very similar to that found with pnpase and the major cold shock proteins in which flexible loops are appended to a well ordered five stranded  barrel core within the crystal lattice the protein forms a dimer stabilized primarily by intermolecular hydrophobic packing consistent with this observation light scattering chemical crosslinking and nmr spectroscopic measurements confirm that the isolated rnase e s domain undergoes a specific monomer  dimer equilibrium in solution with a kd value in the millimolar range the substitution of glycine  with serine dramatically destabilizes the folded structure of this domain thereby providing an explanation for the temperature sensitive phenotype associated with this mutation in full length rnase e based on amide chemical shift perturbation mapping the binding surface for a single stranded dna dodecamer kd      m was identified as a groove of positive electrostatic potential containing several exposed aromatic side chains this surface which corresponds to the conserved ligand binding cleft found in numerous ob fold proteins lies distal to the dimerization interface such that two independent oligonucleotide binding sites can exist in the dimeric form of the rnase e s domain based on these data we propose that the s domain serves a dual role of dimerization to aid in the formation of the tetrameric quaternary structure of rnase e as described by callaghan et al in   and of substrate binding to facilitate rna hydrolysis by the adjacent catalytic domains within this multimeric enzyme
