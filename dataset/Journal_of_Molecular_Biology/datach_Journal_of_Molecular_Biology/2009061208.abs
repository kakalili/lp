desolvation barrier effects are a likely contributor to the remarkable diversity in the folding rates of small proteins
the variation in folding rate among single domain natural proteins is tremendous but common models with explicit representations of the protein chain are either demonstrably insufficient or unclear as to their capability for rationalizing the experimental diversity in folding rates in view of the critical role of water exclusion in cooperative folding we apply native centric coarse grained chain modeling with elementary desolvation barriers to investigate solvation effects on folding rates for a set of  proteins folding rates simulated with desolvation barriers cover    orders of magnitude spanning a range essentially identical to that observed experimentally in contrast folding rates simulated without desolvation barriers cover only    orders of magnitude following a hammond like trend the folding transition state ensemble tse of a protein model with desolvation barriers generally has a higher average number of native contacts and is structurally more specific that is less diffused than the tse of the corresponding model without desolvation barriers folding is generally significantly slower in models with desolvation barriers because of their higher overall macroscopic folding barriers as well as slower conformational diffusion speeds in the tse that are     times those in models without desolvation barriers nonetheless the average root mean square deviation between the tse and the native conformation is often similar in the two modeling approaches a finding suggestive of a more robust structural requirement for the folding rate limiting step the increased folding rate diversity in models with desolvation barriers originates from the tendency of these microscopic barriers to cause more heightening of the overall macroscopic folding free energy barriers for proteins with more nonlocal native contacts than those with fewer such contacts thus the enhancement of folding cooperativity by solvation effects is seen as positively correlated with a protein s native topological complexity
