the palm subdomain based active site is internally permuted in viral rna dependent rna polymerases of an ancient lineage
template dependent polynucleotide synthesis is catalyzed by enzymes whose core component includes a ubiquitous   palm subdomain comprising a b and c sequence motifs crucial for catalysis due to its unique universal conservation in all rna viruses the palm subdomain of rna dependent rna polymerases rdrps is widely used for evolutionary and taxonomic inferences we report here the results of elaborated computer assisted analysis of newly sequenced replicases from thosea asigna virus tav and the closely related euprosterna elaeasa virus eev  insect specific ssrna viruses which revise a capsid based classification of these viruses with tetraviruses an alphavirus like family the replicases of tav and eev do not have characteristic methyltransferase and helicase domains and include a putative rdrp with a unique c  a  b motif arrangement in the palm subdomain that is also found in two dsrna birnaviruses this circular motif rearrangement is a result of migration of    amino acid aa residues encompassing motif c between two internal positions separated by    aa in a conserved region of    aa protein modeling shows that the canonical palm subdomain architecture of poliovirus ssrna  rdrp could accommodate the identified sequence permutation through changes in backbone connectivity of the major structural elements in three loop regions underlying the active site this permutation transforms the ferredoxin like   a    b  fold of the palm subdomain into the      a b  structure and brings  strands carrying two principal catalytic asp residues into sequential proximity such that unique structural properties and ultimately unique functionality of the permuted rdrps may result the permuted enzymes show unprecedented interclass sequence conservation between rdrps of true ssrna and dsrna viruses and form a minor deeply separated cluster in the rdrp tree implying that other as yet unidentified viruses may employ this type of rdrp the structural diversification of the palm subdomain might be a major event in the evolution of template dependent polynucleotide polymerases in the rna  protein world
