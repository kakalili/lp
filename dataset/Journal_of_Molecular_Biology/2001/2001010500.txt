RecA protein is essential for homologous recombination and the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in Escherichia coli. The protein binds DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments that promote joint molecule formation and strand exchange in vitro. RecA polymerises on ssDNA in the 5′-3′ direction and catalyses strand exchange and branch migration with a 5′-3′ polarity. It has been reported previously, using D-loop assays, in which ssDNA (containing a heterologous block at one end) invades supercoiled duplex DNA that 3′-homologous ends are reactive, whereas 5′-ends are inactive. This polarity bias was thought to be due to the polarity of RecA filament formation, which results in the 3′-ends being coated in RecA, whereas 5′-ends remain naked. Using a range of duplex substrates containing ssDNA tails of various lengths and polarities, we now demonstrate that when no heterologous block is imposed, 5′-ends are just as reactive as 3′-ends. Moreover, using short-tailed substrates, we find that 5′-ends form more stable D-loops than 3′-ends. This bias may be a consequence of the instability of short 3′-joints. With more physiological substrates containing long ssDNA tails, we find that RecA shows no intrinsic preference for 5′ or 3′-ends and that both form D-loop complexes with high efficiency.
