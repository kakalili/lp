Surfaces of many binding domains are plastic, enabling them to interact with multiple targets. An understanding of how they bind and recognize their partners is therefore predicated on characterizing such dynamic interfaces. Yet, these interfaces are difficult to study by standard biophysical techniques that often ‘freeze’ out conformations or that produce data averaged over an ensemble of conformers. In this study, we used NMR spectroscopy to study the interaction between the C-terminal SH3 domain of CIN85 and ubiquitin that involves the ‘classical’ binding sites of these proteins. Notably, chemical shift titration data of one target with another and relaxation dispersion data that report on millisecond time scale exchange processes are both well fit to a simple binding model in which free protein is in equilibrium with a single bound conformation. However, dissociation constants and chemical shift differences between free and bound states measured from both classes of experiment are in disagreement. It is shown that the data can be reconciled by considering three-state binding models involving two distinct bound conformations. By combining titration and dispersion data, kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the three-state binding reaction are obtained along with chemical shifts for each state. A picture emerges in which one bound conformer has increased entropy and enthalpy relative to the second and chemical shifts similar to that of the free state, suggesting a less packed interface. This study provides an example of the interplay between entropy and enthalpy to fine-tune molecular interactions involving the same binding surfaces.
