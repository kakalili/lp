peptide investigations of pairwise interactions in the collagen triple helix edited by c r matthews
pairwise interactions have been studied for the major secondary structures in proteins the present work extends the characterization of interactions between side chains to the context of a collagen triple helix in this study the most frequent gly x y tripeptide sequences in collagen are characterized in terms of interchain interactions between non imino acid x and y residues through the use of host guest peptides and statistical frequency analysis stabilities predicted on the basis of additivity show good agreement with experimental values for almost half of the peptides indicating a lack of interaction a small number of peptides have a stability lower than predicted while a larger number are more stable than expected of all triplets containing residues of opposite charge only gly lys asp and gly arg asp exhibit stabilizing electrostatic interactions and these pairs are found together preferentially in collagens repulsion of like charges is observed in gly arg lys gly lys arg and gly glu asp sequences and a small degree of hydrophobic stabilization was observed for the gly leu leu guest triplet the data reported here help clarify basic principles of triple helix stability in addition the experimentally determined stabilities of the tripeptide units found most frequently in collagens constitute a database useful for predicting triple helix stability in peptides collagens and other triple helix containing proteins
