sequence requirements for combinatorial recognition of histone h by the mrg  and pf subunits of the rpd s sin s corepressor complex
the transcriptional output at a genomic locus in eukaryotes is determined in part by the pattern of histone modifications that are read and interpreted by key effector proteins the histone deacetylase activity of the evolutionarily conserved rpd s sin s complex is crucial for suppressing aberrant transcription from cryptic start sites within intragenic regions of actively transcribed genes precise targeting of the complex relies on the chromatin binding activities of the mrg  mrg stands for mortality factor on chromosome  related gene and pf subunits whereas the molecular target of the mrg  chromodomain cd has been suggested to be h k me   the precise molecular target of the pf plant homeodomain  phd  has remained elusive here we show that pf phd binds preferentially to the unmodified extreme n terminus of histone h  h k me  but not to h k me   which are enriched in the promoter and   regions of genes unlike previously characterized cd and phd domains that bind to their targets with micromolar affinity both mrg  cd and pf phd bind to their targets with gt   m affinity offering an explanation for why both mrg  cd and pf phd domains are required to target the rpd s sin s complex to chromatin our results also suggest that bivalency rather than cooperativity is the operative mechanism by which pf and mrg  combine to engage h in a biologically significant manner finally the studies reveal an unanticipated role of pf phd in engaging the mrg  mrg domain albeit in a pf mrg binding  domain dependent manner implying a key role for the mrg  mrg  pf mbd interaction in chromatin targeting of the rpd s sin s complex
