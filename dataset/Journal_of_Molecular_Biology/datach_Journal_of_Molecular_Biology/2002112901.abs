binding free energy differences in a tcr  peptide mhc complex induced by a peptide mutation a simulation analysis
recognition by the t cell receptor tcr of immunogenic peptides presented by class i major histocompatibility complexes mhcs is the determining event in the specific cellular immune response against virus infected cells or tumor cells it is of great interest therefore to elucidate the molecular principles upon which the selectivity of a tcr is based these principles can in turn be used to design therapeutic approaches such as peptide based immunotherapies of cancer in this study free energy simulation methods are used to analyze the binding free energy difference of a particular tcr a  for a wild type peptide tax and a mutant peptide tax p a  both presented in hla a  the computed free energy difference is  kcal mol in good agreement with the experimental value this makes possible the use of the simulation results for obtaining an understanding of the origin of the free energy difference which was not available from the experimental results a free energy component analysis makes possible the decomposition of the free energy difference between the binding of the wild type and mutant peptide into its components of particular interest is the fact that better solvation of the mutant peptide when bound to the mhc molecule is an important contribution to the greater affinity of the tcr for the latter the results make possible identification of the residues of the tcr which are important for the selectivity this provides an understanding of the molecular principles that govern the recognition the possibility of using free energy simulations in designing peptide derivatives for cancer immunotherapy is briefly discussed
