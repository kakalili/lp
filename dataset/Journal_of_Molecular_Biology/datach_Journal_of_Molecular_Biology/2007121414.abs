distribution plasticity of the human estrogen receptor  in live cells distinct imaging of consecutively expressed receptors
an amino terminal fusion of the human estrogen receptor   er with human o alkylguanine dna alkyltransferase agt enabled the observation and distinction of consecutively expressed er populations by sequential pulse labeling of the agt tag with different fluorescent o alkylguanine derivatives in live cells the application of agonists and antagonists led to the characteristic speckled redistribution of fluorescent receptors in the nucleus as visualized by confocal microscopy to investigate where newly synthesized receptors were localized in individual cells with respect to their older relatives in response to extracellular chemical signals receptor expression was continued for  h and newly synthesized receptors were labeled with a new fluorophore spectrally distinct from the first probe this strategy enabled a time resolved analysis of the formation of er enriched protein complexes in distinct nucleoplasmic compartments such complexes represent important but hitherto uncharacterized macromolecular structures involved in er function different long lasting effects were observed depending on the type of ligand for example  h after pulsed application of the partial antagonist  hydroxytamoxifen the second receptor population exhibited a speckled pattern in the cell nucleus that overlapped with the first receptor population pattern this novel finding suggests that the intranuclear positioning of receptor aggregates is not random but influenced in a ligand dependent manner the antagonist ici               pentafluoropentylsulfinyl nonyl estra      triene     diol  a potent drug used in cancer treatment led to down regulation of the first receptor population and newly expressed receptors accumulated in the cytoplasm in contrast the natural agonist   estradiol resulted in significantly shorter effects four hours after ligand application newly expressed receptors were homogeneously distributed in the nucleus as in untreated control cells we present the pulse labeling of agt er fusion proteins with different fluorophores as a novel tool for investigating the functional regulation of nuclear receptors in individual cells
