solution structures of two fha phosphothreonine peptide complexes provide insight into the structural basis of the ligand specificity of fha from yeast rad  edited by m f summers
rad  a yeast checkpoint protein involved in regulating the repair of dna damage contains two forkhead associated domains fha and fha  previous combinatorial library screening has shown that fha strongly selects peptides containing a ptxxd motif subsequent location of this motif within the sequence of rad  the target protein coupled with spectroscopic analysis has led to identification of a tight binding sequence that is likely the binding site of fha   slev pt eadatfvq   we present solution structures of fha in complex with this pt peptide and with another rad derived pt peptide that has ca  fold lower affinity   kkmtfq pt ptdple   both complexes showed intermolecular noes predominantly between three peptide residues pt   and  residues and five fha residues s  r  s  t   and n   furthermore the following interactions were implicated on the basis of chemical shift perturbations and structural analysis the phosphate group of the pt residue with the side chain amide group of n  and the guanidino group of r  and the carboxylate group of asp at the  position with the guanidino group of r  the generated structures revealed a similar binding mode adopted by these two peptides suggesting that pt and the  residue asp are the major contributors to binding affinity and specificity while  and  residues could provide additional fine tuning it was also shown that fha does not bind to the corresponding ps peptides or a related py peptide we suggest that differentiation between pt and ps peptides by fha can be attributed to hydrophobic interactions between the methyl group of the pt residue and the aliphatic protons of r  s  and t  from fha
