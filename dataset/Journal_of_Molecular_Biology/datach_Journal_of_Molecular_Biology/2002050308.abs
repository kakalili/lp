the interaction of the molecular chaperone  crystallin with unfolding  lactalbumin a structural and kinetic spectroscopic study
the unfolding of the apo and holo forms of bovine  lactalbumin   la upon reduction by dithiothreitol dtt in the presence of the small heat shock protein  crystallin a molecular chaperone has been monitored by visible and uv absorption spectroscopy mass spectrometry and h nmr spectroscopy from these data a description and a time course of the events that result from the unfolding of both forms of the protein and the state of the protein that interacts with  crystallin have been obtained   la contains four disulphide bonds and binds a calcium ion in apo  la the disulphide bonds are reduced completely over a period of     seconds fully reduced  la adopts a partly folded molten globule conformation that aggregates and ultimately precipitates in the presence of an equivalent mass of  crystallin this precipitation can be prevented via complexation with the chaperone   crystallin does not interfere with the kinetics of the reduction of disulphide bonds in apo  la but does stabilise the molten globule state in holo  la the disulphide bonds are less accessible to dtt because of the stabilisation of the protein by the bound calcium ion and reduction occurs much more slowly a two disulphide intermediate aggregates and precipitates rapidly its precipitation can be prevented only in the presence of a  fold mass excess of  crystallin it is concluded that kinetic factors are important in determining the efficiency of the chaperone action of  crystallin it interacts efficiently with slowly aggregating highly disordered intermediate molten globule states of  la real time nmr spectroscopy shows that the kinetics of the refolding of apo  la following dilution from denaturant are not affected by the presence of  crystallin thus   crystallin is not a chaperone that is involved in protein folding per se rather its role is to stabilise compromised partly folded molten globule states of proteins that are destined for precipitation
