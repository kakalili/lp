a comprehensive model for the recognition of human telomeres by trf
eukaryotic chromosomes are capped by telomeres nucleoprotein complexes that prevent chromosome end to end fusions and control cell ageing two proteins in this complex telomere repeat binding factors trf and trf  specifically recognise the double stranded ttaggg tandem repeat sequence trf is a homodimer with roles governing dna architecture and negatively regulating telomere length we explore the conformational space of this protein  dna complex using molecular dynamics and for the first time generate a complete model of trf  dna recognition that has not been possible on the basis of crystallographic and nmr data alone the results reconcile previous conflicting experimental models for the sequence selectivity of the recognition process by confirming many of the findings while identifying important new interactions and behaviour this improved characterisation also reveals extensive indirect readout which suggests that recognition will be affected by changes to dna helical parameters such as bending
