the activity of the murine dna methyltransferase dnmt is controlled by interaction of the catalytic domain with the n terminal part of the enzyme leading to an allosteric activation of the enzyme after binding to methylated dna edited by j karn
the mammalian dna methyltransferase dnmt is responsible for the maintenance of the pattern of dna methylation in vivo it is a large multidomain enzyme comprising   amino acid residues we have purified and characterized individual domains of dnmt  nls containing domain nlsd amino acid residues     replication foci directing domain      zn binding domain znd      polybromo domain      and the catalytic domain catd        catd znd and nlsd bind to dna demonstrating the existence of three independent dna binding sites in dnmt  catd shows a preference for binding to hemimethylated cpg sites znd prefers methylated cpgs and nlsd specifically binds to cpg sites but does not discriminate between unmethylated and methylated dna these results are not compatible with the suggestion that the target recognition domain of dnmt resides in the n terminus of the enzyme we show by protein protein interaction assays that znd and catd interact with each other the isolated catalytic domain does not methylate dna neither alone nor in combination with other domains full length dnmt was purified from baculovirus infected insect cells under the experimental conditions dnmt has a strong   fold preference for hemimethylated dna dnmt is stimulated to methylate unmodified cpg sites by the addition of fully methylated dna this effect is dependent on zn suggesting that binding of methylated dna to znd triggers the allosteric activation of the catalytic center of dnmt  the allosteric activation model can explain kinetic data obtained by others it suggests that dnmt might be responsible for spreading of methylation a process that is observed during aging and carcenogenesis but may be important for de novo methylation of dna
