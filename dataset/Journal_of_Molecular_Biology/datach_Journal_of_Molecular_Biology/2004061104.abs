folding of the villin headpiece subdomain from random structures analysis of the charge distribution as a function of ph
the structure of the  residue villin headpiece subdomain is investigated with the electrostatically driven monte carlo method the ecepp  empirical conformational energy program for peptides force field plus two different continuum solvation models were used to describe the conformational energy of the chain with both blocked and unblocked n and c termini a statistical analysis of an ensemble of ab initio generated conformations was carried out based on a comparison with a set of ten native like structures derived from published experimental data by using rigid geometry and nmr derived constraints obtained at ph   the ten native like structures satisfy the nmr derived constraints the whole ensemble of conformations of the terminally unblocked villin headpiece sub domain generated by using ecepp  with a continuum solvation model were subsequently evaluated at ph   with a potential function that includes ecepp  combined with a fast multigrid boundary element method at ph   the lowest energy conformation found during the conformational search satisfies    of both the distance and the dihedral angle constraints and possesses the characteristic packing of three phenylalanine residues that constitute the main part of the hydrophobic core of the molecule on the other hand computations at ph   and ph   for the ten native like structures satisfying the nmr derived constraints indicate a substantial change in the charge distribution for each type of amino acid residue with the change in ph the results of this study provide a basis to understand the effect of the interactions such as hydrophobicity charge  charge interaction and solvent polarization on the stability of this small  helical protein
