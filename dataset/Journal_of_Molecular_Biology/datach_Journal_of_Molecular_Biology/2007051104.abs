the multiple roles of cyclin e in controlling cell cycle progression and cellular morphology of trypanosoma brucei
regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle progression requires sequential activation and inactivation of cyclin dependent kinases previous rna interference rnai experiments in trypanosoma brucei indicated that cyclin e  cdc related kinase crk  and crk are involved in regulating g s transition whereas cyclin b and crk play a pivotal role in controlling the g m checkpoint to search for potential interactions between the other cyclins and crks that may not have been revealed by the rnai assays we used the yeast two hybrid system and an in vitro glutathione s transferase pulldown assay and observed interactions between cyclin e and crk  crk and crk  cyclins e  e are homologues of yeast pho  cyclin but yeast complementation assays indicated that none of them possesses a pho  like function analysis of cyclin e crk and cyclin e crk double knockdowns in the procyclic form of t brucei indicated that the cells were arrested more extensively in the g phase beyond the cumulative effect of individual knockdowns but brdu incorporation was impaired significantly only in cyclin e crk depleted cells whereas a higher percentage of cyclin e crk knockdown cells assumed a grossly elongated posterior end morphology a double knockdown of cyclin e and crk arrested cells in g m much more efficiently than if only crk was depleted taken together these data suggest multiple functions of cyclin e  it forms a complex with crk in promoting g s phase transition it forms a complex with crk in controlling the posterior morphogenesis during g s transition and it forms a complex with crk in promoting passage across the g m checkpoint in the trypanosome
