structure and functional analysis of ycfd a novel  oxoglutarate fe  dependent oxygenase involved in translational regulation in escherichia coli
the  oxoglutarate  og fe  dependent oxygenases  og oxygenases are a large family of proteins that share a similar overall three dimensional structure and catalyze a diverse array of oxidation reactions the jumonji c jmjc domain containing proteins represent an important subclass of the og oxygenase family that typically catalyze protein hydroxylation however recently other reactions have been identified such as trna modification the escherichia coli gene ycfd was predicted to be a jmjc domain containing protein of unknown function based on primary sequence recently ycfd was determined to act as a ribosomal oxygenase hydroxylating an arginine residue on the  s ribosomal protein l   rl   we have determined the crystal structure of ycfd at    resolution revealing that ycfd is structurally similar to known jmjc proteins and possesses the characteristic double stranded  helix fold or cupin domain separate from the cupin domain an additional globular module termed  helical arm mediates dimerization of ycfd we further have shown that og binds to ycfd using isothermal titration calorimetry and identified key binding residues using mutagenesis that together with the iron location and structural similarity with other cupin family members allowed identification of the active site structural homology to ribosomal assembly proteins combined with gst glutathione s transferase ycfd pull down of a ribosomal protein and docking of rl  to the ycfd active site support the role of ycfd in regulation of bacterial ribosome assembly furthermore overexpression of ycfd is shown to inhibit cell growth signifying a toxic effect on ribosome assembly
