sequence dependence of bnip transmembrane domain dimerization implicates side chain hydrogen bonding and a tandem gxxxg motif in specific helix  helix interactions
the transmembrane domain of the pro apoptotic protein bnip self associates strongly in membranes and in detergents we have used site directed mutagenesis to analyze the sequence dependence of bnip transmembrane domain dimerization from which we infer the physical basis for strong and specific helix  helix interactions in this system hydrophobic substitutions identify six residues as critical to dimerization and the pattern of sensitive residues suggests that the bnip helices interact at a right handed crossing angle based on the dimerization propensities of single point mutants we propose that polar residues his  and ser  make inter monomer hydrogen bonds to one another through their side chains ala   gly   and gly  form a tandem gxxxg motif that allows close approach of the helices and ile  makes inter monomer van der waals contacts since neither the tandem gxxxg motif nor the hydrogen bonding pair is sufficient to drive dimerization our results demonstrate the importance of sequence context for either hydrogen bonding or gxxxg motif involvement in bnip transmembrane helix  helix interactions in this study hydrophobic substitutions away from the six interfacial positions have almost no effect on dimerization confirming the expectation that hydrophobic replacements affect helix  helix interactions only if they interfere with packing or hydrogen bonding by interfacial residues however changes to slightly polar residues are somewhat disruptive even when located away from the interface and the degree of disruption correlates with the decrease in hydrophobicity changing the hydrophobicity of the bnip transmembrane domain alters its helicity and protection of its backbone amides we suggest that polar substitutions decrease the fraction of dimer by stabilizing an unfolded monomeric state of the transmembrane span rather than by affecting helix  helix interactions this result has broad implications for interpreting the sequence dependence of membrane protein stability in detergents
