tyr   a key residue involved in strand discrimination by the dna mismatch repair endonuclease muth
the molecular mechanism of how the dam methylation status of the dna is recognized during dna mismatch repair by the strand discrimination endonuclease muth is not known a comparison of the crystal structure of muth with those of co crystal structures of several restriction endonucleases together with a multiple sequence alignment of muth and related proteins suggested that phe  arg  and tyr  could be involved in discrimination between a methylated or unmethylated adenine in the d gatc sequence a mutational analysis revealed that the variants r  a and y  s but not f a were substantially reduced in their ability to complement a mismatch repair deficiency in a muth  escherichia coli strain in vitro r  a displayed a strongly reduced endonuclease activity whereas the y  s variant has almost completely lost its preference for cleaving the unmethylated strand at hemimethylated d gatc sites furthermore the y  variant can cleave fully methlyated d gatc sites at a comparable rate to unmethylated d gatc sites this demonstrates that tyr  is an important if not the only amino acid residue in muth for sensing the methylation status of the dna
