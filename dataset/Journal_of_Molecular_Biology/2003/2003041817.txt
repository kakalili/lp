Human Fen1 can be acetylated in vivo and in vitro resulting in reduced endonuclease and exonuclease activities in vitro. Acetylation occurs at four lysines located at the C terminus of Fen1, which is important for DNA binding. In this paper we show that Fen1 mutant proteins lacking the lysines at the C terminus have both reduced PCNA independent exonucleolytic and endonucleolytic activities. However, lysines at the C terminus are not required for PCNA stimulation of human Fen1. A double flap substrate was optimal for human Fen1 endonuclease and did not require the C-terminal lysines. Similarly, a one nucleotide 3′-overhang nick substrate was optimal for human Fen1 exonuclease and also did not require the C-terminal lysines. Finally, we found by an electromobility shift assay that human Fen1 had a different mode of binding with a double flap substrate containing a one nucleotide 3′-tail when compared to various other flap substrates. Taken together, our results confirm the double flap substrate as the likely in vivo intermediate for human Fen1 and that the C-terminal lysines are important for the endonuclease and exonuclease activities likely through DNA binding.
