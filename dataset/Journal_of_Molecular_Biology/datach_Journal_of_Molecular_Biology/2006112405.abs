structural basis for nucleic acid and toxin recognition of the bacterial antitoxin ccda
toxin  antitoxin systems are highly abundant in plasmids and bacterial chromosomes they ensure plasmid maintenance by killing bacteria that have lost the plasmid their expression is autoregulated at the level of transcription here we present the solution structure of ccda the antitoxin of the ccd system as a free protein    kda and in complex with its cognate dna    kda  ccda is composed of two distinct and independent domains the n terminal domain responsible for dna binding which establishes a new family of the ribbon helix helix fold and the c terminal region which is responsible for the interaction with the toxin ccdb the c terminal domain is intrinsically unstructured and forms a tight complex with the toxin we show that ccda specifically recognizes a  bp palindromic dna sequence within the operator  promoter op region of the ccd operon and binds to dna by insertion of the positively charged n terminal  sheet into the major groove the binding of up to three ccda dimers to a  mer dna of its operator  promoter region was studied by nmr spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry and single point mutation the highly flexible c terminal region of free ccda explains its susceptibility to proteolysis by the lon atp dependent protease
