nap  histone chaperone function and phosphorylation state through the cell cycle edited by t richmond
we have recently cloned the human nucleosome assembly protein  nap   here we demonstrate that casein kinase  ckii from hela cell nuclear extracts interacts with immobilized nap ii and phosphorylates both nap  and nucleosome assembly protein  nap  in vitro furthermore nap  and nap  phosphorylation in crude hela cell extracts is abolished by heparin a specific inhibitor of ckii addition of core histones can stimulate phosphorylation of nap  and nap  by ckii nap  is also a phosphoprotein in vivo the protein is phosphorylated at the g g boundary but it is not phosphorylated in s phase here we show that nap  is a histone chaperone throughout the cell cycle and that its cell cycle distribution might be governed by its phosphorylation status phosphorylated nap  remains in the cytoplasm in a complex with histones during the g g transition whereas its dephosphorylation triggers its transport into the nucleus at the g s boundary with the histone cargo suggesting that binding to histones does not depend on phosphorylation status finally indirect immunofluorescence shows that nap  is present during metaphase of hela and cos cells and its localization is distinct from metaphase chromosomes
