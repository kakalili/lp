crystal structure of an antigen binding fragment bound to single stranded dna edited by i a wilson
antibodies to dna are characteristic of the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus sle and they also serve as models for the study of protein dna recognition anti dna antibodies often play an important role in disease pathogenesis by mediating kidney damage via antibody dna immune complex formation the structural underpinnings of anti dna antibody pathogenicity and antibody dna recognition however are not well understood due in part to the lack of direct experimental three dimensional structural information on antibody dna complexes to address these issues for anti single stranded dna antibodies we have determined the    crystal structure of a recombinant fab dna  in complex with dt  dna  was previously isolated from a bacteriophage fab display library from the immunoglobulin repertoire of an sle prone mouse the structure shows that dna  binds oligo dt primarily by sandwiching thymine bases between tyr side chains which allows the bases to make sequence specific hydrogen bonds the critical stacking tyr residues are l  l  h   and h  a while his l  and asn l  contribute hydrogen bonds comparison of the dna  structure to other anti nucleic acid fab structures reveals a common ssdna recognition module consisting of tyr l  a hydrogen bonding residue at position l  and an aromatic side chain from the tip of complementarity determining region h  the structure also provides a framework for interpreting previously determined thermodynamics data and this analysis suggests that hydrophobic desolvation might underlie the observed negative enthalpy of binding finally arg side chains from complementarity determining region h appear to play a novel role in dna  rather than forming ion pairs with dt  arg contributes to oligo dt recognition by helping to maintain the structural integrity of the combining site this result is significant because antibody pathogenicity is thought to be correlated to the arg content of anti dna antibody hypervariable loops
