on the structural and functional importance of the highly conserved glu  of thermus thermophilus l ribosomal protein
the structural and functional importance of the highly conserved amino acid residue glutamic acid   glu  of the ribosomal protein l from thermus thermophilus tthl  has been investigated by replacing this residue by alanine or glutamine and by incorporating the resulted mutants into escherichia coli ribosomes the catalytic properties of peptidyltransferase estimated for the mutants as well as for the wild type tthl by the puromycin reaction were quite different the binding of trna to the p and a site was affected in addition replacement of the native l protein by wild type tthl or by tthl ala  mutant resulted in reduced capability of  s subunits for association with  s subunits in contrast neither the assembly of the  s subunits nor the fixation of the trna   end at the p or a site was affected these results are used to discuss critically the hypothesis that the  carboxyl group of the highly conserved glu  is essential for stabilizing a flexible loop of l  which extended into the ribosome interior region influences the mechanism of peptide bond formation mutations concerning the semi conserved glycine   gly  were investigated replacement of gly  by serine did not affect the measured functions in contrast replacement of gly  by alanine resulted in enhanced peptidyltransferase activity and increased trna affinity for the p and a sites indicating a possible implication of this amino acid in the local loop conformation of tthl
