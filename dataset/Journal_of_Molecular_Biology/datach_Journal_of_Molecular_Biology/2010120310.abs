coupling translocation with nucleic acid unwinding by ns helicase
we present a semiquantitative model for translocation and unwinding activities of monomeric nonstructural protein  ns  helicase the model is based on structural biochemical and single molecule measurements the model predicts that the ns helicase actively unwinds duplex by reducing more than   the free energy that stabilizes base pairing stacking the unwinding activity slows the movement of the helicase in a sequence dependent manner lowering the average unwinding efficiency to less than  bp per atp cycle when bound with atp the ns helicase can display significant translocational diffusion this increases displacement fluctuations of the helicase decreases the average unwinding efficiency and enhances the sequence dependence also interactions between the helicase and the duplex stabilize the helicase at the junction facilitating the helicase s unwinding activity while preventing it from dissociating in the presence of translocational diffusion during active unwinding the dissociation rate of the helicase also exhibits sequence dependence based on unwinding velocity fluctuations measured from single molecule experiments we estimate the diffusion rate to be on the order of   s   the generic features of coupling single stranded nucleic acid translocation with duplex unwinding presented in this work may apply generally to a class of helicases
