role of the dna repair nucleases rad  rad and uve of schizosaccharomyces pombe in mismatch correction edited by s reed
repair of mismatched dna occurs mainly by the long patch mismatch repair mmr pathway requiring msh and pms  in schizosaccharomyces pombe mismatches can be repaired by a short patch repair system containing nucleotide excision repair ner factors we studied mismatch correction efficiency in cells with inactivated dna repair nucleases rad  rad or uve in mmr proficient and deficient background rad  incises   of damaged dna during ner rad has a function in the uve dependent repair of dna damages and in replication loss of rad  caused a strong reduction of short patch processing of mismatches formed during meiotic recombination mitotic mutation rates were increased but not to the same extent as in the ner mutant swi  which is defective in   incision the difference might be caused by an additional role of rad  in base excision repair or due to partial redundancy with other   endonucleases meiotic mismatch repair was not or only slightly affected in rad and uve mutants in addition inactivation of uve caused only weak effects on mutation avoidance mutation rates were elevated when rad was mutated but not further increased in swi  rad and rad  rad double mutants indicating an epistatic relationship however the mutation spectra of rad were different from that of swi  and rad  thus the function of rad in mutation avoidance is rather independent of ner rad  swi  and rad  but not uve mutants were sensitive to the dna damaging agent methyl methane sulphonate cell survival was further reduced in the double mutants swi  rad  rad  rad and surprisingly swi  rad  these data confirm that ner and rad act in distinct damage repair pathways and further indicate that the function of rad  in repair of alkylated bases is partially independent of ner
