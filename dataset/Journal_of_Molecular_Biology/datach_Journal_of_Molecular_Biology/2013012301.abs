the importance of the n terminus of t endonuclease i in the interaction with dna junctions
t endonuclease i is a dimeric nuclease that is selective for four way dna junctions previous crystallographic studies have found that the n terminal  amino acids are not visible neither in the presence nor in the absence of dna we have now investigated the effect of deleting the n terminus completely or partially n terminal deleted enzyme binds more tightly to dna junctions but cleaves them more slowly while deletion of the n terminus does not measurably affect the global structure of the complex the presence of the peptide is required to generate a local opening at the center of the dna junction that is observed by  aminopurine fluorescence complete deletion of the peptide leads to a cleavage rate that is  orders of magnitude slower and an activation enthalpy that is  fold higher suggesting that the most important interaction of the peptide is with the reaction transition state taken together these data point to an important role of the n terminus in generating a central opening of the junction that is required for the cleavage reaction to proceed properly in the absence of this we find that a cruciform junction is no longer subject to bilateral cleavage but instead just one strand is cleaved thus the n terminus is required for a productive resolution of the junction
