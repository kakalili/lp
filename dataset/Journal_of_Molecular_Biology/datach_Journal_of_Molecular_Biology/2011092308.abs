polymerase chaperoning and multiple atpase sites enable the e coli dna polymerase iii holoenzyme to rapidly form initiation complexes
cellular replicases include three subassemblies a dna polymerase a sliding clamp processivity factor and a clamp loader complex the escherichia coli clamp loader is the dnax complex dnax        where dnax occurs either as  or as the shorter  that arises by translational frameshifting complexes composed of either form of dnax are fully active clamp loaders but  confers important replicase functions including chaperoning the polymerase to the newly loaded clamp to form an initiation complex for processive replication the kinetics of initiation complex formation were explored for dnax complexes reconstituted with varying  and  stoichiometries revealing that  mediated polymerase chaperoning accelerates initiation complex formation by   fold analyzing dnax complexes containing one or more k e variant dnax subunits demonstrated that only one active atp binding site is required to form initiation complexes but the two additional sites increase the rate by ca   fold for  containing complexes the atp analogue atp s was found to support initiation complex formation at    th the rate with atp in contrast to previous models that proposed atp s drives hydrolysis independent initiation complex formation by  containing complexes the rate and stoichiometry of atp s hydrolysis coincide with those for initiation complex formation these results show that although one atpase site is sufficient for initiation complex formation the combination of polymerase chaperoning and the binding and hydrolysis of three atps dramatically accelerates initiation complex formation to a rate constant      s   compatible with double stranded dna replication
