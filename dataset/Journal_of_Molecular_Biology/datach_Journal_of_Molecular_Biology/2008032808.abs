protein arginine methyltransferase  coactivates nf  b dependent gene expression synergistically with carm and parp
nuclear factor kappa b nf  b plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell survival transcriptional coactivators that methylate histones become increasingly important recently we provided evidence that coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase  carm  is a transcriptional coactivator of nf  b and functions as a promoter specific regulator of nf  b recruitment to chromatin here we show that protein arginine methyltransferase  prmt  synergistically coactivates nf  b dependent gene expression at the macrophage inflammatory protein  and human immunodeficiency virus  long terminal repeat promoters in concert with the transcriptional coactivators p  creb binding protein carm  and poly adp ribose polymerase  prmt formed a complex with poly adp ribose polymerase  and nf  b in vivo and interacted directly with the nf  b subunit p  in vitro the methyltransferase activity of prmt appeared essential for its coactivator function in context with carm and p  creb binding protein these results suggest that the cooperative action between prmt and carm is required for nf  b dependent gene expression
