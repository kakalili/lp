determination of stoichiometry and conformational changes in the first step of the p  tail assembly
large oligomeric portal assemblies have a central role in the life cycles of bacteriophages and herpesviruses the stoichiometry of in vitro assembled portal proteins has been a subject of debate for several years the intrinsic polymorphic oligomerization of ectopically expressed portal proteins makes it possible to form rings of diverse stoichiometry e g   mer   mer   mer etc  in solution in this study we have investigated the stoichiometry of the in vitro assembled portal protein of bacteriophage p  and characterized its association with the tail factor gp  using native mass spectrometry we show for the first time that the reconstituted portal protein assembled in vitro using a modified purification and assembly protocol is exclusively dodecameric under the conditions used here   copies of tail factor gp bind to the portal ring in a cooperative fashion to form a    complex of    mda we applied tandem mass spectrometry to the complete assembly and found an unusual dimeric dissociation pattern of gp  suggesting a dimeric sub organization of gp when assembled with the portal ring furthermore native and ion mobility mass spectrometry reveal a major conformational change in the portal upon binding of gp  we propose that the gp induced conformational change in the portal ring initiates a cascade of events assisting in the stabilization of newly filled p  particles which marks the end of phage morphogenesis
