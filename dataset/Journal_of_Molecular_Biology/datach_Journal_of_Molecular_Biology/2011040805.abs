features of rhodobacter sphaeroides chrr required for stimuli to promote the dissociation of  e chrr complexes
in the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter sphaeroides a transcriptional response to the reactive oxygen species singlet oxygen  o  is mediated by chrr a zinc metalloprotein that binds to and inhibits the activity of the alternative  factor  e we provide evidence that o promotes the dissociation of  e from chrr to activate transcription in vivo to identify what is required for o to promote the dissociation of  e chrr complexes we analyzed the in vivo properties of variant chrr proteins with amino acid changes in conserved residues of the c terminal cupin like domain chrr cld  we found that o was unable to promote the detectable dissociation of  e chrr complexes when the chrr cld zinc ligands his   his   glu   and his   were substituted with alanine even though individual substitutions caused a  fold to  fold decrease in zinc affinity for this domain relative to that for wild type chrr kd         m  we conclude that the side chains of these invariant residues play a crucial role in the response to o  additionally we found that cells containing variant chrr proteins with single amino acid substitutions at cys  or cys  exhibited  e activity similar to those containing wild type chrr when exposed to o  suggesting that these thiol side chains are not required for o to induce  e activity in vivo finally we found that the same aspects of r sphaeroides chrr needed for a response to o are required for the dissociation of  e chrr complexes in the presence of the organic hydroperoxide t butyl hydroperoxide
