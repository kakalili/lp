mixtures of wild type and a pathogenic e g form of a   in vitro accumulate protofibrils including amyloid pores
although app mutations associated with inherited forms of alzheimer s disease ad are relatively rare detailed studies of these mutations may prove critical for gaining important insights into the mechanism s and etiology of ad here we present a detailed biophysical characterization of the structural properties of protofibrils formed by the arctic variant e g of amyloid  protein a  arc as well as the effect of a  wt on the distribution of the protofibrillar species formed by a  arc by characterizing biologically relevant mixtures of both proteins that may mimic the situation in the heterozygous patients these studies revealed that the arctic mutation accelerates both a  oligomerization and fibrillogenesis in vitro in addition a  arc was observed to affect both the morphology and the size distribution of a  protofibrils electron microscopy examination of the protofibrils formed by a  arc revealed several morphologies including   relatively compact spherical particles roughly    nm in diameter   annular pore like protofibrils   large spherical particles     nm in diameter and   short filaments with chain like morphology conversion of a  arc protofibrils to fibrils occurred more rapidly than protofibrils formed in mixed solutions of a  wt a  arc suggesting that co incubation of a  arc with a  wt leads to kinetic stabilization of a  arc protofibrils an increase in the ratio of a wt a mut arctic  therefore may result in the accumulation of potential neurotoxic protofibrils and acceleration of disease progression in familial alzheimer s disease mutation carriers
