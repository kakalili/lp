a conformational switch involved in maturation of staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage   capsids
bacteriophages are involved in many aspects of the spread and establishment of virulence factors in staphylococcus aureus including the mobilization of genetic elements known as s aureus pathogenicity islands sapis  which carry genes for superantigen toxins and other virulence factors sapis are packaged into phage like transducing particles using proteins supplied by the helper phage we have used cryo electron microscopy and icosahedral reconstruction to determine the structures of the procapsid and the mature capsid of    a bacteriophage that can mobilize several different sapis the   capsid has t  icosahedral symmetry with the capsid protein organized into pentameric and hexameric clusters that interact via prominent trimeric densities the   capsid protein was modeled based on the capsid protein fold of bacteriophage hk  and fitted into the   reconstructions the models show that the trivalent interactions are mediated primarily by a  residue  hairpin structure called the p loop that is not found in hk  capsid expansion is associated with a conformational switch in the spine helix that is propagated throughout the subunit unlike the domain rotation mechanism in phage hk  or p
