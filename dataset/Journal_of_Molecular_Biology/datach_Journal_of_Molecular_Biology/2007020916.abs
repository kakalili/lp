the crystal structures of human calpains  and  imply diverse mechanisms of action and auto inhibition
calpains are calcium activated cysteine proteases found throughout the animal plant and fungi kingdoms   isoforms have been described in the human genome calpains have been implicated in multiple models of human disease for instance calpain  is activated in the brains of individuals with alzheimer s disease and the digestive tract specific calpain  is down regulated in gastric cancer cell lines we have solved the structures of human calpain  and calpain  protease cores using crystallographic methods both structures have clear implications for the function of non catalytic domains of full length calpains in the calcium mediated activation of the enzyme the structure of minicalpain  is similar to previously solved structures of the protease core auto inhibition in this system is most likely through rearrangements of a central helical loop region near the active site cysteine which occlude the substrate binding site however the structure of minicalpain  indicates that auto inhibition in this enzyme is mediated through large intra domain movements that misalign the catalytic triad this disruption is reminiscent of the full length inactive calpain conformation the structures of the highly conserved ubiquitously expressed human calpain  and the more tissue specific human calpain  indicate that although there are high levels of sequence conservation throughout the calpain family isolated structures of family members are insufficient to explain the molecular mechanism of activation for this group of proteins
