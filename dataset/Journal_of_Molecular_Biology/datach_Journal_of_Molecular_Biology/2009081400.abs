a   utr spliced mrna isoform is specialized for enhanced hiv  gag translation
full length unspliced genomic rna plays critical roles in hiv replication serving both as mrna for the synthesis of the key viral polyproteins gag and gag pol and as genomic rna for encapsidation into assembling viral particles we show that a second gag mrna species that differs from the genomic rna molecule by the absence of an intron in the   untranslated region   utr is produced during hiv  replication in cell culture and in infected patients we developed a cotransfection system in which epitopically tagged gag proteins can be traced back to their mrna origins in the translation pool we show that a disproportionate amount of gag is translated from   utr intron spliced mrnas demonstrating a role for the   utr intron in the regulation of gag translation to further characterize the effects of the hiv    utr on translation we fused wild type spliced or mutant leader rna constructs to a luciferase reporter gene and assayed their translation in reticulocyte lysates these assays confirmed that leaders lacking the   utr intron increased translational efficiency compared to that of the unspliced leader in addition we found that removal or mutagenesis of the c box a pyrimidine rich sequence located in the   utr intron and previously shown to affect rna dimerization also strongly influenced translational efficiency these results suggest that the splicing of both the   utr intron and the c box element have key roles in regulation of hiv  gag translation in vitro and in vivo
