solvent exposed non contacting amino acids play a critical role in nf  b i b  complex formation
i b  inhibits transcription factor nf  b activity by specific binding to nf  b heterodimers composed of p  and p  subunits it binds with slightly lower affinity to p  homodimers and with significantly lower affinity to homodimers of p  we have employed a structure based mutagenesis approach coupled with protein  protein interaction assays to determine the source of this dimer selectivity exhibited by i b  mutation of amino acid residues in i b  that contact nf  b only marginally affects complex binding affinity indicating a lack of hot spots in nf  b i b  complex formation conversion of the weak binding nf  b p  homodimer into a high affinity binding partner of i b  requires transfer of both the nls polypeptide and amino acid residues asn  and ser  from the nf  b p  subunit involvement of asn  and ser  in complex formation is surprising as these amino acid residues occupy solvent exposed positions at a distance of   from i b  in the crystal structures however the same amino acid residue positions have been genetically isolated as determinants of binding specificity in a homologous system in drosophila x ray crystallographic and solvent accessibility experiments suggest that these solvent exposed amino acid residues contribute to nf  b i b  complex formation by modulating the nf  b p  subunit nls polypeptide
