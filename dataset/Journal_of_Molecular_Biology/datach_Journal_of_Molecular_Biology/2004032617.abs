identifying target genes regulated downstream of cdx by microarray analysis
the caudal related homeobox transcription factor cdx  plays an important role in intestinal development differentiation and homeostasis however only a limited number of cdx regulated target genes have been elucidated to delineate the molecular mechanism regulated downstream of cdx  we aimed to define cdx regulated genes we engineered a rat intestinal epithelial cell line iec  with minimal endogenous cdx expression to express exogenous cdx  the gene expression patterns for cdx inducing cells and control cells were examined using oligonucleotide arrays in the present study differential expression of  genes was confirmed by a semi quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr analysis using gene specific primers increased expression of genes was involved in the notch signaling pathway xenobiotic metabolism enzymes associated with tumor suppression rna binding protein receptors signal transduction and transcription factors the wide ranging collection of such inducing genes suggests to the functions of cdx in cell fate decision and maintenance of intestinal epithelia
