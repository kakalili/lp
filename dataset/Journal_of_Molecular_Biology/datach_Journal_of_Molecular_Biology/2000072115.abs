drosophila stretchin mlck is a novel member of the titin myosin light chain kinase family
members of the titin myosin light chain kinase family play an essential role in the organization of the actin myosin cytoskeleton especially in sarcomere assembly and function in drosophila melanogaster projectin is so far the only member of this family for which a transcription unit has been characterized the locus of another member of this family a protein related to myosin light chain kinase was also identified the cdna and genomic sequences published explain only the shorter transcripts expressed by this locus here we report the complete molecular characterization of this transcription unit which spans  kb includes  exons and accounts for transcripts up to  kb in length this transcription unit contains both the largest exon     nt and the largest coding region     nt reported so far for drosophila this transcription unit features both internal promoters and internal polyadenylation signals which enable it to express seven different transcripts ranging from   to  kb in size the latter encodes a huge titin like   kda kinase that features two large pevk rich repeats   immunoglobulin and two fibronectin type iii domains which we designate stretchin mlck in addition the   end of the stretchin mlck transcription unit expresses shorter transcripts that encode  to  kda isoforms of stretchin mlck that are analogous to vertebrate myosin light chain kinases similarly the   end of the stretchin mlck transcription unit can also express transcripts encoding kettin and unc  like isoforms which share no sequences with the mlck like transcripts thus this locus can be viewed as a single transcription unit stretchin mlck genetic abbreviation strn mlck  that expresses large composite transcripts and protein isoforms sequences available at http  www academicpress com jmb  as well as a complex of two independent transcription units the stretchin and mlck transcription units strn and mlck respectively the result of a  gene fission  event that encode independent transcripts and proteins with distinct structural and enzymatic functions
