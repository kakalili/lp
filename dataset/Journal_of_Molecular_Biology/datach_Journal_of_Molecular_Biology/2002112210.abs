the crystal structure of the nuclease domain of colicin e suggests a mechanism for binding to double stranded dna by the h  n  h endonucleases
the bacterial toxin cole contains an h  n  h endonuclease domain nuclease cole  that digests cellular dna or rna non specifically in target cells leading to cell death in the host cell protein im forms a complex with cole to inhibit its nuclease activity here we present the crystal structure of the unbound nuclease cole at a resolution of    structural comparison between the unbound and bound nuclease cole in complex with im  suggests that im is not an allosteric inhibitor that induces backbone conformational changes in nuclease cole  but rather one that inhibits by blocking the substrate binding site there were two nuclease cole molecules in the p unit cell in crystals and they appeared as a dimer related to each other by a non crystallographic dyad symmetry gel filtration and cross linking experiments confirmed that nuclease cole indeed formed dimers in solution and that the dimeric conformation was more favored in the presence of double stranded dna structural comparison of nuclease cole with the his cys box homing endonuclease i ppoi further demonstrated that h  n  h motifs in dimeric nuclease cole were oriented in a manner very similar to that of the    fold of the active sites found in dimeric i ppoi a mechanism for the binding of double stranded dna by dimeric h  n  h nuclease cole is suggested
