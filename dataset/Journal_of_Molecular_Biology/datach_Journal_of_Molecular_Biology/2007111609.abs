divergent genetic control of protein solubility and conformational quality in escherichia coli
in bacteria protein overproduction results in the formation of inclusion bodies sized protein aggregates showing amyloid like properties such as seeding driven formation amyloid tropic dye binding intermolecular  sheet architecture and cytotoxicity on mammalian cells during protein deposition exposed hydrophobic patches force intermolecular clustering and aggregation but these aggregation determinants coexist with properly folded stretches exhibiting native like secondary structure several reports indicate that inclusion bodies formed by different enzymes or fluorescent proteins show detectable biological activity by using an engineered green fluorescent protein as reporter we have examined how the cell quality control distributes such active but misfolded protein species between the soluble and insoluble cell fractions and how aggregation determinants act in cells deficient in quality control functions most of the tested genetic deficiencies in different cytosolic chaperones and proteases affecting dnak groel groes clpb clpp and lon at different extents resulted in much less soluble but unexpectedly more fluorescent polypeptides the enrichment of aggregates with fluorescent species results from a dramatic inhibition of clpp and lon mediated dnak surveyed green fluorescent protein degradation and it does not perturb the amyloid like architecture of inclusion bodies therefore the escherichia coli quality control system promotes protein solubility instead of conformational quality through an overcommitted proteolysis of aggregation prone polypeptides irrespective of their global conformational status and biological properties
