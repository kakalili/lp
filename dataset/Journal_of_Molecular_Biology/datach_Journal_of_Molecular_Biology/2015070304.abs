ring e catalyzed e self ubiquitination attenuates the activity of ube e ubiquitin conjugating enzymes
ubiquitination of a target protein is accomplished through sequential actions of the e  e s and the e s e s dictate the modification topology while e ligases confer substrate specificity and recruit the cognate e  human genome codes for   different e proteins all of which contain the characteristic ubiquitin conjugating ubc core domain sufficient for catalysis many of these e enzymes also have n or c terminal extensions roles of which are not very well understood we show that the n terminal extension of ube e undergoes intramolecular auto ubiquitination this self ubiquitination activity is enhanced in the presence of interacting ring e ligases and results in a progressive attenuation of the e activity toward substrate e modification we also find that the n terminal ubiquitination sites are conserved in all the three ube es and replacing them with arginine renders all three full length ube es equally active as their core ubc domains based on these results we propose that e catalyzed self ubiquitination acts as a key regulatory mechanism that controls the activity of ube e class of ubiquitin e s
