composition and topology of the endoplasmic reticulum  mitochondria encounter structure
eukaryotic cells contain multiple organelles which are functionally and structurally interconnected the endoplasmic reticulum  mitochondria encounter structure ermes forms a junction between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum er  four ermes proteins are known in yeast the er anchored protein mmm and three mitochondria associated proteins mdm  mdm  and mdm  with functions related to mitochondrial morphology and protein biogenesis we mapped the glycosylation sites of ermes and demonstrate that three asparagine residues in the n  terminal domain of mmm are glycosylated while the glycosylation is dispensable the cytosolic c  terminal domain of mmm that connects to the mdm proteins is required for mmm function to analyze the composition of ermes we determined the subunits by quantitative mass spectrometry we identified the calcium binding gtpase gem as a new ermes subunit revealing that ermes is composed of five genuine subunits taken together ermes represents a platform that integrates components with functions in formation of er  mitochondria junctions maintenance of mitochondrial morphology protein biogenesis and calcium binding
