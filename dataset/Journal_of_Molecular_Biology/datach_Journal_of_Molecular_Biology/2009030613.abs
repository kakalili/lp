three dimensional solid state nmr study of a seven helical integral membrane proton pump  structural insights
proteorhodopsin pr is a recently discovered ubiquitous eubacterial retinal binding light driven proton pump almost   pr variants are widely distributed in species of marine and freshwater bacteria suggesting pr s important photobiological role pr is a typical seven transmembrane  helical membrane protein and as such poses a significant challenge to structural studies attempts to crystallize pr have not been successful and its three dimensional structure remains unknown we show that pr reconstituted in lipids gives well resolved magic angle spinning nmr spectra of high signal to noise ratio we report sequential assignment of  c and  n backbone and side chain chemical shifts for   of   residues in pr achieved by three dimensional chemical shift correlation experiments performed on two samples with different patterns of reverse labeling the chemical shift analysis gives a number of important structural insights not available from other studies we have established protonation states of several carboxylic acids identified the boundaries and distortions of transmembrane  helices and detected secondary structure elements in the loops we confirmed that internal asp   which was proposed to form part of the schiff base counterion is ionized while glu   which is located close to the extracellular surface is neutral in agreement with earlier predictions we infer that similar to bacteriorhodopsin s structure pr has a proline kink in helix c a non proline kink in helix g a short  turn in the b  c loop and a short  helical segment in the e  f loop
