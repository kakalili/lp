the processing of human rhomboid intramembrane serine protease rhbdl is required for its proteolytic activity
rhbdl  a human homolog of the rhomboids belongs to a unique class of serine intramembrane proteases little is known about its function and regulation here we show that rhbdl is produced as a proenzyme and that the processing of rhbdl is required for its cellular protease activity the processing of rhbdl was shown by both western blot and immunofluorescence analysis we have demonstrated that a highly conserved arg residue on loop  of rhbdl plays a critical role in the activation of the proenzyme the activation of rhbdl is catalyzed by a protease that is sensitive to a class of sulfonamide compounds furthermore endogenous rhbdl exists as the processed form and treatment of cells with a sulfonamide inhibitor led to an accumulation of the full length of rhbdl  therefore this study has demonstrated that rhbdl activity is regulated by proenzyme activation revealed a role for the conserved wr residues in loop  in rhbdl activity and provided critical insights into the regulation and function of this human rhomboid protease
