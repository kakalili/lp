connectivity between catalytic landscapes of the metallo  lactamase superfamily
the expansion of functions in an enzyme superfamily is thought to occur through recruitment of latent promiscuous functions within existing enzymes thus the promiscuous activities of enzymes represent connections between different catalytic landscapes and provide an additional layer of evolutionary connectivity between functional families alongside their sequence and structural relationships functional connectivity has been observed between individual functional families however little is known about how catalytic landscapes are connected throughout a highly diverged superfamily here we describe a superfamily wide analysis of evolutionary and functional connectivity in the metallo  lactamase mbl superfamily we investigated evolutionary connections between functional families and related evolutionary to functional connectivity   enzymes from  distinct functional families were challenged against  catalytically distinct reactions we revealed that enzymes of this superfamily are generally promiscuous as each enzyme catalyzes on average   reactions in addition to its native one catalytic landscapes in the mbl superfamily overlap substantially each reaction is connected on average to   other reactions whereas some connections appear to be unrelated to recent evolutionary events and occur between chemically distinct reactions these findings support the idea that the highly distinct reactions in the mbl superfamily could have evolved from a common ancestor traversing a continuous network via promiscuous enzymes several functional connections e g  the lactonase phosphotriesterase and phosphonatase phosphodiesterase arylsulfatase reactions are also observed in structurally and evolutionary distinct superfamilies suggesting that these catalytic landscapes are substantially connected our results show that new enzymatic functions could evolve rapidly from the current diversity of enzymes and range of promiscuous activities
