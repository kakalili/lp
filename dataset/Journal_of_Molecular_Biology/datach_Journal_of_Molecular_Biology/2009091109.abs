peptide nmhrypnq of the cellular prion protein prpc inhibits aggregation and is a potential key for understanding prion  prion interactions
pathogenesis of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is correlated with a conversion of the normal cellular form of the prion protein prpc into the abnormal isoform scrapie form of prp  contact of the normal prp with its abnormal isoform the scrapie form of prp induces the transformation knowledge of molecules that inhibit such contacts leads to an understanding of the mechanism of the aggregation and these molecules may serve as leads for drugs against transmissible spongiform encephalopathies therefore we screened a synthetic octapeptide library of the globular domain of the human prpc for binding affinity to prpc two fragments with binding affinity   yyrenmhr  and  nmhrypnq   were identified with kd values of  and    m respectively a  fold excess of peptide  nmhrypnq  inhibits aggregation of the prp by   nmr and mass spectrometry showed that the binding region of the peptide  nmhrypnq  is located at helix  of the prp
