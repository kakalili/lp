mechanism of dissociative inhibition of hiv protease and its autoprocessing from a precursor
dimerization is indispensible for release of the human immunodeficiency virus protease pr from its precursor gag pol and ensuing mature like catalytic activity that is crucial for virus maturation we show that a single chain fv fragment scfv of a previously reported monoclonal antibody mab    which recognizes the n terminus of pr dissociates a dimeric mature d n pr mutant with an enhanced dimer dissociation constant kd in the sub micromolar range to form predominantly a monomer  scfv complex at a   ratio along with small      amounts of a dimer  scfv complex enzyme kinetics indicate a mixed mechanism of inhibition of the wild type pr which exhibits a kd lt  nm with effects both on km and kcat at an scfv to pr ratio of    scfv binds to the n terminal peptide p qitlw of pr and to pr monomers with dissociation constants of   nm and   nm respectively consistent with an   fold increase in the dissociation of the antibody kab on even addition of an acetyl group to p of the peptide the antibody fails to inhibit n terminal autoprocessing of the pr from a model precursor at   m  however subsequent to this cleavage it sequesters the pr thus blocking autoprocessing at its c terminus a second monoclonal antibody prm  human monoclonal antibody to pr  which recognizes part of the flap region residues     of the mature pr and its precursor does not inhibit autoprocessing and ensuing catalytic activity however its failure to recognize drug resistant clinical mutants of pr may be beneficial to monitor the selection of mutations in this region under drug pressure
