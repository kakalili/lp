structure of a dihydroxycoumarin active site inhibitor in complex with the rnase h domain of hiv  reverse transcriptase and structure  activity analysis of inhibitor analogs
human immunodeficiency virus hiv encodes four essential enzymes protease integrase reverse transcriptase rt associated dna polymerase and rt associated ribonuclease h rnase h  current clinically approved anti aids drugs target all hiv enzymatic activities except rnase h which has proven to be a very difficult target for hiv drug discovery our high throughput screening activities identified the dihydroxycoumarin compound f     as a specific inhibitor of rt rnase h with low micromolar potency in vitro optimization of inhibitory potency can be facilitated by structural information about inhibitor  target binding here we report the crystal structure of f     bound to the active site of an isolated rnase h domain of hiv  rt at a resolution limit of     from predictions based on this structure compounds were obtained that showed improved inhibitory activity computational analysis suggested structural alterations that could provide additional interactions with rt and thus improve inhibitory potency these studies established proof of concept that f     could be used as a favorable chemical scaffold for development of hiv rnase h inhibitors
