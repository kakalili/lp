structures and solution properties of two novel periplasmic sensor domains with c type heme from chemotaxis proteins of geobacter sulfurreducens implications for signal transduction
periplasmic sensor domains from two methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins from geobacter sulfurreducens encoded by genes gsu   and gsu   were expressed in escherichia coli the sensor domains were isolated purified characterized in solution and their crystal structures were determined in the crystal both sensor domains form swapped dimers and show a pas type fold the swapped segment consists of two helices of about  residues at the n terminus with the hemes located between the two monomers in the case of the gsu   sensor the dimer contains a crystallographic  fold symmetry and the heme is coordinated by an axial his and a water molecule in the case of the gsu   sensor the crystals contain a non crystallographic dimer and surprisingly the coordination of the heme in each monomer is different monomer a heme has his met ligation and monomer b heme has his water ligation as found in the gsu   sensor the structures of these sensor domains are the first structures of pas domains containing covalently bound heme optical absorption electron paramagnetic resonance and nmr spectroscopy have revealed that the heme groups of both sensor domains are high spin and low spin in the oxidized and reduced forms respectively and that the spin state interconversion involves a heme axial ligand replacement both sensor domains bind no in their ferric and ferrous forms but bind co only in the reduced form the binding of both no and co occurs via an axial ligand exchange process and is fully reversible the reduction potentials of the sensor domains differ by   mv     mv and     mv for sensors gsu   and gsu   respectively  the swapped dimerization of these sensor domains and redox linked ligand switch might be related to the mechanism of signal transduction by these chemotaxis proteins
