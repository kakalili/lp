conformational properties of the unfolded state of im in nondenaturing conditions
the unfolded ensemble in aqueous solution represents the starting point of protein folding characterisation of this species is often difficult since the native state is usually predominantly populated at equilibrium previous work has shown that the four helix protein im  immunity protein   folds via an on pathway intermediate while the transition states and folding intermediate have been characterised in atomistic detail knowledge of the unfolded ensemble under the same ambient conditions remained sparse here we introduce destabilising amino acid substitutions into the sequence of im  such that the unfolded state becomes predominantly populated at equilibrium in the absence of denaturant using far and near uv cd fluorescence urea titration and heteronuclear nmr experiments we show that three amino acid substitutions l a  l a  l a are sufficient to prevent im folding such that the unfolded state is predominantly populated at equilibrium using measurement of chemical shifts  n transverse relaxation rates and sedimentation coefficients we show that the unfolded species of l a  l a  l a deviates significantly from random coil behaviour specifically we demonstrate that this unfolded species is compact rh     relative to the urea denatured state rh      and contains local clusters of hydrophobic residues in regions that correspond to the four helices in the native state despite these interactions there is no evidence for long range stabilising tertiary interactions or persistent helical structure the results reveal an unfolded ensemble that is conformationally restricted in regions of the polypeptide chain that ultimately form helices i ii and iv in the native state
