an envelope determined endocytic route of viral entry allows hiv  to escape from secreted phospholipase a entry blockade
secreted phospholipases a  spla s represent a new class of human immunodeficiency virus hiv inhibitors that block the early steps of virus entry into cells here we applied an in vitro evolution selection procedure to select from primary hiv isolates an emerging variant hivrbv  able to actively infect cells in the presence of spla s hivrbv  represents a very atypical hiv  isolate because in contrast to others this virus requires a functional endocytic machinery to infect cells indeed endocytosis inhibitors that affect endosome acidification bafilomycin a  monensin and or endosomal trafficking nocodazole latrunculin a drastically reduced hivrbv  replication using a standardized pcr assay we showed that endocytosis inhibitors block hivrbv  entry just before the reverse transcription step concurrently to identify the viral proteins responsible for the hivrbv  atypical behaviour we constructed a hiv  molecular chimera bearing different hivrbv  proteins we demonstrated that the sole presence of the hivrbv  envelope glycoprotein is enough not only to confer the resistance to spla s but also to direct hivrbv  to the endosomal dependant entry pathway interestingly hivrbv  envelope glycoprotein sequencing revealed an unusual structural pattern with the presence of rare mutations in the n terminal region and v  v envelope loop sequence extensions taken together we conclude that hiv  may escape from entry inhibitors such as spla s through the selection of a particular hiv  envelope glycoprotein that allows hiv to infect cells via an alternative entry route that relies on endosome trafficking
