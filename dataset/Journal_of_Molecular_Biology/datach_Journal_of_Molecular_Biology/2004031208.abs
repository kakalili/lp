folding barrier in horse cytochrome c support for a classical folding pathway
native state structures and conformations of ferrocytochrome c nitrosylcytochrome c and carbonmonoxycytochrome c are very similar they are however immensely different from each other in terms of thermodynamic stability the dramatic destabilization of ferrocytochrome c to the extent of  kcalmol   produces no effect on the folding rate and this is so in spite of the fact that all three test tube variants fold in an apparent two state manner for all three proteins the folding barrier is early in time sizable in energy and is of the same magnitude    kcalmol    these results raise some challenges to the  new view  of protein folding an early transition state the search for which consumes most of the observed folding time is suggested
