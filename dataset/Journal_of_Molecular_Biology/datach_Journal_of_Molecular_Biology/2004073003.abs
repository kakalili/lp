crystallographic studies of quinol oxidation site inhibitors a modified classification of inhibitors for the cytochrome bc complex
cytochrome bc is an integral membrane protein complex essential for cellular respiration and photosynthesis it couples electron transfer from quinol to cytochrome c to proton translocation across the membrane specific bc inhibitors have not only played crucial roles in elucidating the mechanism of bc function but have also provided leads for the development of novel antibiotics crystal structures of bovine bc in complex with the specific qo site inhibitors azoxystrobin moas myxothiazol stigmatellin and  undecyl  hydroxy   dioxobenzothiazole were determined interactions conformational changes and possible mechanisms of resistance specific to each inhibitor were defined residues and secondary structure elements that are capable of discriminating different classes of qo site inhibitors were identified for the cytochrome b subunit directions in the displacement of the cd helix of cytochrome b subunit in response to various qo site inhibitors were correlated to the binary conformational switch of the extrinsic domain of the iron  sulfur protein subunit the new structural information together with structures previously determined provide a basis that combined with biophysical and mutational data suggest a modification to the existing classification of bc inhibitors bc inhibitors are grouped into three classes class p inhibitors bind to the qo site class n inhibitors bind to the qi site and the class pn inhibitors target both sites class p contains two subgroups pm and pf that are distinct by their ability to induce mobile or fixed conformation of iron  sulfur protein
