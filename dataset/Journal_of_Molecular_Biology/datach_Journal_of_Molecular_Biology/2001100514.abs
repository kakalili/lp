quantitative analysis of dna binding by the escherichia coli arginine repressor edited by d e draper
allosteric activation of the hexameric arginine repressor argr for specific operator dna binding appears to involve alteration in its quaternary structure current models for activation include subunit assembly and or domain rearrangements in response to binding of the coeffector l arginine to investigate the molecular basis for argr operator interactions we have carried out a series of quantitative analyses of argr subunit assembly and of the affinity stoichiometry cooperativity and l arginine and dna sequence dependence of argr dna binding the results indicate that subunit assembly plays no role in activation although communication among subunits of the argr hexamer is required for specific dna binding the data suggest that dna is also an allosteric effector of argr
