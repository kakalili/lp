crystal structure analysis and solution studies of human lck sh  zinc induced homodimerization competes with the binding of proline rich motifs
in cytosolic src type tyrosine kinases the src type homology  sh  domain binds to an internal proline rich motif and the presence or the absence of this interaction modulates the kinase enzymatic activity the src type kinase lck plays an important role during t cell activation and development since it phosphorylates the t cell antigen receptor in an early step of the activation pathway we have determined the crystal structure of the sh domain from lck kinase at a near atomic resolution of     unexpectedly the lck sh domain forms a symmetrical homodimer in the crystal and the dimer comprises two identical zinc binding sites in the interface the atomic interactions formed across the dimer interface resemble strikingly those observed between sh domains and their canonical proline rich ligands since almost identical residues participate in both contacts ultracentrifugation experiments confirm that in the presence of zinc ions the lck sh domain also forms dimers in solution the zn  dissociation constant from the lck sh dimer is estimated to be lower than   nm moreover upon addition of a proline rich peptide with a sequence corresponding to the recognition segment of the herpesviral regulatory protein tip competition between zinc induced homodimerization and binding of the peptide can be detected by both fluorescence spectroscopy and analytical ultracentrifugation these results suggest that in vivo too competition between lck sh homodimerization and binding of regulatory proline rich sequence motifs possibly represents a novel mechanism by which kinase activity is modulated because the residues that form the zinc binding site are highly conserved among lck orthologues but not in other src type kinases the mechanism might be peculiar to lck and to its role in the initial steps of t cell activation
