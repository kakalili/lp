atpase cycle of an archaeal chaperonin edited by c r matthews
recent structural data imply differences in allosteric behavior of the group i chaperonins typified by groel from escherichia coli and the group ii chaperonins which comprise archaeal thermosome and eukaryotic tric cct therefore this study addresses the mechanism of interaction of adenine nucleotides with recombinant  only and native   thermosomes from thermoplasma acidophilum which also enables us to analyze the role of the heterooligomeric composition of the natural thermosome although all subunits of the  only thermosome seem to bind nucleotides tightly and independently the native chaperonin has two different classes of atp binding sites furthermore for the  only thermosome the steady state atpase rate is determined by the cleavage reaction itself whereas for the   thermosome the rate limiting step is associated with a post hydrolysis isomerisation into a non covalent adp  pi species prior to the release of the  phosphate group after half saturation with atp a negative cooperativity in hydrolysis is observed for both thermosomes the effect of mg  and k nucleotide cycling is documented we conclude that archaeal chaperonins have unique allosteric properties and discuss them in the light of the mechanism established for the group i chaperonins
