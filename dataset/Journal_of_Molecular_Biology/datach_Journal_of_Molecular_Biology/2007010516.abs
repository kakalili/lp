how different are structurally flexible and rigid binding sites sequence and structural features discriminating proteins that do and do not undergo conformational change upon ligand binding
proteins are dynamic molecules and often undergo conformational change upon ligand binding it is widely accepted that flexible loop regions have a critical functional role in enzymes lack of consideration of binding site flexibility has led to failures in predicting protein functions and in successfully docking ligands with protein receptors here we address the question which sequence and structural features distinguish the structurally flexible and rigid binding sites we analyze high resolution crystal structures of ligand bound holo and free apo forms of  proteins where no conformational change takes place upon ligand binding   examples with moderate conformational change and  cases where a large conformational change has been observed we find that the number of residue  residue contacts observed per residue contact density does not distinguish flexible and rigid binding sites suggesting a role for specific interactions and amino acids in modulating the conformational changes examination of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions reveals that cases that do not undergo conformational change have high polar interactions constituting the binding pockets intriguingly the large aromatic amino acid tryptophan has a high propensity to occur at the binding sites of examples where a large conformational change has been noted further in large conformational change examples hydrophobic  hydrophobic aromatic  aromatic and hydrophobic  polar residue pair interactions are dominant further analysis of the ramachandran dihedral angles     reveals that the residues adopting disallowed conformations are found in both rigid and flexible cases more importantly the binding site residues adopting disallowed conformations clustered narrowly into two specific regions of the l ala ramachandran map examination of the dihedral angles changes upon ligand binding shows that the magnitude of    changes are in general minimal although some large changes particularly between right handed  helical and extended conformations are seen our work further provides an account of conformational changes in the dihedral angles space the findings reported here are expected to assist in providing a framework for predicting protein  ligand complexes and for template based prediction of protein function
