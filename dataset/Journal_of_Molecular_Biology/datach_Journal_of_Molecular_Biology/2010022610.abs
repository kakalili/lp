accessory  helix of complexin i can displace vamp locally in the complexin  snare quaternary complex
the calcium triggered neurotransmitter release requires three snare soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor proteins synaptobrevin  or vesicle associated membrane protein  on the synaptic vesicle and syntaxin  and snap   synaptosome associated protein of   kda at the presynaptic plasma membrane this minimal fusion machinery is believed to drive fusion of the vesicle to the presynaptic membrane complexin also known as synaphin is a neuronal cytosolic protein that acts as a major regulator of synaptic vesicle exocytosis stimulatory and inhibitory effects of complexin have both been reported suggesting the duality of its function to shed light on the molecular basis of the complexin s dual function we have performed an epr investigation of the complexin  snare quaternary complex we found that the accessory  helix amino acids     by itself has the capacity to replace the c terminus of the snare motif of vesicle associated membrane protein  in the four helix bundle and makes the snare complex weaker when the n terminal region of complexin i amino acids     is removed however the accessory  helix remains detached from the snare core when the n terminal region of complexin i is present thus our data show the possibility that the balance between the activities of the accessory  helix and the n terminal domain might determine the final outcome of the complexin function either stimulatory or inhibitory
