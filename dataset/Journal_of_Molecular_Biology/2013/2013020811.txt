Hsp70s are molecular chaperones involved in the folding and assembly of proteins. They recognize hydrophobic amino acid stretches in their substrate binding groove. However, a detailed understanding of substrate specificity is still missing. Here, we use the endoplasmic reticulum-resident Hsp70 BiP to identify binding sites in a natural client protein. Two sites are mutually recognized and form stable Hsp70â€“substrate complexes. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed an extended substrate conformation as a crucial factor for interaction and show an unexpected plasticity of the substrate binding groove. The basic binding mechanism is conserved among different Hsp70s.
