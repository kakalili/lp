structural biochemical and in vivo characterization of the first virally encoded cyclophilin from the mimivirus
although multiple viruses utilize host cell cyclophilins including severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   their role in infection is poorly understood to help elucidate these roles we have characterized the first virally encoded cyclophilin mimicyp derived from the largest virus discovered to date the mimivirus that is also a causative agent of pneumonia in humans mimicyp adopts a typical cyclophilin fold yet it also forms trimers unlike any previously characterized homologue strikingly immunofluorescence assays reveal that mimicyp localizes to the surface of the mature virion as recently proposed for several viruses that recruit host cell cyclophilins such as sars and hiv  additionally mimicyp lacks peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity in contrast to human cyclophilins thus this study suggests that cyclophilins whether recruited from host cells i e hiv  and sars or virally encoded i e mimivirus  are localized on viral surfaces for at least a subset of viruses
