ebola virus matrix protein vp  interaction with human cellular factors tsg  and nedd
the ebola virus matrix protein vp  is a major viral structural protein and plays a central role in virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane of infected cells for efficient budding a full amino terminus of vp  is required which includes a ppxy and a pt sap motif both of which have been proposed to interact with cellular proteins here we report that ebola vp  can interact with cellular factors human nedd and tsg  in vitro we show that ww domain  of human nedd is necessary and sufficient for binding to the ppxy motif of vp  which requires an oligomeric conformation of vp  single particle electron microscopy reconstructions indicate that ww of nedd is in close contact with the n terminal domain of hexameric vp  in contrast the ubiquitin enzyme variant domain of tsg  was sufficient for binding to the pt sap motif of vp  regardless of the oligomeric state of the matrix protein these results suggest that hnedd and tsg  may play complimentary roles at a late stage of the assembly process by recruiting cellular factors of two independent pathways to the site of budding at the plasma membrane
