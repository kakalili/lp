np sticky a web server for optimizing dna ligation with non palindromic sticky ends
high efficiency dna ligation is vital for many molecular biology experiments and it is best achieved using reactants with non palindromic sticky ends to maximize specificity however optimizing such multi parametric ligation reactions often involves extensive trial and error we have developed a freely available web based ligation calculator np sticky http  sarkarlab umn edu npsticky  that predicts product distribution for given reactant concentrations thus enabling straightforward computational optimization of these reactions built in schemes include two piece and three piece linear ligation as well as insert vector circular ligation the only parameters needed for the underlying thermodynamic model are the free energies of ligation for each sticky end which can be estimated by the calculator from the overhang sequences or provided by the user from direct experimental measurement free energies of sticky end mismatches are also calculated for determining the extent of byproduct formation this ligation calculator allows rapid identification of the optimal conditions for maximizing incorporation efficiency and or accuracy based on specific needs
