an atpase deficient variant of the snf family member hells shows altered dynamics at pericentromeric heterochromatin
the hells helicase lymphoid specific also known as lymphoid specific helicase protein is related to the snf  sucrose non fermentable  family of chromatin remodeling atpases it is required for efficient dna methylation in mammals particularly at heterochromatin located repetitive sequences in this study we investigated the interaction of hells with chromatin and used an atpase deficient hells variant to address the role of atp hydrolysis in this process chromatin fractionation experiments demonstrated that in the absence of the atpase activity hells is retained at the nuclear matrix compartment defined in part by lamin b  microscopy studies revealed a stronger association of the atpase deficient mutant with heterochromatin these results were further supported by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements which showed that at heterochromatic sites wild type hells is very dynamic with a recovery half time of  s and a mobile protein fraction of   in contrast the atpase deficient mutant displayed   s recovery half time and a reduction in the mobile fraction to   we also present evidence suggesting that in addition to the atpase activity a functional h k me signaling pathway contributes to an efficient release of hells from pericentromeric chromatin overall our results show that a functional atpase activity is not required for the recruitment of hells to heterochromatin but it is important for the release of the enzyme from these sites
