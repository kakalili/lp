the crystal structure of the nife hydrogenase from the photosynthetic bacterium allochromatium vinosum characterization of the oxidized enzyme ni a state
the crystal structure of the membrane associated nife hydrogenase from allochromatium vinosum has been determined to     resolution electron paramagnetic resonance epr and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on dissolved crystals showed that it is present in the ni a state  gt    the structure of the a vinosum nife hydrogenase shows significant similarities with nife hydrogenase structures derived from desulfovibrio species the amino acid sequence identity is     the bimetallic nife active site is located in the large subunit of the heterodimer and possesses three diatomic non protein ligands coordinated to the fe two cn   one co  ni is bound to the protein backbone via four cysteine thiolates two of them also bridge the two metals one of the bridging cysteines cys  exhibits a modified thiolate in part of the sample a mono oxo bridging ligand was assigned between the metal ions of the catalytic center this is in contrast to a proposal for desulfovibrio sp hydrogenases that show a di oxo species in this position for the ni a state the additional metal site located in the large subunit appears to be a mg  ion three iron  sulfur clusters were found in the small subunit that forms the electron transfer chain connecting the catalytic site with the molecular surface the calculated anomalous fourier map indicates a distorted proximal iron  sulfur cluster in part of the crystals this altered proximal cluster is supposed to be paramagnetic and is exchange coupled to the ni  ion and the medial fe s  cluster that are both epr active s   species  this finding of a modified proximal cluster in the nife hydrogenase might explain the observation of split epr signals that are occasionally detected in the oxidized state of membrane bound nife hydrogenases as from a vinosum
