energetics stability and prediction of transmembrane helices edited by g von heijne
we show that the peptide backbone of an  helix places a severe thermodynamic constraint on transmembrane tm stability neglect of this constraint by commonly used hydrophobicity scales underlies the notorious uncertainty of tm helix prediction by sliding window hydropathy plots of membrane protein mp amino acid sequences we find that an experiment based whole residue hydropathy scale ww scale  which includes the backbone constraint identifies tm helices of membrane proteins with an accuracy greater than    furthermore it correctly predicts the minimum hydrophobicity required for stable single helix tm insertion observed in escherichia coli in order to improve membrane protein topology prediction further we introduce the augmented ww aww scale which accounts for the energetics of salt bridge formation an important issue for genomic analysis is the ability of the hydropathy plot method to distinguish membrane from soluble proteins we find that the method falsely predicts  to   of a set of soluble proteins to be mps depending upon the hydropathy scale used
