crystal structure of  galactosidase from lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm insight into tetramer formation and substrate binding
lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is a probiotic bacterium known for its beneficial effects on human health the importance of  galactosidases   gals for growth of probiotic organisms on oligosaccharides of the raffinose family present in many foods is increasingly recognized here the crystal structure of  gal from l acidophilus ncfm lamel a of glycoside hydrolase gh family   gh  is determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion in addition a     resolution crystallographic complex with  d galactose at substrate binding subsite   was determined lamel a has a large n terminal twisted  sandwich domain connected by a long  helix to the catalytic     barrel domain and a c terminal  sheet domain four identical monomers form a tightly packed tetramer where three monomers contribute to the structural integrity of the active site in each monomer structural comparison of lamel a with the monomeric thermotoga maritima  gal tmgal a reveals that o of  d galactose in lamel a interacts with a backbone nitrogen in a glycine rich loop of the catalytic domain whereas the corresponding atom in tmgal a is from a tryptophan side chain belonging to the n terminal domain thus two distinctly different structural motifs participate in substrate recognition the tetrameric lamel a furthermore has a much deeper active site than the monomeric tmgal a which possibly modulates substrate specificity sequence analysis of gh  inspired by the observed structural differences results in four distinct subgroups having clearly different active site sequence motifs this novel subdivision incorporates functional and architectural features and may aid further biochemical and structural analyses within gh
