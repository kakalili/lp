sequence dependent dna flexibility mediates dnase i cleavage
understanding the preference of nonspecific proteins for certain dna structural features requires an accurate description of the properties of free dna especially regarding their possible predisposition to adopt a conformation that favors the formation of a complex exploiting previous exhaustive nmr studies performed on free dna oligomers we investigated the molecular basis of dnase i sensitivity under conditions where dnase i binding limits the probability of cleavage we showed that cleavage intensity was correlated with adjacent   phosphate linkage flexibility monitored by  p chemical shifts examining nmr refined dna structures highlighted that sequence dependent flexible phosphates were associated with large minor groove variations that may promote the affinity of dnase i according to relevant dna  protein complexes in sum this work demonstrates that specificity in dna  dnase i interaction is mediated by dna flexibility which influences the induced fit transitions required to form productive complexes
