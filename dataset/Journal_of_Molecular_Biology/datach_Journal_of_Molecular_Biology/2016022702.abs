synthetic biology  toward therapeutic solutions
higher multicellular organisms have evolved sophisticated intracellular and intercellular biological networks that enable cell growth and survival to fulfill an organism s needs although such networks allow the assembly of complex tissues and even provide healing and protective capabilities malfunctioning cells can have severe consequences for an organism s survival in humans such events can result in severe disorders and diseases including metabolic and immunological disorders as well as cancer dominating the therapeutic frontier for these potentially lethal disorders cell and gene therapies aim to relieve or eliminate patient suffering by restoring the function of damaged diseased and aging cells and tissues via the introduction of healthy cells or alternative genes however despite recent success these efforts have yet to achieve sufficient therapeutic effects and further work is needed to ensure the safe and precise control of transgene expression and cellular processes in this review we describe the biological tools and devices that are at the forefront of synthetic biology and discuss their potential to advance the specificity efficiency and safety of the current generation of cell and gene therapies including how they can be used to confer curative effects that far surpass those of conventional therapeutics we also highlight the current therapeutic delivery tools and the current limitations that hamper their use in human applications
