Homer proteins bind specifically to the C termini of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1α/a and mGluR5, play a role in their targeting and modulate their synaptic properties. We have discovered that extensive alternative splicing generates a family of 17 Homer proteins. These fall into two distinct groups of 12 “long” Homers, which all have a coiled-coil domain at their C termini, and five “short” Homers, which lack such a domain. All Homers contain the N-terminal sequence responsible for their binding to mGluR1α/a receptors and can be co-localised with the recombinantly expressed mGluR1α/a protein in HEK-293 cells. The existence of the long and the short variants of each of the Homer-1, Homer-2 and Homer-3 proteins reflects the fundamental principles of Homer functions.
