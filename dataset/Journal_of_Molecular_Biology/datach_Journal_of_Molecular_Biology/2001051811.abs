calculation of ensembles of structures representing the unfolded state of an sh domain edited by p e wright
the n terminal sh domain of drk drkn sh domain exists in equilibrium between a folded fexch and an unfolded uexch form under non denaturing conditions in order to further our previous descriptions of the uexch state we have developed a protocol for calculating ensembles of structures based on experimental spectroscopic data which broadly represent the unfolded state a large number of unfolding trajectories were generated starting from the folded state structure of the protein in order to provide a reasonable sampling of the conformational space accessible to this sequence unfolded state ensembles have been  calculated  using a newly developed program ensemble which optimizes the population weights assigned to each structure based on experimental properties of the uexch state pseudo energy terms for nuclear overhauser effects j coupling constants  c chemical shifts translational diffusion coefficients and tryptophan ring burial based on nmr and fluorescence data have been implemented the population weight assignment procedure was performed for different starting ensembles small numbers of structures  lt   dominate the final ensembles compared to the total number in the starting ensembles suggesting that the drkn sh domain uexch state can be described by a limited number of lower energy conformations the calculated uexch state ensembles are much more compact than a  random coil  chain with significant native like residual structure observed in particular a sizable population of conformers having the n src loop and distal  hairpin structures exist in the calculated uexch state ensembles and trp  is involved in a large number of interactions both native and non native
