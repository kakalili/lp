translation driven by picornavirus ires is hampered from sindbis virus replicons rescue by poliovirus a protease
alphavirus replicons are very useful for analyzing different aspects of viral molecular biology they are also useful tools in the development of new vaccines and highly efficient expression of heterologous genes we have investigated the translatability of sindbis virus sv subgenomic mrna bearing different   untranslated regions including several viral internal ribosome entry sites iress from picornaviruses hepatitis c virus and cricket paralysis virus our findings indicate that all these ires containing mrnas are initially translated in culture cells transfected with the corresponding sv replicon but their translation is inhibited in the late phase of sv replication notably co expression of different poliovirus pv non structural genes reveals that the protease a  apro is able to increase translation of subgenomic mrnas containing the pv or encephalomyocarditis virus iress but not of those of hepatitis c virus or cricket paralysis virus a pv apro variant deficient in eukaryotic initiation factor eif  gi cleavage or pv protease c neither of which cleaves eif gi does not increase picornavirus ires driven translation whereas l protease from foot and mouth disease virus also rescues translation these findings suggest that the replicative foci of sv infected cells where translation takes place are deficient in components necessary to translate ires containing mrnas in the case of picornavirus iress cleavage of eif gi accomplished by pv apro or foot and mouth disease virus protease l rescues this inhibition eif gi co localizes with ribosomes both in cells electroporated with sv replicons bearing the picornavirus ires and in cells co electroporated with replicons that express pv apro these findings support the idea that eif gi cleavage is necessary to rescue the translation driven by picornavirus iress in baby hamster kidney cells that express sv replicons
