the osaka fad mutation e   leads to the formation of a previously unknown type of amyloid  fibrils and modulates a  neurotoxicity
alzheimer s disease ad is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebral deposition of amyloid fibrils formed by the amyloid   a  peptide a  has a length of     amino acid residues the predominant a  isoforms are a     and a     while the majority of ad cases occur spontaneously a subset of early onset familial ad cases is caused by mutations in the genes encoding the a  precursor protein or presenilin  presenilin  recently a deletion of glutamic acid at position  within the a  sequence e   was identified in japanese patients with familial dementia but the aggregation properties of the deletion variant of a  are not well understood we investigated the aggregation characteristics and neurotoxicity of recombinantly expressed a  isoforms    and    with and without the e   mutation we show that the e   mutation strongly accelerates the fibril formation of a     e   compared to a     wild type wt  in addition we demonstrate that fibrils of a     e   form a unique quaternary structure characterized by a strong tendency to form fibrillar bundles and a strongly increased thioflavin t binding capacity a     e   was neurotoxic in rat primary neuron cultures as compared to nontoxic a     wt a     e   was less toxic than a     wt but it significantly decreased neurite outgrowth per cell in neuronal primary cultures because a     is the major a  form in vivo the gain of toxic function caused by the e  deletion may explain the development of familial ad in mutation carriers
