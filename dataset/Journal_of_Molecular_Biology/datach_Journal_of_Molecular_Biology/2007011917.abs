disulfide bridges in the mesophilic triosephosphate isomerase from giardia lamblia are related to oligomerization and activity
triosephosphate isomerase from the mesophile giardia lamblia gltim is the only known tim with natural disulfide bridges we previously found that oxidized and reduced thiol states of gltim are involved in the interconversion between native dimers and higher oligomeric species and in the regulation of enzymatic activity here we found that trophozoites and cysts have different oligomeric species of gltim and complexes of gltim with other proteins our data indicate that the internal milieu of g lamblia is favorable for the formation of disulfide bonds enzyme mutants of the three most solvent exposed cys of gltim c  a c  a and c  a were prepared to ascertain their contribution to oligomerization and activity the data show that the establishment of a disulfide bridge between two c  of two dimeric gltims accounts for multimerization in addition we found that the establishment of an intramonomeric disulfide bond between c  and c  abolishes catalysis multimerization and inactivation are both reversed by reducing conditions the d structure of the c  a gltim was solved at     resolution showing that the environment of the c  is prone to hydrophobic interactions molecular dynamics of an in silico model of gltim when the intramonomeric disulfide bond is formed showed that s  is displaced     from its original position causing loss of hydrogen bonds with residues of the active site loop this suggests that this change perturb the conformational state that aligns the catalytic center with the substrate inducing enzyme inactivation
