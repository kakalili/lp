stepwise dissection of the hin catalyzed recombination reaction from synapsis to resolution
the hin dna invertase promotes a site specific dna recombination reaction in the salmonella chromosome the native hin reaction exhibits overwhelming selectivity for promoting inversions between appropriately oriented recombination sites and requires the fis regulatory protein a recombinational enhancer and a supercoiled dna substrate here we report a robust recombination reaction employing oligonucleotide substrates and a hyperactive mutant form of hin synaptic complex intermediates purified by gel electrophoresis were found to contain four hin protomers bound to two recombination sites each hin protomer is associated covalently with a cleaved dna end the cleaved complexes can be ligated into both parental and recombinant orientations at equivalent frequencies provided the core residues can base pair and are readily disassembled into separated dna fragments bound by hin dimers kinetic analyses reveal that synapsis occurs rapidly followed by comparatively slow hin catalyzed dna cleavage subsequent steps of the reaction including dna exchange and ligation are fast thus post synaptic step s required for dna cleavage limit the overall rate of the recombination reaction
