structure of the haemagglutinin neuraminidase from human parainfluenza virus type iii
the three dimensional structure of the haemagglutinin neuraminidase hn from a human parainfluenza virus is described at ca    resolution both in native form and in complex with three substrate analogues in support of earlier work on the structure of the homologous protein from the avian pathogen newcastle disease virus ndv  we observe a dimer of  propellers and find no evidence for spatially separated sites performing the receptor binding and neuraminidase functions of the protein as with the ndv hn the active site of the hn of parainfluenza viruses is structurally flexible suggesting that it may be able to switch between a receptor binding state and a catalytic state however in contrast to the ndv structures we observe no ligand induced structural changes that extend beyond the active site and modify the dimer interface
