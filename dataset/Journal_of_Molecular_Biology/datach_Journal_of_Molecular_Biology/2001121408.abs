crystal structure of the n terminal domain of oxytricha nova telomere end binding protein  subunit both uncomplexed and complexed with telomeric ssdna edited by k morikawa
oxytricha nova telomere end binding protein specifically recognizes and caps single strand t g n telomeric dna at the very   ends of o nova macronuclear chromosomes proteins homologous to the n terminal domain of ontebp  subunit have now been identified in oxytricha trifallax stylonychia mytilis euplotes crassus schizosaccharomyces pombe and homo sapiens suggesting that this protein is widely distributed in eukaryotes we describe here the crystal structures of the n terminal single stranded dna ssdna binding domain of o nova telomere end binding protein  subunit both uncomplexed and complexed with single strand telomeric dna these structures show how the n terminal domain of  alone in the absence of the  subunit and without  dimerization can bind single stranded telomeric dna in a sequence specific and   end specific manner furthermore comparison of the uncomplexed and complexed forms of this protein shows that the ssdna binding site is largely pre organized in the absence of ssdna with modest but interesting rearrangements of amino acid side chains that compose the ssdna binding site the structures described here extend our understanding of structures of o nova telomeric complexes by adding uncomplexed and complexed forms of monomeric  to previously described structures for    ssdna  dimer and      ssdna ternary complexes we believe that each of these four structures represent intermediates in an ordered assembly disassembly pathway for o nova telomeric complexes
