probing the equilibrium denaturation of the serpin   antitrypsin with single tryptophan mutants evidence for structure in the urea unfolded state edited by c r matthews
the native conformation of proteins in the serpin superfamily is metastable in order to understand why serpins attain the native state instead of more stable conformations we have begun investigations into the equilibrium unfolding of   antitrypsin   antitrypsin contains two tryptophan residues trp  and trp   situated on the a and b  sheets respectively site directed mutagenesis was used to construct two single tryptophan variants both variants were fully active and had similar secondary structure and stabilities to   antitrypsin the denaturation of   antitrypsin and its variants was extremely similar when followed by far uv cd indicating the presence of a single intermediate fluorescence analysis of the unfolding behavior of each single tryptophan variant indicated that the sole tryptophan residue reported the structural changes within its immediate environment these data suggest that the a  sheet is expanded in the intermediate state whilst no structural change around the b  sheet has occurred in the urea induced unfolded state trp  does not become fully solvated suggesting the persistence of structure around this residue the implications of these data on the folding misfolding and function of the serpin superfamily are discussed
