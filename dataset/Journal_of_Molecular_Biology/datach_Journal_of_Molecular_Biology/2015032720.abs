elucidating the mechanism by which compensatory mutations rescue an hiv  matrix mutant defective for gag membrane targeting and envelope glycoprotein incorporation
the matrix ma domain of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv  gag is responsible for gag targeting to the plasma membrane where virions assemble ma also plays a role in the incorporation of the viral envelope env glycoproteins and can influence particle infectivity post maturation and post entry a highly basic region of ma targets gag to the plasma membrane via specific binding to phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate pi   p  this binding also triggers exposure of an amino terminal myristate moiety which anchors gag to the membrane an ma mutant deficient for pi   p binding  ke  ke has been shown to mislocalize within the cell leading to particle assembly in a multivesicular body compartment and defective release of cell free particles in hela and  t cells despite the defect in virus production in these cells release of the  ke  ke mutant is not significantly reduced in primary t cells macrophages and jurkat t cells  ke  ke virions also display an infectivity defect associated with impaired env incorporation irrespective of the producer cell line here we examine the properties of  ke  ke by analyzing compensatory mutations obtained by a viral adaptation strategy the ma mutant  ek restores virus release through enhanced membrane binding  ek also influences the infectivity defect in combination with an additional ma mutant  qr additionally the  ke  ke ma mutant displays a defect in proteolytic cleavage of the murine leukemia virus env cytoplasmic tail in pseudotyped virions our findings elucidate the mechanism whereby an ma mutant defective in pi   p binding can be rescued and highlight the ability of ma to influence env glycoprotein function
