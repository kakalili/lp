plasticity of the gene functions for dna replication in the t like phages
we have completely sequenced and annotated the genomes of several relatives of the bacteriophage t  including three coliphages rb  rb  and rb   three aeromonas salmonicida phages  rr  t   and   and one aeromonas hydrophila phage aeh  in addition we have partially sequenced and annotated the t like genomes of coliphage rb  a close relative of rb   a salmonicida phage   acinetobacter johnsonii phage   and vibrio natriegens phage nt  each of these phage genomes exhibited a unique sequence that distinguished it from its relatives although there were examples of genomes that are very similar to each other as a group the phages compared here diverge from one another by several criteria including a host range  b genome size in the range between     kb and     kb  c content and genetic organization of their t like genes for dna metabolism  d mutational drift of the predicted t like gene products and their regulatory sites and e content of open reading frames that have no counterparts in t or other known organisms novel orfs  we have observed a number of dna rearrangements of the t genome type some exhibiting proximity to putative homing endonuclease genes also we cite and discuss examples of sequence divergence in the predicted sites for protein  protein and protein  nucleic acid interactions of homologues of the t dna replication proteins with emphasis on the diversity in sequence molecular form and regulation of the phage encoded dna polymerase gp  five of the sequenced phage genomes are predicted to encode split forms of this polymerase our studies suggest that the modular construction and plasticity of the t genome type and several of its replication proteins may offer resilience to mutation including dna rearrangements and facilitate the adaptation of t like phages to different bacterial hosts in nature
