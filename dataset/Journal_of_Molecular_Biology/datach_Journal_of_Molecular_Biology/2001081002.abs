structure and mechanism of the ruvb holliday junction branch migration motor edited by t richmond
the ruvb hexamer is the chemomechanical motor of the ruvab complex that migrates holliday junction branch points in dna recombination and the rescue of stalled dna replication forks the    crystal structure of thermotoga maritima ruvb together with five mutant structures reveal that ruvb is an atpase associated with diverse cellular activities aaa class atpase with a winged helix dna binding domain the ruvb adp complex structure and mutagenesis suggest how aaa class atpases couple nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to interdomain conformational changes and asymmetry within the ruvb hexamer implied by the crystallographic packing and small angle x ray scattering in solution atp driven domain motion is positioned to move double stranded dna through the hexamer and drive conformational changes between subunits by altering the complementary hydrophilic protein protein interfaces structural and biochemical analysis of five motifs in the protein suggest that atp binding is a strained conformation recognized both by sensors and the walker motifs and that intersubunit activation occurs by an arginine finger motif reminiscent of the gtpase activating proteins taken together these results provide insights into how ruvb functions as a motor for branch migration of holliday junctions
