crystal structure of the  subunit of human translation initiation factor b
eukaryotic translation initiation factor b eif b is the heteropentameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor specific for eukaryotic initiation factor  eif  under stressed conditions guanine nucleotide exchange is strongly inhibited by the tight binding of phosphorylated eif to eif b here we report the crystal structure of the  subunit of human eif b at     resolution the eif b  structure consists of the n terminal  helical domain and the c terminal rossmann fold like domain a positively charged pocket whose entrance is about       in diameter resides at the boundary between the two domains a sulfate ion is located at the bottom of the pocket about    in depth  the residues comprising the sulfate ion binding site are strictly conserved in eif b  since this deep wide pocket with the sulfate ion binding site is not conserved in distant homologues including  methylthioribose  phosphate isomerases these characteristics may be distinctive of eif b  interestingly the yeast eif b  missense mutations that reduce the eif b sensitivity to phosphorylated eif are mapped on the other side of the pocket one of the three human eif b  missense mutations that induce the lethal brain disorder vanishing white matter or childhood ataxia with central nervous system hypomyelination is mapped inside the pocket the  and  subunits of eif b are homologous to eif b  and may have tertiary structures similar to the present eif b  structure the sulfate ion binding residues of eif b  are well conserved in eif b    the abovementioned yeast and human missense mutations of eif b   were also mapped on the eif b  structure which revealed that the human mutations are clustered on the same side as the pocket while the yeast mutations reside on the opposite side as most of the mutated residues are exposed on the surface of the eif b subunit structure these exposed residues are likely to be involved in either the subunit interactions or the interaction with eif
