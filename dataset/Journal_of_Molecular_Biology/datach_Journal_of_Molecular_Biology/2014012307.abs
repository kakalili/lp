structure of a prokaryotic sodium channel pore reveals essential gating elements and an outer ion binding site common to eukaryotic channels
voltage gated sodium channels navs are central elements of cellular excitation notwithstanding advances from recent bacterial nav bacnav structures key questions about gating and ion selectivity remain here we present a closed conformation of navae p a pore only bacnav derived from navae  a bacnav from the arsenite oxidizer alkalilimnicola ehrlichei found in mono lake california that provides insight into both fundamental properties the structure reveals a pore domain in which the pore lining s helix connects to a helical cytoplasmic tail electrophysiological studies of full length bacnavs show that two elements defined by the navae p structure an s activation gate position and the cytoplasmic tail  neck   are central to bacnav gating the structure also reveals the selectivity filter ion entry site termed the  outer ion  site comparison with mammalian voltage gated calcium channel cav selectivity filters together with functional studies shows that this site forms a previously unknown determinant of cav high affinity calcium binding our findings underscore commonalities between bacnavs and eukaryotic voltage gated channels and provide a framework for understanding gating and ion permeation in this superfamily
