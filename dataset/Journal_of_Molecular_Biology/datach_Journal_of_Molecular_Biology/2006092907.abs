translation initiation factor if interacts with the  s ribosomal subunit via two separate binding sites
the functional properties of the two natural forms of escherichia coli translation initiation factor if  if  and if   and of an n terminal deletion mutant of the factor if  n lacking the first   residues corresponding to the entire n terminal domain were analysed comparatively the results revealed that if  and if  display almost indistinguishable properties whereas if  n although fully active in all steps of the translation initiation pathway displays functional activities having properties and requirements distinctly different from those of the intact molecule indeed binding of if  n to the  s subunit if  n dependent stimulation of fmet trna binding to the ribosome and of initiation dipeptide formation strongly depend upon the presence of if and gtp unlike with if  and if   the present results indicate that using two separate active sites if establishes two interactions with the  s ribosomal subunit which have different properties and functions the first site located in the n domain of if  is responsible for a high affinity interaction which  anchors  the factor to the subunit while the second site mainly located in the  barrel module homologous to domain ii of ef g and ef tu is responsible for the functional   core   interaction of if leading to the decoding of fmet trna in the  s subunit p site the first interaction is functionally dispensable sensitive to ionic strength variations and essentially insensitive to the nature of the guanosine nucleotide ligand and to the presence of if  unlike the second interaction which strongly depends upon the presence of if and gtp
