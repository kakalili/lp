constrained simulations of protein folding transition states implications for calculating
analysis has been used to identify interresidue contacts in the transition state ensemble tse of ubiquitin and other proteins the magnitude of  depends on the degree to which an inserted bihistidine bihis metal ion binding site is formed in the tse a  equal to zero or one indicates that the bihis site is absent or fully native like respectively while a fractional  implies that in the tse the bihis site recovers only part of the binding induced stabilization of the native state all atom langevin dynamics simulations of the tse are performed with restrictions imposed only on the distances between the pairs of residues with experimentally determined  of unity when a site with a fractional  lies adjacent to a site with    the fractional  generally signifies that the  fractional site  has a distorted geometry in the tse when a fractional site is distal to the sites with    however the histidines sample configurations in which the site is absent the simulations indicate that the   sites by themselves can be used to generate a well defined tse having near native topology   values calculated from the ts simulations exhibit mixed agreement with the experimental values the origin and implication of the disparities are discussed
