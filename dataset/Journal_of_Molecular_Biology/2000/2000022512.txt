For the therapeutic application of catalytic nucleic acids it is desirable to have small, stable and inexpensive compounds that are active at physiological Mg2+ concentrations. We have explored the possibility of using the versatile 10–23 DNA catalytic core to suppress the expression of the protein kinase Cα (PKCα) isoform in malignant cells. By introducing either a 3′-3′-inverted thymidine nucleotide or site-specific phosphorothioate modification into a PKCα DNA enzyme, we have designed stable catalysts that retained a significant in vitro cleavage activity. In particular, a DNA enzyme containing phosphorothioate analogues in the antisense arms and in the pyrimidine residues of the catalytic core was found to be remarkably stable in 50 % human serum (t1/2 &gt; 90 hours) and inhibited in vitro cell growth by up to 90 % at nanomolar concentrations. The inhibition of PKCα gene expression is sequence-specific, as a DNA enzyme with reversed antisense arms was found to be ineffective. Epifluorescence microscopic analysis of cells transfected with a 5′ fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated DNA enzyme showed that the DNA enzyme molecules are mainly localised in the nuclei. Most of the DNA enzyme-treated cells were killed by apoptosis. The ability of the described PKCα DNA enzymes to trigger apoptosis (apoptozymes) in malignant cells illustrates their therapeutic potential. Furthermore, such agents can be a valuable tool for probing gene function.
