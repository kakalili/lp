real time nmr kinetic studies provide global and residue specific information on the non cooperative unfolding of the  trefoil protein interleukin
the interleukin   il   structural motif is a  trefoil super fold created by six two stranded  hairpins turns are thus particularly important in creating the topology and the arrangement of  strands in this structural motif in contrast to the signals observed in optical studies real time nmr kinetic investigations of the denaturant induced unfolding of interleukin   provide direct global and residue specific information on the structural nature of the unfolding reaction heterogeneity in the individual amino acid residue kinetics reveals a rugged unfolding landscape the relative kinetic stability of native like turns supports low temperature molecular dynamics predictions of turn controlled unfolding
