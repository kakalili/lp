engineering strand specific dna nicking enzymes from the type iis restriction endonucleases bsai bsmbi and bsmai
more than  type iia iis restriction endonucleases with different recognition specificities are now known in contrast only a limited number of strand specific nicking endonucleases are currently available to overcome this limitation a novel genetic screening method was devised to convert type iis restriction endonucleases into strand specific nicking endonucleases the genetic screen consisted of four steps   random mutagenesis to create a plasmid library each bearing an inactivated endonuclease gene   restriction digestion of plasmids containing the wild type and the mutagenized endonuclease gene   back crosses with the wild type gene by ligation to the wild type n terminal or c terminal fragment   transformation of the ligated dna into a pre modified host and screening for nicking endonuclease activity in total cell culture or cell extracts of the transformants nt bsai and nb bsai nicking endonucleases were isolated from bsai using this genetic screen in addition site directed mutagenesis was carried out to isolate bsai nicking variants with minimal double stranded dna cleavage activity the equivalent amino acid substitutions were introduced into bsmbi and bsmai restriction endonucleases with similar recognition sequence and significant amino acid sequence identity and their nicking variants were successfully isolated this work provides strong evidence that some type iis restriction endonucleases carry two separate active sites when one of the active sites is inactivated the type iis restriction endonuclease may nick only one strand
