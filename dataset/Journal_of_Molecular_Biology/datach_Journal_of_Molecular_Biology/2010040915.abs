a single domain llama antibody potently inhibits the enzymatic activity of botulinum neurotoxin by binding to the non catalytic  exosite binding region
ingestion or inhalation of botulinum neurotoxin bont results in botulism a severe and frequently fatal disease current treatments rely on antitoxins which while effective cannot reverse symptoms once bont has entered the neuron for treatments that can reverse intoxication interest has focused on developing inhibitors of the enzymatic bont light chain bont lc  such inhibitors typically mimic substrate and bind in or around the substrate cleavage pocket to explore the full range of binding sites for serotype a light chain bont a lc inhibitors we created a library of non immune llama single domain vhh camelid heavy chain variable region derived from heavy chain only antibody antibodies displayed on the surface of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae library selection on bont a lc yielded  yeast displayed vhh with equilibrium dissociation constants kd from   to    nm measured by flow cytometry eight of  vhh inhibited the cleavage of substrate snap  synaptosome associated protein of     da by bont a lc the most potent vhh aa  had a solution kd for bont a lc of        m and an ic    inhibitory concentration of        m and was resistant to heat denaturation and reducing conditions to understand the mechanism by which aa inhibited catalysis we solved the x ray crystal structure of the bont a lc  aa vhh complex at     resolution the structure reveals that the aa vhh binds in the  exosite of the bont a lc far from the active site for catalysis the study validates the utility of non immune llama vhh libraries as a source of enzyme inhibitors and identifies the bont a lc  exosite as a target for inhibitor development
