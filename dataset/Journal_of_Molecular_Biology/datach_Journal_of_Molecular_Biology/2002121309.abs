structural and functional analysis of the s layer protein crystallisation domain of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc    evidence for protein  protein interaction of two subdomains
the structure of the crystallisation domain san of the sa protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc   was analysed by insertion and deletion mutagenesis and by proteolytic treatment mutant sa protein synthesised in escherichia coli with    amino acid insertions near the n terminus or within regions of sequence variation in san amino acid position            or in the cell wall binding domain position   could form crystalline sheets whereas insertions in conserved regions or in regions with predicted secondary structure elements positions      and   destroyed this capacity facscan analysis of l acidophilus synthesising three crystallising and one non crystallising sa protein c myc   amino acid residues insertion mutant was performed with c myc antibodies fluorescence was most pronounced for insertions at positions   and   less for position  and severely reduced for position  by cytometric flow sorting a transformant harbouring the mutant sa protein gene position   was isolated that showed an increased fluorescense signal immunofluorescence microscopy suggested that the transformant synthesized mutant sa protein only pcr analysis of the transformant grown in the absence of selection pressure indicated that the mutant allele was stably integrated in the chromosome proteolytic treatment of sa protein indicated that only sites near the middle of san are susceptible although potential cleavage sites are present through the entire molecule expression in e coli of dna sequences encoding the two halves of san yielded peptides that could oligomerize our results indicate that san consists of a   kda n and a   kda c terminal subdomain linked by a surface exposed loop the capacity of sa protein of l acidophilus to present epitopes up to    amino acid residues in length at the bacterial surface in a genetically stable form makes the system in principle suitable for application as an oral delivery vehicle
