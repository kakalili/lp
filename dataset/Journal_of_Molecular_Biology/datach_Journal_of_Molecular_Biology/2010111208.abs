crystal structure of an essential enzyme in seed starch degradation barley limit dextrinase in complex with cyclodextrins
barley limit dextrinase hordeum vulgare limit dextrinase hvld  catalyzes the hydrolysis of    glucosidic linkages in limit dextrins this activity plays a role in starch degradation during germination and presumably in starch biosynthesis during grain filling the crystal structures of hvld in complex with the competitive inhibitors  cyclodextrin cd and  cd are solved and refined to     and     respectively and are the first structures of a limit dextrinase hvld belongs to glycoside hydrolase  family and is composed of four domains an immunoglobulin like n terminal eight stranded  sandwich domain a six stranded  sandwich domain belonging to the carbohydrate binding module  family a catalytic     like barrel domain that lacks  helix  and a c terminal eight stranded  sandwich domain of unknown function the cds are bound at the active site occupying carbohydrate binding subsites  and   a glycerol and three water molecules mimic a glucose residue at subsite    thereby identifying residues involved in catalysis the bulky met   a unique residue at its position among    acting enzymes obstructs subsite    the steric hindrance observed is proposed to affect substrate specificity and to cause a low activity of hvld towards amylopectin an extended loop asp  asn   between   and   of the catalytic domain also seems to influence substrate specificity and to give hvld a higher affinity for  cd than pullulanases the crystal structures additionally provide new insight into cation sites and the concerted action of the battery of hydrolytic enzymes in starch degradation
