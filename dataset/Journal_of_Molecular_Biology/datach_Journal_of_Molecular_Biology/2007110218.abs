biochemical and structural characterization of the paralogous benzoate coa ligases from burkholderia xenovorans lb   defining the entry point into the novel benzoate oxidation box pathway
xenobiotic aromatic compounds represent one of the most significant classes of environmental pollutants a novel benzoate oxidation box pathway has been identified recently in burkholderia xenovorans lb   referred to simply as lb   that is capable of assimilating benzoate and intimately tied to the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  the box pathway in lb  is present in two paralogous copies boxm and boxc and encodes eight enzymes with the first committed step catalyzed by benzoate coa ligase bcl  as a first step towards delineating the biochemical role of the box pathway in lb   we have carried out functional studies of the paralogous bcl enzymes bclm and bclc with  different putative substrates we have established a structural rationale for the observed substrate specificities on the basis of a     crystal structure of bclm in complex with benzoate these data show that while bclm and bclc display similar overall substrate specificities bclm is significantly more active towards benzoate and  aminobenzoate with tighter binding km and a faster reaction rate vmax  despite these clear functional differences the residues that define the substrate binding site in bclm are completely conserved in bclc suggesting that second shell residues may play a significant role in substrate recognition and catalysis furthermore comparison of the active site of bclm with the recently solved structures of  chlorobenzoate coa ligase and   dihydroxybenzoate coa ligase offers additional insight into the molecular features that mediate substrate binding in adenylate forming enzymes this study provides the first biochemical characterization of a box enzyme from lb  and the first structural characterization of a box enzyme from any organism and further substantiates the concept of distinct roles for the two paralogous box pathways in lb
