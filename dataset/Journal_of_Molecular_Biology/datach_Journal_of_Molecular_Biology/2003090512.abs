kinetics of intramolecular contact formation in a denatured protein
quenching of the triplet state of tryptophan by cysteine has provided a new tool for measuring the rate of forming a specific intramolecular contact in disordered polypeptides here we use this technique to investigate contact formation in the denatured state of csptm a small cold shock protein from thermotoga maritima engineered to contain a single tryptophan residue w  and a single cysteine residue at the c terminus c   at all concentrations of denaturant the decay rate of the w  triplet of the unfolded protein is more than tenfold faster than the rate observed for the native protein    s    experiments on the unfolded protein without the added c terminal cysteine residue show that this faster rate results entirely from contact quenching by c  the quenching rate in the unfolded state by c  increases at concentrations of denaturant that favor folding indicating a compaction of the unfolded protein as observed previously in single molecule f rster resonance energy transfer fret experiments
