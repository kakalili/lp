the conserved asparagine in the hnh motif serves an important structural role in metal finger endonucleases
the hnh motif is a small nucleic acid binding and cleavage module widespread in metal finger endonucleases in all life kingdoms here we studied a non specific endonuclease the nuclease domain of cole  n cole  to decipher the role of the conserved asparagine and histidine residues in the hnh motif we found using fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret assays that the dna hydrolysis activity of h  n cole mutants was completely abolished while activities of n  and h  mutants varied from   to    of the wild type activity the crystal structures of three n cole mutants in complex with the inhibitor im  n  a  im  n  d  im and h  a  im  were determined at a resolution of     to     h  is responsible for metal ion binding in the wild type protein as the zinc ion is still partially associated in the structure of h  a suggesting that h  plays a supportive role in metal binding both n  a and n  d contain a disordered loop in the hnh motif due to the disruption of the hydrogen bond network surrounding the side chain of residue   and as a result the imidazole ring of the general base residue h  is tilted slightly and the scissile phosphate is shifted leading to the large reductions in hydrolysis activities these results suggest that the highly conserved asparagine in the hnh motif in general plays a structural role in constraining the loop in the metal finger structure and keeping the general base histidine and scissile phosphate in the correct position for dna hydrolysis
