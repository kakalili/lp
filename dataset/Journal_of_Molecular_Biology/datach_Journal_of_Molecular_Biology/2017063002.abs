yeats domain  a histone acylation reader in health and disease
histone post translational modifications ptms carry an epigenetic layer of message to regulate diverse cellular processes at the chromatin level many of these ptms are selectively recognized by dedicated effector proteins for normal cell growth and development while dysregulation of these recognition events is often implicated in human diseases notably cancer thus it is fundamentally important to elucidate the regulatory mechanism s underlying the readout of ptms on histones the yaf  enl af  taf  sas  yeats domain is an emerging reader module that selectively recognizes histone lysine acylation with a preference for crotonylation over acetylation in the review we discuss the recognition of histone acylations by the yeats domain and the biological significance of this readout from multiple perspectives
