muscle z band ultrastructure titin z repeats and z band periodicities do not match
vertebrate muscle z bands show zig zag densities due to different sets of  actinin cross links between anti parallel actin molecules their axial extent varies with muscle and fibre type    nm in fast and    nm in cardiac and slow muscles corresponding to the number of  actinin cross links present fish white fast muscle z bands have two sets of  actinin links mammalian slow muscle z bands have six the modular structure of the   mda protein titin that spans from m band to z band correlates with the axial structure of the sarcomere it may form the template for myofibril assembly the z band located amino terminal  kda of titin includes  residue repeating modules z repeats that are expressed differentially heart slow and fast muscles have seven four to six and two to four z repeats respectively gautel et al proposed a z band model in which each z repeat links to one level of  actinin cross links requiring that the axial extent of a z repeat is the same as the axial separation of  actinin layers of which there are two in every actin crossover repeat the span of a z repeat in vitro is estimated by atkinson et al to be  nm or less much less than half the normal vertebrate muscle actin crossover length of  nm different actin binding proteins can change this length it is reduced markedly by cofilin binding or can increase to   nm in the abnormally large nemaline myopathy z band here we tested whether in normal vertebrate z bands there is a marked reduction in crossover repeat so that it matches twice the apparent z repeat length of  nm we found that the measured periodicities in wide z bands in slow and cardiac muscles are all very similar about  nm just like the nemaline myopathy z bands hence the  nm periodicity is an important conserved feature of z bands and either cannot be explained by titin z repeats as previously suggested or may correlate with two z repeats
