metal dependent conformational changes in a recombinant vwf a domain from human factor b a solution study by circular dichroism fourier transform infrared and h nmr spectroscopy edited by r huber
factor b is a key component of the alternative pathway of complement and is cleaved by factor d into the ba and bb fragments when complexed with the activated form of c  namely c b the bb fragment contains a von willebrand factor type a vwf a domain which is composed of an open twisted almost parallel  sheet flanked on both sides by seven  helices a to a  with a metal coordination site at its active site cleft homology modelling of this vwf a domain shows that the metal binding site was present two recombinant vwf a domains gly  ile  and gly  gln   were examined by circular dichroism and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and indicated a significant conformational transition in the presence and absence of mg  two upfield shifted signals in the h nmr spectrum were used as sensitive probes of the vwf a protein structure one of which was assigned to a methyl group and demonstrated metal and ph dependent properties between two distinct conformations temperature denaturation studies followed by spectroscopy showed that metal binding caused the vwf a structure to become significantly more stable ring current calculations based on a homology model for the vwf a structure correlated one upfield shifted signal with a methyl group on the  helices in the vwf a structure and the other one with individual single protons an allosteric property of the vwf a domain has thus been identified and its implications for factor b activation were examined since the vwf a domain after  helix a is connected by a short link to the catalytic serine protease domain in the bb fragment the identification of a metal free and a more stable metal bound conformation for the vwf a domain implies that the vwf a interaction with c b may alter its mg  bound coordination in such a way as to induce conformational changes that may regulate the proteolytic activity of factor b
