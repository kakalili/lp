in vitro reconstitution and characterization of the yeast mitochondrial degradosome complex unravels tight functional interdependence
the mitochondrial degradosome mtexo  the main rna degrading complex of yeast mitochondria is composed of two subunits an exoribonuclease encoded by the dss gene and an rna helicase encoded by the suv gene we expressed both subunits of the yeast mitochondrial degradosome in escherichia coli reconstituted the complex in vitro and analyzed the rnase atpase and helicase activities of the two subunits separately and in complex the results reveal a very strong functional interdependence for every enzymatic activity we observed significant changes when the relevant protein was present in the complex compared to the activity measured for the protein alone the atpase activity of suv p is stimulated by rna and its background activity in the absence of rna is reduced greatly when the protein is in the complex with dss p the suv protein alone does not display rna unwinding activity and the   to   directional helicase activity requiring a free   single stranded substrate becomes apparent only when suv p is in complex with dss p the dss protein alone does have some basal exoribonuclease activity which is not atp dependent but in the presence of suv p the activity of the entire complex is enhanced greatly and is entirely atp dependent with no residual activity observed in the absence of atp such absolute atp dependence is unique among known exoribonuclease complexes on the basis of these results we propose a model in which the suv p rna helicase acts as a molecular motor feeding the substrate to the catalytic centre of the rnase subunit
