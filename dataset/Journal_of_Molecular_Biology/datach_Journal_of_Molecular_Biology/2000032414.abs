the spatial orientation of the essential amino acid residues arginine and aspartate within the    integrin recognition site of collagen iv has been resolved using fluorescence resonance energy transfer edited by r huber
the interaction of collagen iv with cells is mediated mainly by the integrin     the recognition site has been located to a segment of the triple helical domain   nm away from the n terminus of the collagen molecule the three essential amino acid residues of the    binding site arginine   iv   and the two aspartate residues   iv   are all located on different chains since the spatial array of the three residues depends on the stagger of the chains within the triple helix the stagger has been elucidated using fluorescence resonance energy transfer with phenylalanine   iv   and tryptophan   iv   as the fluorescent donor acceptor pair the distance r between phenylalanine and tryptophan was determined by analysis of the energy transfer efficiency e and the orientation factor    in parallel distance r and orientation factor   were also calculated from the coordinates of the triple helix comparison of the calculated and empirically determined values unequivocally showed the stagger to be        this arrangement of the three  chains describes the conformation of the    integrin recognition site that is the distinct orientation of the side chains of the essential residues aspartate and arginine in respect to the helix axis
