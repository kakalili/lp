ligand induced conformational changes and a reaction intermediate in branched chain  oxo acid dehydrogenase e  from thermus thermophilus hb  as revealed by x ray crystallography
the    tetrameric e component of the branched chain  oxo acid bcoa dehydrogenase multienzyme complex is a thiamin diphosphate thdp dependent enzyme e catalyzes the decarboxylation of a bcoa concomitant with the formation of the  carbanion enamine intermediate    hydroxyalkyl thdp followed by transfer of the  hydroxyalkyl group to the distal sulfur atom on the lipoamide of the e component in order to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of e  the   and  subunits of e from thermus thermophilus hb have been co expressed in escherichia coli purified and crystallized as a stable complex and the following crystal structures have been analyzed the apoenzyme e apo  the holoenzyme e holo  e holo in complex with the substrate analogue  methylpentanoate mpa as an es complex model and e holo in complex with  methyl  oxopentanoate mopa as the  carbanion enamine intermediate e ceim  binding of cofactors to e apo induces a disorder  order transition in two loops adjacent to the active site furthermore upon binding of mpa to e holo the loop comprised of gly   gln   moves close to the active site and interacts with mpa the carboxylate group of mpa is recognized mainly by tyr   and n   of thdp the hydrophobic moiety of mpa is recognized by phe   tyr   met   and his    as an intermediate mopa is decarboxylated and covalently linked to thdp and the conformation of the protein loop is almost the same as in the substrate free holoenzyme form these results suggest that e undergoes an open  closed conformational change upon formation of the es complex with a bcoa and the mobile region participates in the recognition of the carboxylate group of the bcoa es complex models of e holo mopa and of e ceim lipoamide built from the above structures suggest that his   and his     are potential proton donors to the carbonyl group of a bcoa and to the proximal sulfur atom on the lipoamide respectively
