latent lytm at    resolution
lytm an autolysin from staphylococcus aureus is a zn  dependent glycyl glycine endopeptidase with a characteristic hxh motif that belongs to the lysostaphin type merops m    of metallopeptidases here we present the    crystal structure of lytm the first structure of a lysostaphin type peptidase in the lytm structure the zn  is tetrahedrally coordinated by the side chains of n   h   d  and h   the second histidine of the hxh motif although close to the active site h   the first histidine of the hxh motif is not directly involved in zn  coordination and there is no water molecule in the coordination sphere of the zn  suggesting that the crystal structure shows a latent form of the enzyme although lytm has not previously been considered as a proenzyme we show that a truncated version of lytm that lacks the n terminal part with the poorly conserved zn  ligand n  has much higher specific activity than full length enzyme this observation is consistent with the known removal of profragments in other lysostaphin type proteins and with a prior observation of an active lytm degradation fragment in s aureus supernatant the  asparagine switch  in lytm is analogous to the  cysteine switch  in pro matrix metalloproteases
