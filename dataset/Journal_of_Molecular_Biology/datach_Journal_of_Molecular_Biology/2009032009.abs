oligomeric structure diversity within the giy yig nuclease family
the giy yig nuclease domain has been identified in homing endonucleases dna repair and recombination enzymes and restriction endonucleases the type ii restriction enzyme eco ki belongs to the giy yig nuclease superfamily and like most of other family members including the homing endonuclease i tevi is a monomer it recognizes the palindromic sequence   ccgc gg        marks the cleavage position and cuts it to generate   staggered ends the eco ki monomer which contains a single active site either has to nick sequentially individual dna strands or has to form dimers or even higher order oligomers upon dna binding to make a double strand break at its target site here we provide experimental evidence that eco ki monomers dimerize on a single cognate dna molecule forming the catalytically active complex the mechanism described here for eco ki differs from that of cfr i isoschisomer which also belongs to the giy yig family but is functional as a tetramer this novel mechanism may have implications for the function of homing endonucleases and other enzymes of the giy yig family
