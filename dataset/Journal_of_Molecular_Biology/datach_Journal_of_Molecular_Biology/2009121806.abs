structural and thermodynamic characterization of pre and postpolymerization states in the f fimbrial subunit faeg
enterotoxigenic escherichia coli expressing f fimbriae are the major cause of porcine colibacillosis and are responsible for significant death and morbidity in neonatal and postweaned piglets via the chaperone  usher pathway f fimbriae are assembled into thin flexible polymers mainly composed of the single domain adhesin faeg the f fimbrial system has been labeled eccentric because the f pilins show some features distinct from the features of pilins of other chaperone  usher assembled structures in particular faeg is much larger than other pilins    versus    kda  grafting an additional carbohydrate binding domain on the common immunoglobulin like core structural data of faeg during different stages of the f fimbrial biogenesis process combined with differential scanning calorimetry measurements confirm the general principles of the donor strand complementation exchange mechanisms taking place during pilus biogenesis via the chaperone  usher pathway
