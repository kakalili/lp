recognition of   ypg   sequences by coupled stacking hydrogen bonding interactions with amino acid residues
the combined biochemical and structural study of hundreds of protein  dna complexes has indicated that sequence specific interactions are mediated by two mechanisms termed direct and indirect readout direct readout involves direct interactions between the protein and base specific atoms exposed in the major and minor grooves of dna for indirect readout the protein recognizes dna by sensing conformational variations in the structure dependent on nucleotide sequence typically through interactions with the phosphodiester backbone based on our recent structure of ndt  bound to dna in conjunction with a search of the existing pdb database we propose a new method of sequence specific recognition that utilizes both direct and indirect readout in this mode a single amino acid side chain recognizes two consecutive base pairs the   base is recognized by canonical direct readout while the   base is recognized through a variation of indirect readout whereby the conformational flexibility of the particular dinucleotide step namely a   pyrimidine  purine   step facilitates its recognition by the amino acid via cation   interactions in most cases this mode of dna recognition helps explain the sequence specificity of the protein for its target dna
