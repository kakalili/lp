genetic dissection of an inhibitor of the sporulation sigma factor  g
sporulation in bacillus subtilis is controlled by a cascade of four sigma factors that are held into inactive form until the proper stage of development the gin protein encoded by csfb is able to strongly inhibit the activity of one of these factors  g in vivo the csfb gene is present in a large number of endospore formers but the various gin orthologues show little conservation in striking contrast to their  g counterparts we have carried out a mutagenesis analysis of the gin protein in order to understand its inhibitory properties by measuring  g inhibition in the presence of gin in vivo assessing gin ability to bind  g in a yeast two hybrid assay and quantifying gin   g interaction in b subtilis we have identified specific residues that play an essential role in binding  g or in preventing  g transcriptional activity two cysteine pairs conserved in all gin orthologues are essential for gin activity mutations in the first pair are partially complemented by mutations in the second pair suggesting that gin exists in oligomeric form at least as a dimer dimerisation is consistent with our in vitro analysis of a purified gin recombinant protein which shows that gin contains   zinc atom per monomer altogether these results indicate that the conserved cysteines play a structural role whereas another less conserved region of the protein is involved in interacting with  g interestingly some mutants have kept most of their ability to bind  g but are completely unable to inhibit  g transcriptional activity raising the possibility that gin might act by a mechanism more complex than just sequestration of  g
