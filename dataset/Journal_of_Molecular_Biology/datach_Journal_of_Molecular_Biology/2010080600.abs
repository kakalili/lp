correlation between the ompg secondary structure and its ph dependent alterations monitored by ftir
the channel activity of the outer membrane protein g ompg from escherichia coli is ph dependent to investigate the role of the histidine pair his  his  in triggering channel opening and closing we mutated both histidines to alanines and cysteines fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that the ompg mutants stay  independent of ph  in an open conformation temperature ramp experiments indicate that the mutants are as stable as the open state of wild type ompg the x ray structure of the alanine substituted ompg mutant obtained at ph   confirms the constitutively open conformation compared to previous structures of the wild type protein in the open and closed conformation the mutant structure shows a difference in the extracellular loop l connecting  strands s  and s  a deletion of amino acids      which are thought to block the channel at low ph in wild type ompg indicates conformational changes which might be triggered by his  his
