x ray structure of isoaspartyl dipeptidase from e coli a dinuclear zinc peptidase evolved from amidohydrolases
l aspartyl and l asparaginyl residues in proteins spontaneously undergo intra residue rearrangements forming isoaspartyl  aspartyl residues linked through their side chain  carboxyl group with the following amino acid in order to avoid accumulation of isoaspartyl dipeptides left over from protein degradation some bacteria have developed specialized isoaspartyl  aspartyl zinc dipeptidases sequentially unrelated to other peptidases which also poorly degrade  aspartyl dipeptides we have expressed and crystallized the   amino acid residue isoaspartyl dipeptidase iada from e coli and have determined its crystal structure in the absence and presence of the phosphinic inhibitor asp  po ch  leuoh this structure reveals an octameric particle of   symmetry with each polypeptide chain organized in a     tim like barrel catalytic domain attached to a u shaped  sandwich domain at the c termini of the  strands of the  barrel the two catalytic zinc ions are surrounded by four his a bridging carbamylated lys and an asp residue which seems to act as a proton shuttle a large  hairpin loop protruding from the     barrel is disordered in the free peptidase but forms a flap that stoppers the barrel entrance to the active center upon binding of the dipeptide mimic this isoaspartyl dipeptidase shows strong topological homology with the  subunit of the binickel containing ureases the dinuclear zinc dihydroorotases hydantoinases and phosphotriesterases and the mononuclear adenosine and cytosine deaminases which all are catalyzing hydrolytic reactions at carbon or phosphorous centers thus nature has adapted an existing fold with catalytic tools suitable for hydrolysis of amide bonds to the binding requirements of a peptidase
