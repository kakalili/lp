structural basis of conserved cysteine in the fibroblast growth factor family evidence for a vestigial half cystine
the  members of the mouse human fibroblast growth factor fgf family of proteins contain a conserved cysteine residue at position   numbering scheme of the   residue form of fgf   sequence and structure information suggests that this position is a free cysteine in  members and participates as a half cystine in at least  and perhaps as many as  other members while a structural role as a half cystine provides a stability basis for possible selective pressure it is less clear why this residue is conserved as a free cysteine although free buried thiols can limit protein functional half life  to probe the structural role of the free cysteine at position  in fgf  we constructed ala ser thr val and ile mutations and determined their effects on structure and stability these results show that position  in fgf  is thermodynamically optimized to accept a free cysteine a second cysteine mutation was introduced into wild type fgf  at adjacent position ala  which is known to participate as a half cystine with position  in fgf  fgf   and fgf   results show that unlike position   a free cysteine at position  destabilizes fgf  however upon oxidation a near optimal disulfide bond is formed between cys  and cys  resulting in    kj mol of increased thermostability thus while the conserved free cysteine at position  in the majority of the fgf proteins may have a principal role in limiting functional half life evidence suggests that it is a vestigial half cystine
