two positively charged residues of   dna polymerase conserved in protein primed dna polymerases are involved in stabilisation of the incoming nucleotide
in dna polymerases from families a and b in the closed conformation several positively charged residues located in pre motif b and motif b have been shown to interact with the phosphate groups of the incoming nucleotide at the polymerisation active site the invariant lys of motif b and the nearly invariant lys of pre motif b family b correspond to a his in family a dna polymerases in   dna polymerase belonging to the family b dna polymerases able to start replication by protein priming the corresponding residues lys  and lys   have been shown to be dntp ligands since in several dna polymerases a third residue has been involved in dntp binding we have addressed here the question if in the dna polymerases of the protein primed subfamily and especially in   dna polymerase there are more than these two residues involved in nucleotide binding by site directed mutagenesis in   dna polymerase the functional role of the remaining two conserved positively charged amino acid residues of pre motif b and motif b besides lys  and lys   has been studied the results indicate that residue lys  of motif b is also involved in dntp binding possibly through interaction with the triphosphate moiety of the incoming nucleotide since the affinity for nucleotides of mutant dna polymerase k  t was reduced in dna and tp primed reactions on the other hand we propose that when the terminal protein tp is present at the polymerisation active site residue lys  of pre motif b is involved in stabilising the incoming nucleotide in an appropriate position for efficient tp deoxynucleotidylation although mutant dna polymerase k  t showed a wild type like phenotype in dna primed polymerisation in the presence of dna as template in tp primed reactions as initiation and transition it was impaired especially in the presence of the   dbp protein p
