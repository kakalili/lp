s nitrosylation induces structural and dynamical changes in a rhodanese family protein
s nitrosylation is well established as an important post translational regulator in protein function and signaling however relatively little is known about its structural and dynamical consequences we have investigated the effects of s nitrosylation on the rhodanese domain of the escherichia coli integral membrane protein ygap by nmr x ray crystallography and mass spectrometry the results show that the active cysteine in the rhodanese domain of ygap is subjected to two competing modifications s nitrosylation and s sulfhydration which are naturally occurring in vivo it has been observed that in addition to inhibition of the sulfur transfer activity s nitrosylation of the active site residue cys  causes an increase in slow motion and a displacement of helix  due to a weakening of the interaction between the active site and the helix dipole these findings provide an example of how nitrosative stress can exert action at the atomic level
