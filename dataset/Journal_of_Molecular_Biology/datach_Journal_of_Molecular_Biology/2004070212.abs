a normal mode analysis of structural plasticity in the biomolecular motor f atpase
normal modes have been used to explore the inherent flexibility of the    and  subunits of f atpase in isolation and as part of the     complex it was found that the structural plasticity of the  and  subunits in particular correlates with their functions the n and c terminal helices forming the coiled coil domain of the  subunit are highly flexible in the isolated subunit but more rigid in the     complex due to interactions with other subunits the globular domain of the  subunit is structurally relatively rigid when isolated and in the     complex this is important for its functional role in coupling the f and f complex of atp synthase and in inducing the conformational changes of the  subunits in synthesis most important the character of the lowest frequency modes of the  e subunit is highly correlated with the large  e   tp transition this holds for the c terminal domain and the nucleotide binding domain which undergo significant conformational transitions in the functional cycle of f atpase this is most evident in the ligand free  e subunit the flexibility in the nucleotide binding domain is reduced somewhat in the  tp subunit in the presence of mg  atp the low frequency modes of the     complex show that the motions of the globular domain of the  subunit and of the c terminal and nucleotide binding domains of the  e subunits are coupled in accord with their function overall the normal mode analysis reveals that f atpase like other macromolecular assemblies has the intrinsic structural flexibility required for its function encoded in its sequence and three dimensional structure this inherent plasticity is an essential aspect of assuring a small free energy cost for the large scale conformational transition that occurs in molecular motors
