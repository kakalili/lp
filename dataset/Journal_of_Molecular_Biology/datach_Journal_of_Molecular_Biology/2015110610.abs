peptide probes reveal a hydrophobic steric ratchet in the anthrax toxin protective antigen translocase
anthrax toxin is a tripartite virulence factor produced by bacillus anthracis during infection under acidic endosomal ph conditions the toxin s protective antigen pa component forms a transmembrane channel in host cells the pa channel then translocates its two enzyme components lethal factor and edema factor into the host cytosol under the proton motive force protein translocation under a proton motive force is catalyzed by a series of nonspecific polypeptide binding sites called clamps a  residue guest host peptide model system kkkkkxxsxx was used to functionally probe polypeptide clamp interactions within wild type pa channels the guest residues were thr ala leu phe tyr and trp in steady state translocation experiments the channel blocked most tightly with peptides that had increasing amounts of nonpolar surface area cooperative peptide binding was observed in the trp containing peptide sequence but not the other tested sequences trp substitutions into a flexible uncharged linker between the lethal factor amino terminal domain and diphtheria toxin a chain expedited translocation therefore peptide clamp sites in translocase channels can sense large steric features like tryptophan in peptides and while these steric interactions may make a peptide translocate poorly in the context of folded domains they can make the protein translocate more rapidly presumably via a hydrophobic steric ratchet mechanism
