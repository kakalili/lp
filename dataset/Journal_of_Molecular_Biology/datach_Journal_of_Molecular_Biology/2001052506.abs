effects of cobalt hexammine on folding and self cleavage of the neurospora vs ribozyme edited by d draper
we have investigated the effects of co nh    an analog of hexahydrated mg  on folding and catalysis of the neurospora vs ribozyme most of the metal ion induced changes detected by chemical modification structure probing in either metal ion are similar but occur at approximately  fold lower concentrations of co nh   than mg  however co nh   is not as effective at inducing two functionally important structural changes stabilizing the pseudoknot interaction between loops i and v and rearranging the secondary structure of helix ib comparison of the folding of the precursor and the downstream cleavage product which lacks helix ia shows that helix ia inhibits stable pseudoknot formation and rearrangement of helix ib the vs ribozyme does not self cleave with co nh   as the sole polyvalent cation however mixed metal kinetic experiments show that co nh   does not inhibit mg  induced self cleavage in contrast at sub saturating concentrations of mg  co nh   increases the rate of mg  induced self cleavage indicating that co nh   contributes to the functionally relevant folding of the vs ribozyme
