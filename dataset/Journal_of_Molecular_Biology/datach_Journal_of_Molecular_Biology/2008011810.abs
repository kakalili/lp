restriction endonuclease inhibitor ipi of bacteriophage t  a novel structure for a dedicated target
phage t protects its dna from the two gene encoded gmrs gmrd glucose modified hydroxymethylcytosine restriction endonuclease ct of pathogenic escherichia coli ct   by injecting several hundred copies of the  amino acid residue nuclease inhibitor ipi  into the infected host here the three dimensional solution structure of mature ipi is reported as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance techniques using   experimental nuclear overhauser effect and dipolar coupling constraints    constraints per residue  close examination of this oblate shaped protein structure reveals a novel fold consisting of two small  sheets    b and b    b  b  flanked at the n and c termini by  helices h and h  such a fold is very compact in shape and allows ejection of ipi through the narrow    portal and tail tube apertures of the virion without unfolding structural and dynamic measurements identify an exposed hydrophobic knob that is a putative gmrs gmrd binding site a single gene from the uropathogenic e coli ut   which codes for a gmrs gmrd like ut fusion enzyme with    identity to the heterodimeric ct enzyme  has evolved ipi inhibitor immunity analysis of the gmrs gmrd restriction endonuclease enzyme family and its ipi family phage antagonists reveals an evolutionary pathway that has elaborated a surprisingly diverse and specifically fitted set of coevolving attack and defense structures
