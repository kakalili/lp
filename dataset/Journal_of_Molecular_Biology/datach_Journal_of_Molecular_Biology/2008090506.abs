demonstration of a multistep mechanism for assembly of the srp srp receptor complex implications for the catalytic role of srp rna
two gtpases in the signal recognition particle srp and its receptor sr control the delivery of newly synthesized proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane during the protein targeting reaction the  s srp rna accelerates the association between the two gtpases by   fold using fluorescence resonance energy transfer we demonstrate here that formation of a stable srp sr complex involves two distinct steps a fast initial association between srp and sr to form a gtp independent early complex and then a gtp dependent conformational rearrangement to form the stable final complex we also found that the  s srp rna significantly stabilizes the early gtp independent intermediate furthermore mutational analyses show that there is a strong correlation between the ability of the mutant srp rnas to stabilize the early intermediate and their ability to accelerate srp sr complex formation we propose that the srp rna by stabilizing the early intermediate can give this transient intermediate a longer life time and therefore a higher probability to rearrange to the stable final complex this provides a coherent model that explains how the  s rna exerts its catalytic role in srp sr complex assembly
