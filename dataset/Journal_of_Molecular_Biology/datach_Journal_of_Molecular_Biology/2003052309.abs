structural determinants in human dna polymerase  account for mitochondrial toxicity from nucleoside analogs
although antiviral nucleoside analog therapy successfully delays progression of hiv infection to aids these drugs cause unwelcome side effects by inducing mitochondrial toxicity we and others have demonstrated that the mitochondrial polymerase dna polymerase   pol   participates in mitochondrial toxicity by incorporating these chain terminating antiviral nucleotide analogs into dna here we explore the role of three highly conserved amino acid residues in the active site of human pol  that modulate selection of nucleotide analogs as substrates for incorporation sequence alignments crystal structures and mutagenesis studies of family a dna polymerases led us to change tyr  and tyr  in polymerase motif b to phe and ala and glu  in polymerase motif a was changed to ala the mutant polymerases were tested for their ability to incorporate natural nucleotides and the five antiviral nucleoside analogs currently approved for antiviral therapy azt ddc d t  tc and carbovir steady state kinetic analysis of the pol  derivatives with the normal and antiviral nucleotides demonstrated that tyr  is largely responsible for the ability of pol  to incorporate dideoxynucleotides and d t mp mutation of tyr  to phe renders the enzyme resistant to dideoxynucleotides and d t tp without compromising the activity of the polymerase alteration of glu  and tyr  to ala had the largest effect on overall polymerase activity with normal nucleotides producing dramatic increases in km dntp and large decreases in kcat mutation of tyr  in pol  causes the degenerative disease progressive external ophthalmoplegia in humans and we show that this residue partially accounts for the ability of pol  to incorporate d t mp and carbovir alteration of glu  to ala slightly increased discrimination against dideoxynucleotides and d t tp the mechanisms by which pol  selects certain nucleotide analogs are discussed
