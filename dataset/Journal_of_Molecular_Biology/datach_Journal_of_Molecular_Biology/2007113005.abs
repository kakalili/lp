predicting protein function from structure  the roles of short chain dehydrogenase reductase enzymes in bordetella o antigen biosynthesis
the pathogenic bacteria bordetella parapertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica express a lipopolysaccharide o antigen containing a polymer of   diacetamido   dideoxy l galacturonic acid the o antigen cluster contains three neighbouring genes that encode proteins belonging to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase sdr family wbmf wbmg and wbmh and we aimed to elucidate their individual functions mutation and complementation implicate each gene in o antigen expression but as their putative sugar nucleotide substrates are not currently available biochemical characterisation of wbmf wbmg and wbmh is impractical at the present time sdr family members catalyse a wide range of chemical reactions including oxidation reduction and epimerisation because they typically share low sequence conservation however catalytic function cannot be predicted from sequence analysis alone in this context structural characterisation of the native proteins co crystals and small molecule soaks enables differentiation of the functions of wbmf wbmg and wbmh these proteins exhibit typical sdr architecture and coordinate nad in the substrate binding domain all three enzymes bind uridyl nucleotides wbmg contains a typical sdr catalytic tyk triad which is required for oxidoreductase function but the active site is devoid of additional acid  base functionality similarly wbmh possesses a tyk triad but an otherwise feature poor active site consequently   epimerase function can probably be ruled out for these enzymes the wbmf active site contains conserved   epimerase features namely a positionally conserved cysteine cys   and basic side chain his  or asn   but lacks the serine threonine component of the sdr triad and therefore may not act as an oxidoreductase the data suggest a pathway for synthesis of the o antigen precursor udp   diacetamido   dideoxy l galacturonic acid and illustrate the usefulness of structural data in predicting protein function
