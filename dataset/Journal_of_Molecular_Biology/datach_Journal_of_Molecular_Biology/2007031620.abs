orientational information of troponin c within the thin filaments obtained by neutron fiber diffraction
in striated muscles contraction is regulated by the thin filament based proteins troponin consisting of three subunits tnc tni and tnt  and tropomyosin knowledge of in situ structures of these proteins is indispensable for elucidating this ca  sensitive regulatory mechanism we employed neutron scattering to investigate the structure of tnc within the thin filament and found that tnc assumes extended dumbbell like structures and moves toward the filament axis by binding of ca  here in order to obtain more detailed in situ structural information of tnc neutron fiber diffraction measurements were performed sols of native thin filaments and the thin filaments containing deuterated tnc were prepared in h o the oriented samples were obtained by placing these sols sealed in quartz capillaries with a diameter of  mm in a magnetic field of  tesla neutron fiber diffraction patterns were obtained from these oriented samples in the absence and presence of ca  the patterns obtained showed strong equatorial diffraction due to the thin filaments     and    layer lines due to actin and meridional reflections due to tn complex analysis of the meridional reflections due to tn complex with aid of model calculation showed that the angle between the thin filament axis and the long axis of tnc was estimated to be      and       in the absence and presence of ca  respectively suggesting that tnc which assumes orientations rather perpendicular to the filament axis in the absence of ca  tilts toward the filament axis and the orientational and positional disorder increases by binding ca  it also showed that the relative position of the tnc moved by about    by binding ca  and this apparent movement was concomitant with the movements of other tn subunits this implies that by binding ca  significant structural rearrangements of tn subunits occur
