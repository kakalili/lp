role of bundle helices in a regulatory crosstalk in the trimeric betaine transporter betp
the na coupled betaine symporter betp regulates transport activity in response to hyperosmotic stress only in its trimeric state suggesting a regulatory crosstalk between individual protomers betp shares the overall fold of two inverted structurally related five transmembrane tm helix repeats with the sequence unrelated na coupled symporters leut vsglt and mhp  which are neither trimeric nor regulated in transport activity conformational changes characteristic for this transporter fold involve the two first helices of each repeat which form a four tm helix bundle here we identify two ionic networks in betp located on both sides of the membrane that might be responsible for betp s unique regulatory behavior by restricting the conformational flexibility of the four tm helix bundle the cytoplasmic ionic interaction network links both first helices of each repeat in one protomer to the osmosensing c terminal domain of the adjacent protomer moreover the periplasmic ionic interaction network conformationally locks the four tm helix bundle between the same neighbor protomers by a combination of site directed mutagenesis cross linking and betaine uptake measurements we demonstrate how conformational changes in individual bundle helices are transduced to the entire bundle by specific inter helical interactions we suggest that one purpose of bundle networking is to assist crosstalk between protomers during transport regulation by specifically modulating the transition from outward facing to inward facing state
