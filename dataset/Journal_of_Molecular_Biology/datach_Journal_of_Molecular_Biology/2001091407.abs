crystal structure of rv  c an adomet dependent methyltransferase from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv  this is cdri communication no    edited by r huber
rv  c belongs to the class of conserved hypothetical proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv the crystal structure of rv  c in complex with s adenosyl l methionine adomet has been determined at     resolution the crystallographic asymmetric unit consists of a monomer but symmetry related subunits interact extensively leading to a tetrameric structure the structure of the monomer can be divided functionally into two domains the larger catalytic c terminal domain that binds the cofactor adomet and is involved in the transfer of methyl group from adomet to the substrate and a smaller n terminal domain the structure of the catalytic domain is very similar to that of other adomet dependent methyltransferases the n terminal domain is primarily a  structure with a fold not found in other methyltransferases of known structure database searches reveal a conserved family of rv  c like proteins from various organisms multiple sequence alignments show several regions of high sequence similarity motifs in this family of proteins structure analysis and homology to yeast gcd p suggest that rv  c could be an rna methyltransferase but further studies are required to establish its functional role conclusively
