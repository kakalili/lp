radioprobing of a reca three stranded dna complex with iodine   evidence for recognition of homology in the major groove of the target duplex edited by p e wright
a fundamental problem in homologous recombination is how homology between dnas is recognized in all current models a recombination protein loads onto a single strand of dna and scans another duplex for homology when homology is found a synaptic complex is formed leading to strand exchange and a heteroduplex a novel technique based on strand cleavage by the auger radiodecay of iodine   allows us to determine the distances between  i on the incoming strand and the target sugars of the duplex dna strands in an escherichia coli reca protein mediated synaptic complex analysis of these distances shows that the complex represents a post strand exchange intermediate in which the heteroduplex is located in the center while the outgoing strand forms a relatively wide helix intertwined with the heteroduplex and located in its minor groove the structure implies that homology is recognized in the major groove of the duplex
