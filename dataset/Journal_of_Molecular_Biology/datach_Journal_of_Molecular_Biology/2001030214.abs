transthyretin stability as a key factor in amyloidogenesis x ray analysis at atomic resolution edited by j thornton
transthyretin ttr amyloidosis is a conformational disturbance which like other amyloidoses represents a life threat here we report a ttr variant ttr thr  met that has been shown to have a protective role in the development of clinical symptoms in carriers of ttr val met one of the most frequent variants among ttr amyloidosis patients in order to understand this effect we have determined the structures of the ttr val met thr  met double mutant isolated from the serum of one patient and of both the native and thyroxine complex of ttr thr  met major conclusions are  i new h bonds within each monomer and monomer monomer inter subunit contacts e g ser  ser  and met  tyr   increase protein stability possibly leading to the protective effect of the ttr val met thr  met variant when compared to the single variant ttr val met  ii the mutated residue met   extends across the thyroxine binding channel inducing conformational changes that lead to closer contacts between different dimers within the tetramer the data at atomic resolution were essential to detect for the first time the subtle changes in the inter subunit contacts of ttr and explain the non amyloidogenic potential of the ttr thr  met variant improving considerably current research on the ttr amyloid fibril formation pathway
