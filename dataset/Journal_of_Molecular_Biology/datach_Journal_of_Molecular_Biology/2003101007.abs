interaction of a putative transcriptional regulatory protein and the thermo inducible cts  mutant repressor in the bacillus subtilis phage    genome
a   amino acid residue cts  mutant repressor mtc    located in the ecori f immunity region immf of bacillus subtilis phage    is involved in the control mechanism of a thermo inducible expression system adjacent to the repressor gene an open reading frame designated orf  encodes a polypeptide of  amino acid residues which shares a   homology with the amino acid sequence of the repressor on the basis of the protein sequence alignment a dna binding  helix   turn   helix hth motif was identified in the n terminal region residues     of the repressor as well as in the polypeptide of orf  residues      in vivo expression of the mutant repressor and orf were confirmed by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr and western blot analysis to study their dna binding properties the wild type repressor wtc    and the mutant repressor mtc    which has a thr  to ile substitution were overexpressed in escherichia coli and purified for affinity assays their affinities towards six operator sites at various temperatures were elucidated by surface plasmon resonance spr  our data showed that a temperature shift does not influence the wtc    operators binding affinity while the binding of mtc   to the operators was temperature sensitive this explains how thermo induction triggers the release of the mutant repressor and renders heterologous gene expression interestingly mtc   and orf demonstrated a large affinity discrepancy towards individual operators at different temperatures mrna levels monitored by real time rt pcr indicated a suppression of mtc   expression but a stimulation of orf transcription after thermo induction our data suggested that orf might be a counter protein to the phage repressor in the modulation of the two divergent oriented promoters pm and pr within the immf region
