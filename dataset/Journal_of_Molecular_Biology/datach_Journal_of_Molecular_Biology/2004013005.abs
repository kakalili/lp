structure formation in the c terminus of type iii collagen guides disulfide cross linking
in type iii collagen the main triple helical domain is followed by a disulfide knot and the c terminal propeptide which are both essential for nucleation stabilization and registration of the triple helix we demonstrate that oxidative inter chain disulfide bridging does not occur between the knot sequences glyprocyscysgly of dissociated randomly coiled chains n terminal fusion of the obligatory trimeric domain of mini fibritin is able to direct this process efficiently demonstrating a folded precursor mechanism in which the thiol groups have to be properly placed for the formation of native disulfide bonds the natural c propeptide domain may act in a similar way as the mini fibritin domain after disulfide linkage and triple helix formation the catalyzing mini fibritin domain was removed by thrombin cleavage in this way a short but stable triple helical collagen fragment was expressed in escherichia coli for structural and functional studies
