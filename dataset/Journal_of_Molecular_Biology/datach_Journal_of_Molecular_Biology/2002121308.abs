the solution structure of the recombinant hemoglobin from the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc   in its hemichrome state
the product of the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp pcc   gene slr   is a   amino acid polypeptide chain belonging to the truncated hemoglobin family recombinant ferric heme reconstituted synechocystis sp pcc   hemoglobin displays bis histidine coordination of the iron ion in addition this protein is capable of covalently attaching a reactive histidine to the heme  vinyl group the structure of the protein in the low spin ferric state with intact vinyl substituents was solved by nmr methods it was found that the structure differs from that of known truncated hemoglobins primarily in the orientation of the e helix which carries his  e  as the distal ligand to the iron the length and orientation of the f helix which carries his  f  as the proximal ligand to the iron and the h helix which carries his   h   the reactive histidine regions of enhanced flexibility include the short a helix the loop connecting the e and f helices and the last seven residues at the carboxy end the structural data allowed for the rationalization of physical properties of the cyanobacterial protein such as fast on rate for small ligand binding unstable apoprotein fold and cross linking ability comparison to the truncated hemoglobin from the green alga chlamydomonas eugametos also suggested how the endogenous hexacoordination affected the structure
