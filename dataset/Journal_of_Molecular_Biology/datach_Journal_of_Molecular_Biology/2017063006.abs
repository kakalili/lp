bromodomain histone readers and cancer
lysine acetylation of histone proteins is a fundamental post translational modification that regulates chromatin structure and plays an important role in gene transcription aberrant levels of histone lysine acetylation are associated with the development of several diseases acetyl lysine modifications create docking sites for bromodomains which are structurally conserved modules present in transcription associated proteins that are termed  reader  proteins bromodomain containing reader proteins are part of multiprotein complexes that regulate transcription programs which are often associated with profound phenotypic changes many bromodomain containing proteins are aberrantly expressed in diseases as best studied in cancers where bromodomain proteins impact the expression of oncogenes and anti apoptotic proteins thus bromodomain readers of histone acetylation have emerged as attractive targets for cancer drug discovery prompting immense interest in epigenetic focused medicinal chemistry to develop structurally guided chemical probes of bromodomains here we describe bromodomain containing proteins with defined roles in cancer and highlight recent progress in the development of bromodomain inhibitors
