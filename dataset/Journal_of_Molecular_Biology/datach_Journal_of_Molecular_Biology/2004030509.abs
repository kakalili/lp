the crystal structure of the globular domain of sheep prion protein
the prion protein prp is a naturally occurring polypeptide that becomes transformed from a normal conformation to that of an aggregated form characteristic of pathological states in fatal transmissible spongiform conditions such as creutzfeld  jacob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy we report the crystal structure at   resolution of residues      of the c terminal globular domain of the arq allele of sheep prion protein prp  the asymmetric unit contains a single molecule whose secondary structure and overall organisation correspond to those structures of prps from various mammalian species determined by nmr the globular domain shows a close association of helix  the c terminal portion of helix  and the n terminal portion of helix  bounded by the intramolecular disulphide bond       the loop      between   and helix  is relatively well structured compared to the human prp nmr structure analysis of the sheep prp structure identifies two possible loci for the initiation of  sheet mediated polymerisation one of these comprises the  strand residues      that forms an intra molecular  sheet with residues      this strand is involved in lattice contacts about a crystal dyad to generate a four stranded intermolecular  sheet between neighbouring molecules the second locus involves the region      which modelling suggests is able to undergo a partial     switch within the monomer these loci provide sites within the prpc monomer that could readily give rise to early intermediate species on the pathway to the formation of aggregated prpsc containing additional intermolecular  structure
