insight into catalysis of a unique gtpase reaction by a combined biochemical and ftir approach
rap and rap are the only small guanine nucleotide binding proteins of the ras superfamily that do not use glutamine for gtp hydrolysis moreover rap gap which stimulates the gtpase reaction of rap   fold does not have the classical  arginine finger  like rasgap but presumably introduces an asparagine residue into the active site here we address the requirements of this unique reaction in detail by combining various biochemical methods such as fluorescence spectroscopy stopped flow and time resolved fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir  the fluorescence spectroscopic assay monitors primarily protein  protein interaction steps while ftir resolves simultaneously the elementary steps of functional groups labor free but it is less sensitive and needs higher concentrations combining both methods allows us to distinguish weather mechanistic defects caused by mutation are due to affinity or due to functionality we show that several mutations of asn  block catalysis some of the mutants however still form a complex with rap  gdp in the presence of befx but not alfx supporting the notion that fluoride complexes are indicators of the ground versus transition state mutational analysis also shows that thr  is not required for catalysis while replacement of thr  of rap by leu eliminates gtpase activation by rap gap the t a and t q mutants have only a minor effect on catalysis but change the relative rates of cleavage and pi   release while rap gap n  a is completely inactive on wild type rap  it can act on rap t q  arguing that asn  in trans has a role in catalysis similar to that of the intrinsic gln in ras and rho finally since ftir works at high and thus mostly saturating concentrations it can clearly separate effects on affinity from purely catalytic modifications showing that arg   conserved between rapgaps and mutated in the homologous rhebgap tuberin affects binding affinity severely but has no effect on the cleavage reaction itself
