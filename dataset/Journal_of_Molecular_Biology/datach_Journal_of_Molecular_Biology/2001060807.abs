recognition of pre formed and flexible elements of an rna stem loop by nucleolin
nucleolin is an abundant nucleolar protein which is essential for ribosome biogenesis the first two of its four tandem rna binding domains rbd  specifically recognize a stem loop structure containing a conserved ucccga sequence in the loop called the nucleolin recognition element nre  we have determined the structure of the consensus selex nre snre by nmr spectroscopy in both the free and bound rna the top part of the stem forms a loop e or s turn motif in the absence of protein the structure of the hairpin loop is not well defined due to conformational heterogeneity and appears to be in equilibrium between two families of conformations titrations of rbd  rbd  and rbd  with the snre show that specific binding requires rbd  in complex with rbd  the hairpin loop interacts specifically with the protein and adopts a well defined structure which shares some of the features of the free form the loop e motif also has specific interactions with the protein implications of these findings for the mechanism of recognition of rna structures by modular proteins are discussed
