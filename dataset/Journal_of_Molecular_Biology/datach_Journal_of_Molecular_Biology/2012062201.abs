apobec b and aid have similar nuclear import mechanisms
members of the apobec apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like protein family catalyze dna cytosine deamination and underpin a variety of immune defenses for instance several family members including apobec b a b  elicit strong retrotransposon and retrovirus restriction activities however unlike the other proteins a b is the only family member with steady state nuclear localization here we show that a b nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid val  within an n terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme aid activation induced cytosine deaminase  mechanistic conservation with aid is further suggested by a b s capacity to interact with the same subset of importin proteins despite these mechanistic similarities enforced a b expression cannot substitute for aid dependent antibody gene diversification by class switch recombination regulatory differences between a b and aid are also visible during cell cycle progression our studies suggest that the present day a b enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an ancestral aid protein during the expansion of the apobec locus in primates our studies also highlight the likelihood that after nuclear import specialized mechanisms exist to guide these enzymes to their respective physiological substrates and prevent gratuitous chromosomal dna damage
