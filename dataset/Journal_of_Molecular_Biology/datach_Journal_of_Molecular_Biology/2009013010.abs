structure of amantadine bound m transmembrane peptide of influenza a in lipid bilayers from magic angle spinning solid state nmr the role of ser  in amantadine binding
the m proton channel of influenza a is the target of the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine whose effectiveness has been abolished by a single site mutation of ser  to asn in the transmembrane domain of the protein recent high resolution structures of the m transmembrane domain obtained from detergent solubilized protein in solution and crystal environments gave conflicting drug binding sites we present magic angle spinning solid state nmr results of ser  and a number of other residues in the m transmembrane peptide m tmp bound to lipid bilayers comparison of the spectra of the membrane bound apo and complexed m tmp indicates that ser  is the site of the largest chemical shift perturbation by amantadine the chemical shift constraints lead to a monomer structure with a small kink of the helical axis at gly  a tetramer model is then constructed using the helix tilt angle and several interhelical distances previously measured on unoriented bilayer samples this tetramer model differs from the solution and crystal structures in terms of the openness of the n terminus of the channel the constriction at ser  and the side chain conformations of trp  a residue important for channel gating moreover the tetramer model suggests that ser  may interact with amantadine amine via hydrogen bonding while the apo and drug bound m tmp have similar average structures the complexed peptide has much narrower linewidths at physiological temperature indicating drug induced changes of the protein dynamics in the membrane further at low temperature several residues show narrower lines in the complexed peptide than the apo peptide indicating that amantadine binding reduces the conformational heterogeneity of specific residues the differences of the current solid state nmr structure of the bilayer bound m tmp from the detergent based m structures suggest that the m conformation is sensitive to the environment and care must be taken when interpreting structural findings from non bilayer samples
