the backbone conformational entropy of protein folding experimental measures from atomic force microscopy
the energy dissipated during the atomic force microscopy based mechanical unfolding and extension of proteins is typically an order of magnitude greater than their folding free energy the vast majority of the  excess  energy dissipated is thought to arise due to backbone conformational entropy losses as the solvated random coil unfolded state is stretched into an extended low entropy conformation we have investigated this hypothesis in light of recent measurements of the energy dissipated during the mechanical unfolding of  polyproteins  comprised of multiple homogeneous domains given the assumption that backbone conformational entropy losses account for the vast majority of the energy dissipated an assumption supported by numerous lines of experimental evidence  we estimate that      j molkresidue of entropy is lost during the extension of three mechanically stable  sheet polyproteins if as suggested by measured peak to peak extension distances pulling proceeds to near completion this estimate corresponds to the absolute backbone conformational entropy of the unfolded state as such it is exceedingly close to previous theoretical and semi empirical estimates that place this value at   j molkresidue  the estimated backbone conformational entropy lost during the extension of two helical polyproteins which in contrast to the mechanically stable  sheet polyproteins rupture at very low applied forces is three to sixfold less either previous estimates of the backbone conformational entropy are significantly in error or the reduced mechanical strength of the helical proteins leads to the rupture of a subsequent domain before full extension and thus complete entropy loss is achieved
