high level production of functional antibody fab fragments in an oxidizing bacterial cytoplasm edited by j karn
the antigen binding fragments fab of antibodies are powerful tools in clinal therapy molecular diagnostics and basic research however their principal applications require pure recombinant molecules in large amounts which are challenging to obtain severe limitations in yield folding and functionality are commonly encountered in bacterial production of fab fragments secretion into the oxidizing periplasm generally results in low yield whereas expression in the reducing cytoplasmic environment produces unfolded or non functional protein we hypothesized that an impaired reducing environment of the cytoplasm would permit correctly folded functional cytoplasmic expression of fabs with high yield we used the escherichia coli strain fa   which has no activity of both thioredoxin and glutathione reductase and thus has an oxidizing cytoplasmic environment with the newly constructed vector pfab we tested the cytoplasmic expression of two fab fragments which recognize the integral membrane protein nhaa a bacterial na h antiporter these antibodies differ in terms of dna sequence and stability both antibody fragments were produced to very high yields    mg l from bacterial cultures at an a  nm       this is a factor    times higher than any other reported over expression strategy for fab fragments and currently represents the highest production rate ever been reported for antibody fab fragments in bacteria grown to similar cell densities the fragments are fully functional and can be efficiently purified by his tag chromatography expression of active fab fragments in the bacterial cytoplasm unlocks the possibility of using antibody specific targeting in an intracellular environment such a capacity opens new perspectives for investigating metabolic and regulatory pathways in vivo and also provides a powerful selection system for functional genomics
