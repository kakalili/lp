the effects of matrices of paired substitutions in mid acceptor stem on drosophila trnahis structure and end processing edited by m gottesman
end maturation reactions in which the   end leader and   end trailer of precursor trna are removed by rnase p and   trnase respectively are early essential steps in eukaryotic precursor trna processing end processing enzymes may be expected to contact the acceptor stem of trna due to its proximity to both cleavage sites we constructed matrices of pair wise substitutions in mid acceptor stem at nt   and   of drosophila trnahis and analyzed their ability to be processed by drosophila rnase p and   trnase in accord with our earlier study of d t loop processing matrices we find that trna end processing enzymes respond to sequence changes differently more processing defects were observed with   trnase than with rnase p and substitutions at   reduced processing more than those at    we evaluated trna folding using structure probing nucleases and investigated the contribution of km and vmax to the processing efficiency of selected variants in one substitution c a  mis folding correlates with processing defects in another c a  a disruption of structure appears to be transmitted laterally to both ends of the acceptor stem poor processing of c a by rnase p is due entirely to a reduction in vmax but for   trnase it is due to an increase in km
