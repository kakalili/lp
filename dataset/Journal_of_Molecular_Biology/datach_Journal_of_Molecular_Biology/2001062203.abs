birth of a gene locus of neuronal bc  snmrna in three prosimians and human bc  pseudogenes as archives of change in the anthropoidea lineage edited by m gottesman
the gene encoding brain specific dendritic bc  small non messenger rna is limited to the primate order and arose from a monomeric alu element it is present and neuronally expressed in all anthropoidea examined by comparing the human sequence of about   kb with each of the prosimian lemur   kb galago  kb and tarsier   kb orthologous loci we could establish that the bc  rna gene is absent from the prosimian lineages in strepsirhini lemurs and lorises  a dimeric aluj like element integrated very close to the bc  insertion point while the corresponding tarsier region is devoid of any repetitive element consequently insertion of the alu monomer that gave rise to the bc  rna gene must have occurred after the anthropoid lineage diverged from the prosimian lineage s  shared insertions of other repetitive elements favor proximity of simians and tarsiers in support of their grouping into haplorhini and the omomyid hypothesis on the other hand the nucleotide sequences in the segment that is available for comparison in all four species reveal less exchanges between strepsirhini lemur and galago and human than between tarsier and human our data imply that the early activity of dimeric alu sequences must have been concurrent with the activity of monomeric alu elements thapt persisted longer than is usually thought as bc  rna gave rise to more than   pseudogenes we used their consensus sequence variations as a molecular archive recording the bc  rna sequence changes in the anthropoid lineage leading to homo sapiens and timed these alterations over the past     million years
