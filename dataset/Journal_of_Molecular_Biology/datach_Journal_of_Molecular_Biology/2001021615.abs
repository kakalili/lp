identification of the domain in the human interleukin  receptor that mediates ligand binding edited by j a wells
the interleukin  receptor il  r belongs to the hematopoietic receptor superfamily the functional receptor complex comprises il   il  r and the signal transducing subunit gp   the extracellular part of the il  r consists of three domains an n terminal immunoglobulin like domain d  and two fibronectin type iii like fniii domains and d and d  the two fniii domains comprise the cytokine receptor homology region defined by a set of four conserved cysteine residues in the n terminal domain d  and a wsxws sequence motif in the c terminal domain d  we investigated the structural and functional role of the third extracellular receptor domain of il  r a molecular model of the human il  il  r complex allowed the identification of amino acid residues in il  r to be involved in ligand binding most of them were located in the third extracellular domain which therefore should be able to bind with high affinity to il   to prove this prediction domain d of the il  r was expressed in escherichia coli refolded and purified for structural characterization circular dichroism fluorescence and nmr spectroscopy were used by plasmon resonance experiments we show that the ligand binding capacity of this domain is as high as that one for the whole receptor these results provide a basis for further structural investigations that could be used for the rational design of potential agonists and antagonists essential in human therapy
