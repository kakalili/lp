structure of the catalytic a a fragment of the protein disulfide isomerase erp
protein disulfide isomerases pdis are responsible for catalyzing the proper oxidation and isomerization of disulfide bonds of newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum er  the er contains many different pdi like proteins some such as pdi are general enzymes that directly recognize misfolded proteins while others such as erp  and erp  have more specialized roles here we report the high resolution x ray crystal structure of the n terminal portion of erp  also known as cabp or pdi a  which contains two a a catalytic thioredoxin like domains the structure shows that the a domain contains an additional n terminal  strand and a different conformation of the      loop relative to other thioredoxin like domains the structure of the a domain reveals that a conserved arginine residue inserts into the hydrophobic core and makes a salt bridge with a conserved glutamate residue in the vicinity of the catalytic site a structural model of full length erp  shows that all three catalytic sites roughly face each other and positions the adjacent hydrophobic patches that are likely involved in protein substrate binding
