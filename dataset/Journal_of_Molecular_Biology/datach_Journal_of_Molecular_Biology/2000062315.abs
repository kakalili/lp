three dimensional reconstruction of transcription termination factor rho orientation of the n terminal domain and visualization of an rna binding site edited by w baumeister
the escherichia coli rho transcription termination protein is a hexameric helicase and is believed to function by separating an rna dna hybrid unlike hexameric dna helicases where a single strand of dna passes through the central channel it has been proposed that the rna wraps around the outside of the ring we have generated a three dimensional reconstruction of rho and localized a trna molecule bound to the primary rna binding site to the outside of the ring an atomic structure of the n terminal domain of rho fits into our reconstruction uniquely with the residues involved in rna binding on the outside of the ring although rho shares a common structural core with the f atpase and other hexameric helicases there has been a divergence in function due to rho  s n terminal domain which has no homology to other helicases
