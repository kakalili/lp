directed evolution of soluble single chain human class ii mhc molecules
major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecules are membrane anchored heterodimers that present antigenic peptides to t cells expression of these molecules in soluble form has met limited success presumably due to their large size heterodimeric structure and the presence of multiple disulfide bonds here we have used directed evolution and yeast surface display to engineer soluble single chain human lymphocyte antigen hla class ii mhc dr molecules without covalently attached peptides scdr    specifically a library of mutant scdr   molecules was generated by random mutagenesis and screened by fluorescence activated cell sorting facs with dr specific conformation sensitive antibodies yielding three well expressed and properly folded scdr   variants displayed on the yeast cell surface detailed analysis of these evolved variants and a few site directed mutants generated de novo indicated three amino acid residues in the   domain are important for the improved protein folding yield further molecular modeling studies suggested these mutations might increase the protein folding efficiency by improving the packing of a hydrophobic core in the    domain of dr  the scdr   mutants displayed on the yeast cell surface are remarkably stable and bind specifically to dr specific peptide ha     with high sensitivity and rapid kinetics in flow cytometric assays moreover since the expression stability and peptide binding properties of these mutants can be directly assayed on the yeast cell surface using immuno fluorescence labeling and flow cytometry time consuming purification and refolding steps of recombinant dr molecules are eliminated therefore these scdr   molecules will provide a powerful technology platform for further design of dr molecules with improved peptide binding specificity and affinity for therapeutic and diagnostic applications the methods described here should be generally applicable to other class ii mhc molecules and also class i mhc molecules for their functional expression characterization and engineering
