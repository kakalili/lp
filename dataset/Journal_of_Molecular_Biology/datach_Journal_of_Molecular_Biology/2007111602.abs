vanadium induces vl  retrotransposition at an unusually high level a possible carcinogenesis mechanism
carcinogenesis by vanadium is thought to occur through induction of dna double strand breaks dsbs but its mechanism is not fully understood we investigated the effect of vanadium on induction of viral like  element vl  retrotransposition using a nih t cell retrotransposition assay based on a recombinant vl  egfp element incubation of assay cells with vanadyl sulphate voso  induced retrotransposition frequency in a dose and time dependent manner measured by fluorescence activated cell scanning facs and retrotransposition events were confirmed by uv microscopy and pcr analysis among vanadium salts with different valence tested vanadyl   ions were the most potent retrotransposition inducers voso  at    m induced retrotranspositions at an unusually high frequency of up to    events per cell per generation voso  acting at the transcription level strongly induced vl  and endogenous reverse transcriptase enrt transcripts with maxima at    m and    m of  and  fold respectively voso induced retrotransposition frequency was inhibited by   with efavirenz an inhibitor of enrts while paraquat a dna dsbs inducer had no effect furthermore it was completely abolished with deferoxamine a metal chelator while reduced by   with n acetyl cysteine a general antioxidant remarkably h o reproduced inducible retrotransposition linking for the first time oxidative stress to induction of retrotransposition we propose that voso induced vl  retrotransposition through h o generation may be an alternative mutagenic dna dsbs independent mechanism leading to carcinogenesis
