the sv  capsid is stabilized by a conserved pentapeptide hinge of the major capsid protein vp
the simian virus   sv  outer shell is composed of  pentamers of vp  the core of the vp monomer is a  barrel with jelly roll topology and extending n and c terminal arms a pentapeptide hinge knpyp tethers the c arm to the vp   barrel core the five c arms that extend from each pentamer insert into the neighbouring pentamers tying them together through different types of interactions in the mature virion this element adopts either of six conformations according to their location in the capsid we found that the hinge is conserved among  members of the polyomaviridae attesting to its importance in capsid assembly and or structure we have used site directed mutagenesis to gain an understanding into the structural requirements of this element y  was changed to a f and t and p  to a and g the mutants showed reduction in viability to varying degrees unexpectedly assembly was reduced only to a small extent however the data showed that the mutants were highly unstable the largest effect was observed for mutations of p   indicating a role of the proline in the virion structure p  g was more unstable than p  a indicating a requirement for rigidity of the pentapeptide hinge y  t and y  a were more defective in viability than y  f highlighting the importance of an aromatic ring at this position structural inspection showed that this aromatic ring contacts c arms of neighbouring pentamers computational modelling predicted loss of stability of the y mutants in concordance with the experimental results this study provides insights into the structural details of the pentapeptide hinge that are responsible for capsid stability
