high resolution orientation and depth of insertion of the voltage sensing s helix of a potassium channel in lipid bilayers
the opening and closing of voltage gated potassium kv channels are controlled by several conserved arg residues in the s helix of the voltage sensing domain the interaction of these positively charged arg residues with the lipid membrane has been of intense interest for understanding how membrane proteins fold to allow charged residues to insert into lipid bilayers against free energy barriers using solid state nmr we have now determined the orientation and insertion depth of the s peptide of the kvap channel in lipid bilayers two dimensional  n correlation experiments of macroscopically oriented s peptide in phospholipid bilayers revealed a tilt angle of   and two possible rotation angles differing by    around the helix axis remarkably the tilt angle and one of the two rotation angles are identical to those of the s helix in the intact voltage sensing domain suggesting that interactions between the s segment and other helices of the voltage sensing domain are not essential for the membrane topology of the s helix  c   p distances between the s backbone and the lipid  p indicate a     local thinning and    average thinning of the dmpc   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphochloline dmpg   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphatidylglycerol bilayer consistent with neutron diffraction data moreover a short distance of     from the guanidinium c  of the second arg to  p indicates the existence of guanidinium phosphate hydrogen bonding and salt bridges these data suggest that the structure of the kv gating helix is mainly determined by protein  lipid interactions instead of interhelical protein  protein interactions and the s amino acid sequence encodes sufficient information for the membrane topology of this crucial gating helix
