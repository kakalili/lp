a thermodynamic and structural analysis of dna minor groove complex formation edited by i tinoco
as part of an effort to develop a better understanding of the structural and thermodynamic principles of dna minor groove recognition we have investigated complexes of three diphenylfuran dications with the d cgcgaattcgcg  duplex the parent compound furamidine db   has two amidine substituents while db  has cyclopentyl amidine substituents and db  has  pentyl amidines the structure for the db  dna complex is reported here and is compared to the structure of the db  complex crystals were not obtained with db  but information from the db  and db  structures as well as previous nmr results on db  indicate that all three compounds bind in the minor groove at the aatt site of the duplex db  and db  penetrate to the floor of the groove and form hydrogen bonds with t on one strand and t  on the opposite strand while db  forms a complex with fewer interactions binding studies by surface plasmon resonance spr yield   g  values in the order db   gt db  gt db  that are relatively constant with temperature the equilibrium binding constants for db  are    times greater than that for db   isothermal titration calorimetric itc experiments indicate that in contrast to  g   h  varies considerably with temperature to yield large negative  cp  values the thermodynamic results analyzed in terms of structures of the dna complexes provide an explanation of why db  binds more strongly to dna than db  while db  binds more weakly all three compounds have a major contribution to binding from hydrophobic interactions but the hydrophobic term is most favorable for db   db  also has strong contributions from molecular interactions in its dna complex and all of these factors combine to give it the largest   g  for binding although the factors that influence the energetics of minor groove interactions are varied and complex results from the literature coupled with those on the furan derivatives indicate that there are some common characteristics for minor groove recognition by unfused heterocyclic cations that can be used in molecular design
