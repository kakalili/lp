crystal structure of mouse md  with endogenous phospholipid bound in its cavity
md  is a glycoprotein that associates with a b cell specific rp  protein and has a low sequence identity of   to md  that associates with toll like receptor  and recognizes endotoxic lipopolysaccharide md  and rp  are supposed to mediate lipopolysaccharide recognition however little is known about their structures and functions here the crystal structure of mouse md  is determined at     resolution md  has a hydrophobic cavity sandwiched by two  sheets as is md  the cavity is    long    wide and    deep longer narrower and shallower than that of md  no charged residues are located on the cavity entrance md  is primarily monomeric in solution but shows a dimeric assembly in the crystal lattices with their cavity entrances facing each other in the cavity electron densities attributable to phosphatidylcholine are located together with the binding assay with tetra acylated lipid iva md  is shown to be a lipid binding coreceptor
