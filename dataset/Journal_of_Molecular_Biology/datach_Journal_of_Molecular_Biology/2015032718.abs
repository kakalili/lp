potent and specific peptide inhibitors of human pro survival protein bcl xl
the bcl  family of proteins plays a critical role regulating apoptosis and pro survival bcl  family members are important therapeutic targets due to their overexpression in different cancers pro apoptotic bcl  homology  bh  only proteins antagonize pro survival bcl  protein functions by binding directly to them and a sub class of bh only proteins termed sensitizers can initiate apoptosis via this mechanism in response to diverse signals the five pro survival proteins bcl xl mcl  bcl  bcl w and bfl  differ in their binding preferences with bcl xl bcl  and bcl w sharing similar interaction profiles for many natural sensitizers and small molecules peptides that bind selectively to just one or a subset of family members have shown utility in assays that diagnose apoptotic blockades in cancer cells and as reagents for dissecting apoptotic mechanism combining computational design combinatorial library screening and rational mutagenesis we designed a series of bh sensitizer peptides that bind bcl xl with sub nanomolar affinity and selectivity up to   fold over each of the four competing pro survival proteins we demonstrate the efficacy of our designed bh peptides in assays that differentiate between cancer cells that are dependent on different pro survival proteins
