modulation of t gene  protein dna binding activity by the recombination mediator protein uvsy
bacteriophage t uvsy is a recombination mediator protein that promotes assembly of the uvsx ssdna presynaptic filament uvsy helps uvsx to displace t gene  protein gp  from ssdna a reaction necessary for proper formation of the presynaptic filament here we use dna stretching to examine uvsy interactions with single dna molecules in the presence and absence of gp  and a gp  c terminal truncation  i  and show that in both cases uvsy is able to destabilize gp  ssdna interactions in these experiments uvsy binds more strongly to dsdna than ssdna due to its inability to wrap ssdna at high forces to support this hypothesis we show that ssdna created by exposure of stretched dna to glyoxal is strongly wrapped by uvsy but wrapping occurs only at low forces our results demonstrate that uvsy interacts strongly with stretched dna in the absence of other proteins in the presence of gp  and i uvsy is capable of strongly destabilizing gp  dna complexes in order to facilitate ssdna wrapping which in turn prepares the ssdna for presynaptic filament assembly in the presence of uvsx thus uvsy mediates uvsx binding to ssdna by converting rigid gp  dna filaments into a structure that can be strongly bound by uvsx
