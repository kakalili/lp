residual structures in the acid unfolded states of v  proteins affect amyloid fibrillation
many proteins form amyloid like fibrils in vitro under partially or highly unfolding conditions recently we showed that the residual structure in highly unfolded state is closely related to amyloid fibril formation in hen lysozyme thus to better understand the role of the residual structure on amyloid fibril formation we focused on al amyloidosis which results from the extracellular deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain variable domains vls as insoluble fibrils we examined the relationship between the residual structure and amyloid fibril formation on three   recombinant vl rv   proteins wild type jto and wil although rv  proteins are highly unfolded in ph    n nmr transverse relaxation experiments revealed nonrandom structures in regions which include some hydrophobic residues and a single disulfide bond indicating the existence of residual structure in rv  proteins however the residual structure of wil was markedly disrupted compared with those of the other proteins despite there being no significant differences in amino acid sequences fibrillation experiments revealed that wil had a longer lag time for fibril formation than the others when the single disulfide bond was reduced and alkylated the residual structure was largely disrupted and fibril formation was delayed in all three rv  proteins it was suggested that the residual structure in highly unfolded state has a crucial role in amyloid fibril formation in many proteins even pathogenic ones
