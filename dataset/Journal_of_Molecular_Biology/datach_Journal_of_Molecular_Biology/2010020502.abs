solution structure of an active mutant of maize ribosome inactivating protein mod and its interaction with the ribosomal stalk protein p
ribosome inactivating proteins rips are n glycosidases that depurinate a specific adenine residue in the conserved sarcin ricin loop of ribosomal rna this modification renders the ribosome unable to bind the elongation factors thereby inhibiting the protein synthesis maize rip a type iii rip is unique compared to the other type i and type ii rips because it is synthesized as a precursor with a  residue internal inactivation region which is removed in order to activate the protein in this study we describe the first solution structure of this type of rip a   kda active mutant of maize rip mod  the overall protein structure of mod is comparable to those of the other type i rips and the a chain of type ii rips but shows significant differences in specific regions including   shorter   and  b segments probably for accommodating easier substrate binding and   an  helix instead of an antiparallel  sheet in the c terminal domain which has been reported to be involved in binding ribosomal protein p in some rips furthermore nmr chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that the p binding site on mod is located at the n terminal domain near the internal inactivation region this relocation of the p binding site can be rationalized by concerted changes in the electrostatic surface potential and d structures on the mod protein and provides vital clues about the underlying molecular mechanism of this unique type of rip
