measuring transcription rate changes via time course  thiouridine pulse labelling improves transcriptional target identification
identifying changes in the transcriptional regulation of target genes from high throughput studies is important for unravelling molecular mechanisms controlled by a given perturbation when measuring global transcript levels only the effect of the perturbation e g  transcription factor tf overexpression or drug treatment on its target genes is often obscured by delayed feedback and secondary effects until the changes are fully propagated as a proof of principle we show that selective measuring of transcripts that are only synthesised after a perturbation  thiouridine  su sequencing  su seq  is a more sensitive method to identify targets and time dependent transcriptional responses than global transcript profiling by metabolically labelling rna in a time course setup we could vastly increase the sensitivity of mycn target gene detection compared to traditional rna sequencing the validity of targets identified by su seq was demonstrated using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and neuroblastoma microarray tumour data here we describe the methodology both molecular biology and computational aspects required to successfully apply this su seq approach
