polyglutamine aggregation behavior in vitro supports a recruitment mechanism of cytotoxicity edited by f cohen
in expanded cag repeat diseases such as huntington  s disease proteins containing polyglutamine poly gln  sequences with repeat lengths of about  residues or more are associated with development of both disease symptoms and neuronal intranuclear inclusions niis  disease physiology in animal and cellular models does not always correlate with nii formation however and the mechanism by which aggregate formation might lead to cytotoxicity is unknown to help evaluate various possible mechanisms we determined the biophysical properties of a series of simple poly gln peptides the circular dichroism spectra of poly gln peptides with repeat lengths of five     and  residues are all nearly identical and are consistent with a high degree of random coil structure suggesting that the length dependence of disease is not related to a conformational change in the monomeric states of expanded poly gln sequences in contrast there is a dramatic increase in both the kinetics and the thermodynamic favorability of the spontaneous formation of ordered amyloid like aggregates for poly gln peptides with repeat lengths of greater than  residues at the same time poly gln peptides with repeat lengths in the     residue range despite their poor abilities to support spontaneous self nucleated aggregation are capable of efficiently adding to an already formed aggregate we also find that morphologically small finely divided aggregates are much more efficient at recruiting poly gln peptides than are large aggregates suggesting a possible explanation for why disease pathology does not always correlate with the observable nii burden together these data are consistent with a model for disease pathology in which critical cellular proteins possessing poly gln sequences of modest length become inactivated when they are recruited into aggregates of an expanded poly gln protein
