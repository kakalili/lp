characterization of abasic endonuclease activity of human ape on alternative substrates as well as effects of atp and sequence context on ap site incision
human ape is a multifunctional protein with a major role in initiating repair of apurinic apyrimidinic ap sites in dna by catalyzing hydrolytic incision of the phosphodiester backbone immediately adjacent to the damage besides in double stranded dna ape has been shown to cleave at ap sites in single stranded regions of a number of biologically relevant dna conformations and in structured single stranded dna extension of these studies has revealed a more expansive repertoire of model substrates on which ape exerts ap endonuclease activity in particular ape possesses the ability to cleave at ap sites located in i the dna strand of a dna rna hybrid  ii   pseudo triplex  bubble substrates designed to mimic stalled replication or transcription intermediates and iii configurations that emulate r loop structures that arise during class switch recombination moreover ape was found to cleave ap site containing single stranded rna suggesting a novel  cleansing  function that may contribute to the elimination of detrimental cellular ap rna molecules finally sequence context immediately surrounding an abasic site in duplex dna was found to have a less than threefold effect on the incision efficiency of ape  and atp was found to exert complex effects on the endonuclease capacity of ape on double stranded substrates the results suggest that in addition to abasic sites in conventional duplex genomic dna ape has the ability to incise at ap sites in dna conformations formed during dna replication transcription and class switch recombination and that ape can endonucleolytically destroy damaged rna
