crystal structure of streptococcus suis dps like peroxide resistance protein dpr implications for iron incorporation
the dps like peroxide resistance protein dpr is an aerotolerance and hydrogen peroxide resistance agent found in the meningitis associated pathogen streptococcus suis dpr is believed to act by binding free intracellular iron to prevent fenton chemistry catalysed formation of toxic hydroxyl radicals the crystal structure of dpr has been determined to    resolution the final model has an rcryst value of    rfree    and consists of  identical monomers each of them comprising a four  helix bundle that form a hollow sphere obeying  symmetry structural features show that dpr belongs to the dps family of bacterial proteins twelve putative ferroxidase centers each formed at the interface of neighboring monomer pairs were identified in the dpr structure with structural similarities to those found in other dps family members dpr was crystallized in the absence of iron hence no bound iron was found in the structure in contrast to other dps family members a novel metal binding site approximately   from the ferroxidase centre was identified and assigned to a bound calcium ion two residues from the ferroxidase centre asp  and asp  were found to be involved in calcium binding structural comparison with other family members revealed that asp  and asp  adopt different conformation in the dpr structure the structure of dpr presented here shows potential local conformational changes that may occur during iron incorporation a role for the metal binding site in iron uptake is proposed
