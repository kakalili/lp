structure of the complex between her and an antibody paratope formed by side chains from tryptophan and serine
engineered antibody paratopes with limited sequence diversity permit assessment of the roles played by different amino acid side chains in creating the high affinity high specificity interactions characteristic of antibodies we describe a paratope raised against the human erbb family member her  using a binary diversity tryptophan serine library displayed on phage fab  binds to the extracellular domain of her with sub nanomolar affinity an x ray structure at     resolution reveals a contact paratope composed almost entirely of tryptophan and serine residues mutagenesis experiments reveal which of these side chains are more important for direct antigen interactions and which are more important for conformational flexibility the crystal lattice contains an unprecedented trimeric arrangement of her closely related to previously observed homodimers of the related epidermal growth factor receptor
