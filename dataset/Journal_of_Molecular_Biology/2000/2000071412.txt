The insulin-like growth factor II mRNAs are targets for site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage in the 3′-UTR, which results in a very stable 3′ cleavage product of 1.8 kb, consisting of 3′-UTR sequences and a poly(A) tail. The 5′ cleavage product contains the coding region and is rapidly degraded. Thus, cleavage is thought to provide an additional way to control IGF-II protein synthesis. We had established that cleavage requires two widely separated sequence elements (I and II) in the 3′-UTR that form a stable duplex of 83 nucleotides. The cleavage-site itself is located in an internal loop preceded by two stable stem-loop structures. Furthermore, in a study which was based on RNA folding algorithms, we have shown that there are specific sequence and structural requirements for the cleavage reaction. Here, the functions of the different structural domains in cleavage were assessed by deletion/mutational analyses, and biochemical structure probing assays were performed to characterize better the RNA structures formed and to verify the computer folding predictions. The data suggest that the stem-loop domain contributes to maintain a highly specific c leavage-site by preventing the formation of alternative structures in the cleavage-site domain. Involvement of the nucleotides in the cleavage-site loop itself in non-Watson-Crick interactions may be important for providing a specific recognition surface for an endoribonuclease activity.
