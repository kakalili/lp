m ldh serves as a regulatory subunit of the cytosolic substrate channelling complex in vivo
nucleoside diphosphate kinase a ndpk a regulates the   isoform of the amp activated protein kinase ampk   selectively independent of amp and surrounding atp  by a process termed substrate channelling here we show using a range of empirically validated biochemical techniques that the muscle form m ldh or ldh a and the heart form h ldh or ldh b of lactate dehydrogenase are physically associated with the liver cytosolic substrate channelling complex such that m ldh associates with ndpk a ampk   and casein kinase  ck  whereas h ldh associates with local ndpk b we find that the species of ldh bound to the substrate channelling complex regulates the in vivo enzymatic activities of both ampk and ck  and has a downstream effect on the phospho status of acetyl coa carboxylase a key regulator of cellular fat metabolism known to be a part of the cytosolic substrate channelling complex in vivo we hypothesise that the regulatory presence of ldh in the complex couples the substrate channelling mechanism to both the glycolytic and redox states of the cell allowing for efficient sensing of cell metabolic status interfacing with the substrate channelling complex and regulating the enzymatic activities of ampk and ck  two critical protein kinases
