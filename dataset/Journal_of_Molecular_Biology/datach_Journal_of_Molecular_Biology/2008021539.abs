hsdr subunit of the type i restriction modification enzyme ecor  i biophysical characterisation and structural modelling
type i restriction modification rm systems are large multifunctional enzymes composed of three different subunits hsds and hsdm form a complex in which hsds recognizes the target dna sequence and hsdm carries out methylation of adenosine residues the hsdr subunit when associated with the hsds hsdm complex translocates dna in an atp dependent process and cleaves unmethylated dna at a distance of several thousand base pairs from the recognition site the molecular mechanism by which these enzymes translocate the dna is not fully understood in part because of the absence of crystal structures to date crystal structures have been determined for the individual hsds and hsdm subunits and models have been built for the hsdm  hsds complex with the dna however no structure is available for the hsdr subunit in this work the gene coding for the hsdr subunit of ecor  i was re sequenced which showed that there was an error in the published sequence this changed the position of the stop codon and altered the last  amino acid residues of the protein sequence an improved purification procedure was developed to enable hsdr to be purified efficiently for biophysical and structural analysis analytical ultracentrifugation shows that hsdr is monomeric in solution and the frictional ratio of   indicates that the subunit is globular and fairly compact small angle neutron scattering of the hsdr subunit indicates a radius of gyration of   nm and a maximum dimension of   nm we constructed a model of the hsdr using protein fold recognition and homology modelling to model individual domains and small angle neutron scattering data as restraints to combine them into a single molecule the model reveals an ellipsoidal shape of the enzymatic core comprising the n terminal and central domains and suggests conformational heterogeneity of the c terminal region implicated in binding of hsdr to the hsds  hsdm complex
