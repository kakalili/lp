substrate complexes of hepatitis c virus rna polymerase hc j  structural evidence for nucleotide import and de novo initiation
several crystal structures of the hepatitis c virus ns b protein genotype b strain j  complexed with metal ions single stranded rna or nucleoside triphosphates have been determined these complexes illustrate how conserved amino acid side chains together with essential structural features within the active site control nucleotide binding and likely mediate de novo initiation the incoming nucleotide interacts with several basic residues from an extension on the ns b fingers domain a  hairpin from the ns b thumb domain and the c terminal arm the modular bi partite fingers domain carries a long binding groove which guides the template towards the catalytic site the apo polymerase structure provides unprecedented insights into potential non nucleoside inhibitor binding sites located between palm and thumb near motif e which is unique to rna polymerases and reverse transcriptases
