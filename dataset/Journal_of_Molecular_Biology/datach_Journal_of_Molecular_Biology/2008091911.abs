an allosteric circuit in caspase
structural studies of caspase  reveal that the dimeric thiol protease can exist in two states in an on state when the active site is occupied or in an off state when the active site is empty or when the enzyme is bound by a synthetic allosteric ligand at the dimer interface      from the active site a network of  hydrogen bonds from nine side chains connecting the active and allosteric sites change partners when going between the on state and the off state alanine scanning mutagenesis of these nine side chains shows that only two of them  arg  and glu   which form a salt bridge  have major effects causing   to   fold reductions in catalytic efficiency kcat km  two neighbors ser  and ser   have minor effects causing  to  fold reductions a more detailed mutational analysis reveals that the enzyme is especially sensitive to substitutions of the salt bridge even a homologous r  k substitution causes a   fold reduction in kcat km x ray crystal structures of these variants suggest the importance of both the salt bridge interaction and the coordination of solvent water molecules near the allosteric binding pocket thus only a small subset of side chains from the larger hydrogen bonding network is critical for activity these form a contiguous set of interactions that run from one active site through the allosteric site at the dimer interface and onto the second active site this subset constitutes a functional allosteric circuit or  hot wire  that promotes site to site coupling
