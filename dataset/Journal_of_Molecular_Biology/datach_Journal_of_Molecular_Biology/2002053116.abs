dna polymerase  purified from human cells is a high fidelity enzyme
with the aim to identify unconventional dna polymerases from human cells we have set up a special assay to fractionate hela extracts based on the ability i to bypass dna lesions  ii to be resistant to aphidicolin and an inhibitory antibody against pol  and iii to be non responsive to proliferating cell nuclear antigen after eight different chromatographic steps an aphidicolin resistant dna polymerase activity was obtained that was able to utilize either undamaged or abasic sites containing dna with the same efficiency biochemical characterization and immunoblot analysis allowed its identification as the human homologue of dna polymerase   hpol   whose cdna has been cloned by homology with the mus  gene of drosophila melanogaster but still awaited detailed biochemical characterization the purified hpol  was devoid of detectable helicase activity possessed a       exonuclease activity and showed biochemical properties clearly distinct from any other eukaryotic dna polymerase known so far misincorporation and fidelity assays showed that  i hpol  was able to catalyze efficiently dna synthesis past an abasic site and ii hpol  showed high fidelity our findings are discussed in light of the proposed physiological role of hpol
