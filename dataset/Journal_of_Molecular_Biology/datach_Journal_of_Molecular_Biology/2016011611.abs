correct assembly of the bacteriophage t procapsid requires both the maturation protease and the portal complex
the  nm diameter capsid of coliphage t is organized with t  icosahedral geometry and encloses a double stranded dna genome that measures  kbp its assembly follows a path similar to that of phage hk  but yielding a larger structure that includes   subunits of the major head protein   subunits of the portal protein and   subunits of the decoration protein as for phage hk  t encodes the scaffold function as an n terminal extension   domain to the major head protein that is cleaved by the maturation protease after assembly of the initial prohead i form and prior to dna packaging and capsid expansion although the major head protein alone is sufficient to assemble capsid like particles the yield is poor and includes many deformed structures here we explore the role of both the portal and the protease in capsid assembly by generating constructs that include the major head protein and a combination of protease wild type or an inactive mutant and portal proteins and overexpressing them in escherichia coli our results show that the inactive protease mutant acts to trigger assembly of the major head protein probably through binding to the   domain while the portal protein regulates assembly into the correct t  geometry a cryo electron microscopy reconstruction of prohead i including inactivated protease reveals density projecting from the prohead interior surface toward its center that is compatible with the   domain as well as additional internal density that we assign as the inactivated protease these results reveal complexity in t beyond that of the hk  system
