the structure and function of a novel glycerophosphodiesterase from enterobacter aerogenes
the structure of the glycerophosphodiesterase gdpd from enterobacter aerogenes gpdq has been solved by sad phasing from the active site metal ions structural analysis indicates that gpdq belongs to the    sandwich metallo phosphoesterase family rather than the     barrel gdpd family suggesting that gpdq is a structurally novel gdpd hexameric gpdq is generated by interactions between three dimers the dimers are formed through domain swapping stabilised by an inter chain disulfide bond and  sheet extension the active site contains a binuclear metal centre with a fully occupied  metal ion site and partially occupied  metal ion site as revealed by anomalous scattering analysis using a combination of tls refinement and normal mode analysis the dynamic movement of gpdq was investigated this analysis suggests that the hexameric quaternary structure stabilises the base of the dimer which promotes  breathing  of the active site cleft comparison with other metallo phosphodiesterases shows that although the central catalytic domain is highly conserved many of these enzymes possess structurally unrelated secondary domains located at the entrance of the active site we suggest that this could be a common structural feature of metallo phosphodiesterases that constrains substrate specificity preventing non specific phosphodiester hydrolysis
