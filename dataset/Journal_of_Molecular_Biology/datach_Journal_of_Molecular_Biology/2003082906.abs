dna looping and physical constraints on transcription regulation
dna looping participates in transcriptional regulation for instance by allowing distal binding sites to act synergistically here we study this process and compare different regulatory mechanisms based on repression with and without looping within a simple mathematical model for the lac operon we show that regulation based on dna looping in addition to increasing the repression level can reduce the fluctuations of transcription and at the same time decrease the sensitivity to changes in the number of regulatory proteins looping is thus able to circumvent some of the constraints inherent to mechanisms based solely on binding to a single operator site and provides a mechanism to regulate the average properties of transcription and its fluctuations
