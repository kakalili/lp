In the presence of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) damage, many DNA polymerases exhibit a dual coding potential which facilitates efficient incorporation of matched dCTP or mismatched dATP. This also holds true for the insertion of 8-oxodGTP opposite template bases dC and dA. Employing single-turnover kinetic methods, we examined human DNA polymerase β and its novel X-family homolog, human DNA polymerase λ, to determine which nucleotide and template base was preferred when encountering 8-oxodG and 8-oxodGTP, respectively. While DNA polymerase β preferentially incorporated dCTP over dATP, DNA polymerase λ did not modulate a preference for either dCTP or dATP when opposite 8-oxodG in single-nucleotide gapped DNA, as incorporation proceeded with essentially equal efficiency and probability. Moreover, DNA polymerase λ is more efficient than DNA polymerase β to fill this oxidized single-nucleotide gap. Insertion of 8-oxodGTP by both DNA polymerases λ and β occurred predominantly against template dA, thereby reiterating how the asymmetrical design of the polymerase active site differentially accommodated the anti and syn conformations of 8-oxodG and 8-oxodGTP. Although the electronegative oxygen at the C8 position of 8-oxodG may induce DNA structural perturbations, human DNA ligase I was found to effectively ligate the incorporated 8-oxodGMP to a downstream strand, which sealed the nicked DNA. Consequently, the erroneous nucleotide incorporations catalyzed by DNA polymerases λ and β as well as the subsequent ligation catalyzed by a DNA ligase during base excision repair are a threat to genomic integrity.
