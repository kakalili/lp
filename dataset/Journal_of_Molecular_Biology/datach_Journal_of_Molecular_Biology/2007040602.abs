insight into host cell carbohydrate recognition by human and porcine rotavirus from crystal structures of the virion spike associated carbohydrate binding domain vp
rotavirus infection leads to the death of half a million children annually the exact specifics of interaction between rotavirus particles and host cells enabling invasion and infection have remained elusive host cell oligosaccharides are critical components and their involvement aids the virus in cell recognition and attachment as well as dictation of the remarkable host specificity that rotaviruses demonstrate interaction between the rotavirus spike protein carbohydrate binding domain vp  and cell surface oligosaccharides facilitate virus recognition of host cells and attachment rotaviruses are considered controversially to recognise vastly different carbohydrate structures and either with incorporation of terminal sialic acid or without as assessed by their ability to infect cells that have been pre treated with sialidases herein the x ray crystallographic structures of vp  from the sialidase insensitive wa and the sialidase sensitive crw  rotavirus strains that cause debilitating gastroenteritis in human and pig are reported striking differences are apparent regarding recognition of the sialic acid derivative methyl  d n acetylneuraminide presenting the first experimental evidence of the inability of the human rotavirus strain to bind this monosaccharide that correlates with wa and crw  recognising sialidase resistant and sialidase sensitive receptors respectively identified are structural features that provide insight in attainment of substrate specificity exhibited by porcine strains as compared to rhesus rotavirus revealed in the crw  vp  structure is an additional bound ligand that intriguingly is within a cleft located equivalent to the carbohydrate binding region of galectins and is suggestive of a new region for interaction with cell surface carbohydrates this novel result and detailed comparison of our representative sialidase sensitive crw  and insensitive wa vp  structures with those reported leads to our hypothesis that this groove is used for binding carbohydrates and that for the human strains as for other sialidase insensitive strains could represent a major oligosaccharide binding region
