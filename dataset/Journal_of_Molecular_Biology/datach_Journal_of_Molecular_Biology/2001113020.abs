the n terminal atpase site in the large terminase protein gp  is critically required for dna packaging in bacteriophage t  edited by m gottesman
double stranded dna packaging in bacteriophages is apparently driven by the most powerful molecular motor ever measured although it is widely accepted that a translocating atpase powers the dna packaging machine the identity of the atpase that generates this driving force is unknown evidence suggests that the large terminase protein gp  which possesses two consensus atp binding motifs and an atpase activity is a strong candidate for the translocating atpase in bacteriophage t  this hypothesis was tested by a pcr directed combinatorial mutagenesis approach in which mutant libraries consisting of all possible codon combinations were constructed at the signature residues of the atp binding motifs the impact on gp  function of each randomly selected mutant was evaluated by phenotypic analysis following recombinational transfer into the viral genome the precise mutation giving rise to a particular phenotype was determined by dna sequencing the data showed that the n terminal atp binding site i srqlgkt      but not the atp binding site ii taavegks      is critical for gp  function even conservative substitutions such as g  a k  r and t  a were not tolerated at the gkt signature residues which are predicted to interact with the atp substrate biochemical analyses of the mutants showed a complete loss of in vitro dna packaging activity but not the terminase dna cutting activity the purified k  g mutant showed a loss of gp  atpase activity the data for the first time implicated a specific atpase center in the viral dsdna packaging
