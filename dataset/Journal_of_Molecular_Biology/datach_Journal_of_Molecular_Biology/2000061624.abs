fluorescence energy transfer indicates similar transient and equilibrium intermediates in staphylococcal nuclease folding edited by c r matthews
fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret is one of the few methods available to measure the rate at which a folding protein collapses using staphylococcal nuclease in which a cysteine residue was engineered in place of lys  permitted fret measurements of the distance between the donor tryptophan   and     iodoacetyl amino ethyl amino naphthalene  sulfonic acid labeled cys  these measurements were undertaken on both equilibrium partially folded intermediates at low ph a states  as well as transient intermediates during stopped flow refolding the results indicate that there is an initial collapse of the protein in the deadtime of the stopped flow instrument corresponding to a regain of     of the native signal followed by three slower transients this is in contrast to circular dichroism measurements which show only      regain of the native secondary structure in the burst phase thus hydrophobic collapse precedes the formation of substantial secondary structure the first two detected transient intermediate species have fret properties essentially identical with those of the previously characterized equilibrium a state intermediates suggesting similar structures between the equilibrium and transient intermediates the effects of anions on the folding of acid unfolded staphylococcal nuclease and urea on the unfolding of the resulting a states indicates that in folding the protein becomes compact prior to formation of major secondary structure whereas in unfolding the protein expands prior to major loss of secondary structure comparison of the kinetics of refolding of staphylococcal nuclease monitored by fret and for a proline free variant indicate that folding occurs via two partially folded intermediates leading to a native like species with one or more proline residues in a non native conformation for the a states an excellent correlation between compactness measured by fret and compactness determined from small angle x ray scattering was observed further a linear relationship between compactness and free energy of unfolding was noted formation of soluble aggregates of the a states led to dramatic enhancement of the fret consistent with intermolecular fluorescence energy transfer
