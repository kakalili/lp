thermodynamics of the coil    sheet transition in a membrane environment
biologically important peptides such as the alzheimer peptide a      display a reversible random coil    structure transition at anionic membrane surfaces in contrast to the well studied random coil    helix transition of amphipathic peptides there is a dearth on information on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the random coil    structure transition here we present a new method to quantitatively analyze the thermodynamic parameters of the membrane induced  structure formation we have used the model peptide kigaki  and eight analogues in which two adjacent amino acids were substituted by their d enantiomers the positions of the d d pairs were shifted systematically along the three identical segments of the peptide chain the  structure content of the peptides was measured in solution and when bound to anionic lipid membranes with circular dichroism spectroscopy the thermodynamic binding parameters were determined with isothermal titration calorimetry and the binding isotherms were analysed by combining a surface partition equilibrium with the gouy  chapman theory the thermodynamic parameters were found to be linearly correlated with the extent of  structure formation   structure formation at the membrane surface is characterized by an enthalpy change of  h      kcal mol per residue an entropy change of  s      cal mol k residue and a free energy change of  g      kcal mol residue an increase in temperature induces an unfolding of  structure the residual free energy of membrane induced  structure formation is close to that of membrane induced  helix formation
