characterisation of the conformational properties of urea unfolded im  implications for the early stages of protein folding
the colicin immunity protein im folds from its unfolded state in  m urea to its native four helix structure through an on pathway intermediate that lacks one of the helices of the native structure helix iii  in order to further characterize the folding mechanism of im  we have studied the conformational properties of the protein unfolded in  m urea in detail using heteronuclear nmr triple resonance experiments with  c  n labelled im in  m urea provided almost complete resonance assignments for the backbone nuclei and measurement of backbone  n relaxation parameters allowed dynamic ordering of the unfolded polypeptide chain to be investigated reduced spectral density mapping and fitting backbone r relaxation rates to a polymer dynamics model identified four clusters of interacting residues each predicted by the average area buried upon folding for each residue chemical shift analyses and measurement of noes detected with a long mixing time h h  n noesy hsqc spectrum confirmed the formation of four clusters each cluster of interacting side chains in urea unfolded im occurs in a region of the protein that forms a helix in the protein with the largest clusters being associated with the three long helices that are formed in the on pathway folding intermediate whilst the smallest cluster forms a helix only in the native state nmr studies of a phe ala im variant and a protein in which residues     are replaced by three glycine residues h g im   indicated that the clusters do not interact with each other possibly because they are solvated by urea as indicated by analysis of noes between the protein and the solvent based on these data we suggest that dilution of the chaotrope to initiate refolding will result in collapse of the clusters leading to the formation of persistent helical structure and the generation of the three helix folding intermediate
