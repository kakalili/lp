AFP1 is a recently discovered anti-fungal, chitin-binding protein from Streptomyces tendae Tü901. Mature AFP1 comprises 86 residues and exhibits limited sequence similarity to the cellulose-binding domains of bacterial cellulases and xylanases. No similarity to the Cys and Gly-rich domains of plant chitin-binding proteins (e.g. agglutinins, lectins, hevein) is observed. AFP1 is the first chitin-binding protein from a bacterium for which anti-fungal activity was shown. Here, we report the three-dimensional solution structure of AFP1, determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein contains two antiparallel β-sheets (five and four β-strands each), that pack against each other in a parallel β-sandwich. This type of architecture is conserved in the functionally related family II of cellulose-binding domains, albeit with different connectivity. A similar fold is also observed in other unrelated proteins (spore coat protein from Myxococcus xanthus, β-B2 and γ-B crystallins from Bos taurus, canavalin from Jack bean). AFP1 is therefore classified as a new member of the βγ-crystallin superfamily. The dynamics of the protein was characterized by NMR using amide 15N relaxation and solvent exchange data. We demonstrate that the protein exhibits an axially symmetric (oblate-like) rotational diffusion tensor whose principal axis coincides to within 15° with that of the inertial tensor. After completion of the present structure of AFP1, an identical fold was reported for a Streptomyces killer toxin-like protein. Based on sequence comparisons and clustering of conserved residues on the protein surface for different cellulose and chitin-binding proteins, we postulate a putative sugar-binding site for AFP1. The inability of the protein to bind short chitin fragments suggests that certain particular architectural features of the solid chitin surface are crucial for the interaction.
