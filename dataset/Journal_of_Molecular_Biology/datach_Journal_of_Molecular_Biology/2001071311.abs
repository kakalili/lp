analysis of the nf  b p  dimer interface by diversity screening edited by j wells
an in vivo screen has been devised for nf  b p  activity in escherichia coli exploiting the ability of the mammalian transcription factor to emulate a prokaryotic repressor active intracellular p  was shown to repress the expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene allowing for visual screening of colonies expressing active p  on agar plates a library of mutants was constructed in which the residues y   l   a  and v  of the dimer interface were simultaneously randomised and twenty five novel functional interfaces were selected which repressed the reporter gene to similar levels as the wild type protein the leucine   alanine   core was repeatedly but not exclusively selected from the library whilst a diversity of predominantly non polar residues were selected at positions   and   these results indicate that l  and a  may form a hot spot of interaction and allow an insight into the processes of dimer selectivity and evolution within this family of transcription factors
