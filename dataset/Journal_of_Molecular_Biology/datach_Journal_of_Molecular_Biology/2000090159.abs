the effect of intracellular molybdenum in hydrogenophaga pseudoflava on the crystallographic structure of the seleno molybdo iron sulfur flavoenzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase edited by d rees
crystal structures of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase codh  a seleno molybdo iron sulfur flavoprotein from the aerobic carbon monoxide utilizing carboxidotrophic eubacterium hydrogenophaga pseudoflava have been determined from the enzyme synthesized at high moplus codh and low intracellular molybdenum content mominus codh at     and    resolution respectively the structures were solved by patterson search methods utilizing the enzyme from oligotropha carboxidovorans as the initial model the codhs from both sources are structurally very much conserved and show the same overall fold architecture and arrangements of the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide type of molybdenum cofactor the type i and type ii  fe s clusters and the flavin adenine dinucleotide unlike the codh from o carboxidovorans the enzyme from h pseudoflava reveals a unique post translationally modified c  hydroxy arg  residue which precedes the catalytically essential s selanyl cys  in the active site loop in addition the trp  which shields the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin adenine dinucleotide in the m subunit of the h pseudoflava codh is a tyr  in the o carboxidovorans codh the hydrogen bonding interaction pattern of the molybdenum cofactor involves  hydrogen bonds with the surrounding protein of these eight are with the cytosine moiety eight with the pyrophosphate six with the pyranopterin and five with the ligands of the mo ion the structure of the catalytically inactive mominus codh indicates that an intracellular mo deficiency affects exclusively the active site of the enzyme as an incomplete non functional molybdenum cofactor was synthesized the   cdp residue was present in mominus codh whereas the mo pyranopterin moiety was absent in moplus codh the selenium faces the mo ion and flips away from the mo site in mominus codh the different side chain conformations of the active site residues s selanyl cys  and glu  in moplus and mominus codh indicate a side chain flexibility and a function of the mo ion in the proper orientation of both residues
