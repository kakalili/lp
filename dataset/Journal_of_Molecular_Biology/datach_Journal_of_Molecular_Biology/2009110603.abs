deciphering the distinct role for the metal coordination motif in the catalytic activity of mycobacterium smegmatis topoisomerase i
mycobacterium smegmatis topoisomerase i mstopoi is distinct from typical type ia topoisomerases the enzyme binds to both single and double stranded dna with high affinity making specific contacts the enzyme comprises conserved regions similar to type ia topoisomerases from escherichia coli and other eubacteria but lacks the typically found zinc fingers in the carboxy terminal domain the enzyme can perform dna cleavage in the absence of mg  but religation needs exogenously added mg  one molecule of mg  tightly bound to the enzyme has no role in dna cleavage but is needed only for the religation reaction the toprim topoisomerase  primase domain in mstopoi comprising the mg  binding pocket conserved in both type ia and type ii topoisomerases was subjected to mutagenesis to understand the role of mg  in different steps of the reaction the residues d   d   and e  of the enzyme which form the acidic triad in the dxdxe motif were changed to alanines d  a mutation resulted in an enzyme that is mg  dependent for dna cleavage unlike mstopoi and exhibited enhanced dna cleavage property and reduced religation activity the mutant was toxic for cell growth most likely due to the imbalance in cleavage  religation equilibrium in contrast the e  a mutant behaved like wild type enzyme cleaving dna in a mg  independent fashion albeit to a reduced extent intra and intermolecular religation assays indicated specific roles for d  and e  residues during the reaction together these results indicate that the d  residue has a major role during cleavage and religation while e  is important for enhancing the efficiency of cleavage thus although architecturally and mechanistically similar to topoisomerase i from e coli the metal coordination pattern of the mycobacterial enzyme is distinct opening up avenues to exploit the enzyme to develop inhibitors
