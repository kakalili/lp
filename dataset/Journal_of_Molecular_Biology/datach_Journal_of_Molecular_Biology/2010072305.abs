crystal structure of fatty acid amide hydrolase bound to the carbamate inhibitor urb   discovery of a deacylating water molecule and insight into enzyme inactivation
the endocannabinoid system regulates a wide range of physiological processes including pain inflammation and cognitive emotional states urb  is one of the best characterized covalent inhibitors of the endocannabinoid degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase faah  here we report the structure of the faah  urb  complex at     resolution the structure provides insights into mechanistic details of enzyme inactivation and experimental evidence of a previously uncharacterized active site water molecule that likely is involved in substrate deacylation this water molecule is part of an extensive hydrogen bonding network and is coordinated indirectly to residues lining the cytosolic port of the enzyme in order to corroborate our hypothesis concerning the role of this water molecule in faah s catalytic mechanism we determined the structure of faah conjugated to a urea based inhibitor pf    to a higher resolution      than previously reported the higher resolution structure confirms the presence of the water molecule in a virtually identical location in the active site examination of the structures of serine hydrolases that are non homologous to faah such as elastase trypsin or chymotrypsin shows a similarly positioned hydrolytic water molecule and suggests a functional convergence between the amidase signature enzymes and serine proteases
