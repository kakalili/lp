human transcriptional coactivator pc stimulates dna end joining and activates dsb repair activity
human transcriptional coactivator pc is a highly abundant nuclear protein that is involved in diverse cellular processes ranging from transcription to chromatin organization earlier we have shown that pc  a positive activator of p  overexpresses upon genotoxic insult in a p  dependent manner in the present study we show that pc stimulates ligase mediated dna end joining irrespective of the source of dna ligase pull down assays reveal that pc helps in the association of dna ends through its c terminal domain in vitro nonhomologous end joining assays with cell free extracts show that pc enhances the joining of noncomplementary dna ends interestingly we found that pc activates double strand break dsb repair activity through stimulation of dsb rejoining in vivo together these findings demonstrate pc as an activator of nonhomologous end joining and dsb repair activity
