ligand binding and activation in a prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide modulated channel
we designed a technique that directly determines binding of cyclic nucleotides to the prokaryotic cyclic nucleotide modulated ion channel mlok  the ability to purify large quantities of mlok facilitated equilibrium binding assays which avoided the inherent problem of relatively low affinity binding which hindered the use of eukaryotic channels we found that mlok specifically binds camp and cgmp with affinity values in the range of those observed for activity assays for eukaryotic channels notably the concentration of ligand that elicited   of maximum response in  rb flux assays k   also referred to as ligand sensitivity was smaller than the corresponding value obtained from binding assays kd potentially indicating significant channel activity in partially liganded states to gain further insight into the mechanism of binding and activation of these channels we mutated several amino acids in the ligand binding pocket of mlok  known from electrophysiological studies of homologous eukaryotic channels to affect ligand selectivity and binding efficacy the s  v mlok mutant a mutation which decreases cgmp selectivity in eukaryotic channels decreased both the observed cgmp binding affinity and the sensitivity to cgmp relative to the wild type wt channel leaving those for camp unchanged conversely the a  d mlok mutant a mutation which increases cgmp selectivity in eukaryotic channels increased both the affinity and the sensitivity for cgmp relative to the wt channel again leaving those for camp unchanged mutations at r  in mlok  the most conserved residue in the binding pocket of cyclic nucleotide binding proteins were not tolerated as these mutants do not form functional channels furthermore for each mutation changes in binding affinities were mirrored by equivalent changes in ligand sensitivity these data together with the evidence that partially liganded channels open significantly suggested strong coupling between cyclic nucleotide binding and mlok channel opening
