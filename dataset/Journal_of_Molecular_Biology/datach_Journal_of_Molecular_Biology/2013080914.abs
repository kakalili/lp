the long range p helix of the tetrahymena ribozyme is disrupted during folding between the native and misfolded conformations
rnas are prone to misfolding but how misfolded structures are formed and resolved remains incompletely understood the tetrahymena group i intron ribozyme folds in vitro to a long lived misfolded conformation m that includes extensive native structure but is proposed to differ in topology from the native state n  a leading model predicts that exchange of the topologies requires unwinding of the long range core helix p  despite the presence of p in both conformations to test this model we constructed  mutations to strengthen or weaken p  catalytic activity and in line probing showed that nearly all of the mutants form the m state before folding to n the p weakening mutations accelerated refolding from m   to  fold and the p strengthening mutations slowed refolding   to   fold  suggesting that p indeed unwinds transiently upon depletion of mg  the mutations had analogous effects on unfolding from n to intermediates that subsequently fold to m the magnitudes for the p weakening mutations were larger than in refolding from m and small angle x ray scattering showed that the ribozyme expands rapidly to intermediates from which p is disrupted subsequently these results are consistent with previous results indicating unfolding of native peripheral structure during refolding from m which probably permits rearrangement of the core together our results demonstrate that exchange of the native and misfolded conformations requires loss of a core helix in addition to peripheral structure further the results strongly suggest that misfolding arises from a topological error within the ribozyme core and a specific topology is proposed
