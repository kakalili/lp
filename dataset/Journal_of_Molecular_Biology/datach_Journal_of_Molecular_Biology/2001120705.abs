three dimensional structures of the mn and mg dtdp complexes of the family gt  glycosyltransferase spsa a comparison with related ndp sugar glycosyltransferases edited by r huber
the vast majority of glycosidic bond synthesis in nature is performed by glycosyltransferases which use activated glycosides as the sugar donor typically the activated leaving group is a nucleoside phosphate lipid phosphate or phosphate the nucleotide sugar dependent glycosyltransferases fall into over  sequence based families with the largest and most widespread family of inverting transferases named family gt  here we present the three dimensional crystal structure of spsa the first and currently the only structural representative from family gt  in complex with both mn dtdp and mg dtdp at a resolution of    these structures reveal how spsa and related enzymes may display nucleotide plasticity and permit a comparison of the catalytic centre of this enzyme with those from related sequence families whose three dimensional structures have recently been determined family gt  enzymes together with enzymes from families    and   appear to form a clan of related structures with identical catalytic apparatus and reaction mechanism
