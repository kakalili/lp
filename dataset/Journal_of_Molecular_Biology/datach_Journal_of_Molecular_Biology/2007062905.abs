when the surface tells what lies beneath combinatorial phage display mutagenesis reveals complex networks of surface  core interactions in the pacifastin protease inhibitor family
pacifastin protease inhibitors are small cysteine rich motifs of    residues that were discovered in arthropods the family is divided into two related groups on the basis of the composition of their minimalist inner core in group i the core is governed by a lys   trp  interaction while in group ii it is organized around phe  group i inhibitors exhibit intriguing taxon specificity potent arthropod trypsin inhibitors from this group are almost inactive against vertebrate enzymes the group i member sgpi  and the group ii member sgpi  are extensively studied inhibitors sgpi  is taxon selective while sgpi  is not individual mutations failed to explain the causes underlying this difference we deciphered this phenomenon using comprehensive combinatorial mutagenesis and phage display we produced a complete chimeric sgpi   sgpi  inhibitor phage library in which the two sequences were shuffled at the highest possible resolution of individual residues the library was selected for binding to bovine trypsin and crayfish trypsin sequence analysis of the selectants revealed that taxon specificity is due to an intra molecular functional coupling between a surface loop and the lys  trp  core five sgpi  surface residues transplanted into sgpi  resulted in a variant that retained the  taxon specific  core but potently inhibited both vertebrate and arthropod enzymes an additional rational point mutation resulted in a picomolar inhibitor of both trypsins our results challenge the generally accepted view that surface residues are the exclusive source of selectivity for canonical inhibitors moreover we provide important insights into general principles underlying the structure  function properties of small disulfide rich polypeptides molecules that exist at the borderline between peptides and proteins
