structural energetics of the adenine tract from an intrinsic transcription terminator
intrinsic transcription termination sites generally contain a tract of adenines in the dna template that yields a tract of uracils at the   end of the nascent rna to understand how this base sequence contributes to termination of transcription we have investigated two nucleic acid structures the first is the rna  dna hybrid that contains the uracil tract   ruuuuuau   from the tr intrinsic terminator of bacteriophage   the second is the homologous dna  dna duplex that contains the adenine tract   dataaaaa    this duplex is present at the tr site when the dna is not transcribed the opening and the stability of each ru da dt da base pair in the two structures are characterized by imino proton exchange and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the results reveal concerted opening of the central ru da base pairs in the rna  dna hybrid furthermore the stability profile of the adenine tract in the rna  dna hybrid is very different from that of the tract in the template dna  dna duplex in the rna  dna hybrid the stabilities of ru da base pairs range from   to   kcal mol at    c  the sites of lowest stability are identified at the central positions of the tract in the template dna  dna duplex the dt da base pairs are more stable than the corresponding ru da base pairs in the hybrid by   to   kcal mol and in contrast to the rna  dna hybrid the central base pairs have the highest stability these results suggest that the central ru da dt da base pairs in the adenine tract make the largest energetic contributions to transcription termination by promoting both the dissociation of the rna transcript and the closing of the transcription bubble the results also suggest that the high stability of dt da base pairs in the dna provides a signal for the pausing of rna polymerase at the termination site
