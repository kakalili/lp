distance from the chromosome end determines the efficiency of double strand break repair in subtelomeres of haploid yeast
double strand break dsb repair plays an important role in chromosome evolution we have investigated the fate of dsbs as a function of their location along the yeast chromosome xi in a system where no conventional homologous recombination can occur we report that the relative frequency of non homologous endjoining nhej  which is the exclusive mode of dsb repair in the internal chromosomal portion decreases gradually towards the telomere keeping the absolute frequency nearly constant and that other repair mechanisms which generally involve the loss of the distal chromosomal fragment appear in subtelomeric regions distance of the dsb from chromosome ends plays a critical role in the global frequency of these repair mechanisms direct telomere additions are rare and other events such as break induced replication plasmid incorporation and gene conversion involve acquisition of heterologous sequences therefore in subtelomeric regions cell survival to dsbs is higher and alternative modes of repair allow new genomic combinations to be generated furthermore subtelomeric rearrangements depend on the recombination process which unexpectedly also promotes the joining of heterologous sequences finally we report that the rad  protein increases the efficiency of nhej
