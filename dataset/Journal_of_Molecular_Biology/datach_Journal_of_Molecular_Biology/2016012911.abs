solvent removal induces a reversible  to  switch in oligomeric a  peptide
solvation and hydration are key factors for determining the stability and folding of proteins as well as the formation of amyloid fibrils and related polypeptide aggregates using attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared and solid state nmr spectroscopy we find that the a  peptide experiences a remarkable conformational switch from  to  secondary structure upon solvent removal by lyophilization of oligomers this transition is contrary to a  fibrils independent of concentration of organic co solvents or co solutes and is reversible upon re addition of the solvent our data illuminate a previously unnoted secondary structural plasticity of the a  peptide in amyloid oligomers that could bear relevance for a  s interactions with cellular structures of low polarity
