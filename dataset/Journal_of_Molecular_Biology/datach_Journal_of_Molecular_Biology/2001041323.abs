protein cofactor dependent acquisition of novel catalytic activity by the rnase p ribonucleoprotein of e coli edited by d draper
escherichia coli rnase p derivatives were evolved in vitro for dna cleavage activity ribonucleoproteins sampled after ten generations of selection show a gt   fold increase in the first order rate constant kcat on a dna substrate reflecting a significant improvement in the chemical cleavage step this increase is offset by a reduction in substrate binding as measured by km we trace the catalytic enhancement to two ubiquitous a   u sequence changes at positions   and   in the m rna component positions that are phylogenetically conserved in the eubacteria furthermore although the mutations are located in different folding domains of the catalytic rna the first in the substrate binding domain the second near the catalytic core their effect on catalytic activity is significantly influenced by the presence of the c protein the activity of the evolved ribonucleoproteins on both pre   s rna and on an rna oligo substrate remain at wild type levels in contrast improved dna cleavage activity is accompanied by a   fold decrease in pre trna cleavage efficiency kcat km  the presence of the c component does not buffer this tradeoff in catalytic activities despite the in vivo role played by the c protein in enhancing the substrate versatility of rnase p the change at position   located in the j   single stranded region likely alters the geometry of the pre trna binding cleft and may provide a functional explanation for the observed tradeoff these results thus shed light both on structure function relations in e coli rnase p and on the crucial role of proteins in enhancing the catalytic repertoire of rna
