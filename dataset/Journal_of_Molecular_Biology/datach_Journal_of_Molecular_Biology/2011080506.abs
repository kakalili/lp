dynamic interaction of hsp  with its client protein p
although the structure of the molecular chaperone hsp  has been extensively characterized by x ray crystallography the nature of the interactions between hsp  and its client proteins remains unclear we present results from a series of spectroscopic studies that strongly suggest that these interactions are highly dynamic in solution extensive nmr assignments have been made for human hsp  through the use of specific isotopic labeling of one and two domain constructs sites of interaction of a client protein the p  dna binding domain were then probed both by chemical shift mapping and by saturation transfer nmr spectroscopy specific spectroscopic changes were small and difficult to observe but were reproducibly measured for residues over a wide area of the hsp  surface in the n terminal middle and c terminal domains a somewhat greater specificity for the area close to the interface between the n terminal and middle domains of hsp  was identified in saturation transfer experiments these results are consistent with a highly dynamic and nonspecific interaction between hsp  and p  dna binding domain in this chaperone  client system which results in changes in the client protein structure that are detectable by spectroscopic and other methods
