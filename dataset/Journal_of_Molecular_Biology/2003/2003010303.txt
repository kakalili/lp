Aquaporin-0 (AQP0) is the most prevalent intrinsic protein in the plasma membrane of lens fiber cells where it functions as a water selective channel and also participates in fiber–fiber adhesion. We report the 3D envelope of purified AQP0 reconstituted with random orientation in phospholipid bilayers as single particles. The envelope was obtained by combining freeze-fracture, shadowing and random conical tilt electron microscopy followed by single particle image processing. Two-dimensional analysis of 2547 untilted images produced eight class averages exhibiting “square” and “octagonal” shapes with a continuum of variation. We reconstructed in 3D five class averages that best described the data set. The reconstructions (“molds”) appeared as metal cups exhibiting external and internal surfaces. We used the internal surface of the mold to calculate the “imprints” that represent the AQP0 particles protruding from the hydrophobic core of the phospholipid bilayer. The complete envelope of the channel, formed by joining the square and octagonal imprints, described accurately the size, shape, oligomeric state, orientation, and molecular weight of the AQP0 channel inserted in the phospholipid bilayer. Rigid body docking of the atomic model of the aquaporin-1 (AQP1) tetramer showed that the freeze-fracture envelope accounted for the conserved transmembrane domain (∼73% similarity between AQP0 and AQP1) but not for the amino and carboxyl termini. We suggest that the discrepancy might reflect differences in the location of the amino and carboxyl termini in the crystal and in the phospholipid bilayer.
