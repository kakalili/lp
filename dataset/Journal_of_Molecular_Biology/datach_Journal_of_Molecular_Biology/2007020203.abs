crystal structures of a poxviral glutaredoxin in the oxidized and reduced states show redox correlated structural changes
glutaredoxins act as reducing agents for the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase r  in many prokaryotes and eukaryotes including humans the same relationship has been proposed for the glutaredoxin and r proteins expressed by all orthopoxviruses including vaccinia variola and ectromelia virus interestingly the orthopoxviral proteins share   and   sequence identity with human glutaredoxin  grx  and r  respectively to study structure function relationships of the vertebrate grx  family and reveal potential viral adaptations we have determined crystal structures of the ectromelia virus glutaredoxin evm   in the oxidized and reduced states the structures show a large redox induced conformational rearrangement of tyr  and thr  near the active site we predict that the movement of tyr  is a viral specific adaptation that increases the redox potential by stabilizing the reduced state the conformational switch of thr  appears to be shared by vertebrate grx  and may affect the strictly conserved lys  a crystal packing induced structural change in residues     affects the gsh binding loop and our structures reveal a potential interaction network that connects the gsh binding loop and the active site evm  also exhibits a novel cis proline pro  in a loop that has been shown to contribute to r binding in escherichia coli grx  the cis peptide bond of pro  may be required to promote electrostatic interactions between lys  and the c terminal carboxylate of r  finally dimethylarsenite was covalently attached to cys  in one reduced evm  structure and our preliminary data show that evm  has dimethylarsenate reductase activity
