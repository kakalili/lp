a dissection of the protein  protein interfaces in icosahedral virus capsids
we selected  icosahedral virus capsids whose crystal structures are reported in the protein data bank they belong to the t  t  pseudo t  and other lattice types we identified in them   unique interfaces between pairs of subunits all repeated by icosahedral symmetry we analyzed the geometric and physical chemical properties of these interfaces and compared with interfaces in protein  protein complexes and homodimeric proteins and with crystal packing contacts the capsids contain one to  subunits implicated in three to  unique interfaces each subunit loses     of its accessible surface in contacts with an average of   neighbors many of the interfaces are very large with a buried surface area bsa that can exceed       yet   are small with a bsa lt     comparable to crystal packing contacts pairwise capsid interfaces overlap so that one third of the residues are part of more than one interface those with a bsa gt     resemble homodimer interfaces in their chemical composition relative to the protein surface they are non polar enriched in aliphatic residues and depleted of charged residues but not of neutral polar residues they contain one h bond per about     bsa small capsid interfaces bsa lt      are only slightly more polar they have a similar amino acid composition but they bury fewer atoms and contain fewer h bonds for their size geometric parameters that estimate the quality of the atomic packing suggest that the small capsid interfaces are loosely packed like crystal packing contacts whereas the larger interfaces are close packed as in protein  protein complexes and homodimers we discuss implications of these findings on the mechanism of capsid assembly assuming that the larger interfaces form first to yield stable oligomeric species capsomeres  and that medium size interfaces allow the stepwise addition of capsomeres to build larger intermediates
