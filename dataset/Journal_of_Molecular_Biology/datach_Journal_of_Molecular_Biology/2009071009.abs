crystal structures of the human and fungal cytosolic leucyl trna synthetase editing domains a structural basis for the rational design of antifungal benzoxaboroles
leucyl trna synthetase leurs specifically links leucine to the   end of trnaleu isoacceptors the overall accuracy of the two step aminoacylation reaction is enhanced by an editing domain that hydrolyzes mischarged trnas notably ile trnaleu we present crystal structures of the editing domain from two eukaryotic cytosolic leurs human and fungal pathogen candida albicans in comparison with previous structures of the editing domain from bacterial and archeal kingdoms these structures show that the leurs editing domain has a conserved structural core containing the active site for hydrolysis with distinct bacterial archeal or eukaryotic specific peripheral insertions it was recently shown that the benzoxaborole antifungal compound an    fluoro   dihydro  hydroxy   benzoxaborole inhibits leurs by forming a covalent adduct with the   adenosine of trnaleu at the editing site thus locking the enzyme in an inactive conformation to provide a structural basis for enhancing the specificity of these benzoxaborole antifungals we determined the structure at     resolution of the c albicans editing domain in complex with a related compound an     ethylamino  fluorobenzo c   oxaborol  h ol  using amp as a surrogate for the   adenosine of trnaleu the interactions between the an    amp adduct and c albicans leurs are similar to those previously observed for bacterial leurs with the an   adduct with an additional hydrogen bond to the extra ethylamine group however compared to bacteria eukaryotic cytosolic leurs editing domains contain an extra helix that closes over the active site largely burying the adduct and providing additional direct and water mediated contacts small differences between the human domain and the fungal domain could be exploited to enhance fungal specificity
