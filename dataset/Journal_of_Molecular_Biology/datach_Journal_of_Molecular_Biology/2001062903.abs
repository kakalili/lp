solution state nmr investigations of triosephosphate isomerase active site loop motion ligand release in relation to active site loop dynamics edited by p e wright
product release is partially rate determining in the isomerization reaction catalyzed by triosephosphate isomerase the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to d glyceraldehyde  phosphate probably because an active site loop movement is necessary to free the product from confinement in the active site the timescale of the catalytic loop motion and of ligand release were studied using  f and  p solution state nmr a   fluorotryptophan was incorporated in the loop n terminal hinge as a reporter of loop motion timescale crystallographic studies confirmed that the structure of the fluorinated enzyme is indistinguishable from the wild type the fluorine accepts a hydrogen bond from water and not from a protein residue with minimal perturbation to the flexible loop stability two distinct loop conformations were observed by  f nmr both for unligated empty and ligated enzyme samples a single species was detected but the chemical shifts of these two distinct species differed by   ppm for samples in the presence of subsaturating amounts of a substrate analogue glycerol  phosphate both nmr peaks were present with broadened lineshapes at  c in contrast a single nmr peak representing a rapid average of the two species was observed at   c we conclude that the rate of loop motion is less than   s   at  c and more than   s   at   c ligand release was studied under similar sample conditions using  p nmr of the phosphate group of the substrate analogue the rate of ligand release is less than   s   at  c and more than   s   at   c therefore loop motion and product release are probably concerted and likely to represent a rate limiting step for chemistry
