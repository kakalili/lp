effects of side chain characteristics on stability and oligomerization state of a de novo designed model coiled coil   amino acid substitutions in position  d   edited by p e wright
we describe the de novo design and biophysical characterization of a model coiled coil protein in which we have systematically substituted  different amino acid residues in the central  d  position the model protein consists of two identical  residue polypeptide chains covalently linked at their n termini via a disulfide bridge the hydrophobic core contained val and ile residues at positions  a  and leu residues at positions  d   this core allowed for the formation of both two stranded and three stranded coiled coils in benign buffer depending on the substitution at position  d   the structure of each analog was analyzed by cd spectroscopy and their relative stability determined by chemical denaturation using gdnhci all analogs denatured from the two stranded state  the oligomeric state s was determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis in benign medium our results showed a thermodynamic stability order in order of decreasing stability of leu met ile tyr phe val gln ala trp asn his thr lys ser asp glu arg orn and gly the pro analog prevented coiled coil formation the overall stability range was   kcal mol from the lowest to the highest analog indicating the importance of the hydrophobic core and the dramatic effect a single substitution in the core can have upon the stability of the protein fold in general the side chain contribution to the level of stability correlated with side chain hydrophobicity molecular modelling studies however showed that packing effects could explain deviations from a direct correlation in regards to oligomerization state eight analogs demonstrated the ability to populate exclusively one oligomerization state in benign buffer   m kcl    m k po ph   ile and val the  branched residues induced the three stranded oligomerization state whereas tyr lys arg orn glu and asp induced the two stranded state asn gln ser ala gly phe leu met and trp analogs were indiscriminate and populated two stranded and three stranded states comparison of these results with similar substitutions in position  a  highlights the positional effects of individual residues in defining the stability and numbers of polypeptide chains occurring in a coiled coil structure overall these results in conjunction with other work now generate a relative thermodynamic stability scale for  naturally occurring amino acid residues in either an  a  or  d  position of a two stranded coiled coil thus these results will aid in the de novo design of new coiled coil structures a better understanding of their structure function relationships and the design of algorithms to predict the presence of coiled coils within native protein sequences
