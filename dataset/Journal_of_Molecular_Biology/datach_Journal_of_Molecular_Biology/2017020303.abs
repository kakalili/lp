bfdca a comprehensive tool of using bayes factor for differential co expression analysis
comparing the gene expression profiles between biological conditions is useful for understanding gene regulation underlying complex phenotypes along this line analysis of differential co expression dc has gained attention in the recent years where genes under one condition have different co expression patterns compared with another we developed an r package bayes factor approach for differential co expression analysis bfdca for dc analysis bfdca is unique in integrating various aspects of dc patterns including shift cross and re wiring into one uniform bayes factor we tested bfdca using simulation data and experimental data simulation results indicate that bfdca outperforms existing methods in accuracy and robustness of detecting dc pairs and dc modules results of using experimental data suggest that bfdca can cluster disease related genes into functional dc subunits and estimate the regulatory impact of disease related genes well bfdca also achieves high accuracy in predicting case control phenotypes by using significant dc gene pairs as markers bfdca is publicly available at http  dx doi org     jdz vtvnm
