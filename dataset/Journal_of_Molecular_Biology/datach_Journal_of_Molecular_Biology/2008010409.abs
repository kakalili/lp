the regulatory scr   and cell surface binding scr    fragments of factor h reveal partially folded back solution structures and different self associative properties
factor h fh is a plasma glycoprotein that plays a central role in regulation of the alternative pathway of complement it is composed of  short complement regulator scr domains the scr   fragment is required for decay acceleration and cofactor activity while the scr    fragment possesses binding sites for complement c d and heparin x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that scr   was monomeric while scr    formed dimers the guinier radius of gyration rg of   nm for scr   and those of   nm and about   nm for monomeric and dimeric scr    respectively showed that their structures are partially folded back and bent the distance distribution function p r showed that scr   has a maximum dimension of   nm while monomeric and dimeric scr    are   nm and about   nm long respectively the sedimentation coefficient of   s for scr   showed no concentration dependence while that for scr    was   s for the monomer and   s for the dimer sedimentation equilibrium data showed that scr   is monomeric while scr    exhibited a weak monomer  dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of    m the constrained scattering and sedimentation modelling of scr   and scr    showed that partially folded back and bent flexible scr arrangements fitted both data sets better than extended linear arrangements and that the dimer was best modelled in the scr    model by an end to end association of two scr  domains the scr   and scr    models were conformationally similar to the previously determined partially folded back structure for intact wild type fh hence suggesting a partial explanation of the intact fh structure comparison of the scr    model with the crystal structure of c b clarified reasons for the distribution of mutations leading to atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome
