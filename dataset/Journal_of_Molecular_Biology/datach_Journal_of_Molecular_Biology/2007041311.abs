toc   a preprotein receptor at the outer membrane with bipartide function
protein translocation across membranes is assisted by translocation machineries present in the membrane targeted by the precursor proteins translocon subunits can be functionally divided into receptor proteins warranting the specificity of this machine and a translocation channel at the outer envelope of chloroplasts two sets of receptor proteins regulate protein translocation facing the cytosol or acting in the intermembrane space one toc  is a receptor of the translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts toc complex with dual function toc  recognizes hsp  delivered precursor proteins via a cytosolic exposed domain containing three tetratrico peptide repeat motifs and as demonstrated in here toc  functions also as a major component of a complex facing the intermembrane space the latter complex is composed of an hsp  localized in the intermembrane space its interaction partner toc  a j domain containing protein and the intermembrane space protein tic  we analyzed the intermembrane space domain of toc  this domain is involved in preprotein recognition and association with the toc complex independent of the cytosolic domain of the toc  receptor therefore toc  is involved in preprotein translocation across the outer envelope at both sites of the membrane
