structural basis for glutamate racemase inhibition
d glutamic acid is a required biosynthetic building block for peptidoglycan and the enzyme glutamate racemase glur catalyzes the inter conversion of d and l glutamate enantiomers therefore glur is considered as an attractive target for the design of new antibacterial drugs here we report the crystal structures of glur from streptococcus pyogenes in both inhibitor free and inhibitor bound forms the inhibitor free glur crystallized in two different forms which diffracted to     and     resolution while the inhibitor bound crystal diffracted to     resolution glur is composed of two domains of    protein that are related by pseudo  fold symmetry and the active site is located at the domain interface the inhibitor    naphthylmethyl d glutamate which was reported earlier as a novel potent competitive inhibitor makes several hydrogen bonds with protein atoms and the naphthyl moiety is located in the hydrophobic pocket the inhibitor binding induces a disorder in one of the loops near the active site in both crystal forms glur exists as a dimer and the interactions seen at the dimer interface are almost identical this agrees well with the results from gel filtration and dynamic light scattering studies
