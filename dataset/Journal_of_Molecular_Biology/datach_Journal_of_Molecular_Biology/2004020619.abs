a cross talk between hypoxia and tgf  orchestrates erythropoietin gene regulation through sp and smads
erythropoietin epo is the humoral regulator of red blood cell production low oxygen tension increases the epo levels by enhancing transcription through the hypoxia inducible factor hif   a transcriptional modulator in oxygen regulated gene expression in the present work a cooperative interaction between hypoxia mediated by the hif  complex and transforming growth factor   tgf   mediated by smad   was revealed in the epo gene this cooperation is due to physical interaction between smad  and hif   the smad  binding site is located within the   epo enhancer downstream from the hre consensus and immediately adjacent to the orphan hepatic nuclear factor receptor hnf   hnf  is interacting also with smad and the hif  complex to potentiate further the cooperative effect between both factors moreover sp has been identified as the factor binding the promoter necessary for the full hypoxia inducibility of the epo gene however this full induction is achieved only if the tgf  pathway is mediating a cross talk between promoter sp  and enhancer hif   regions through smad  we show that sp binding to the proximal promoter is relevant for epo transcription and contributes to the epo induction by hypoxia a functional cooperation among the transcription factors mediating hypoxia hif  sp  the tgf  pathway smad   and tissue specific hnf  is proposed for the regulation of the epo gene in this model the physical contact between the upstream promoter and the   downstream enhancer is mediated by sp and smad factors and would occur upon bending of the dna intervening sequences thus sp would reinforce the promoter enhancer contact while smad would stabilize the multifactorial complex by interacting with hif  sp hnf  and the coactivator cbp p   this model may be extended to other genes where collaboration between tgf  and hypoxia takes place
