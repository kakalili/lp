nmr characterisation of the relationship between frustration and the excited state of im
previous work shows that im folds in a two state transition while its homologue im folds in a three state transition via an on pathway kinetic intermediate state kis  with this difference being related to frustration in the structure of im  we have used nmr spectroscopy to study conformational dynamics connected to the frustration a combination of equilibrium peptide n h n h exchange model free analyses of backbone nh relaxation data and relaxation dispersion rd nmr shows that the native state of im is in equilibrium with an intermediate state that is lowly populated equilibrium intermediate state eis  comparison of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters describing the eis native state equilibrium obtained by rd nmr with previously reported parameters describing the kis native state equilibrium obtained from stopped flow fluorescence studies of refolding his tagged im shows that the kis and the eis are the same species  n chemical shifts of the eis obtained from the rd nmr analysis show that residues forming helix iii in the native state are unstructured in the eis while other residues experiencing frustration in the native state are in structured regions of the eis we show that binding of im and its l a i a variant which resembles the eis as shown in previous work to the cognate partner for im  the dnase domain of colicin e  causes the dynamic processes associated with the frustration to be dampened
