chd assumes a central role during follicle development
during bombyx mori follicle development fine tuning of chorion gene expression is under the control of bidirectional promoters in this work we show that the silkmoth chromo helicase atpase dna binding protein  chd  ortholog is responsible for repositioning of nucleosomes on chorion promoters where the factor binds specifically chorion genes occupying a single chromosomal locus rely on an almost identical set of cis elements for their differential expression as a direct consequence of remodeling interaction of c ebp and tfiid with promoter elements is facilitated and ultimately leads to initiation of transcription appending of methylation marks to h k in a temporal specific manner is dependent on chd binding to cognate cis elements and signifies gene activation overall chd is a critical factor for proper development of the follicular epithelium in terms of whole cell chromatin arrangement
