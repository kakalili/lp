the crystal structure of the c terminal dap p  domain sheds light on the molecular basis for its processing by caspase cleavage
dap p  death associated protein  is a member of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor g family it functions as a scaffold protein promoting cap independent translation of proteins during apoptosis dap p  is cleaved by caspases at position   yielding an  kda c terminal truncated isoform dap p  that promotes translation of several mrnas mediated by an internal ribosome entry site in this study we report the crystal structure of the c terminal region of dap p  extending between amino acids   and   this structure consists of four heat repeats and is homologous to the c terminal domain of eif gi eif  and eif b  unlike the other proteins dap p  lacks electron density in the loop connecting   and   which harbors the caspase cleavage site moreover we observe fewer interactions between these two helices thus previous mapping of this site by mutation analysis is confirmed here by the resolved structure of the dap p  c terminus in addition we identified the position of two conserved aromatic and acidic boxes in the structure of the dap p  c terminus the acidic residues in the two aromatic and acidic boxes form a continuous negatively charged patch which is suggested to make specific interactions with other proteins such as eif   the caspase cleavage of dap p  removes the subdomain carrying acidic residues in the aa box motif which may result in exposure of a hydrophobic surface these intriguing structural differences between the two dap isoforms suggest that they have different interaction partners and subsequently different functions
