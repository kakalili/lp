oritavancin binds to isolated protoplast membranes but not intact protoplasts of staphylococcus aureus
solid state nmr has been used to examine the binding of n     fluorophenyl benzyl chloroeremomycin a fluorinated analogue of oritavancin to isolated protoplast membranes and whole cell sucrose stabilized protoplasts of staphylococcus aureus grown in media containing   c glycine and l    n lysine rotational echo double resonance nmr was used to characterize the binding by estimating internuclear distances from  f of oritavancin to  c and  n labels of the membrane associated peptidoglycan and to the  p of the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane in isolated protoplast membranes both with and without  m sucrose added to the buffer the nascent peptidoglycan was extended away from the membrane surface and the oritavancin hydrophobic side chain was buried deep in the exposed lipid bilayer however there was no n     fluorophenyl benzyl chloroeremomycin binding to intact sucrose stabilized protoplasts even though the drug bound normally to the cell walls of whole cells of s aureus in the presence of  m sucrose as shown by the proximity of peptidoglycan bridge  c labels to phosphate  p the nascent peptidoglycan of the intact protoplasts was confined to the membrane surface
