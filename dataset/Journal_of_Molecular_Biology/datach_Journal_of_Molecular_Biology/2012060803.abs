concomitant lethal mutagenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type
rna virus population dynamics are complex and sophisticated approaches are needed in many cases for therapeutic intervention one such approach termed lethal mutagenesis is directed at targeting the virus population structure for extinction or error catastrophe previous studies have demonstrated the concept of this approach with human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  by use of chemical mutagens i e   azacytidine  azc  as well as by host factors with mutagenic properties i e  apobec g  in this study these two unrelated mutagenic agents were used concomitantly to investigate the interplay of these distinct mutagenic mechanisms specifically an hiv  was produced from apobec g a g expressing cells and used to infect permissive target cells treated with  azc reduced viral infectivity and increased viral mutagenesis were observed with both the viral mutagen i e  g to c mutations and the host restriction factor i e  g to a mutations  however when combined they had complex interactions intriguingly nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that concomitant hiv  exposure to both  azc and a g resulted in an increase in g to a viral mutagenesis at the expense of g to c mutagenesis a g catalytic activity was required for the diminution in g to c mutagenesis taken together our findings provide the first demonstration for potentiation of the mutagenic effect of a cytosine analog by a g expression resulting in concomitant hiv  lethal mutagenesis
