regulation of p kip during muscle differentiation role of egr  sp and dna hypomethylation
the cdk inhibitor p kip plays a critical role in many differentiation processes by performing not only redundant but also specific functions compared to other cdk inhibitors p kip shows a more restricted expression pattern during development and in adult tissues we have previously reported that in muscle cells p kip is induced by the myogenic factor myod through an indirect mechanism involving p  proteins as intermediaries we have also reported that p kip shows a differential responsiveness to myod dependent regulation in different cell types in this work we have further investigated the molecular mechanism by which myod activates p  promoter we show that the minimal promoter element able to confer myod responsiveness contains multiple sp and egr recognition sites and that both transcription factors are necessary for the increase in p  rna we also suggest that the role of myod induced p  consists in promoting the binding of sp to p kip promoter moreover we show that egr and sp are concomitantly recruited to p  promoter in vivo only in differentiation conditions and only in responsive cells bisulfite sequencing suggested a functional link between the methylation status and the differential activity of p  promoter both during differentiation and in distinct cell types these results which highlight the involvement of epigenetic factors in the regulation of p  expression in muscle cells could be of general relevance to explain its tissue and cell type restriction during development
