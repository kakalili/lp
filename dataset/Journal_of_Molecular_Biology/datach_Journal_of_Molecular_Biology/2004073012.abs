the structure and biochemical properties of the human spliceosomal protein u c
the spliceosomal u c protein is critical to the initiation and regulation of precursor messenger rna pre mrna splicing as part of the u small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle snrnp  we have produced full length and  residue constructs of human u c in soluble form in escherichia coli atomic absorption spectroscopy and mass spectrometry show that both constructs contain one zn atom and are monomeric gelmobility shift assays showed that one molecule of recombinant u c either full length or  residue construct can be incorporated into the u snrnp core domain in the presence of u  k this result is in perfect agreement with the previous experiment with u c isolated from the hela u snrnp showing that the recombinant u c is functionally active we have determined the solution structure of the n terminal  residue construct of u c by nmr a cys his type zinc finger distinct from the tfiiia type is extended at its c terminus by two additional helices the two zn coordinating histidine residues are separated by a five residue loop the conserved basic residues in the first two helices and the intervening loop may be involved in rna binding the opposite  sheet face with two surface exposed tyr residues may be involved in protein contacts both the full length and  residue constructs of human u c fail to bind rna containing the   splice site sequence in contrast to what has been reported for the saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue
