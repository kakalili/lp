induction of the yersinia type  secretion system as an all or none phenomenon
pathogenic yersinia spp possess a protein secretion system designated as type  that plays a clear role in promoting their survival vis  vis the macrophage inductive expression of the yersinia type  secretion system t ss  triggered either by host cell contact or in the absence of host cells by a reduction in extracellular calcium ion levels is accompanied by a withdrawal from the bacterial division cycle here we analyzed ca  dependent induction of the t ss at the single cell level to understand how yersinia coordinates pro survival and growth related activities we utilized a novel high throughput quantitative microscopy approach as well as flow cytometry to determine how ca  levels t ss expression and cellular division are interrelated our analysis showed that there is a high degree of homogeneity in terms of t ss expression levels among a population of y  pseudotuberculosis cells following the removal of ca  and that t ss expression appears to be independent of the cellular division cycle unexpectedly our analysis showed that ca  levels are inversely related to the initiation of inductive t ss expression and not to the intensity of activation once initiated thus providing a basis for the seemingly graded response of t ss activation observed in bulk level analyses the properties of the system described here display both similarities to and differences from that of the lac operon first described  years ago by novick and weiner
