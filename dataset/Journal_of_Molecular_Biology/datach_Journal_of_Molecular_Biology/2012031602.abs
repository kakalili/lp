dlk is a transcriptional target of klf in the early stages of adipogenesis
the epidermal growth factor like protein dlk  highly homologous to dlk  has been identified as a modulator of adipogenesis in vitro knocking down dlk expression prevents adipogenesis of t l cells but enhances that of the mesenchymal cell line c h t   the expression of dlk shows two peaks along this differentiation process the first one in response to  isobutyl  methylxanthine ibmx and dexamethasone dex  and the second shortly after exposure to insulin nothing is known about the transcriptional regulation of dlk during adipogenesis here we report that during early adipogenesis of t l cells dlk expression is controlled independently by ibmx and dex we also show that klf  a transcription factor critical for the control of early adipogenesis binds directly to the dlk promoter and increases dlk expression in response to ibmx overexpression of klf leads to an increase in dlk expression levels whereas klf knockdown downregulates the transcriptional activity of the dlk promoter finally we demonstrate that klf regulates the basal expression of dlk in c h t  cells and it is required for the adipogenic differentiation of those cells these results indicate that klf mediates the transcriptional regulation of dlk in response to ibmx during the early stages of adipogenesis
