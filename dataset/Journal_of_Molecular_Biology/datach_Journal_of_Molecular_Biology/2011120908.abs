crystal structure of human prostate specific antigen in a sandwich antibody complex
human prostate specific antigen psa or human kallikrein related peptidase  present in small quantities in the sera of healthy men becomes elevated in prostate cancer pca and other prostate disorders the ability to identify the free psa fraction associated with pca could increase the reliability of the psa diagnostic test here we present the crystal structure of human psa from seminal fluid in a sandwich complex with two monoclonal antibodies mabs  mab d a captures total psa with exceptionally high affinity and mab d d  selectively discriminates between free psa subforms that are more abundant in sera from patients with pca although the antigen is not of seric origin several insights into cancer diagnosis can be discerned from this complex mab d d  recognizes a psa conformation different from that previously reported interacting with the kallikrein loop the psa n linked glycan attached to asparagine  is an uncommonly complex sialated triantennary chain o linked glycosylation is observed at threonine   the description of how psa subforms in prostatic fluid can be discriminated using pairs of antibodies is a first step in the design of new strategies that are capable of real discrimination among psa subforms which will lead to the formulation of more reliable diagnostic tests in a companion article muller b h  savatier a  l hostis g  costa n  bossus m  michel s  et al     in vitro affinity maturation of an anti psa antibody for prostate cancer diagnostic assay j mol biol  we describe engineering efforts to improve the affinity of mab d d  a first step towards such goal
