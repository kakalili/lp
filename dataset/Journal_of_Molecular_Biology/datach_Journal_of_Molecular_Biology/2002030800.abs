differences in backbone dynamics of two homologous bacterial albumin binding modules implications for binding specificity and bacterial adaptation edited by m f summers
proteins g and pab are bacterial albumin binding proteins expressed at the surface of group c and g streptococci and peptostreptococcus magnus respectively repeated albumin binding domains known as ga modules are found in both proteins the third ga module of protein g from the group g streptococcal strain g   g  ga  and the second ga module of protein pab from p magnus strain alb  alb ga exhibit   sequence identity and both fold to form three helix bundle structures that are very stable against thermal denaturation alb ga binds human serum albumin with higher affinity than g  ga  but g  ga shows substantially broader albumin binding specificity than alb ga the  n nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation measurements reported here show that the two ga modules exhibit mobility on the picosecond nanosecond time scale in directly corresponding regions loops and termini  most residues in g  ga were seen to be involved in conformational exchange processes on the microsecond millisecond time scale whereas for alb ga such motions were only identified for the beginning of helix  and its preceding loop furthermore and more importantly hydrogen deuterium exchange and saturation transfer experiments reveal large differences between the two ga modules with respect to motions on the second hour time scale the high degree of similarity between the two ga modules with respect to sequence structure and stability and the observed differences in dynamics binding affinity and binding specificity to different albumins suggest a distinct correlation between dynamics binding affinity and binding specificity finally it is noteworthy in this context that the module g  ga  which has broad albumin binding specificity is expressed by group c and g streptococci known to infect all mammalian species whereas p magnus with the alb ga module has been isolated only from humans
