the crystal structure of odorant binding protein  from anopheles gambiae exhibits an outstanding adaptability of its binding site
anopheles gambiae agam targets human and animals by using its olfactory system leading to the spread of plasmodium falciparum the malaria vector odorant binding proteins obps participate to the first event in odorant recognition and constitute an interesting target for insect control obps interact with olfactory receptors to which they deliver the odorant molecule we have undertaken a large scale study of proteins belonging to the olfactory system of agam with in mind of designing strong olfactory repellants here we report the expression three dimensional structures and binding properties of agamobp  a member of a new structural class of obps characterized by the occurrence of eight cysteines we showed that agamobp  possesses seven  helices and four disulfide bridges instead of six  helices and three disulfide bridges in classical obps the extra seventh helix is located at the surface of the protein locked by the fourth disulfide bridge and forms a wall of the internal cavity the binding site of the protein is mainly hydrophobic elongated and open and is able to accommodate elongated ligands linear or polycyclic as suggested also by binding experiments an elongated electron density was observed in the internal cavity of the purified protein belonging to a serendipitous ligand the structure of agamobp  in complex with an azo bicyclic model compound reveals that a large conformational change in the protein has reshaped its binding site provoking helix  unfolding and doubling of the cavity volume
