a non sequence specific dna binding mode of rag is inhibited by rag
rag and rag proteins catalyze site specific dna cleavage reactions in v d j recombination a process that assembles antigen receptor genes from component gene segments during lymphocyte development the first step towards the dna cleavage reaction is the sequence specific association of the rag proteins with the conserved recombination signal sequence rss  which flanks each gene segment in the antigen receptor loci questions remain as to the contribution of each rag protein to recognition of the rss for example while rag alone is capable of recognizing the conserved elements of the rss it is not clear if or how rag may enhance sequence specific associations with the rss to shed light on this issue we examined the association of rag  with and without rag  with consensus rss versus non rss substrates using fluorescence anisotropy and gel mobility shift assays the results indicate that while rag can recognize the rss the sequence specific interaction under physiological conditions is masked by a high affinity non sequence specific dna binding mode significantly addition of rag effectively suppressed the association of rag with non sequence specific dna resulting in a large differential in binding affinity for the rss versus the non rss sites we conclude that this represents a major means by which rag contributes to the initial recognition of the rss and that therefore association of rag with rag is required for effective interactions with the rss in developing lymphocytes
