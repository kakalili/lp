crystal structure of the botulinum neurotoxin type g binding domain insight into cell surface binding
botulinum neurotoxins bonts typically bind the neuronal cell surface via dual interactions with both protein receptors and gangliosides we present here the    x ray structure of the bont serotype g bont g receptor binding domain residues       and a detailed view of protein receptor and ganglioside binding regions the ganglioside binding motif sxwy has a conserved structure compared to the corresponding regions in bont serotype a and bont serotype b bont b  but several features of interactions with the hydrophilic face of the ganglioside are absent at the opposite side of the motif in the bont g ganglioside binding cleft this may significantly reduce the affinity between bont g and gangliosides bont g and bont b share the protein receptor synaptotagmin syt i ii the syt binding site has a conserved hydrophobic plateau located centrally in the proposed protein receptor binding interface tyr   phe   ala   pro   and phe    interestingly only  of  residues that are important for binding between syt ii and bont b are conserved in bont g suggesting that the means by which bont g and bont b bind syt diverges more than previously appreciated indeed substitution of syt ii phe  and phe  with alanine residues had little effect on the binding of bont g but strongly reduced the binding of bont b furthermore an extended solvent exposed hydrophobic loop located between the syt binding site and the ganglioside binding cleft may serve as a third membrane association and binding element to contribute to high affinity binding to the neuronal membrane while bont g and bont b are homologous to each other and both utilize syt i syt ii as their protein receptor the precise means by which these two toxin serotypes bind to syt appears surprisingly divergent
