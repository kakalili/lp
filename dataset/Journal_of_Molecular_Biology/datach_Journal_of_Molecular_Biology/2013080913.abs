ph triggered conformational switching of the diphtheria toxin t domain the roles of n terminal histidines
ph induced conformational switching is essential for functioning of diphtheria toxin which undergoes a membrane insertion translocation transition triggered by endosomal acidification as a key step of cellular entry in order to establish the sequence of molecular rearrangements and side chain protonation accompanying the formation of the membrane competent state of the toxin s translocation t domain we have developed and applied an integrated approach that combines multiple techniques of computational chemistry e g  long microsecond range all atom molecular dynamics md simulations continuum electrostatics calculations and thermodynamic integration ti  with several experimental techniques of fluorescence spectroscopy ti calculations indicate that protonation of h  causes the greatest destabilization of the native structure   kcal mol  which is consistent with our early mutagenesis results extensive equilibrium md simulations with a combined length of over  s demonstrate that histidine protonation while not accompanied by the loss of structural compactness of the t domain nevertheless results in substantial molecular rearrangements characterized by the partial loss of secondary structure due to unfolding of helices th and th and the loss of close contact between the c and n terminal segments the structural changes accompanying the formation of the membrane competent state ensure an easier exposure of the internal hydrophobic hairpin formed by helices th and th  in preparation for its subsequent transmembrane insertion
