the ns protein from influenza virus stimulates translation initiation by enhancing ribosome recruitment to mrnas
the non structural protein ns of influenza a viruses exerts pleiotropic functions during infection among these functions ns was shown to be involved in the control of both viral and cellular translation however the mechanism by which this occurs remains to be determined thus we have revisited the role of ns in translation by using a combination of influenza infection mrna reporter transfection and in vitro functional and biochemical assays our data show that the ns protein is able to enhance the translation of virtually all tested mrnas with the exception of constructs bearing the dicistroviruses internal ribosome entry segment ireses  dcv and crpv  suggesting a role at the level of translation initiation the domain of ns required for translation stimulation was mapped to the rna binding amino terminal motif of the protein with residues r  and k  being critical for activity although we show that ns can bind directly to mrnas it does not correlate with its ability to stimulate translation this activity rather relies on the property of ns to associate with ribosomes and to recruit them to target mrnas
