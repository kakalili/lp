structures of human n acetylglucosamine kinase in two complexes with n acetylglucosamine and with adp glucose insights into substrate specificity and regulation
n acetylglucosamine glcnac  a major component of complex carbohydrates is synthesized de novo or salvaged from lysosomally degraded glycoconjugates and from nutritional sources the salvage pathway requires that glcnac kinase converts glcnac to glcnac  phosphate a component utilized in udp glcnac biosynthesis or energy metabolism glcnac kinase belongs to the sugar kinase hsp  actin superfamily that catalyze phosphoryl transfer from atp to their respective substrates and in most cases catalysis is associated with a large conformational change in which the n terminal small and c terminal large domains enclose the substrates here we report two crystal structures of homodimeric human glcnac kinase one in complex with glcnac and the other in complex with adp and glucose the active site of glcnac kinase is located in a deep cleft between the two domains of the v shaped monomer the enzyme adopts a  closed  configuration in the glcnac bound complex and glcnac interacts with residues of both domains in addition the n acetyl methyl group contacts residues of the other monomer in the homodimer a unique feature compared to other members of the sugar kinase hsp  actin superfamily this contrasts an  open  configuration in the adp glucose bound structure where glucose cannot form these interactions explaining its low binding affinity for glcnac kinase our results support functional implications derived from apo crystal structures of glcnac kinases from chromobacter violaceum and porphyromonas gingivalis and show that tyr   which is phosphorylated in thrombin activated platelets lines the glcnac binding pocket this suggests that phosphorylation of tyr  may modulate glcnac kinase activity and or specificity
