a conserved acidic amino acid mediates the interaction between modulators and co chaperones in enterobacteria
hsp  like co chaperones are ubiquitous enzymes that stimulate the protein refolding activity of hsp  family chaperones they are widespread in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems in bacteria the best characterized co chaperone is the escherichia coli dnaj protein many  proteobacteria encode a functional homologue of dnaj known as cbpa which is expressed in response to starvation and environmental stress the activity of cbpa is regulated by the  modulator  protein cbpm here we have used a combination of genetics and biochemistry to identify the co chaperone contact determinant of cbpm we show that the nature of the interaction is conserved in enterobacteria
