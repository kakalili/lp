characterization of a trp rna binding attenuation protein trap mutant with tryptophan independent rna binding activity
trap trp rna binding attenuation protein is an  subunit rna binding protein that regulates expression of genes involved in tryptophan metabolism trp in bacillus subtilis in response to changes in intracellular tryptophan concentration when activated by binding up to  tryptophan residues trap binds to the mrnas of several trp genes and down regulates their expression recently a trap mutant was found that binds rna in the absence of tryptophan in this mutant protein thr  which is part of the tryptophan binding site is replaced with val t v  we have compared the rna binding properties of t v and wild type wt trap as well as of a series of hetero  mers containing mixtures of wt and t v trap subunits the most significant difference between the interaction of t v and wt trap with rna is that the affinity of t v trap is more dependent on ionic strength analysis of the hetero  mers allowed us to examine how subunits interact within an  mer with regard to binding to tryptophan or rna our data suggest that individual subunits retain properties similar to those observed when they are in homo  mers and that individual g uag triplets within the rna can bind to trap differently
