microsecond rearrangements of hydrophobic clusters in an initially collapsed globule prime structure formation during the folding of a small protein
determining how polypeptide chain collapse initiates structure formation during protein folding is a long standing goal it has been challenging to characterize experimentally the dynamics of the polypeptide chain which lead to the formation of a compact kinetic molten globule mg in about a millisecond in this study the sub millisecond events that occur early during the folding of monellin from the guanidine hydrochloride unfolded state have been characterized using multiple fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes the kinetic mg is shown to form in a noncooperative manner from the unfolded u state as a result of at least three different processes happening during the first millisecond of folding initial chain compaction completes within the first   s and further compaction occurs only after structure formation commences at a few milliseconds of folding the transient nonnative and native like hydrophobic clusters with side chains of certain residues buried form during the initial chain collapse and the nonnative clusters quickly disassemble subsequently partial chain desolvation occurs leading to the formation of a kinetic mg the initial chain compaction and subsequent chain rearrangement appear to be barrierless processes the two structural rearrangements within the collapsed globule appear to prime the protein for the actual folding transition
