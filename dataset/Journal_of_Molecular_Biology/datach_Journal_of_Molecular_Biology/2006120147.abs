mixed macromolecular crowding accelerates the refolding of rabbit muscle creatine kinase implications for protein folding in physiological environments
the effects of four single macromolecular crowding agents ficoll   dextran   polyethylene glycol peg    and calf thymus dna ct dna  and three mixed crowding agents containing both ct dna and polysaccharide or peg    on the refolding of guanidine hydrochloride denatured rabbit muscle creatine kinase mm ck have been examined by activity assay when the total concentration of the mixed crowding agent is   g l in which the weight ratio of ct dna to ficoll  is   the refolding yield of mm ck after refolding for  h under these conditions increases   compared with that in the presence of   g l ct dna   compared with   g l ficoll   and   compared with that in the absence of crowding agents a remarkable increase in the refolding yield of mm ck by a mixed crowding agent containing ct dna and dextran   or peg    is also observed further folding kinetics analyses show that these three mixed crowding agents remarkably accelerate the refolding of mm ck compared with single crowding agents aggregation of mm ck in the presence of any of the three mixed crowding agents is less serious than that in the presence of a single crowding agent at the same concentration but more serious than that in the absence of crowding agents both the refolding yield and the refolding rate of mm ck in mixtures of these agents are increased relative to the individual agents by themselves indicating that mixed macromolecular crowding agents are more favorable to mm ck folding and can be used to reflect the physiological environment more accurately than single crowding agents
