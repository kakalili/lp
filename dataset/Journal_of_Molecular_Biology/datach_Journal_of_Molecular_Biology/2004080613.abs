terbium mediated footprinting probes a catalytic conformational switch in the antigenomic hepatitis delta virus ribozyme
the two forms of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme are derived from the genomic and antigenomic rna strands of the human hepatitis delta virus hdv  where they serve a crucial role in pathogen replication by catalyzing site specific self cleavage reactions the hdv ribozyme requires divalent metal ions for formation of its tertiary structure consisting of a tight double nested pseudoknot and for efficient self  or cis  cleavage comparison of recently solved crystal structures of the cleavage precursor and   product indicates that a significant conformational switch is required for catalysis by the genomic hdv ribozyme here we have used the lanthanide metal ion terbium iii to footprint the precursor and product solution structures of the cis acting antigenomic hdv ribozyme inhibitory tb  binds with high affinity to similar sites on rna as mg  and subsequently promotes slow backbone scission we find subtle yet significant differences in the terbium iii footprinting pattern between the precursor and product forms of the antigenomic hdv ribozyme consistent with differences in conformation as observed in the crystal structures of the genomic ribozyme in addition uv melting profiles provide evidence for a less tight tertiary structure in the precursor in both the precursor and product we observe high affinity terbium iii binding sites in joining sequence j   tb     m and loop l  which are key structural components forming the catalytic core of the hdv ribozyme as well as in several single stranded regions such as j  and the l tetraloop tb      m  sensitized luminescence spectroscopy confirms that there are at least two affinity classes of tb  binding sites our results thus demonstrate that a significant conformational change accompanies catalysis in the antigenomic hdv ribozyme in solution similar to the catalytic conformational switch observed in crystals of the genomic form and that structural and perhaps catalytic metal ions bind close to the catalytic core
