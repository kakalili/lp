subtle interplay between synaptotagmin and complexin binding to the snare complex
ca  triggered neurotransmitter release depends on the formation of snare complexes that bring the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes together on the ca  sensor synaptotagmin  and on complexins which play active and inhibitory roles release of the complexin inhibitory activity by binding of synaptotagmin  to the snare complex causing complexin displacement was proposed to trigger exocytosis however the validity of this model was questioned based on the observation of simultaneous binding of complexin i and a fragment containing the synaptotagmin  c domains c ab to membrane anchored snare complex using diverse biophysical techniques here we show that c ab and complexin i do not bind to each other but can indeed bind simultaneously to the snare complex in solution hence the snare complex contains separate binding sites for both proteins however total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy experiments show that c ab can displace a complexin i fragment containing its central snare binding helix and an inhibitory helix cpx    from membrane anchored snare complex under equilibrium conditions interestingly full length complexin i binds more tightly to membrane anchored snare complex than cpx    and it is not displaced by c ab these results show that interactions of n and or c terminal sequences of complexin i with the snare complex and or phospholipids increase the affinity of complexin i for the snare complex hindering dissociation induced by c ab we propose a model whereby binding of synaptotagmin  to the snare complex directly or indirectly causes a rearrangement of the complexin i inhibitory helix without inducing complexin i dissociation thus relieving the inhibitory activity and enabling cooperation between synaptotagmin  and complexin i in triggering release
