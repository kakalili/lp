IRP1 [iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1] is a bifunctional protein with mutually exclusive end-states. In one mode of operation, IRP1 binds iron-responsive element (IRE) stemâ€“loops in messenger RNAs encoding proteins of iron metabolism to control their rate of translation. In its other mode, IRP1 serves as cytoplasmic aconitase to correlate iron availability with the energy and oxidative stress status of the cell. IRP1/IRE binding occurs through two separate interfaces, which together contribute about two-dozen hydrogen bonds. Five amino acids make base-specific contacts and are expected to contribute significantly to binding affinity and specificity of this protein:RNA interaction. In this mutagenesis study, each of the five base-specific amino acids was changed to alter binding at each site. Analysis of IRE binding affinity and translational repression activity of the resulting IRP1 mutants showed that four of the five contact points contribute uniquely to the overall binding affinity of the IRP1:IRE interaction, while one site was found to be unimportant. The stronger-than-expected effect on binding affinity of mutations at Lys379 and Ser681, residues that make contact with the conserved nucleotides G16 and C8, respectively, identified them as particularly critical for providing specificity and stability to IRP1:IRE complex formation. We also show that even though the base-specific RNA-binding residues are not part of the aconitase active site, their substitutions can affect the aconitase activity of holo-IRP1, positively or negatively.
