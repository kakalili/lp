inhibition of the activities of reverse transcriptase and integrase of human immunodeficiency virus type  by peptides derived from the homologous viral protein r vpr
shortly after infection by human immunodeficiency virus hiv  two complexes are formed in a stepwise manner in the cytoplasm of infected cells the reverse transcription complex that later becomes the preintegration complex both complexes include in addition to cellular proteins viral rna or dna and several proteins such as reverse transcriptase rt  integrase in  and viral protein r vpr  these proteins are positioned in close spatial proximity within these complexes enabling mutual interactions between the proteins physical in vitro interactions between rt and in that affect their enzymatic activities were already reported moreover we found recently that hiv  rt derived peptides bind and inhibit hiv  in and that an in derived peptide binds and inhibits hiv  rt additionally hiv  vpr and its c terminal domain affected in vitro the integration activity of hiv  in here we describe the associations of vpr derived peptides with rt and in of a peptide library that spans the  residue long vpr protein three partially overlapping peptides derived from the c terminal domain bind both enzymes two of these peptides inhibit both rt and in another peptide derived from the vpr n terminal domain binds in and inhibits its activities without binding and affecting rt interestingly two sequential c terminal peptides derived from residues     and     of full length vpr are the most effective inhibitors of both enzymes the data and the molecular modeling presented suggest that rt and in are inhibited as a result of steric hindrance or conformational changes of their active sites whereas a second mechanism of blocking its dimerization state could be also attributed to the inhibition of in
