A heme-acquisition system present in several Gram-negative bacteria requires the secretion of hemophores. These extracellular carrier proteins capture heme and deliver it to specific outer membrane receptors. The Serratia marcescens HasA hemophore is a monodomain protein that binds heme with a very high affinity. Its α/β structure, as that of its binding pocket, has no common features with other iron- or heme-binding proteins. Heme is held by two loops L1 and L2 and coordinated to iron by an unusual ligand pair, H32/Y75. Two independent regions of the hemophore β-sheet are involved in HasA–HasR receptor interaction. Here, we report the 3-D NMR structure of apoHasA and the backbone dynamics of both loaded and unloaded hemophore. While the overall structure of HasA is very similar in the apo and holo forms, the hemophore presents a transition from an open to a closed form upon ligand binding, through a large movement, of up to 30 Å, of loop L1 bearing H32. Comparison of loaded and unloaded HasA dynamics on different time scales reveals striking flexibility changes in the binding pocket. We propose a mechanism by which these structural and dynamic features provide the dual function of heme binding and release to the HasR receptor.
