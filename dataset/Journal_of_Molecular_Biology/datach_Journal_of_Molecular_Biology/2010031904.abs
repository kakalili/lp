structure of the membrane domain of human erythrocyte anion exchanger  revealed by electron crystallography
the membrane domain of human erythrocyte anion exchanger  ae  works as a cl  hco   antiporter this exchange is a key step for co o circulation in the blood in spite of their importance structural information about ae and the ae anion exchanger family are still very limited we used electron microscopy to solve the three dimensional structure of the ae membrane domain fixed in an outward open conformation by cross linking at    resolution a dimer of ae membrane domains packed in two dimensional array showed a projection map similar to that of the prokaryotic homolog of the clc chloride channel a cl  h antiporter in a three dimensional map there are v shaped densities near the center of the dimer and slightly narrower v shaped clusters at a greater distance from the center of the dimer these appear to be inserted into the membrane from opposite sides the structural motifs two homologous pairs of helices in internal repeats of the clc transporter helices b c and j k  are well fitted to those ae densities after simple domain movement
