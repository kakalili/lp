predicting ligand binding affinity with alchemical free energy methods in a polar model binding site
we present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in t lysozyme l a m  q  for modeling we computed alchemical absolute binding free energies these were blind tests performed prospectively on  diverse previously untested candidate ligand molecules we predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five would not   of  predictions were correct at this level the rms error to the measurable absolute binding energies was   kcal mol in addition we computed  relative  binding free energies for six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands phenol and catechol the average rms error in the relative free energy prediction was   kcal mol phenol and   kcal mol catechol  to understand these results at atomic resolution we obtained x ray co complex structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol analogs the average rmsd of the predicted pose to the experiment was     diverse set      phenol derived predictions  and     catechol derived predictions  we found that predicting accurate affinities and rank orderings required near native starting orientations of the ligand in the binding site unanticipated binding modes multiple ligand binding and protein conformational change all proved challenging for the free energy methods we believe that these results can help guide future improvements in physics based absolute binding free energy methods
