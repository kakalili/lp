mechanism of u insertion rna editing in trypanosome mitochondria characterization of ret functional domains by mutational analysis
terminal uridylyl transferases tutases selectively bind uridine   triphosphate utp and catalyze the addition of uridine   monophosphate to the   hydroxyl of rna substrates in a template independent manner rna editing tutase  and rna editing tutase  ret  play central roles in uridine insertion deletion rna editing which is an essential part of mitochondrial rna processing in trypanosomes although the conserved n terminal catalytic domain and c terminal nucleotide base recognition domain are readily distinguished in all known tutases nucleotide specificity rna substrate preference processivity quaternary structures and auxiliary domains vary significantly among enzymes of divergent biological functions ret acts as a subunit of the rna editing core complex to carry out guide rna dependent u insertion into mitochondrial mrna by correlating mutational effects on ret activity as recombinant protein and as rna editing core complex subunit with rnai based knock in phenotypes we have assessed the utp and rna binding sites in ret  here we demonstrate functional conservation of key utp binding and metal ion coordinating residues and identify amino acids involved in rna substrate recognition invariant arginine residues   and   positioned in the vicinity of the utp binding site are critical for ret activity on single stranded and double stranded rnas as well as function in vivo recognition of a double stranded rna which resembles a guide rna mrna duplex is further facilitated by multipoint contacts across the ret specific middle domain
