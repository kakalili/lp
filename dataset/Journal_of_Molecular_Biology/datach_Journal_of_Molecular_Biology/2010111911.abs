sin resolvase catalytic activity and oligomerization state are tightly coupled
serine recombinases promote specific dna rearrangements by a cut and paste mechanism that involves cleavage of all four dna strands at two sites recognized by the enzyme dissecting the order and timing of these cleavage events and the steps leading up to them is difficult because the cleavage reaction is readily reversible here we describe assays using activated sin mutants and a dna substrate with a   bridging phosphorothiolate modification that renders sin mediated dna cleavage irreversible we find that activating sin mutations promote dna cleavage rather than simply stabilize the cleavage product cleavage events at the scissile phosphates on complementary strands of the duplex are tightly coupled and the overall dna cleavage rate is strongly dependent on sin concentration when combined with analytical ultracentrifugation data these results suggest that sin catalytic activity and oligomerization state are tightly linked and that activating mutations promote formation of a cleavage competent oligomeric state that is normally formed only transiently within the full synaptic complex
