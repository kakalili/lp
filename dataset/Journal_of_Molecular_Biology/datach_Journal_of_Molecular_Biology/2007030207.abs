reversible inhibition of escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase by fluoride trapped catalytic intermediates in cryo crystallographic studies
here we describe high resolution x ray structures of escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase e ppase complexed with the substrate magnesium or manganese pyrophosphate the structures correspond to steps in the catalytic synthesis of enzyme bound pyrophosphate ppi in the presence of fluoride as an inhibitor of hydrolysis the catalytic reaction intermediates were trapped applying a new method that we developed for initiating hydrolytic activity in the e ppase crystal x ray structures were obtained for three consecutive states of the enzyme in the course of hydrolysis comparative analysis of these structures showed that the mn  supported hydrolysis of the phosphoanhydride bond is followed by a fast release of the leaving phosphate from the p site the electrophilic phosphate p is trapped in the  down  conformation its movement into the  up  position most likely represents the rate limiting step of mn  supported hydrolysis we further determined the crystal structure of the arg gln mutant variant of e ppase complexed with one phosphate and four mn ions
