atp induced allostery in the eukaryotic chaperonin cct is abolished by the mutation g  d in cct that renders yeast temperature sensitive for growth
saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells containing the chaperonin cct chaperonin containing t complex polypeptide  tcp   with the g  d mutation in subunit cct  anc   are temperature sensitive for growth and display defects in organization of actin structure budding and cell shape in this first structure  function analysis of cct we show that this mutation abolishes both intra and inter ring cooperativity in atp binding by cct the finding that a single mutation in only one subunit in each cct ring has such drastic effects highlights the importance of allostery for its in vivo function these results together with other kinetic data for wild type cct reported in this study provide support for the sequential model for atp dependent allosteric transitions in cct
