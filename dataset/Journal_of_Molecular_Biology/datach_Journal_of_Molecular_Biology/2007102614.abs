structural and biochemical basis for polyamine binding to the tp   lipoprotein of treponema pallidum putative role for tp   tppotd as a polyamine receptor
tp   of treponema pallidum the causative agent of syphilis is predicted to be a   kda membrane lipoprotein previous sequence analysis of tp   noted its homology to polyamine binding proteins of the bacterial potd family which serve as periplasmic ligand binding proteins of atp binding cassette abc transport systems here the     crystal structure of tp   demonstrated structural homology to escherichia coli potd and potf the latter two proteins preferentially bind spermidine and putrescine respectively all of these proteins contain two domains that sandwich the ligand between them the ligand binding site of tp   can be occupied by  n morpholino ethanesulfanoic acid a component of the crystallization medium to discern the polyamine binding preferences of tp   the protein was subjected to isothermal titration calorimetric experiments the titrations established that tp   binds polyamines avidly with a marked preference for putrescine kd   nm over spermidine kd   nm  but the related compounds cadaverine and spermine did not bind structural comparisons and structure based sequence analyses provide insights into how polyamine binding proteins recognize their ligands in particular these comparisons allow the derivation of rules that may be used to predict the function of other members of the potd family the sequential structural and functional homology of tp   to potd and potf prompt the conclusion that the former likely is the polyamine binding component of an abc type polyamine transport system in t pallidum we thus rename tp   as tppotd the ramifications of tppotd as a polyamine binding protein to the parasitic strategy of t pallidum are discussed
