the molecular structure of ornithine acetyltransferase from mycobacterium tuberculosis bound to ornithine a competitive inhibitor
mycobacterium tuberculosis ornithine acetyltransferase mtb oat e c      is a key enzyme of the acetyl recycling pathway during arginine biosynthesis it reversibly catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from n acetylornithine naorn to l glutamate mtb oat is a member of the n terminal nucleophile fold family of enzymes the crystal structures of mtb oat in native form and in its complex with ornithine orn have been determined at   and     resolutions respectively orn is a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme against l glutamate as substrate although the acyl  enzyme complex of streptomyces clavuligerus ornithine acetyltransferase has been determined ours is the first crystal structure to be reported of an ornithine acetyltransferase in complex with an inhibitor orn binding does not alter the structure of mtb oat globally however its presence stabilizes the three c terminal residues that are disordered and not observed in the native structure also stabilization of the c terminal residues by orn reduces the size of the active site pocket volume in the structure of the orn complex the interactions of orn and the protein residues of mtb oat unambiguously delineate the active site residues of this enzyme in mtb moreover modeling studies carried out with naorn based on the structure of the orn  mtb oat complex reveal important interactions of the carbonyl oxygen of the acetyl group of naorn with the main chain nitrogen atom of gly  and with the side chain oxygen of thr   these interactions likely help in the stabilization of oxyanion formation during enzymatic reaction and also will polarize the carbonyl carbon  oxygen bond thereby enabling the side chain atom o  of thr  to launch a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom of the acetyl group of naorn
