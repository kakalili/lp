crystal structure of tobacco necrosis virus at     resolution edited by r huber
the crystal structure of tobacco necrosis virus tnv has been determined by real space averaging with  fold non crystallographic symmetry and refined to r     for diffraction data to     resolution a total of   subunits form a t   virus shell with a diameter of about    and a small protrusion at the  fold axis in   amino acid residues the respective amino terminal    and  residues of the a b and c subunits are disordered no density for the rna was found the subunits have a  jelly roll    barrel structure as have the structures of the subunits of other spherical viruses the tertiary and quaternary structures of tnv are in particular similar to those of southern bean mosaic virus although they are classified in different groups invisible residues  to  with a high level of basic residues are considered to be located inside the particle sequence comparison of the coat proteins of several tnv strains showed that the sequences of the disordered segment diverge considerably as compared with those of the ordered segment consistent with a small tertiary structural constraint being imposed on the n terminal segment basic residues are localized on the subunit interfaces or inner surface of the capsid positive charges of the basic residues facing the interior as well as those of the n terminal segment may neutralize the negative charge of the rna inside five calcium ions per icosahedral asymmetric unit are located at the subunit interfaces three are close to the exterior surface the other two away from it the environments of the first three are similar and those of the other two sites are similar these calcium ions are assumed to be responsible for the stabilization transition of the quaternary structure of the shell three peptide segments ordered only in the c subunits are clustered around each  fold quasi  fold axis forming a  annulus and may lead to quasi equivalent interactions for the organization of the t   shell
