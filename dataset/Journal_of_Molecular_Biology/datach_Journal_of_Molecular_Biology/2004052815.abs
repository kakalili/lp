the ankrd protein a link between the sarcomere and the nucleus in skeletal muscle
ankrd may be a link between the sarcomere and the nucleus a similar role has recently been proposed for carp that has a high level of structural and functional conservation with ankrd  both ankrd and carp are involved in striated muscle hypertrophy the mechanism by which muscle stretch is sensed and signals are transduced is still unknown however ankrd and carp could play similar roles in pathways leading to hypertrophy the triggering mechanisms being heart pressure overload monitored by carp and mechanical stretch in skeletal muscle monitored by ankrd  recently ankrd and carp have been proposed as members of a family of muscle ankyrin repeat proteins marps that form a complex with titin myopalladin and calpain protease p  involved in signaling and regulation of gene expression in response to muscle stress here we show that ankrd is able to interact with the z disc protein telethonin as well as being able to interact with three transcription factors yb  pml and p  ankrd binding to the ubiquitous transcription factor yb  can be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo this is not very surprising since a similar interaction was previously described for carp however the interactions with pml and p  are unexpected new findings with interesting implications in the ankrd signaling cascade ankrd co localizes with the transcriptional co activator and co repressor pml in nuclear bodies nbs in human myoblasts as detected by confocal immunofluorescence interestingly we show that ankrd not only binds the tumor suppressor protein p  both in vitro and in vivo but also enhances the up regulation of the p wafi cipi promoter by p  therefore our findings strengthen the hypothesis that ankrd may be involved in sensing stress signals and linking these to muscle gene regulation
