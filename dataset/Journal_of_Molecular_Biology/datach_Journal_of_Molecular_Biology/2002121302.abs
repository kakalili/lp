navigation inside a protease substrate selection and product exit in the tricorn protease from thermoplasma acidophilum
the proposed pathway and mechanism of substrate entry and product egress in the hexameric d symmetric tricorn protease from thermoplasma acidophilum were explored by crystallographic studies of ligand complexes and by structure based mutagenesis obstruction of the pore within the  bladed  propeller    domain by alkylation or oxidation of an engineered double cysteine mutant strongly decreased enzymatic activities in line herewith the crystal structure of the tricorn protease in complex with a trideca peptide inhibitor modifying the catalytic ser  revealed part of the peptide trapped inside the channel of the   domain the cysteine mutation widening the lumen of the  bladed  propeller    domain enhanced catalytic activity which was restored to normal values after its alkylation a charge reversal mutant at the putative anchor site of the substrate c terminus r  e r  e drastically reduced the proteolytic activity the complex crystal structure of a peptide inhibitor with a diketo group at the cleavage site mapped the substrate recognition site and confirmed the role of arg  arg  as an anchor site our results strongly suggest the wider   domain to serve as a selective filter and guide of the substrate to the sequestered active site while the narrower   domain routes the product to the surface moreover we identified the role of arg  arg  in anchoring the substrate c terminus
