The catalytic antibody 6D9, which was raised against a transition-state analogue (TSA), catalyzes the hydrolysis of a non-bioactive chloramphenicol monoester to generate chloramphenicol. It has been shown that 6D9 utilizes the binding affinity in the catalysis; the differential affinity of the TSA relative to the substrate is equal to the rate enhancement. To reveal the recognition mechanism of 6D9 for the TSA and the substrate, we performed NMR analysis of the Fv fragment of 6D9 (6D9-Fv), together with site-directed mutagenesis and stopped-flow kinetic analyses. Among six 6D9-Fv mutants, Y58(H)A and W100i(H)A displayed significant reductions in their affinities to the TSA, while their substrate-binding affinities were identical with that of the wild-type 6D9-Fv. The stopped-flow kinetic studies revealed that the TSA binding to 6D9-Fv occurred by an induced-fit mechanism. In contrast, no induced-fit type of TSA-binding mechanism was observed for Y58(H)A and W100i(H)A. From NMR experiments, we identified the residues with chemical shifts that were perturbed by the ligand-binding. The residues affected by the TSA binding were located on the TSA-binding site determined by the X-ray study, and on the regions far from the binding site. On the other hand, the residues affected by the substrate binding were localized on the TSA-binding site. As for W100i(H)A, no residue other than those in the binding site was affected by the ligand binding. On the basis of these results and the crystal structure, we concluded that the TSA binding induced a conformational change involving the formation of aromaticâ€“aromatic interactions and a hydrogen bond. These interactions can account for the differential affinity for the TSA relative to the substrate. W100i(H) probably plays an important role in inducing the conformational changes. The present NMR studies have enabled us to visualize the concept of transition-state stabilization in enzymatic catalysis, in which the transition-state contacts are better than those of the substrate.
