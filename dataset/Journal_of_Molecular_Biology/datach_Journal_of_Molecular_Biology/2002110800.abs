digging deep for ancient relics a survey of protein motifs in the intergenic sequences of four eukaryotic genomes
we have examined conserved protein motifs in the non coding intergenic regions   pseudomotif patterns   and surveyed their occurrence in the fly worm yeast and human genomes chromosomes  and  only  to identify these patterns we masked out annotated genes pseudogenes and repeat regions from the raw genomic sequence and then compared the remaining sequence in six frame translation against   patterns from the prosite database for each pseudomotif pattern the absolute number of occurrences is not very informative unless compared against a statistical expectation consequently we calculated the expected occurrence of each pattern using a poisson model and verified this with simulations using a p value cut off of    we found  pseudomotif patterns over represented in fly intergenic regions   in worm   in human and six in yeast these include the zinc finger leucine zipper nucleotide binding motif and egf domain many of the over represented patterns were common to two or more organisms but there were a few that were unique to specific ones furthermore we found more over represented patterns in the fly than in the worm although the fly has fewer pseudogenes this puzzling observation can be explained by a higher deletion rate in the fly genome we also surveyed under represented patterns finding  in the fly   in the worm   in human and two in yeast if intergenic sequences were truly random we would expect an equal number of over and under represented patterns the fact that for each organism the number of over represented patterns is greater than the number of under represented ones implies that a fraction of the intergenic regions consist of ancient protein fragments that due to accumulated disablements have become unrecognizable by conventional techniques for gene and pseudogene identification moreover we find that in aggregate the over represented pseudomotif patterns occupy a substantial fraction of the intergenic regions further information is available at http  pseudogene org
