crystal structure of rat gtp cyclohydrolase i feedback regulatory protein gfrp edited by i wilson
tetrahydrobiopterin the cofactor required for hydroxylation of aromatic amino acids regulates its own synthesis in mammals through feedback inhibition of gtp cyclohydrolase i this mechanism is mediated by a regulatory subunit called gtp cyclohydrolase i feedback regulatory protein gfrp  the    resolution crystal structure of rat gfrp shows that the protein forms a pentamer this indicates a model for the interaction of mammalian gtp cyclohydrolase i with its regulator gfrp kinetic investigations of human gtp cyclohydrolase i in complex with rat and human gfrp showed similar regulatory effects of both gfrp proteins
