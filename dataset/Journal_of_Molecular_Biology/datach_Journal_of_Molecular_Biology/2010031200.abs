the humanness of macaque antibody sequences
chimeric humanized and human antibodies have successively been exploited as therapeutics because their increasing human   self   character is expected to correspond with decreased immunogenicity which is critical for their clinical development thus humanness has been inferred to predict antibody immunogenicity humanness of antibody variable regions v regions has recently been studied using a parameter here referred to as the h score that evaluates similarity to expressed human sequences macaque macaca fascicularis antibody sequences are of particular interest because they have been suggested to have extremely human like character and recently macaque single chain variable fragments with very high affinity for various antigens have been isolated in this study the h scores of all macaque antibody v regions available in sequence data banks were compared with those of their human counterparts using statistical tests the results were found to be influenced by the relative size of the human families to which the macaque v regions are related as the relevance of families to immunogenicity is suspected but unproven a new parameter the  g score   was derived from the h score to avoid this influence and macaque v region sequences were reanalyzed using the g score both parameters show that these regions cannot be regarded as human when they derive from heavy chains but the humanness of light chains is variable it was shown that  germline humanization  of a macaque v region favourably influenced its humanness as evaluated by both h score and g score in addition the humanness of macaque sequences presented in patents has been analyzed the h score and g score define objectively the humanness of antibody v regions and their use is exemplified here
