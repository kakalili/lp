crystal structure of the anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer
we present crystal structures of the anabaena sensory rhodopsin transducer asrt  a soluble cytoplasmic protein that interacts with the first structurally characterized eubacterial retinylidene photoreceptor anabaena sensory rhodopsin asr  four crystal structures of asrt from three different spacegroups were obtained in all of which asrt is present as a planar c  tetramer consistent with our characterization of asrt as a tetramer in solution the asrt tetramer is tightly packed with large interfaces where the well structured  sandwich portion of the monomers provides the bulk of the tetramer forming interactions and forms a flat stable surface on one side of the tetramer the  face  only one of our four different asrt crystals reveals a c terminal  helix in the otherwise all  protein together with a large loop from each monomer on the opposite face of the tetramer the  face  which is flexible and largely disordered in the other three crystal forms gel filtration chromatography demonstrated that asrt forms stable tetramers in solution and isothermal microcalorimetry showed that the asrt tetramer binds to asr with a stoichiometry of one asrt tetramer per one asr photoreceptor with a kd of   m in the highest affinity measurements possible mechanisms for the interaction of this transducer tetramer with the asr photoreceptor via its flexible  face to mediate transduction of the light signal are discussed
