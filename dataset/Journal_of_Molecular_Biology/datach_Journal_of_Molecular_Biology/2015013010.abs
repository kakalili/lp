human apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease  ape  has   rna phosphatase and   exoribonuclease activities
apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease  ape  is the predominant mammalian enzyme in dna base excision repair pathway that cleaves the dna backbone immediately   to abasic sites in addition to its abasic endonuclease activity ape has   phosphatase and       exonuclease activities against dna we recently identified ape as an endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves at ua ug and ca sites in single stranded regions of rnas and can regulate c myc mrna level and half life in cells ape can also endonucleolytically cleave abasic single stranded rna here we show for the first time that the human ape has   rna phosphatase and   exoribonuclease activities using three distinct rna substrates we show that ape  but not rnase a can remove the phosphoryl group from the   end of rna decay products studies using various site directed ape mutant proteins h  n h  s d  n n a d  n y  f d  a f  a and d a suggest that the   rna phosphatase activity shares the same active center as its other known nuclease activities a number of ape variants previously identified in the human population including the most common d  e variant have greater than   reduction in the   rna phosphatase activity ape can remove a ribonucleotide from the   overhang of rna decay product but its       exoribonuclease activity against unstructured poly a  poly c  and poly u rnas is relatively weak this study further underscores the significance of understanding the role of ape in rna metabolism in vivo
