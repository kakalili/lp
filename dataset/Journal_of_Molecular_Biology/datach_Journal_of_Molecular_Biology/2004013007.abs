crystal structure of fully ligated adenylosuccinate synthetase from plasmodium falciparum
in the absence of the de novo purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway in parasitic protozoa purine salvage is of primary importance for parasite survival enzymes of the salvage pathway are therefore good targets for anti parasitic drugs adenylosuccinate synthetase adss  catalysing the first committed step in the synthesis of amp from imp is a potential target for anti protozoal chemotherapy we report here the crystal structure of adenylosuccinate synthetase from the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum complexed to  phosphoryl imp gdp mg  and the aspartate analogue hadacidin at   resolution the overall architecture of p falciparum adss pfadss is similar to the known structures from escherichia coli mouse and plants differences in substrate interactions seen in this structure provide a plausible explanation for the kinetic differences between pfadss and the enzyme from other species additional hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein with gdp may account for the ordered binding of substrates to the enzyme the dimer interface of pfadss is also different with a pronounced excess of positively charged residues differences highlighted here provide a basis for the design of species specific inhibitors of the enzyme
