anatomy of escherichia coli ribosome binding sites edited by d draper
during translational initiation in prokaryotes the   end of the  s rrna binds to a region just upstream of the initiation codon the relationship between this shine dalgarno sd region and the binding of ribosomes to translation start points has been well studied but a unified mathematical connection between the sd the initiation codon and the spacing between them has been lacking using information theory we constructed a model that treats these three components uniformly by assigning to the sd and the initiation region ir conservations in bits of information and by assigning to the spacing an uncertainty also in bits to build the model we first aligned the sd region by maximizing the information content there the ease of this process confirmed the existence of the sd pattern within a set of   reviewed and revised escherichia coli gene starts this large data set allowed us to show graphically by sequence logos that the spacing between the sd and the initiation region affects both the sd site conservation and its pattern we used the aligned sd the spacing and the initiation region to model ribosome binding and to identify gene starts that do not conform to the ribosome binding site model a total of   experimentally proven starts are more conserved have higher information content than the full set of revised starts which probably reflects an experimental bias against the detection of gene products that have inefficient ribosome binding sites models were refined cyclically by removing non conforming weak sites after this procedure models derived from either the original or the revised gene start annotation were similar therefore this information theory based technique provides a method for easily constructing biologically sensible ribosome binding site models such models should be useful for refining gene start predictions of any sequenced bacterial genome
