yidc driven membrane insertion of single fluorescent pf coat proteins
the membrane insertion of single bacteriophage pf coat proteins was observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy within seconds after addition of the purified and fluorescently labeled protein to liposomes or proteoliposomes containing the purified and reconstituted membrane insertase yidc of escherichia coli the translocation of the labeled residue was detected the  amino acid long pf coat protein was labeled with atto  and inserted into the proteoliposomes translocation of the dye into the proteoliposome was revealed by quenching the fluorescence outside of the vesicles this allowed us to distinguish single pf coat proteins that only bound to the surface of the liposomes from proteins that had inserted into the bilayer and translocated the dye into the lumen the pf coat protein required the presence of the yidc membrane insertase whereas mutants that have a membrane spanning region with an increased hydrophobicity were autonomously inserted into the liposomes without yidc
