determination of protein folding intermediate structures consistent with data from oxidative footprinting mass spectrometry
the mapping of folding landscapes remains an important challenge in protein chemistry pulsed oxidative labeling of exposed residues and their detection via mass spectrometry provide new means of taking time resolved  snapshots  of the structural changes that occur during protein folding however such experiments have been so far only interpreted qualitatively here we report the detailed structural interpretation of mass spectrometry data from fast photochemical oxidation of proteins fpop experiments at atomic resolution in a biased molecular dynamics approach we are able to calculate structures of the early folding intermediate of the model system barstar that are fully consistent with fpop data and  values furthermore structures calculated with both fpop data and  values are significantly less compact and have fewer helical residues than intermediate structures calculated with  values only this improves the agreement with the experimental  tanford value and cd measurements the restraints that we introduce facilitate the structural interpretation of fpop data and provide new means for refined structure calculations of transiently sampled states on protein folding landscapes
