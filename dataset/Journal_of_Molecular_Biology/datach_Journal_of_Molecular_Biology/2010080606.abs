tyr  of ran preserves the ran gtp gradient by inhibiting gtp hydrolysis
ran is a member of the superfamily of small gtpases which cycle between a gtp bound  on  and a gdp bound  off  state ran regulates nuclear transport in order to maintain a gradient of excess ran gtp within the nucleoplasm and excess ran gdp within the cytoplasm the hydrolysis of ran gtp in the nucleoplasm should be prevented whereas in the cytoplasm hydrolysis is catalyzed by ran gap gtpase activating protein  in this article we investigate the gtpase reaction of ran in complex with its binding protein ran binding protein  by time resolved fourier transform infrared spectroscopy we show that the slowdown of the intrinsic hydrolysis of rangtp is accomplished by tyrosine   which is probably misplacing the attacking water we monitored the interaction of ran with rangap which reveals two reactions steps by isotopic labeling of ran and rangap we were able to assign the first step to a small conformational change within the catalytic site the following bond breakage is the rate limiting step of hydrolysis an intermediate of protein bound phosphate as found for ras or rap systems is kinetically unresolved this demonstrates that despite the structural similarity among the g domain of the gtpases different reaction mechanisms are utilized
