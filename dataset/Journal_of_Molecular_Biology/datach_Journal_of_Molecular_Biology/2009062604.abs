x ray fluorescence microscopy reveals the role of selenium in spermatogenesis
selenium se is a trace element with important roles in human health several selenoproteins have essential functions in development however the cellular and tissue distribution of se remains largely unknown because of the lack of analytical techniques that image this element with sufficient sensitivity and resolution herein we report that x ray fluorescence microscopy xfm can be used to visualize and quantify the tissue cellular and subcellular topography of se we applied this technique to characterize the role of se in spermatogenesis and identified a dramatic se enrichment specifically in late spermatids a pattern that was not seen in any other elemental maps this enrichment was due to elevated levels of the mitochondrial form of glutathione peroxidase  and was fully dependent on the supplies of se by selenoprotein p high resolution scans revealed that se concentrated near the lumen side of elongating spermatids where structural components of sperm are formed during spermatogenesis maximal se associated with decreased phosphorus whereas zn did not change in sperm se was primarily in the midpiece and colocalized with cu and fe xfm allowed quantification of se in the midpiece    fg and head    fg of individual sperm cells revealing the ability of sperm cells to handle the amounts of this element well above its toxic levels overall the use of xfm allowed visualization of tissue and cellular se and provided important insights in the role of this and other trace elements in spermatogenesis
