side chain conformational changes upon protein  protein association
conformational changes upon protein  protein association are the key element of the binding mechanism the study presents a systematic large scale analysis of such conformational changes in the side chains the results indicate that short and long side chains have different propensities for the conformational changes long side chains with three or more dihedral angles are often subject to large conformational transition shorter residues with one or two dihedral angles typically undergo local conformational changes not leading to a conformational transition a relationship between the local readjustments and the equilibrium fluctuations of a side chain around its unbound conformation is suggested most of the side chains undergo larger changes in the dihedral angle most distant from the backbone the frequencies of the core to surface interface transitions of six nonpolar residues and tyr are larger than the frequencies of the opposite surface to core transitions the binding increases both polar and nonpolar interface areas however the increase of the nonpolar area is larger for all considered classes of protein complexes suggesting that the protein association perturbs the unbound interfaces to increase the hydrophobic contribution to the binding free energy to test modeling approaches to side chain flexibility in protein docking conformational changes in the x ray set were compared with those in the docking decoy sets the results lead to a better understanding of the conformational changes in proteins and suggest directions for efficient conformational sampling in docking protocols
