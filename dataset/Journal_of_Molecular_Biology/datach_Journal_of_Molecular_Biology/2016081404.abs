the details of glycolipid glycan hydrolysis by the structural analysis of a family   glycoside hydrolase from clostridium perfringens
clostridium perfringens is an opportunistic pathogen of humans and animals whose genome encodes a wide variety of putative carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes that are increasingly being shown to be directed toward the cleavage of host glycans among these putative enzymes is a member of glycoside hydrolase family   here we show that the recombinant enzyme referred to as cpnga   encoded by the gene cloned from c perfringens strain atcc    locus tag cpf    is a  n acetylgalactosaminidase similar to ngap from paenibacillus sp ts  like ngap cpnga  was able to cleave the terminal  d galnac     d gal and  d galnac     d gal motifs that would be found in glycosphigolipids the x ray crystal structure of cpnga  revealed it to have an n terminal  sandwich domain and a     barrel catalytic domain with a c terminal  helical elaboration the structures determined in complex with reaction products provide details of the   subsite architecture catalytic residues and a structural change in the active site that is likely required to enable hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by promoting engagement of the substrate by the catalytic residues the features of the active site support the likelihood of a substrate assisted catalytic mechanism for this enzyme the structures of an inactive mutant of cpnga  in complex with intact ga and gb glycosphingolipid motifs reveal insight into aglycon recognition and suggest that the kinked or pleated conformation of ga caused by the    linkage between n acetylgalactosamine and galactose and the accommodation of this conformation by the enzyme active site may be responsible for greater activity on ga
