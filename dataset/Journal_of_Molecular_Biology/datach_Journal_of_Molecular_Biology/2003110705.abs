a  polyorfomic  analysis of prokaryote genomes using disabled homology filtering reveals conserved but undiscovered short orfs
prokaryote gene annotation is complicated by large numbers of short open reading frames orfs that arise naturally from genetic code design historically many hypothetical orfs have been annotated as genes in microbes usually with an arbitrary length threshold e g greater than   codons  given the use of such thresholds what is the extent of genuine undiscovered short genes in the current sampling of prokaryote genomes to assess rigorously the potential under annotation of short orfs with homology we exhaustively compared the polyorfome  all possible orfs in  prokaryotes   bacteria and  archaea plus budding yeast  to itself and to all known proteins the novelty of our analysis is that firstly sequence comparisons to between both annotated and un annotated orfs are considered and secondly a two step disabled homology filter is applied to set aside putative pseudogenes and spurious orfs we find that un annotated homologous short orfs uhorfs correspond to a small but non negligible fraction of the annotated prokaryote proteomes       depending on selection criteria  moreover the disabled homology filter indicates that about a third of uhorfs correspond to putative pseudogenes or spurious orfs our analysis shows that the use of annotation length thresholds is unnecessary as there are manageable numbers of short orf homologies conserved without disablements across microbial genomes data on uhorfs are available from http  pseudogene org polyo
