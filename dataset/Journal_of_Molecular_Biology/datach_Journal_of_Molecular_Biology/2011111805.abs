pyrophosphorolysis of cca addition implication for fidelity
in nucleic acid polymerization reaction pyrophosphorolysis is the reversal of nucleotide addition in which the terminal nucleotide is excised in the presence of inorganic pyrophosphate ppi  the cca enzymes are unusual rna polymerases which catalyze cca addition to positions     at the trna   end without using a nucleic acid template to better understand the reaction mechanism of cca addition we tested pyrophosphorolysis of cca enzymes which are divided into two structurally distinct classes here we show that only class ii cca enzymes catalyze pyrophosphorolysis and that the reaction can initiate from all three cca positions and proceed processively until the removal of nucleotide c  pyrophosphorolysis of class ii enzymes establishes a fundamental difference from class i enzymes and it is achieved only with the trna structure and with specific divalent metal ions importantly pyrophosphorolysis enables class ii enzymes to efficiently remove an incorrect a  nucleotide from the   end at a rate much faster than the rate of a  incorporation suggesting the ability to perform a previously unexpected quality control mechanism for cca synthesis measurement of kinetic parameters of the class ii escherichia coli cca enzyme reveals that the enzyme catalyzes pyrophosphorolysis slowly relative to the forward nucleotide addition and that it exhibits weak binding affinity to ppi relative to ntp suggesting a mechanism in which ppi is rapidly released after each nucleotide addition as a driving force to promote the forward synthesis of cca
