binding of   amino   deoxycytidine   triphosphate to norovirus polymerase induces rearrangement of the active site
crystal structures of a genogroup ii  human norovirus polymerase bound to an rna primer  template duplex and the substrate analogue   amino   deoxycytidine   triphosphate have been determined to     resolution the alteration of the substrate binding site that is required to accommodate the   amino group leads to a rearrangement of the polymerase active site and a disruption of the coordination shells of the active site metal ions the mode of binding seen for   amino   deoxycytidine   triphosphate suggests a novel molecular mechanism of inhibition that may be exploited for the design of inhibitors targeting viral rna polymerases
