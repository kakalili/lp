Reverse transcription of HIV-1 viral RNA uses human tRNA3Lys as a primer. Recombinant tRNA3Lys was previously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, 15N-labelled and purified for NMR studies. It was shown to be functional for priming of HIV-1 reverse transcription. Using heteronuclear 2D and 3D NMR, we have been able to assign almost all the imino groups in the helical regions and involved in the tertiary base interactions of tRNA3Lys. This crucial step enabled us to address the question of the annealing mechanism of tRNA3Lys by the nucleocapsid protein (NC) using heteronuclear NMR. Moreover, structural aspects of the tRNA3Lys/ (12–53)NCp7 interaction have been characterised. The (12–53)NCp7 protein binds preferentially to the inside of the L-shape of the tRNA3Lys, on the acceptor and D stems, and at the level of the tertiary interactions between the D and T-Ψ-C loops. (12–53)NCp7 binding does not induce the melting of any single base-pair or unwinding of the tRNA3Lys helical domains. Moreover, NMR provides a unique means to investigate the base-pairs that are destabilised by (12–53)NCp7 binding. Indeed, the measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time T1 and of the exchange time of the imino protons revealed two major regions sensitive to catalysis by the protein, namely the G6-U67 and T54(A58) pairs. It is interesting that for the biological role of the NC protein, these pairs could be the starting points of the tRNA melting required for the hybridisation to the viral RNA.
