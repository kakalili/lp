a heterodimeric coiled coil peptide pair selected in vivo from a designed library versus library ensemble edited by a r fersht
novel heterodimeric coiled coil pairs were selected simultaneously from two dna libraries using an in vivo protein fragment complementation assay with dihydrofolate reductase and the best pair was biophysically characterized we randomized the interface flanking e and g positions to gln glu arg or lys and the core a position to asn or val in both helices simultaneously using trinucleotide codons in dna synthesis selection cycles with three different stringencies yielded sets of coiled coil pairs of which  clones were statistically analyzed thereby properties most crucial for successful heterodimerization could be distinguished from those mediating more subtle optimization a strong bias towards an asn pair in the core a position indicated selection for structural uniqueness and a reduction of charge repulsions at the e g positions indicated selection for stability increased stringency led to additional selection for heterospecificity by destabilizing the respective homodimers interestingly the best heterodimers did not contain exclusively complementary charges the dominant pair winzip a b  proved to be at least as stable in vitro as naturally occurring coiled coils and was shown to be dimeric and highly heterospecific with a kd of approximately  nm as a result of having been selected in vivo it possesses all characteristics required for a general in vivo heterodimerization module the combination of rational library design and in vivo selection presented here is a very powerful strategy for protein design and it can reveal new structural relationships
