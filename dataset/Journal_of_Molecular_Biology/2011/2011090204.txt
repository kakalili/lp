The ubiquitous molecular chaperone 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) play key roles in maintaining protein homeostasis. Hsp70s contain two functional domains: a nucleotide binding domain and a substrate binding domain. The two domains are connected by a highly conserved inter-domain linker, and allosteric coupling between the two domains is critical for chaperone function. The auxiliary chaperone 40-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp40) facilitate all the biological processes associated with Hsp70s by stimulating the ATPase activity of Hsp70s. Although an overall essential role of the inter-domain linker in both allosteric coupling and Hsp40 interaction has been suggested, the molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Previously, we reported a crystal structure of a full-length Hsp70 homolog, in which the inter-domain linker forms a well-ordered Î² strand. Four highly conserved hydrophobic residues reside on the inter-domain linker. In DnaK, a well-studied Hsp70, these residues are V389, L390, L391, and L392. In this study, we biochemically dissected their roles. The inward-facing side chains of V389 and L391 form extensive hydrophobic contacts with the nucleotide binding domain, suggesting their essential roles in coupling the two functional domains, a hypothesis confirmed by mutational analysis. On the other hand, L390 and L392 face outward on the surface. Mutation of either abolishes DnaK's in vivo function, yet intrinsic biochemical properties remain largely intact. In contrast, Hsp40 interaction is severely compromised. Thus, for the first time, we separated the two essential roles of the highly conserved Hsp70 inter-domain linker: coupling the two functional domains through V389 and L391 and mediating the interaction with Hsp40 through L390 and L392.
