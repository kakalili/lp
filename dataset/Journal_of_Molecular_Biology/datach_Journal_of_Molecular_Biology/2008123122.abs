solution structure and dynamics of the wild type pseudoknot of human telomerase rna
telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that replicates the   ends of linear chromosomes by successive additions of telomere repeat dna the telomerase holoenzyme contains two essential components for catalysis a telomerase reverse transcriptase tert and telomerase rna ter  the ter includes a template for telomere repeat synthesis as well as other domains required for function we report the solution structure of the wild type minimal conserved human ter pseudoknot refined with an extensive set of rdcs and a detailed analysis of the effect of the bulge u  on pseudoknot structure dynamics analyzed by rdc and  c relaxation measurements and base pair stability the overall structure of pkwt is highly similar to the previously reported  u  pseudoknot pkdu that has a deletion of a conserved bulge u important for catalytic activity for direct comparison to pkwt the structure of pkdu was re refined with a comparable set of rdcs both pseudoknots contain a catalytically essential triple helix at the junction of the two stems including two stem  loop  minor groove triples a junction loop  loop  hoogsteen base pair and stem  loop  major groove u a u watson  crick  hoogsteen triples located directly above the bulge u   however there are significant differences in the stabilities of base pairs near the bulge and the dynamics of some nucleotides the stability of the base pairs in stem  surrounding the bulge u  is greatly decreased with the result that the watson  crick pairs in the triple helix begin to unfold before the hoogsteen pairs which may affect telomerase assembly and activity the bulge u is positioned in the minor groove on the face opposite the triple helical interactions and sterically blocks the a    oh which has recently been proposed to have a role in catalysis the bulge u may serve as a hinge providing backbone flexibility in this region
