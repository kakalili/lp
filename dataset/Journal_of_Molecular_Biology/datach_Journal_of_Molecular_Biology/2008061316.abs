the     gene family is a rapidly diversifying host defense gene cluster in the purple sea urchin strongylocentrotus purpuratus
the genome of the purple sea urchin contains numerous large gene families with putative immunological functions one gene family known as     is characterized by extraordinary molecular diversity resulting from single nucleotide polymorphisms and the presence or the absence of  large blocks of sequences known as elements the mosaic composition of elements known as element patterns that is present within the members of this gene family is encoded entirely in the second of two exons many of the elements correspond to one of six types of repeats that are present throughout the genes the sequence diversity and variation in element patterns led us to investigate the evolution of the     gene family the work presented here suggests that the element patterns are the result of both recombination and duplication and or deletion of intragenic repeats each element is composed of a limited number of similar but distinct sequences and their distribution among the     genes suggests frequent recombination within this gene family phylogenetic analyses of five     elements and two regions of the intron were performed using two tests incongruence length difference and incongruence permutation results indicated that each pair of sequence segments was incongruent suggesting that recombination occurs frequently along the length of the genes including both the intron and the second exon and that recombination is not restricted to intact elements paradoxically the high level of similarity among the elements indicated that the     genes appear to be the result of a recent diversification these results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that invertebrate immune systems are not simple and static but are dynamic and highly complex and may employ group specific mechanisms for diversification
