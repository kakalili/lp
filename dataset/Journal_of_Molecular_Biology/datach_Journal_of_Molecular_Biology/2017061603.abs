functional requirements for djla and rraa mediated enhancement of recombinant membrane protein production in the engineered escherichia coli strains suptoxd and suptoxr
in previous work we have generated the engineered escherichia coli strains suptoxd and suptoxr which upon co expression of the effector genes djla or rraa respectively are capable of suppressing the cytotoxicity caused by membrane protein mp overexpression and of producing dramatically enhanced yields for a variety of recombinant mps of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin here we investigated the functional requirements for dnaj like protein a djla  and regulator of ribonuclease activity a rraa mediated enhancement of recombinant mp production in these strains and show that  i djla and rraa act independently that is the beneficial effects of each protein on recombinant mp production occur through a mechanism that does not involve the other and in a non additive manner  ii full length and membrane bound djla is required for exerting its beneficial effects on recombinant mp production in e coli suptoxd  iii the mp production promoting properties of djla in suptoxd involve the action of the molecular chaperone dnak but do not rely on the activation of the regulation of capsular synthesis response a well established consequence of djla overexpression  iv the observed rraa mediated effects in e coli suptoxr involve the ribonucleolytic activity of rnase e but not that of its paralogous ribonuclease rnase g and v djla and rraa are unique among similar e coli proteins in their ability to promote bacterial recombinant mp production these observations provide important clues about the molecular requirements for suppressed toxicity and enhanced mp accumulation in suptoxd suptoxr and will guide future studies aiming to decipher the exact mechanism of djla and rraa mediated enhancement of recombinant mp production in these strains
