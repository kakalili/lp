role of small oligomers on the amyloidogenic aggregation free energy landscape
we combine atomic force microscopy particle size distribution measurements with earlier measurements on  anilino  naphthalene sulfonate thioflavin t and dynamic light scattering to develop a quantitative kinetic model for the aggregation of  lactoglobulin into amyloid we directly compare our simulations to the population distributions provided by dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy we combine species in the simulation according to structural type for comparison with fluorescence fingerprint results the kinetic model of amyloidogenesis leads to an aggregation free energy landscape we define the roles of and propose a classification scheme for different oligomeric species based on their location in the aggregation free energy landscape we relate the different types of oligomers to the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the toxic oligomer hypothesis for amyloid related diseases we discuss existing kinetic mechanisms in terms of the different types of oligomers we provide a possible resolution to the toxic oligomer  amyloid coincidence
