structural requirements for nucleocapsid protein mediated dimerization of avian leukosis virus rna
the avian leukosis virus alv belongs to the alpha group of retroviruses that are widespread in nature the   untranslated region of alv genome contains the l element that is important for virus infectivity and the formation of an unstable rna dimer in vitro the l sequence is predicted to fold into a long stem  loop structure with two internal loops and an apical one phylogenetic analysis predicts that the l stem  loop is conserved in alpharetroviruses furthermore a significant selection mechanism maintains a palindrome in the apical loop the nucleocapsid protein of the alpharetroviruses ncp  is required for rna dimer formation and replication in vivo it is not known whether l can be an ncp  mediated rna dimerization site able to bind ncp  with high affinity here we report that ncp  chaperones formation of a stable alv rna dimer through l  to investigate the ncp  mediated l dimerization reaction we performed site directed mutagenesis gel retardation and heterodimerization assays and analysis of thermostability of dimeric rnas we show that the affinity of ncp  for l is lower than its affinity for the   rna packaging signal results show that conservation of a long stem  loop structure and a loop  loop interaction are not required for ncp  mediated l dimerization we show that the l apical stem  loop is sufficient to form an extended duplex and the whole stem  loop l cannot be converted by ncp  into a duplex extending throughout l  three dimensional modelling of the stable l dimer supports the notion that the extended duplex may represent the minimal dimer linkage structure found in the genomic rna
