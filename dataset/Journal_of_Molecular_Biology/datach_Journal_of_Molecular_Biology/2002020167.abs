towards proteome wide production of monoclonal antibody by phage display edited by j karn
sequencing of the human genome reveals that there are approximately    genes that encode an even greater number of proteins which comprise the human proteome characterization of gene products at the genome wide scale requires the development of high throughput methods to generate tempero spatial information on each and every protein in the cell under normal and pathological conditions monoclonal antibodies are important reagents for these studies we have developed a method to generate human monoclonal antibodies by selecting phage antibody libraries directly on antigen blotted onto poly vinylidene floride membranes cellular proteins are first separated by two dimensional  d gel electrophoresis western blotted onto poly vinylidene floride membranes and used to select phage antibody libraries monoclonal antibodies can be generated against individual protein spots on a d gel the antibodies are functional in western blotting elisa and immunohistochemistry automation of this process should allow high throughput production of monoclonal phage antibodies against cellular proteins as well as proteins that are uniquely expressed under pathological conditions
