proteasomes can degrade a significant proportion of cellular proteins independent of ubiquitination
the critical role of the ubiquitin  s proteasome system in regulation of protein homeostasis in eukaryotes is well established in contrast the impact of the ubiquitin independent proteolytic activity of proteasomes is poorly understood through biochemical analysis of mammalian lysates we find that the  s proteasome latent in peptide hydrolysis specifically cleaves more than   of all cellular proteins thirty intrinsic proteasome substrates ipss were identified and in vitro studies of their processing revealed that cleavage occurs at disordered regions generating stable products encompassing structured domains the mechanism of ips recognition is remarkably well conserved in the eukaryotic kingdom as mammalian and yeast  s proteasomes exhibit the same target specificity further  s proteasomes specifically recognize and cleave ipss at similar sites independent of ubiquitination suggesting that disordered regions likely constitute the universal structural signal for ips proteolysis by proteasomes finally we show that proteasomes contribute to physiological regulation of ips levels in living cells and the inactivation of ubiquitin activating enzyme e does not prevent ips degradation collectively these findings suggest a significant contribution of the ubiquitin independent proteasome degradation pathway to the regulation of protein homeostasis in eukaryotes
