structural studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis rv   reveal a monomeric membrane anchoring protein with two separate domains
rv   from mycobacterium tuberculosis belongs to the ompa outer membrane protein a family of outer membrane proteins it functions as a pore forming protein the deletion of this gene impairs the uptake of some water soluble substances such as serine glucose and glycerol rv   has also been shown to play a part in low ph environment adaption which may play a part in pathogenic mycobacteria overcoming the host s defense mechanisms based on many bacterial physiological data and recent structural studies it was proposed that rv   forms an oligomeric channel to carry out such functions in this work biochemical and structural data obtained from solution nmr and epr spectroscopy indicated that rv   is a monomeric membrane anchoring protein with two separate domains rather than an oligomeric pore using nmr chemical shift perturbation and isothermal calorimetric titration assays we show that rv   was able to interact with zn  ions which may indicate a role for rv   in the process of zn  acquisition
