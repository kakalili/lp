structural insights into the dehydroascorbate reductase activity of human omega class glutathione transferases
the reduction of dehydroascorbate dha to ascorbic acid aa is a vital cellular function the omega class glutathione transferases gsts catalyze several reductive reactions in cellular biochemistry including dha reduction in humans two isozymes gsto  and gsto   with significant dha reductase dhar activity are found sharing   sequence identity while the activity of gsto  is higher it is significantly more unstable in vitro we report the first crystal structures of human gsto   stabilized through site directed mutagenesis and determined at     resolution in the presence and absence of glutathione gsh  the structure of a human gsto  has been determined at     resolution in complex with the reaction product aa which unexpectedly binds in the g site where the glutamyl moiety of gsh binds the structure suggests a similar mode of ascorbate binding in gsto   this is the first time that a non gsh based reaction product has been observed in the g site of any gst aa stacks against a conserved aromatic residue f  equivalent to y  in gsto   mutation of y  to alanine in gsto  eliminates dhar activity from these structures and other biochemical data we propose a mechanism of substrate binding and catalysis of dhar activity
