subunit conformations and assembly states of a dna translocating motor the terminase of bacteriophage p
bacteriophage p  a podovirus infecting strains of salmonella typhimurium packages a  kbp genome using a headful mechanism dna translocation is accomplished by the phage terminase a powerful molecular motor consisting of large and small subunits although many of the structural proteins of the p  virion have been well characterized little is known about the terminase subunits and their molecular mechanism of dna translocation we report here structural and assembly properties of ectopically expressed and highly purified terminase large and small subunits the large subunit gp  which contains the nuclease and atpase activities of terminase exists as a stable monomer with an    fold the small subunit gp  which recognizes dna for packaging and may regulate gp activity exhibits a highly  helical secondary structure and self associates to form a stable oligomeric ring in solution for wild type gp  the ring contains nine subunits as demonstrated by hydrodynamic measurements electron microscopy and native mass spectrometry we have also characterized a gp mutant ala    thr that forms a  subunit ring despite a subunit fold indistinguishable from wild type both the nonameric and decameric gp rings exhibit nonspecific dna binding activity and gp is able to bind strongly to the dna gp complex but not to dna alone we propose a scheme for the roles of p  terminase large and small subunits in the recruitment and packaging of viral dna and discuss the model in relation to proposals for terminase driven dna translocation in other phages
