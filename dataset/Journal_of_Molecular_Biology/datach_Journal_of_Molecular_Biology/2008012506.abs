bloom s syndrome helicase and mus  are required to induce transient double strand dna breaks in response to dna replication stress
perturbed dna replication either activates a cell cycle checkpoint which halts dna replication or decreases the rate of dna synthesis without activating a checkpoint here we report that at low doses replication inhibitors did not activate a cell cycle checkpoint but they did activate a process that required functional bloom s syndrome associated blm helicase mus  nuclease and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and rad related atr kinase to induce transient double stranded dna breaks the induction of transient dna breaks was accompanied by dissociation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna and dna polymerase  from replication forks in cells with functional blm mus  and atr the transient breaks were promptly repaired and dna continued to replicate at a slow pace in the presence of replication inhibitors in cells that lacked blm mus  or atr transient breaks did not form dna replication did not resume and exposure to low doses of replication inhibitors was toxic these observations suggest that blm helicase atr kinase and mus  nuclease are required to convert perturbed replication forks to dna breaks when cells encounter conditions that decelerate dna replication thereby leading to the rapid repair of those breaks and resumption of dna replication without incurring dna damage and without activating a cell cycle checkpoint
