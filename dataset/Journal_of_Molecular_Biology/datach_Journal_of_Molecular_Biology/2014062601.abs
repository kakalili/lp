gly  ser  amyloid  protein structural isomorphs produce distinct a   conformational dynamics and assembly characteristics
one of the earliest events in amyloid  protein a  self association is nucleation of a  monomer folding through formation of a turn at gly  lys  we report here the effects of structural changes at the center of the turn gly  ser  on a   conformational dynamics and assembly we used  click peptide  chemistry to quasi synchronously create a   from  o acyliso a   ia   through a ph jump from  to   we also synthesized n  acetyl ser  ia   ac ia    which cannot undergo o  n acyl chemistry to study the behavior of this ester form of a   itself at neutral ph data from experiments monitoring increases in  sheet formation thioflavin t cd  hydrodynamic radius rh  scattering intensity quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy  and extent of oligomerization ion mobility spectroscopy  mass spectrometry were quite consistent a rank order of ac ia   gt ia   gt a   was observed photochemically cross linked ia   displayed an oligomer distribution with a prominent dimer band that was not present with a   these dimers also were observed selectively in ia   in ion mobility spectrometry experiments the distinct biophysical behaviors of ia   and a   appear to be due to the conversion of ia   into  pure  a   monomer a nascent form of a   that does not comprise the variety of oligomeric and aggregated states present in pre existent a   these results emphasize the importance of the gly  ser  dipeptide in organizing a   monomer structure and thus suggest that drugs altering the interactions of this dipeptide with neighboring side chain atoms or with the peptide backbone could be useful in therapeutic strategies targeting formation of a  oligomers and higher order assemblies
