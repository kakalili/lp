nmr analysis of methyl  c methionine uvrb from bacillus caldotenax reveals uvrb  domain  heterodimer formation in solution
uvrb is a central dna damage recognition protein involved in bacterial nucleotide excision repair structural information has been limited by the apparent disorder of the c terminal domain  in crystal structures of intact uvrb in solution the isolated domain  is found to form a helix  loop  helix dimer in order to gain insight into the behavior of uvrb in solution we have performed nmr studies on methyl  c methionine labeled uvrb from bacillus caldotenax molecular mass   kda  the  methyl resonances were assigned on the basis of site directed mutagenesis and domain deletion solvent accessibility was assessed based on the relaxation and chemical shift responses of the probe methyl resonances to the stable nitroxide  hydroxy     tetramethylpiperidine  oxyl tempol  m   located at the potential dimer interface of domain  provides an ideal probe for uvrb dimerization behavior the m  resonance of uvrb is very broad consistent with some degree of monomer  dimer exchange and or conformational instability of the exposed dimer interface upon addition of unlabeled domain  peptide the m  resonance of uvrb sharpens and shifts to a position consistent with a uvrb  domain  heterodimer a dissociation constant kd value of    m for the binding constant of uvrb with the domain  peptide was derived from surface plasmon resonance studies due to the flexibility of the domain    linker inferred from limited proteolysis data and from the relaxation behavior of linker residue m   the position of domain  is constrained not by the stiffness of the linking segment but by direct interactions with domains    in uvrb in summary uvrb homodimerization is disfavored while domain  homodimerization and uvrb  domain  heterodimerization are allowed
