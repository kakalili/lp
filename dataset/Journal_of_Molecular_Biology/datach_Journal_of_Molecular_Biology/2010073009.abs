action at hooked or twisted  hooked dna juxtapositions rationalizes unlinking preference of type  topoisomerases
the mathematical basis of the hypothesis that type  topoisomerases recognize and act at specific dna juxtapositions has been investigated by coarse grained lattice polymer models showing that selective segment passages at hooked juxtapositions can result in dramatic reductions in catenane and knot populations the lattice modeling approach is here extended to account for the narrowing of variance of linking number lk of dna circles by type  topoisomerases in general the steady state variance of lk resulting from selective segment passages at a specific juxtaposition geometry j is inversely proportional to the average linking number   lk  j of circles with the given juxtaposition based on this formulation we demonstrate that selective segment passages at hooked juxtapositions reduce the variance of lk the dependence of this effect on model dna circle size is remarkably similar to that observed experimentally for type  topoisomerases which appear to be less capable in narrowing lk variance for small dna circles than for larger dna circles this behavior is rationalized by a substantial cancellation of writhe in small circles with hook like juxtapositions during our simulations we uncovered a twisted variation of the hooked juxtaposition that has an even more dramatic effect on lk variance narrowing than the hooked juxtaposition for an extended set of juxtapositions we detected a significant correlation between the lk narrowing potential and the logarithmic decatenating and unknotting potentials for a given juxtaposition a trend reminiscent of scaling relations observed with experimental measurements on type  topoisomerases from a variety of organisms the consistent agreement between theory and experiment argues for type  topoisomerase action at hooked or twisted  hooked dna juxtapositions
