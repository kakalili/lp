a flexible peptide tether controls accessibility of a unique c terminal rna binding domain in leucyl trna synthetases
a unique c terminal domain extension is required by most leucyl trna synthetases leurs for aminoacylation in one exception the enzymatic activity of yeast mitochondrial leurs is actually impeded by its own c terminal domain it was proposed that the yeast mitochondrial leurs has compromised its aminoacylation activity to some extent and adapted its c terminus for a second role in rna splicing which is also essential x ray crystal structures of the leurs  trna complex show that the  residue c terminal domain is tethered to the main body of the enzyme via a flexible peptide linker and allows interactions with the trnaleu elbow we hypothesized that this short peptide linker would facilitate rigid body movement of the c terminal domain as leurs transitions between an aminoacylation and editing complex or in the case of yeast mitochondrial leurs an rna splicing complex the roles of the c terminal linker peptide for escherichia coli and yeast mitochondrial leurs were investigated via deletion mutagenesis as well as by introducing chimeric swaps deletions within the c terminal linker of e coli leurs determined that its length rather than its sequence was critical to aminoacylation and editing activities although deletions in the yeast mitochondrial leurs peptide linker destabilized the protein in general more stable chimeric enzymes that contained an e coli leurs c terminal domain showed that shortening its tether stimulated aminoacylation activity this suggested that limiting c terminal domain accessibility to trnaleu facilitates its role in protein synthesis and may be a unique adaptation of yeast mitochondrial leurs that accommodates its second function in rna splicing
