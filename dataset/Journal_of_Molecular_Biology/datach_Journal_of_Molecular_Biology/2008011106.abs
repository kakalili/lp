sub terminal sequences modulating is  transposition in vivo and in vitro
inverted repeats of insertion sequences iss are indispensable for transposition we demonstrate that sub terminal sequences adjacent to the inverted repeats of is  are also required for optimal transposition activity we have developed a cell free recombination system and showed that the transposase catalyses formation of a figure of eight transposition intermediate where a  bp long single strand bridge holds the inverted repeat sequences irs together this is the first demonstration of the figure of eight structure in a non is family element suggesting that this mechanism is likely more widely adopted among is families we show that the absence of sub terminal is  sequences negatively influences figure of eight production both in vivo and in vitro these regions enhance ir  ir junction formation and ir targeting events in vivo enhancer elements have been identified within   bp internal to irl and   bp internal to irr in the right end a decanucleotide    gagataattg    is responsible for wild type activity while in the left end a complex assembly of repetitive elements is required functioning of the   bp element in the right end is position dependent and the repetitive elements in the left end act cooperatively and may influence bendability of the end in vitro kinetic experiments suggest that the sub terminal enhancers may at least partly be transposase dependent such enhancers may reflect a subtle regulatory mechanism for is  transposition
