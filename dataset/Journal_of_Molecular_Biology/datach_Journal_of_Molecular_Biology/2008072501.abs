high resolution crystal structure of activated cyt ba monomer from bacillus thuringiensis subsp israelensis
the cyt family of proteins consists of  endotoxins expressed during sporulation of several subspecies of bacillus thuringiensis its members possess insecticidal hemolytic and cytolytic activities through pore formation and attract attention due to their potential use as vehicles for targeted membrane destruction the  endotoxins of subsp israelensis include three cyt species a major cyt aa and two minor proteins cyt ba and cyt ca a cleaved cyt protein that lacks the n and c terminal segments forms a toxic monomer here we describe the crystal structure of cyt ba cleaved at its amino and carboxy termini by bacterial endogenous protease s  overall its fold resembles that of the previously described volvatoxin a and the nontoxic form of cyt aa the structural similarity between these three proteins may provide information regarding the mechanism s of membrane perforating toxins
