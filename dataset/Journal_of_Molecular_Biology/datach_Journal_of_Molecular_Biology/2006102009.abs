structural and functional studies of epsc a crucial component of the type  secretion system from vibrio cholerae
the type  secretion system t ss occurring in gram negative bacteria is composed of     different proteins which form large assemblies spanning two membranes and secreting several virulence factors in folded state across the outer membrane the t ss component epsc of vibrio cholerae plays an important role in this machinery while anchored in the inner membrane by far the largest part of epsc is periplasmic containing a so called homology region hr domain and a pdz domain here we report studies on the structure and function of both periplasmic domains of epsc the crystal structures of two variants of the pdz domain of epsc from v cholerae were determined at better than    resolution compared to the short variant the longer variant contains an additional n terminal helix and reveals a significant difference in the position of helix  b with respect to the  sheet both our structures show that the pdz domain of epsc adopts a more open form than in previously reported structures of other pdz domains most interestingly in the crystals of the short epsc pdz domain the peptide binding groove interacts with an  helix from a neighboring subunit burying       solvent accessible surface this makes it possible that the pdz domain of this bacterial protein binds proteins in a manner which is altogether different from that seen in any other pdz domain so far we also determined that the hr domain of epsc is primarily responsible for the interaction with the secretin epsd while the pdz is not or much less so this new finding together with studies of others leads to the suggestion that the pdz domain of epsc may interact with exoproteins to be secreted while the hr domain plays a key role in linking the inner membrane sub complex of the t ss in v cholerae to the outer membrane secretin
