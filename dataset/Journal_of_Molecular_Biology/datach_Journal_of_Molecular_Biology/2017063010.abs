aurora kinase b phosphorylates histone h  at serine  during mitosis in mammalian cells
serine  of histone h  is phosphorylated during mitosis in mammalian cells and has been shown to influence chromosome segregation we established a screening system to identify candidate kinase s phosphorylating h  s  by using sirna library targeting   human kinases and we confirmed the results with an independent kinase inhibitor screen aurora kinase b was the best candidate hit in both screens moreover the kinase activity of aurora b on h  s  was biochemically confirmed with nucleosomal substrates in vitro
