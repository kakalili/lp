structural variation in pwwp domains
the pwwp domain is a ubiquitous eukaryotic protein module characterised by a region of sequence similarity of approximately  amino acids containing a highly conserved pwwp motif it is frequently found in proteins associated with chromatin we have determined the structure of a pwwp domain from the s pombe protein spbc   c using nmr spectroscopy the structure is composed of a five stranded beta barrel followed by two alpha helices comparison to the recently reported structure of a homologous domain from the mammalian dna methyltransferase dnmt b reveals substantial differences both in the c terminal helical region and in the pwwp motif
