It appears plausible that natural selection constrains, to some extent at least, the stability in many natural proteins. If, during protein evolution, stability fluctuates within a comparatively narrow range, then mutations are expected to be fixed with frequencies that reflect mutational effects on stability. Indeed, we recently reported a robust correlation between the effect of 27 conservative mutations on the thermodynamic stability (unfolding free energy) of Escherichia coli thioredoxin and the frequencies of residues occurrences in sequence alignments. We show here that this correlation likely implies a lower limit to thermodynamic stability of only a few kJ/mol below the unfolding free energy of the wild-type (WT) protein. We suggest, therefore, that the correlation does not reflect natural selection of thermodynamic stability by itself, but of some other factor which is linked to thermodynamic stability for the mutations under study. We propose that this other factor is the kinetic stability of thioredoxin in vivo, since( i) kinetic stability relates to irreversible denaturation, (ii) the rate of irreversible denaturation in a crowded cellular environment (or in a harsh extracellular environment) is probably determined by the rate of unfolding, and (iii) the half-life for unfolding changes in an exponential manner with activation free energy and, consequently, comparatively small free energy effects can have deleterious consequences for kinetic stability. This proposal is supported by the results of a kinetic study of the WT form and the 27 single-mutant variants of E. coli thioredoxin based on the global analyses of chevron plots and equilibrium unfolding profiles determined from double-jump unfolding assays. This kinetic study suggests, furthermore, one of the factors that may contribute to the high activation free energy for unfolding in thioredoxin (required for kinetic stability), namely the energetic optimization of native-state residue environments in regions, which become disrupted in the transition state for unfolding.
