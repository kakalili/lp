intrinsically disordered c terminal tails of e coli single stranded dna binding protein regulate cooperative binding to single stranded dna
the homotetrameric escherichia coli single stranded dna binding protein ssb plays a central role in dna replication repair and recombination e coli ssb can bind to long single stranded dna ssdna in multiple binding modes using all four subunits  ssb  mode or only two subunits  ssb  binding mode  with the binding mode preference regulated by salt concentration and ssb binding density these binding modes display very different ssdna binding properties with the ssb  mode displaying highly cooperative binding to ssdna ssb tetramers also bind an array of partner proteins recruiting them to their sites of action this is achieved through interactions with the last  amino acids acidic tip of the intrinsically disordered linkers idls within the four c terminal tails connected to the ssdna binding domains here we show that the amino acid composition and length of the idl affects the ssdna binding mode preferences of ssb protein surprisingly the number of idls and the lengths of individual idls together with the acidic tip contribute to highly cooperative binding in the ssb  binding mode hydrodynamic studies and atomistic simulations suggest that the e coli ssb idls show a preference for forming an ensemble of globular conformations whereas the idl from plasmodium falciparum ssb forms an ensemble of more extended random coils the more globular conformations correlate with cooperative binding
