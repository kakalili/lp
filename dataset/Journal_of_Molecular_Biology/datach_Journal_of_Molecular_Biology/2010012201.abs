characterization of inhibitor bound  synuclein dimer role of  synuclein n terminal region in dimerization and inhibitor binding
synuclein is a major component of filamentous inclusions that are histological hallmarks of parkinson s disease and other  synucleinopathies previous analyses have revealed that several polyphenols inhibit  synuclein assembly with low micromolar ic  values and that sds stable noncytotoxic soluble  synuclein oligomers are formed in their presence structural elucidation of inhibitor bound  synuclein oligomers is obviously required for the better understanding of the inhibitory mechanism in order to characterize inhibitor bound  synucleins in detail we have prepared  synuclein dimers in the presence of polyphenol inhibitors exifone gossypetin and dopamine and purified the products peptide mapping and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that exifone treated  synuclein monomer and dimer were oxidized at all four methionine residues of  synuclein immunoblot analysis and redox cycling staining of endoproteinase asp n digested products showed that the n terminal region     is involved in the dimerization and exifone binding of  synuclein ultra high field nmr analysis of inhibitor bound  synuclein dimers showed that the signals derived from the n terminal region of  synuclein exhibited line broadening confirming that the n terminal region is involved in inhibitor induced dimerization the c terminal portion still predominantly exhibited the random coil character observed in monomeric  synuclein we propose that the n terminal region of  synuclein plays a key role in the formation of  synuclein assemblies
