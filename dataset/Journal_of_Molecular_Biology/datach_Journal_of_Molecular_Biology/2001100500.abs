zooming in on the hydrophobic ridge of h db implications for the conformational variability of bound peptides edited by i a wilson
class i major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules which display intracellularly processed peptides on the cell surface for scanning by t cell receptors tcrs  are extraordinarily polymorphic mhc polymorphism is believed to result from natural selection since individuals heterozygous at the corresponding loci can cope with a larger number of pathogens here we present the crystal structures of the murine mhc molecule h db in complex with the peptides gp  and np  from the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv  solved at     and     resolution respectively the most prominent feature of h db is a hydrophobic ridge that cuts across its antigen binding site which is conserved in the ld like family of class i mhc molecules the comparison with previously solved crystal structures of peptide h db complexes shows that the hydrophobic ridge focuses the conformational variability of the bound peptides in a  hot spot   which could allow optimal tcr interaction and discrimination this finding suggests a functional reason for the conservation of this structural element
