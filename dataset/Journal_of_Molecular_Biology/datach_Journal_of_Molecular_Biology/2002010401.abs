archaeal group ii chaperonin mediates protein folding in the cis cavity without a detachable groes like co chaperonin edited by w baumeister
group ii chaperonins of archaea and eukaryotes are distinct from group i chaperonins of bacteria whereas group i chaperonins require the co chaperonin cpn  or groes for protein folding no co chaperonin has been known for group ii the protein folding mechanism of group ii chaperonins is not yet clear to understand this mechanism we examined protein refolding by the recombinant  or  subunit chaperonin homo oligomer   mer and   mer from a hyperthermoplilic archaeum thermococcus strain ks  using a model substrate green fluorescent protein gfp  the   mer and   mer captured the non native gfp and promoted its refolding without any co chaperonin in an atp dependent manner a non hydrolyzable atp analog amp pnp induced the gfp refolding mediated by   mer but not by the   mer a mutant  subunit chaperonin homo oligomer trap   could capture the non native protein but lacked the ability to refold it although trap  suppressed atp dependent refolding of gfp mediated by   mer or   mer it did not affect the amp pnp dependent refolding this indicated that the gfp refolding mediated by   mer with amp pnp was not accessible to the trap   gel filtration chromatography and a protease protection experiment revealed that this refolded gfp in the presence of amp pnp was associated with   mer after the completion of gfp refolding mediated by   mer with amp pnp addition of atp induced an additional refolding of gfp furthermore the   mer preincubated with amp pnp showed the ability to capture the non native gfp these suggest that amp pnp induced one of two chaperonin rings cis ring to close and induced protein refolding in this ring and that the other ring trans ring could capture the unfolded gfp which was refolded by adding atp the present data indicate that in the group ii chaperonin of thermococcus strain ks  the protein folding proceeds in its cis ring in an atp dependent fashion without any co chaperonin
