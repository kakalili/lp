on the dynamic nature of the transition state for protein  protein association as determined by double mutant cycle analysis and simulation
the process of protein  protein association starts with their random collision which may develop into an encounter complex followed by a transition state and final complex formation here we aim to experimentally characterize the nature of the transition state of protein  protein association for three different protein  protein interactions barnase barstar tem blip and ifn  ifnar  and use the data to model the transition state structures to model the transition state we determined inter protein distance constraints of the activated complex by using double mutant cycles dmc assuming that interacting residues are spatially close significant   g  int values were obtained only between residues on barnase and barstar however introducing specific mutations that optimize the charge complementarity between blip and tem resulted in the introduction of significant   g  int values also between residues of these two proteins while electrostatic interactions make major contributions towards stabilizing the transition state we show two examples where steric hindrance exerts an effect on the transition state as well to model the transition state structures from the experimental   g  int values we introduced a method for structure perturbation searching for those inter protein orientations that best support the experimental   g  int values two types of transition states were found specific as observed for barnase barstar and the electrostatically optimized tem blip mutants and diffusive as shown for wild type tem blip and ifn  ifnar  the specific transition states are characterized by defined inter protein orientations which cannot be modeled for the diffusive transition states mutations introduced through rational design can change the transition state from diffusive to specific together these data provide a structural view of the mechanism allowing rates of association to differ by five orders of magnitude between different protein complexes
