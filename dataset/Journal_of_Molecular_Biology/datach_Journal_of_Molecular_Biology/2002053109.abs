limitation of ribosomal protein l  availability in vivo affects translation termination
historically referred to as  the gtpase center   the l  binding region l br of escherichia coli  s rrna is a highly conserved structure that has been implicated in several essential functions during protein synthesis here in vivo expression of an rna fragment containing that structure was found to affect translation termination in a codon specific manner the cause of these effects appeared to be titration of ribosomal protein l  since normal phenotypes could be restored by simultaneous overproduction of wild type l  but not mutant l  subsequently altered termination phenotypes were produced when the availability of l  was limited by overexpression of rna antisense to l  mrna and finally by inactivation of the chromosomal l  gene and they too were reversible by simultaneous expression of cloned l  our results indicate that in the intact cell the l br is an integral functional unit important for translation termination and that the presence of l  in ribosomes is required for uag dependent termination and is somewhat inhibitory of uga dependent termination
