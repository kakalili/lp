Bacterial translation termination is triggered when a stop codon arrives at the ribosomal A site. Stop codons are recognized by class I release factors (RF1 and RF2 in Escherichia coli), which bind to the ribosome and catalyze the release of the newly synthesized protein. Crystal structures showed that RF1 and RF2 are in an open conformation when bound to the ribosome but are in a closed conformation when not bound to the ribosome. It is not clear whether only the open form of RF1 and RF2 binds to the ribosome. Alternatively, the closed form of RF1 and RF2 may bind to the ribosome and undergo a conformational change to the open state upon binding. We used transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to monitor precisely the conformation of RF1 in the absence and presence of the ribosome. Our results indicate that RF1 undergoes a large conformational change from a closed to an open form upon binding to the ribosome. Our results are consistent with the mechanism, in which high termination fidelity is achieved by linking stop codon recognition by RF1 to the change in conformation from closed to open state.
