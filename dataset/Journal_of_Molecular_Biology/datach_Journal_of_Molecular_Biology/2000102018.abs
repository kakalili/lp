solution structure of the taz  ch  domain of the transcriptional adaptor protein cbp edited by m f summers
the taz  ch  domain of the transcriptional adapter protein cbp has been implicated in direct functional interactions with numerous cellular transcription factors and viral oncoproteins the solution structure of the taz domain of murine cbp has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr  the protein adopts a novel helical fold stabilized by three zinc ions each of which is bound to one histidine and three cysteine ligands in hccc type motifs each zinc binding site is formed from the carboxy terminus of an  helix a short loop and the amino terminus of the next  helix a peptide derived from the n terminal transactivation domain of p  binds specifically to one face of the taz domain the close similarities between the taz and taz  ch domain of cbp p   sequences suggest that both domains will adopt similar three dimensional structures
