Dynein is a large microtubule-based motor complex that requires tight coupling of intra-molecular ATP hydrolysis with the generation of mechanical force and track-binding activity. However, the microtubule-binding domain is structurally separated by about 15nm from the nucleotide-binding sites by a coiled-coil stalk. Thus, long-range two-way communication is necessary for coordination between the catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis and dynein's track-binding affinities. To investigate the structural changes that occur in the dynein stalk region to produce two different microtubule affinities, here we improve the resolution limit of the previously reported structure of the entire stalk region and we investigate structural changes in the dynein stalk and strut/buttress regions by comparing currently available X-ray structures. In the light of recent crystal structures, the basis of the transition from the low-affinity to the high-affinity coiled-coil registry is discussed. A concerted movement model previously reported by Carter and Vale is modified more specifically, and we proposed it as the open zipper model.
