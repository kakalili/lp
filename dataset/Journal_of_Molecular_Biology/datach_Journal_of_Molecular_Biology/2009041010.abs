identification of dna binding proteins using structural electrostatic and evolutionary features
dna binding proteins dbps participate in various crucial processes in the life cycle of the cells and the identification and characterization of these proteins is of great importance we present here a random forests classifier for identifying dbps among proteins with known d structures first clusters of evolutionarily conserved regions patches on the surface of proteins were detected using the patchfinder algorithm earlier studies showed that these regions are typically the functionally important regions of proteins next we trained a classifier using features like the electrostatic potential cluster based amino acid conservation patterns and the secondary structure content of the patches as well as features of the whole protein including its dipole moment using  fold cross validation on a dataset of   dbps and   proteins that do not bind dna the classifier achieved a sensitivity and a specificity of    which is overall better than the performance of published methods furthermore when we tested five different methods on  new dbps that did not appear in the original dataset only our method annotated all correctly the resulting classifier was applied to a collection of   proteins of known structure and unknown function of these proteins   were predicted to bind dna and we anticipate that some of them interact with dna using new structural motifs the use of complementary computational tools supports the notion that at least some of them do bind dna
