quorum sensing regulation in aeromonas hydrophila
we present detailed results on the c hsl mediated quorum sensing qs regulatory system of the opportunistic gram negative bacterium aeromonas hydrophila this bacterium contains a particularly simple qs system that allows for a detailed modeling of kinetics in a model system i e  the escherichia coli monitor strain mh   the c hsl production of a hydrophila is interrupted by fusion of gfp asv  in the present in vitro study we measure the response of the qs regulatory ahyri locus in the monitor strain to predetermined concentrations of c hsl signal molecules a minimal kinetic model describes the data well it can be solved analytically providing substantial insight into the qs mechanism at high concentrations of signal molecules a slow decay of the activated regulator sets the timescale for the qs regulation loop slow saturation ensures that in an a hydrophila cell the qs system is activated only by signal molecules produced by other a hydrophila cells separate information on the ahyr and ahyi loci can be extracted thus allowing the probe to be used in identifying the target when testing qs inhibitors
