the importance of g a hydrogen bonding in the metal ion and protein induced folding of a kink turn rna
the kink turn k turn is a common motif in rna structure found in many rna species important in translation rna modification and splicing and the control of gene expression in general the k turn comprises a three nucleotide bulge followed by trans sugar hoogsteen g a pairs the rna adopts a tightly kinked conformation and is a common target for binding proteins exemplified by the l ae family we have measured the rates of association and dissociation for the binding of l ae to the kt  kink turn from which we calculate an affinity of kd   pm this high affinity is consistent with the role of this binding as the first stage in the assembly of key functional nucleoproteins such as box c d snornp kink turn rna undergoes a two state transition between the kinked conformation and a more extended structure and folding into the kinked form is induced by divalent metal ions or by binding of proteins of the l ae class the k turn provides an excellent simple model for rna folding which can be dissected at the atomic level we have analyzed the contributions of the hydrogen bonds that form the g a pairs to the ion and protein induced folding of the k turn we find that all four hydrogen bonds are important to the stability of the kinked form of the rna and we can now define all the important hydrogen bonding interactions that stabilize the k turn the high affinity of l ae binding is coupled to the induced folding of the k turn allowing some sub optimal variants to adopt the kinked geometry however in all such cases the affinity is lowered and the results underline the importance of both g a pairs to the stability of the k turn
