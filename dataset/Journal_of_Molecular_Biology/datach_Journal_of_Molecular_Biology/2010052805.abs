the crystal structure of protein mj   from methanocaldococcus jannaschii shows strong conservation of key structural features seen in the eukaryal  ampk
in mammals    amp activated protein kinase ampk is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic serine threonine kinase subunit   and two regulatory subunits   and   the  subunit senses the intracellular energy status by competitively binding amp and atp and is thought to be responsible for allosteric regulation of the whole complex we describe herein the crystal structure of protein mj   from methanocaldococcus jannaschii complexed to amp adp and atp our data provide evidence of a strong conservation of the key functional features seen in the  subunit of the eukaryotic ampk and more importantly it reveals a novel amp binding site herein denoted as site e which had not been previously described in cystathionine  synthase domains so far site e is located in a small cavity existing between the  helices structurally equivalent to those disrupting the internal symmetry of each bateman domain in  ampks and shows striking similarities with a symmetry related crevice of the mammalian enzyme that hosts the pathological mutation n  i
