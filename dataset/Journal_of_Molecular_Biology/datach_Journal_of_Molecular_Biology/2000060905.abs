the dna damage spectrum produced by simulated sunlight edited by i tinoco
the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet and solar irradiation are thought to be due to the formation of dna photoproducts most notably cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and pyrimidine     pyrimidone photoproducts     pps  experimental systems for determining the levels and sequence dependence of photoproduct formation in dna have often used high doses of short wave uvc irradiation we have re assessed this issue by using dna sequencing technologies and different doses of uvc as well as more physiologically relevant doses of solar irradiation emitted from a solar uv simulator it has been questioned whether hot alkali treatment can detect    pps at all sequence positions with high uvc doses the sequence distribution of    pps was virtually identical when hot alkali or uv damage endonuclease uvde were used for detection which appears to validate both methods the    pps form at   tpc and   cpc sequences but very low levels are seen at all other dipyrimidines including   tpt contrary to expectation we find that     photoproducts form at almost undetectable levels under conditions of irradiation for up to five hours with the solar uv simulator the same treatment produces high levels of cpds in addition dna glycosylases which recognize oxidized and ring opened bases did not produce significant cleavage of sunlight irradiated dna from these data we conclude that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are at least  to  times more frequent than any other dna photoproduct when dna or cells are irradiated with simulated sunlight
