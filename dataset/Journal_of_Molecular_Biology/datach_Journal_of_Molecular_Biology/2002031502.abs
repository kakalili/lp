solution structure and dynamics of crh the bacillus subtilis catabolite repression hpr edited by m f summers
the solution structure and dynamics of the bacillus subtilis hpr like protein crh have been investigated using nmr spectroscopy crh exhibits high sequence identity    to the histidine containing protein hpr  a phospho carrier protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate pep carbohydrate phosphotransferase system but contains no catalytic his  the site of pep dependent phosphorylation in hpr crh also forms a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution whereas hpr is known to be monomeric complete backbone and side chain assignments were obtained for the monomeric form and   of the dimer backbone resonances allowing the identification of the crh dimer interface from chemical shift mapping the conformation of crh was determined to a precision of         for the backbone atoms and         for the heavy atoms the monomer structure is similar to that of known hpr         c  rmsd  but has a few notable differences including a change in the orientation of one of the helices b  and a two residue shift in  sheet pairing of the n terminal strand with the   strand this shift results in a shortening of the surface loop present in hpr and consequently provides a flatter surface in the region of dimerisation contact which may be related to the different oligomeric nature of these two proteins a binding site of phospho serine p ser crh with catabolite control protein a ccpa is proposed on the basis of highly conserved surface side chains between crh and hpr this binding site is consistent with the model of a dimer dimer interaction between p ser crh and ccpa  n relaxation measured in the monomeric form also identified differential local mobility in the helix b which is located in the vicinity of this site
