unique amino acid composition of proteins in halophilic bacteria
the amino acid compositions of proteins from halophilic archaea were compared with those from non halophilic mesophiles and thermophiles in terms of the protein surface and interior on a genome wide scale as we previously reported for proteins from thermophiles a biased amino acid composition also exists in halophiles in which an abundance of acidic residues was found on the protein surface as compared to the interior this general feature did not seem to depend on the individual protein structures but was applicable to all proteins encoded within the entire genome unique protein surface compositions are common in both halophiles and thermophiles statistical tests have shown that significant surface compositional differences exist among halophiles non halophiles and thermophiles while the interior composition within each of the three types of organisms does not significantly differ although thermophilic proteins have an almost equal abundance of both acidic and basic residues a large excess of acidic residues in halophilic proteins seems to be compensated by fewer basic residues aspartic acid lysine asparagine alanine and threonine significantly contributed to the compositional differences of halophiles from meso and thermophiles among them however only aspartic acid deviated largely from the expected amount estimated from the dinucleotide composition of the genomic dna sequence of the halophile which has an extremely high g c content    thus the other residues with large deviations lys ala etc  from their non halophilic frequencies could have arisen merely as  dragging effects  caused by the compositional shift of the dna which would have changed to increase principally the fraction of aspartic acid alone
