the human cardiac troponin i hctni mutation r  w has been associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy in this study simultaneous measurements of atpase activity and force in skinned papillary fibers from hctni r  w transgenic mice tg r  w were explored tg r  w fibers showed an       increase in maximal ca  activated force and atpase activity compared to hctni wild type transgenic mice the force generating cross bridge turnover rate g and the energy cost atpase force were the same in all groups of fibers also the tg r  w fibers showed a large increase in the ca  sensitivity of both force development and atpase in intact fibers the mutation caused prolonged force and intracellular ca  transients and increased time to peak force analysis of force and ca  transients showed that there was a   increase in peak force in tg r  w muscles which was likely due to the increased ca  transient duration the above cited results suggest that   there would be an increase in resistance to ventricular filling during diastole resulting from the prolonged force and ca  transients that would result in a decrease in ventricular filling diastolic dysfunction  and   there would be a large approximately   increase in force during systole which may help to partly compensate for diastolic dysfunction these functional results help to explain the mechanisms by which these mutations give rise to a restrictive phenotype
