nonmyristoylated matrix protein from the mason  pfizer monkey virus forms oligomers
we studied the oligomeric properties of betaretroviral nonmyristoylated matrix protein ma and its r f mutant from the mason  pfizer monkey virus in solution by means of chemical crosslinking and nmr spectroscopy by analyzing crosslinked products and using concentration dependent nmr chemical shift mapping we have proven that the wild type wt ma forms oligomers in solution conversely no oligomerization was observed for the r f mutant structural comparison of mas explained their different behaviors in solution concluding that the key residues involved in intermonomeric interaction are exposed in the wt ma but buried in the mutant preventing the oligomerization of r f the final model of oligomerization of the wt ma was derived by concerted use of chemical shift mapping and diffusion ordered spectroscopy measured on a set of protein samples with varying concentrations we found that the mason  pfizer monkey virus wt ma exists in a monomer  dimer  trimer equilibrium in solution with the corresponding dissociation constants of    and    mm respectively structures of the oligomers calculated with haddock software are closely related to the structures of other retroviral ma trimers
