structure of full length human pdgfr  bound to its activating ligand pdgf b as determined by negative stain electron microscopy
members of the receptor tyrosine kinases rtks regulate important cellular functions such as cell growth and migration which are key steps in angiogenesis in organ morphogenesis and in the unregulated states cancer formation one long standing puzzle regarding rtks centers on how the extracellular domain ecd  which detects and binds to growth factors is coupled with the intracellular domain kinase activation while extensive structural works on the soluble portions of rtks have provided critical insights into rtk structures and functions lack of a full length receptor structure has hindered a comprehensive overview of rtk activation in this study we successfully purified and determined a    resolution structure of pdgfr  a full length human platelet derived growth factor receptor  in complex with its ligand pdgf b in the ligand stimulated complex two pdgfr s assemble into a dimer via an extensive interface essentially running along the full length of the receptor suggesting that the membrane proximal region the transmembrane helix and the kinase domain of pdgfr  are involved in dimerization major structural differences are seen between the full length and soluble ecd structures rationalizing previous experimental data on how membrane proximal domains modulate receptor ligand binding affinity and dimerization efficiency also in contrast to the  fold symmetry of the ecd the intracellular kinase domains adopt an asymmetric dimer arrangement in agreement with prior observations for the closely related kit receptor in essence the structure provides a first glimpse into how platelet derived growth factor receptor ecd upon ligand stimulation is coupled to its intracellular domain kinase activation
