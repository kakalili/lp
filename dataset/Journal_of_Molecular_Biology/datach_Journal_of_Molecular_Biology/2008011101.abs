the solution structure of the adhesion protein bd  from babesia divergens reveals structural homology with eukaryotic proteins involved in membrane trafficking
babesia divergens is the apicomplexa agent of the bovine babesiosis in europe this infection leads to growth and lactation decrease so that economical losses due to this parasite are sufficient to require the development of a vaccine the major surface antigen of b divergens has been described as a   kda protein glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol gpi anchored at the surface of the merozoite the immuno prophylactic potential of bd  has been demonstrated and we present here the high resolution solution structure of the   kda structured core of bd    bd  using nmr spectroscopy a model for the whole protein has been obtained using additional small angle x ray scattering saxs data the knowledge of the d structure of bd  allowed the precise epitope mapping of antibodies on its surface interestingly the geometry of  bd  reveals an intriguing similarity with the exocyst subunit exo p c terminal region an eukaryotic protein that has a direct implication in vesicle trafficking this strongly suggests that apicomplexa have developed in parallel molecular machines similar in structure and function to the ones used for endo and exocytosis in eukaryotic cells
