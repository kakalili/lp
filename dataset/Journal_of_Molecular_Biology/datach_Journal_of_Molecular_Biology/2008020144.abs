structural role of bacterioruberin in the trimeric structure of archaerhodopsin
archaerhodopsin  ar  a retinal protein  carotenoid complex found in the claret membrane of halorubrum sp aus  functions as a light driven proton pump in this study the membrane fusion method was utilized to prepare trigonal p  crystals a b      c      and hexagonal p  crystals a b      c       the trigonal crystal is made up of stacked membranes in which the ar trimers are arranged on a honeycomb lattice similar membranous structures are found in the hexagonal crystal but four membrane layers with different orientations are contained in the unit cell in these crystals the carotenoid bacterioruberin    bis  hydroxypropan  yl            octamethylhexatriaconta                   tridecaene   diol binds to crevices between the subunits of the trimer its polyene chain is inclined from the membrane normal by an angle of about   and on the cytoplasmic side it is surrounded by helices ab and de of neighbouring subunits this peculiar binding mode suggests that bacterioruberin plays a striking structural role for the trimerization of ar  when compared with the ar structure in another crystal form containing no bacterioruberin the proton release channel takes a more closed conformation in the p  or p  crystal i e  the native conformation of protein is stabilized in the trimeric protein  bacterioruberin complex interestingly most residues participating in the trimerization are not conserved in bacteriorhodopsin a homologous protein capable of forming a trimeric structure in the absence of bacterioruberin despite a large alteration in the amino acid sequence the shape of the intratrimer hydrophobic space filled by lipids is highly conserved between ar and bacteriorhodopsin since a transmembrane helix facing this space undergoes a large conformational change during the proton pumping cycle it is feasible that trimerization is an important strategy to capture special lipid components that are relevant to the protein activity
