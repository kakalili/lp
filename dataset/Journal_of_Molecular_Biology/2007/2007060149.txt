Members of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family play important roles in the inflammatory and coagulation cascades. Interaction of a serpin with its target proteinase induces a large conformational change, resulting in insertion of its reactive center loop (RCL) into the main body of the protein as a new strand within β-sheet A. Intermolecular insertion of the RCL of one serpin molecule into the β-sheet A of another leads to polymerization, a widespread phenomenon associated with a general class of diseases known as serpinopathies. Small peptides are known to modulate the polymerization process by binding within β-sheet A. Here, we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to probe the mechanism of peptide modulation of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) polymerization and depolymerization, and employ a statistical computationally-assisted design strategy (SCADS) to identify new tetrapeptides that modulate polymerization. Our results demonstrate that peptide-induced depolymerization takes place via a heterogeneous, multi-step process that begins with internal fragmentation of the polymer chain. One of the designed tetrapeptides is the most potent antitrypsin depolymerizer yet found.
