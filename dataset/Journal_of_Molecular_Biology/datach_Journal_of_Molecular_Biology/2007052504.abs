neurospora crassa fkbp  is a novel er chaperone and functionally cooperates with bip
fk  binding proteins fkbps belong to the family of peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases ppiases catalyzing the cis trans isomerisation of xaa pro bonds in oligopeptides and proteins fkbps are involved in folding assembly and trafficking of proteins however only limited knowledge is available about the roles of fkbps in the endoplasmic reticulum er and their interaction with other proteins here we show the er located neurospora crassa fkbp  to be a dimeric protein with ppiase and a novel chaperone activity while the homodimerization of fkbp  is mediated by its carboxy terminal domain the amino terminal domain is a functional fkbp domain the chaperone activity is mediated by the fkbp domain but is exhibited only by the full length protein we further demonstrate a direct interaction between fkbp  and bip the major hsp  chaperone in the er the binding to bip is mediated by the fkbp domain of fkbp  interestingly bip enhances the chaperone activity of fkbp  both proteins form a stable complex with an unfolded substrate protein and thereby prevent its aggregation these results suggest that bip and fkbp  form a folding helper complex with a high chaperoning capacity in the er of neurospora crassa
