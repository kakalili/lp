the role of the lid element in transcription by e coli rna polymerase
the recently described crystal structures of multi subunit rna polymerases rnaps reveal a conserved loop like feature called the lid the lid projects from the clamp domain and contacts the flap thereby enclosing the rna transcript in rnap s rna exit channel and forming the junction between the exit channel and the main channel which holds the rna dna hybrid in the initiating form of bacterial rnap holoenzyme containing   the lid interacts with  region  and encloses an extended linker between  region  and  region  in place of the rna in the exit channel during initiation the lid may be important for holding open the transcription bubble and may help displace the rna from the template dna strand to test these ideas we constructed and characterized a mutant rnap from which the lid element was deleted  lid rnap exhibited dramatically reduced activity during initiation from    dependent and    independent promoters verifying that the lid is important for stabilizing the open promoter complex during initiation however transcript elongation rna displacement and surprisingly transcriptional termination all occurred normally in  lid rnap importantly  lid rnap behaved differently from wild type rnap when transcribing single stranded dna templates where it synthesized long persistent rna dna hybrids in contrast to efficient transcriptional arrest by wild type rnap
