human tpst transmembrane domain triggers enzyme dimerisation and localisation to the golgi compartment
tpst is a human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase that uses   phosphoadenosine   phosphosulfate paps to transfer the sulfate moiety to proteins predominantly designated for secretion to achieve a general understanding of the cellular role of human tyrosine directed sulfotransferases we investigated targeting structure and posttranslational modification of tpst  golgi localisation of the enzyme in cos  and hela cells was visualised by fluorescence imaging techniques pngase treatment and mutational studies determined that tpst bears n linked glycosyl residues exclusively at position asn  and asn   by alanine mutation of these asparagine residues we could determine that the n linked oligosaccharides do not have an influence on golgi retention of tpst  in concert with n and c terminal flanking residues the transmembrane domain of tpst was determined to act in targeting and retention of the enzyme to the trans golgi compartment this domain exhibits a pronounced secondary structure in a lipid environment further in vivo fret studies using the transmembrane domain suggest that the human tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase may be functional as homodimer oligomer in the trans golgi compartment
