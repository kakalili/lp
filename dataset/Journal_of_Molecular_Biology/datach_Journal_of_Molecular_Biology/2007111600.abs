affinity maturation increases the stability and plasticity of the fv domain of anti protein antibodies
the somatic mutations accumulated in variable and framework regions of antibodies produce structural changes that increase the affinity towards the antigen this implies conformational and non covalent bonding changes at the paratope as well as possible quaternary structure changes and rearrangements at the vh  vl interface the consequences of the affinity maturation on the stability of the fv domain were studied in a system composed of two closely related antibodies f    and d   which recognize the same hen egg white lysozyme hel epitope the mab f    has an affinity constant   times higher than d   due to a higher surface complementarity to hel the structure of the free form of the fab f    presented here allows a comparative study of the conformational changes produced upon binding to antigen by means of structural comparison kinetics and thermodynamics of binding and stability studies on fab and fv fragments of both antibodies we have determined that the affinity maturation process of anti protein antibodies affects the shape of the combining site and the secondary structure content of the variable domain stabilizes the vh  vl interaction and consequently produces an increase of the fv domain stability improving the binding to antigen
