two distinct binding modes of a protein cofactor with its target rna
like most cellular rna enzymes the bi group i intron requires binding by a protein cofactor to fold correctly here we use single molecule approaches to monitor the structural dynamics of the bi rna in real time as it assembles with its cbp protein cofactor these experiments show that cbp binds to the target rna in two distinct modes with apparently opposite effects a  non specific  mode that forms rapidly and induces large conformational fluctuations in the rna and a  specific  mode that forms slowly and stabilizes the native rna structure the bi rna folds though multiple pathways toward the native state typically traversing dynamic intermediate states induced by non specific binding of cbp  these results suggest that the protein cofactor assisted rna folding involves sequential non specific and specific protein  rna interactions the non specific interaction potentially increases the local concentration of cbp and the number of conformational states accessible to the rna which may promote the formation of specific rna  protein interactions
