kinase recognition by calmodulin modeling the interaction with the autoinhibitory region of human cardiac titin kinase edited by j thornton
calmodulin cam protein interactions are usually described by studying complexes between synthetic targets of ca  amino acids and cam to understand the relevance of contacts outside the protein binding region we investigated the complex between recombinant human cam hcam and p  a  residue peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of human cardiac titin kinase htk  to expedite the structure determination of hcam p we relied upon the high degree of similarity with other cam kinase peptide complexes by using a combined homonuclear nmr spectroscopy and molecular modeling approach we verified for the bound hcam similar trends in chemical shifts as well as conservation of noe patterns which taken together imply the conservation of cam secondary structure p was anchored to the protein with  experimental intermolecular contacts the hcam p structure is very similar to known cam complexes but the presence of noe contacts outside the binding cavity appears to be novel comparison with the htk crystal structure indicates that the p charged residues all correspond to accessible side chains while the putative anchoring hydrophobic side chains are partially buried to test this finding we also modeled the early steps of the complex formation between ca  loaded hcam and htk the calculated trajectories strongly suggest the existence of an  electrostatic funnel   driving the long range recognition of the two proteins on the other hand on a nanosecond time scale no intermolecular interaction is formed as the p hydrophobic residues remain buried inside htk these results suggest that charged residues in htk might be the anchoring points of ca  hcam favoring the intrasteric regulation of the kinase furthermore our structure the first of cam bound to a peptide derived from a kinase whose three dimensional structure is known suggests that special care is needed in the choice of template peptides to model protein protein interactions
