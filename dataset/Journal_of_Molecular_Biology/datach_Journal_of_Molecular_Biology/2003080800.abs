the structure of the receptor binding domain of the bacteriophage t short tail fibre reveals a knitted trimeric metal binding fold
adsorption of t bacteriophage to the escherichia coli host cell is mediated by six long and six short tail fibres after at least three long tail fibres have bound short tail fibres extend and bind irreversibly to the core region of the host cell lipo polysaccharide lps  serving as inextensible stays during penetration of the cell envelope by the tail tube the short tail fibres consist of a parallel in register trimer of gene product   gp  x ray crystallography at    resolution of a protease stable fragment of gp  generated in the presence of zinc chloride reveals the structure of the c terminal receptor binding domain it has a novel  knitted  fold consisting of three extensively intertwined monomers it reveals a metal binding site containing a zinc ion coordinated by six histidine residues in an octahedral conformation we also suggest an lps binding region
