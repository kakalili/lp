an examination of the electrostatic interactions between the n terminal tail of the brome mosaic virus coat protein and encapsidated rnas
the coat protein of positive stranded rna viruses often contains a positively charged tail that extends toward the center of the capsid and interacts with the viral genome electrostatic interaction between the tail and the rna has been postulated as a major force in virus assembly and stabilization the goal of this work is to examine the correlation between electrostatic interaction and amount of rna packaged in the tripartite brome mosaic virus bmv  nanoindentation experiment using atomic force microscopy showed that the stiffness of bmv virions with different rnas varied by a range that is  fold higher than that would be predicted by electrostatics bmv mutants with decreased positive charges encapsidated lower amounts of rna while mutants with increased positive charges packaged additional rnas up to     nt however the extra rnas included truncated bmv rnas an additional copy of rna  potential cellular rnas or a combination of the three indicating that change in the charge of the capsid could result in several different outcomes in rna encapsidation in addition mutant with specific arginines changed to lysines in the capsid also exhibited defects in the specific encapsidation of bmv rna  the experimental results indicate that electrostatics is a major component in rna encapsidation but was unable to account for all of the observed effects on rna encapsidation thermodynamic modeling incorporating the electrostatics was able to predict the approximate length of the rna to be encapsidated for the majority of mutant virions but not for a mutant with extreme clustered positive charges cryo electron microscopy of virions that encapsidated an additional copy of rna revealed that despite the increase in rna encapsidated the capsid structure was minimally changed these results experimentally demonstrated the impact of electrostatics and additional restraints in the encapsidation of bmv rnas which could be applicable to other viruses
