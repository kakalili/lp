effect of dextran on protein stability and conformation attributed to macromolecular crowding
thermally induced transition curves of hen egg white lysozyme were measured in the presence of several concentrations of dextran at ph   by near uv and far uv cd the transition curves were fitted to a two state model by a non linear least squares method to obtain the transition temperature tm  enthalpy change  hu tm  and free energy change  gu t  of the unfolding transition an increase in tm and almost constant  hu tm values were observed in the presence of added dextran at concentrations exceeding ca  gl   in addition dextran induced conformational changes of fully unfolded protein were investigated by cd spectroscopy addition of high concentrations of dextran to solutions of acid unfolded cytochrome c at ph   results in a shift of the cd spectrum from that characteristic of the fully unfolded polypeptide to that characteristic of the more compact salt induced molten globule state a result suggesting that the molten globule like state is stabilized relative to the fully unfolded form in crowded environments both observations are in qualitative accord with predictions of a previously proposed model for the effect of intermolecular excluded volume macromolecular crowding on protein stability and conformation
