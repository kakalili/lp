crystal structures of two homologous pathogenesis related proteins from yellow lupine
pathogenesis related class   pr  proteins are restricted to the plant kingdom where they are coded by multigene families and occur at high levels in spite of their abundance their physiological role is obscure although members of a distantly related subclass cytokinin specific binding proteins are known to bind plant hormones pr  proteins are of special significance in legume plants where their expression patterns are related to infection by the symbiotic nitrogen fixing bacteria here we present the first crystal structures of classic pr  proteins representing two homologues from one subclass in yellow lupine the general fold is similar and as in a birch pollen allergen consists of a seven stranded  sheet wrapped around a long c terminal helix the mouth of a large pocket formed between the  sheet and the helix seems a likely site for ligand binding the shape of the pocket varies because in variance with the rigid  sheet the helix shows unusual conformational variability consisting in bending disorder and axial shifting a surface loop proximal to the entrance to the internal cavity shows an unusual structural conservation and rigidity in contrast to the high glycine content in its sequence the loop is different from the so called glycine rich p loops that bind phosphate groups of nucleotides but it is very likely that it does play a role in ligand binding in pr  proteins
