structure of pbp a from thermosynechococcus elongatus a penicillin binding protein closely related to class a  lactamases
molecular evolution has always been a subject of discussions and researchers are interested in understanding how proteins with similar scaffolds can catalyze different reactions in the superfamily of serine penicillin recognizing enzymes d alanyl d alanine peptidases and  lactamases are phylogenetically linked but feature large differences of reactivity towards their respective substrates in particular while  lactamases hydrolyze penicillins very fast leading to their inactivation these molecules inhibit d alanyl d alanine peptidases by forming stable covalent penicilloyl enzymes in cyanobacteria we have discovered a new family of penicillin binding proteins pbps presenting all the sequence features of class a  lactamases but having a six amino acid deletion in the conserved  loop and lacking the essential glu  known to be involved in the penicillin hydrolysis mechanism with the aim of evolving a member of this family into a  lactamase pbp a from thermosynechococcus elongatus has been chosen because of its thermostability based on sequence alignments introduction of a glutamate in position   of the shorter  loop afforded an enzyme with a  fold increase in the rate of penicillin hydrolysis the crystal structures of pbp a in the free and penicilloylated forms at     resolution and of l  e mutant at     resolution were also solved giving insights in the catalytic mechanism of the proteins since all the active site elements of pbp a l  e including an essential water molecule are almost perfectly superimposed with those of a class a  lactamase such as tem  the question why our mutant is still  orders of magnitude less active as a penicillinase remains and our results emphasize how far we are from understanding the secrets of enzymes based on the few minor differences between the active sites of pbp a and tem  mutations were introduced in the l  e enzyme but while activities on d ala d ala mimicking substrates were severely impaired further improvement in penicillinase activity was unsuccessful
