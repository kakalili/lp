pdz binding to the bar domain of pick is elucidated by coarse grained molecular dynamics
a key regulator of  amino  hydroxy  methylisoxazole  propionic acid ampa receptor traffic pick is known to interact with over  other proteins including receptors transporters and ionic channels and to be active mostly as a homodimer the current lack of a complete pick structure determined at atomic resolution hinders the elucidation of its functional mechanisms here we identify interactions between the component pdz and bar domains of pick by calculating possible binding sites for the pdz domain of pick  pick pdz to the homology modeled crescent shaped dimer of the pick bar domain using multiplexed replica exchange molecular dynamics mremd and canonical molecular dynamics simulations with the coarse grained unres force field the mremd results show that the preferred binding site for the single pdz domain is the concave cavity of the bar dimer a second possible binding site is near the n terminus of the bar domain that is linked directly to the pdz domain subsequent short canonical molecular dynamics simulations used to determine how the pick pdz domain moves to the preferred binding site on the bar domain of pick revealed that initial hydrophobic interactions drive the progress of the simulated binding thus the concave face of the bar dimer accommodates the pdz domain first by weak hydrophobic interactions and then the pdz domain slides to the center of the concave face where more favorable hydrophobic interactions take over
