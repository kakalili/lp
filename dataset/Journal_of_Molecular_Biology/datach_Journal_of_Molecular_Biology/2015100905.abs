stac  a new domain associated with transmembrane solute transport and two component signal transduction systems
transmembrane receptors are integral components of sensory pathways in prokaryotes these receptors share a common dimeric architecture consisting in its basic form of an n terminal extracellular sensor transmembrane helices and an intracellular effector as an exception we have identified an archaeal receptor family  exemplified by af   from archaeoglobus fulgidus  that is c terminally shortened lacking a recognizable effector module instead a hamp domain forms the sole extension for signal transduction in the cytosol here we examine the gene environment of af   like receptors and find a frequent association with transmembrane transport proteins furthermore we identify and define a closely associated new protein domain family which we characterize structurally using af   from a fulgidus members of this family are found both as stand alone proteins and as domains within extant receptors in general the latter appear as connectors between the solute carrier  slc   like transmembrane domains and two component signal transduction tcst domains this is seen for example in the histidine kinase cbra which is a global regulator of metabolism virulence and antibiotic resistance in pseudomonads we propose that this newly identified domain family mediates signal transduction in systems regulating transport processes and name it stac for slc and tcst associated component
