the  e domain of wheat ec  metallothionein a metal binding domain with a distinctive structure
metallothioneins mts are ubiquitous cysteine rich proteins with a high affinity for divalent metal ions such as znii cui and cdii that are involved in metal ion homeostasis and detoxification as well as protection against reactive oxygen species here we show the nmr solution structure of the  e domain of the early cysteine labeled protein ec  from wheat  e ec   which represents the first three dimensional structure of a plant mt the  e domain comprises the  c terminal residues of ec  and exhibits a distinctive unprecedented structure with two separate metal binding centers a mononuclear znii binding site constituted by two cysteine and two highly conserved histidine residues as found in certain zinc finger motifs and a cluster formed by three znii ions coordinated by nine cys residues that resembles the cluster in the  domain of vertebrate mts cys  metal ion connectivities were determined by exhaustive structure calculations for all   possible configurations of the three metal cluster backbone dynamics investigated by  n relaxation experiments support the results of the structure determination in that  e ec  is a rigidly folded polypeptide to further investigate the influence of metal ion binding on the stability of the structure we replaced znii with cdii ions and examined the effects of metal ion release on incubation with a metal ion chelator
