formation of toxic fibrils of alzheimer  s amyloid  protein     by monosialoganglioside gm  a neuronal membrane component
a pathological hallmark of alzheimer s disease ad is the deposition of amyloid  protein a  in fibrillar form on neuronal cells however the role of a  fibrils in neuronal dysfunction is highly controversial this study demonstrates that monosialoganglioside gm  gm  released from damaged neurons catalyzes the formation of a  fibrils the toxicity and the cell affinity of which are much stronger than those of a  fibrils formed in phosphate buffered saline a      was incubated with equimolar gm at    c after a lag period of     h amyloid fibrils were formed as confirmed by circular dichroism thioflavin t fluorescence size exclusion chromatography and transmission electron microscopy the fibrils showed significant cytotoxicity against pc  cells differentiated with nerve growth factor trisialoganglioside gt b also facilitated the fibrillization although the effect was weaker than that of gm  our study suggests an exacerbation mechanism of ad and an importance of polymorphisms in a  fibrils during the pathogenesis of the disease
