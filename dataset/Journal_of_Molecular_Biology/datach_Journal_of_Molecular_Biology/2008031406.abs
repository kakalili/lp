affinity makes the difference nonselective interaction of the uba domain of ubiquilin  with monomeric ubiquitin and polyubiquitin chains
ubiquilin plic proteins belong to the family of ubl  uba proteins implicated in the regulation of the ubiquitin dependent proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins a human presenilin interacting protein ubiquilin  has been suggested as potential therapeutic target for treating huntington s disease ubiquilin s interactions with mono and polyubiquitins are mediated by its uba domain which is one of the tightest ubiquitin binders among known ubiquitin binding domains here we report the three dimensional structure of the uba domain of ubiquilin  uq uba free in solution and in complex with ubiquitin uq uba forms a compact three helix bundle structurally similar to other known ubas and binds to the hydrophobic patch on ubiquitin with a kd of    m to gain structural insights into uq uba s interactions with polyubiquitin chains we have mapped the binding interface between uq uba and lys  and lys  linked di ubiquitins and characterized the strength of uq uba binding to these chains our nmr data show that uq uba interacts with the individual ubiquitin units in both chains in a mode similar to its interaction with mono ubiquitin although with an improved binding affinity for the chains our results indicate that in contrast to uba of hhr a that has strong binding preference for lys  linked chains uq uba shows little or no binding selectivity toward a particular chain linkage or between the two ubiquitin moieties in the same chain the structural data obtained in this study provide insights into the possible structural reasons for the diversity of polyubiquitin chain recognition by uba domains
