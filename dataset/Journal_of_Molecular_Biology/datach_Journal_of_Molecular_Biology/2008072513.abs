sumoylation of specificity protein  augments its degradation by changing the localization and increasing the specificity protein  proteolytic process
although specificity protein  sp  accumulation has been found in various tumor strains its mechanism is still not very clear herein we found that modification of sp by sumo  facilitates sp degradation our findings revealed that although the amounts of sp and sp mutant k r  sp k r  mrna in cells were equal the protein level of sp k r was higher than that of wild type sp  we also proved that this sumoylation site was not the residue at which ubiquitination occurred in vitro and in vivo pull down assays revealed that more sumoylated sp was localized in the cytoplasm and the interaction between sumo  sp and the proteasome subunit rpt in hela cells was enhanced in addition although sp accumulated in the tumorous cervical tissue it was not prone to sumoylation finally by overexpression of ha hemagglutinin sumo  sp myc ha sp myc and ha sp k r  we found that modification of sp by sumo  was important for sp proteolysis in conclusion modification of sp by sumo  altered its localization and then increased its interaction with rpt  this interaction increased the efficiency of sp proteolytic processing and ubiquitination and then resulted in sp degradation therefore sumoylation of sp is attenuated during tumorigenesis in order to increase sp stability
