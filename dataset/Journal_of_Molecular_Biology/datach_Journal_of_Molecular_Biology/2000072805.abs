structure of human rhinovirus serotype  hrv  edited by r huber
human rhinoviruses are classified into a major and a minor group based on their binding to icam  or to members of the ldl receptor family respectively they can also be divided into groups a and b according to their sensitivity towards a panel of antiviral compounds the structure of human rhinovirus  hrv  which uses the ldl receptor for cell attachment and is included in antiviral group b has been solved and refined at    resolution by x ray crystallography to gain information on the peculiarities of rhinoviruses in particular from the minor receptor group the main structural differences between hrv and other rhinoviruses including the minor receptor group serotype hrv a are located at the internal protein shell surface and at the external antigenic sites in the interior the n termini of vp and vp form a three stranded  sheet in an arrangement similar to that present in poliovirus although myristate was not visible at the amino terminus of vp in the hrv structure the  e  f loop of vp  a linear epitope within antigenic site b recognized by monoclonal antibody f  adopts a conformation considerably different from that found in the complex of f with a synthetic peptide of the same sequence this either points to considerable structural changes impinged on this loop upon antibody binding or to the existence of more than one single conformation of the loop when the virus is in solution the hydrophobic pocket of vp was found to be occupied by a pocket factor apparently identical with that present in the major receptor group virus hrv  electron density consistent with the presence of a viral rna fragment is seen stacked against a conserved tryptophan residue
