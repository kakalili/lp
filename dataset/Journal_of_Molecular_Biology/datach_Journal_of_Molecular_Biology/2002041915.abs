a highly conserved lysine residue in   dna polymerase is important for correct binding of the templating nucleotide during initiation of   dna replication
dna polymerases that initiate replication by protein priming are able to catalyze terminal protein tp primed initiation the following transition steps and finally dna primed elongation therefore their structures must be able to position sequentially both primers tp and dna at a common binding site for dna templated initiation these dna polymerases have to bind the origin of replication as template and tp as primer it is likely that very precise interactions are required to position both tp and templating nucleotide at the polymerization active site such a specificity during tp priming must rely on specific amino acids that must be evolutionarily conserved in this subfamily of dna polymerases by site directed mutagenesis we have analyzed the functional significance of lys  of   dna polymerase immediately adjacent to the kx nsxyg motif and specifically conserved among protein primed dna polymerases during tp primed initiation mutations in this residue did not affect untemplated tp damp formation indicating that the interaction with the initiating nucleotide and tp were not affected whereas the template directed initiation activity was severely inhibited both mutant dna polymerases had a wild type like overall dna binding activity we thus infer that residue lys  of   dna polymerase is important for the correct positioning of the templating nucleotide at the polymerization active site a critical requirement during template directed tp priming at   dna origins consequently mutation of this residue compromised the fidelity of the initiation reaction not controlled by the      exonuclease activity during dna primed polymerization the mutant polymerases showed a defect in translocation of the template strand this translocation problem could be the consequence of a more general defect in the stabilization and positioning of a next templating nucleotide at the polymerization active site during dna primed dna synthesis
