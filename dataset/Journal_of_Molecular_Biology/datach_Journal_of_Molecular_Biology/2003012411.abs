n terminal acetyltransferases and sequence requirements for n terminal acetylation of eukaryotic proteins
n  terminal acetylation occurs in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae by any of three n terminal acetyltransferases nat  nata natb and natc which contain ard p nat p and mak p catalytic subunits respectively the n terminal sequences required for n terminal acetylation i e the nata natb and natc substrates were evaluated by considering over   yeast proteins previously examined in numerous studies and were compared to the n terminal sequences of more than   acetylated mammalian proteins in addition acetylated sequences of eukaryotic proteins were compared to the n termini of   eubacterial and   archaeal proteins which are rarely acetylated protein orthologs of ard p nat p and mak p were identified with the eukaryotic genomes of the sequences of model organisms including caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster arabidopsis thaliana mus musculus and homo sapiens those and other putative acetyltransferases were assigned by phylogenetic analysis to the following six protein families ard p nat p mak p cam baa and nat p the first three families correspond to the catalytic subunits of three major yeast nats these orthologous proteins were identified in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes the cam family include mammalian orthologs of the recently described camello and camello proteins whose substrates are unknown the baa family comprise bacterial and archaeal putative acetyltransferases whose biochemical activity have not been characterized and the new nat p family assignment was on the basis of putative yeast nat nat p yor  w  overall patterns of n terminal acetylated proteins and the orthologous genes possibly encoding nats suggest that yeast and higher eukaryotes have the same systems for n terminal acetylation
