mismatch repair factor msh msh binds and alters the conformation of branched dna structures predicted to form during genetic recombination
genetic studies in saccharomyces cerevisiae predict that the mismatch repair mmr factor msh msh binds and stabilizes branched recombination intermediates that form during single strand annealing and gene conversion to test this model we constructed a series of dna substrates that are predicted to form during these recombination events we show in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay that s cerevisiae msh  msh specifically binds branched dna substrates containing   single stranded dna and that atp stimulates its release from these substrates chemical footprinting analyses indicate that msh msh specifically binds at the double strand single strand junction of branched substrates alters its conformation and opens up the junction therefore msh  msh binding to its substrates creates a unique nucleoprotein structure that may signal downstream steps in repair that include interactions with mmr and nucleotide excision repair factors
