defining the atpase center of bacteriophage t dna packaging machine requirement for a catalytic glutamate residue in the large terminase protein gp
double stranded dna packaging in icosahedral bacteriophages is driven by an atpase coupled packaging machine constituted by the portal protein and two non structural packaging terminase proteins assembled at the unique portal vertex of the empty viral capsid recent studies show that the n terminal atpase site of bacteriophage t large terminase protein gp  is critically required for dna packaging it is likely that this is the dna translocating atpase that powers directional translocation of dna into the viral capsid defining this atpase center is therefore fundamentally important to understand the mechanism of atp driven dna translocation in viruses using combinatorial mutagenesis and biochemical approaches we have defined the catalytic carboxylate residue that is required for atp hydrolysis although the original catalytic carboxylate hypothesis suggested the presence of a catalytic glutamate between the walker a srqlgkt      and walker b miyid      motifs none of the four candidate glutamic acid residues e   e   e  and e   is required for function however the e  residue that is immediately adjacent to the putative walker b aspartic acid residue d   exhibited a phenotypic pattern that is consistent with the catalytic carboxylate function none of the amino acid substitutions including the highly conservative d and q was tolerated biochemical analyses showed that the purified e  v d and q mutant gp s exhibited a complete loss of gp  stimulated atpase activity and in vitro dna packaging activity whereas their atp binding and dna cleavage functions remained intact the data suggest that the e  mutants are trapped in an atp bound conformation and are unable to catalyze the atp hydrolysis transduction cycle that powers dna translocation thus this study for the first time identified and characterized a catalytic glutamate residue that is involved in the energy transduction mechanism of a viral dna packaging machine
