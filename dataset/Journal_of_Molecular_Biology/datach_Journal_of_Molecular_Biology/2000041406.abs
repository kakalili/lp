a new folding intermediate of apomyoglobin from aplysia limacina stepwise formation of a molten globule edited by p e wright
apomyoglobin from aplysia limacina al apomb  despite having only   sequence identity with the more commonly studied mammalian globins m apombs  properties which result in an increased number of hydrophobic contacts and a loss of most internal salt bridges shares a number of features of their folding profiles we show here that it contains an unusually stable core which resists unfolding even at   c the equilibrium intermediate it at this high temperature is distinct from the acid unfolded state ia which has many properties in common with the acid intermediate observed for the mammalian apoproteins iagh  it contains a smaller amount of secondary structure     helical instead of    and is more highly solvated as evidenced from its fluorescence spectrum  max    nm instead of   nm  its stability is greatly increased   gw      kcal mol   in the presence of high salt  m kcl  lending support to the view that hydrophobic interactions are responsible for its stability kinetic data show classical two state kinetics between ia and the folded state both in the presence and absence of salt both ia and it can be populated within the dead time of the stopped flow apparatus since initiating the refolding reaction from it or ia rather than the completely unfolded state does not affect the observed refolding time course our conclusion is that al apomb as other  apo  proteins including for example  lactalbumin in the absence of ca   may be described as  uncoupled  with an unusually high and exploitable tendency to populate partially folded states
