crystal structure of a plant ribonuclease rnase le edited by r huber
ribonuclease le rnase le from cultured tomato lycopersicon esculentum cells is a member of the rnase t family showing broad base specificity the crystal structure of rnase le has been determined at     resolution the structure consists of seven  helices and seven  strands belonging to an     type structure comparison of the structure of rnase le with that of rnase rh a microbial rnase belonging to the rnase t family reveals that while the overall folding topologies are similar to each other major insertions and deletions are found at the n terminal regions the structural comparison an amino acid sequence alignment of the rnase t enzymes and comparison of the disulfide bonding pattern of these enzymes show that the structure of rnase le shown here is the basic framework of the animal plant subfamily of rnase t enzymes including a self incompatibility protein called s rnase  and the structure of rnase rh is that of the fungal subfamily of rnase t enzymes including rnase t  subsequently we superposed the active site of the rnase le with that of rnase rh and found that   his  trp  his  glu  lys  and his  of rnase le coincided exactly with his  trp  his   glu   lys   and his   respectively of rnase rh and   two conserved water molecules were found at the putative p sites of both enzymes these facts suggest that plant rnase le has a very similar hydrolysis mechanism to that of fungal rnase rh and almost all the rnase t enzymes widely distributed in various species share a common catalytic mechanism a cluster of hydrophobic residues was found on the active site face of the rnase le molecule and two large hydrophobic pockets exist these hydrophobic pockets appear to be base binding sites mainly by hydrophobic interactions and are responsible for the base non specificity of rnase le
