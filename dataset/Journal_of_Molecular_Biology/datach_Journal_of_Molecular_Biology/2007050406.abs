temperature dependent rnp conformational rearrangements analysis of binary complexes of primary binding proteins with  s rrna
ribonucleoprotein particles rnps are important components of all living systems and the assembly of these particles is an intricate often multistep process the  s ribosomal subunit is composed of one large rna   s rrna and  ribosomal proteins r proteins  in vitro studies have revealed that assembly of the  s subunit is a temperature dependent process involving sequential binding of r proteins and conformational changes of  s rrna additionally a temperature dependent conformational rearrangement was reported for a complex of primary r protein s and  s rrna given these observations a systematic study of the temperature dependence of  s rrna architecture in individual complexes with the other five primary binding proteins s  s  s  s  and s  was performed while all primary binding r proteins bind  s rrna at low temperature not all r proteins  s rrna complexes undergo temperature dependent conformational rearrangements some rnps achieve the same conformation regardless of temperature others show minor adjustments in  s rrna conformation upon heating and finally others undergo significant temperature dependent changes some of the architectures achieved in these rearrangements are consistent with subsequent downstream assembly events such as assembly of the secondary and tertiary binding r proteins the differential interaction of  s rrna with r proteins illustrates a means for controlling the sequential assembly pathway for complex rnps and may offer insights into aspects of rnp assembly in general
