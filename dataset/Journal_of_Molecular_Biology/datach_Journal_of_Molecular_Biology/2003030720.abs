crystal structure of schizosaccharomyces pombe riboflavin kinase reveals a novel atp and riboflavin binding fold
the essential redox cofactors riboflavin monophosphate fmn and flavin adenine dinucleotide fad are synthesised from their precursor riboflavin in sequential reactions by the metal dependent riboflavin kinase and fad synthetase here we describe the    crystal structure of the schizosaccharomyces pombe riboflavin kinase the enzyme represents a novel family of phosphoryl transferring enzymes it is a monomer comprising a central  barrel clasped on one side by two c terminal helices that display an l like shape the opposite side of the  barrel serves as a platform for substrate binding as demonstrated by complexes with adp and fmn formation of the atp binding site requires significant rearrangements in a short  helix as compared to the substrate free form the diphosphate moiety of adp is covered by the glycine rich flap i formed from parts of this  helix in contrast no significant changes are observed upon binding of riboflavin the ribityl side chain might be covered by a rather flexible flap ii the unusual metal binding site involves in addition to the adp phosphates only the strictly conserved thr  this may explain the preference for zinc observed in vitro
