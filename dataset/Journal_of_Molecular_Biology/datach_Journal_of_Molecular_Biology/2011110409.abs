molecular basis for herpesvirus entry mediator recognition by the human immune inhibitory receptor cd  and its relationship to the cosignaling molecules btla and light
cd  was recently identified as a t cell coinhibitory molecule that interacts with the herpesvirus entry mediator hvem on antigen presenting cells to deliver a potent inhibitory signal to cd  t cells hvem also binds to the coinhibitory receptor btla b and t lymphocyte attenuator and the costimulatory receptor light which is homologous to lymphotoxins exhibits inducible expression and competes with the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein d for hvem a receptor expressed by t lymphocytes or tnfsf   thus regulating the cd  btla light hvem signaling pathway to date the detailed properties of the formation of these complexes especially hvem binding to the newly identified receptor cd   and the relationship of cd  with btla and light are still unclear we performed n terminal sequencing and a mass spectrometric analysis which revealed that the extracellular domain of cd  exists primarily in the monomeric form the surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that cd  binds directly to the cysteine rich domain    of hvem with a similar affinity to but slower dissociation rate than that of btla notably cd  competed with btla for binding to hvem in contrast light did not affect hvem binding to either cd  or btla the results of a mutagenesis study of hvem also suggest that the cd  binding region on hvem was slightly different from but overlapped with the btla binding site interestingly an anti cd  antibody exhibiting antiangiogenic properties blocked cd  hvem binding these results provide insight into the molecular architecture of the cd  btla light hvem signaling complex that regulates immune function
