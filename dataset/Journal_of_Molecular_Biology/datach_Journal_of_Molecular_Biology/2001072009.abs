the palmitoyl groups of lung surfactant protein c reduce unfolding into a fibrillogenic intermediate edited by f cohen
lung surfactant protein c sp c is a lipophilic peptide that converts from a monomeric  helical state into  sheet conformation and forms amyloid fibrils a process which appears to be accelerated by removal of its two s palmitoyl groups and elevated amounts of non palmitoylated sp c are found in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis here we used mass spectrometry to study the first step in fibrillogenesis of di  mono and non palmitoylated sp c first the individual decreases in concentration of monomeric  helical forms of the three peptides in an acidified aqueous organic solvent mixture were monitored by electrospray es mass spectrometry dipalmitoylated sp c disappeared with a first order rate constant of   h   corresponding to a t  of  hours while sp c missing one or two palmitoyl groups disappeared with a rate constant of   h   t     hours this supports the suggestion that the acyl chains stabilise helical sp c and that small differences in helix stability can influence fibril formation the rates of disappearance of the monomeric  helical peptides are much faster than the disappearance of total soluble sp c t     days for sp c forms soluble after centrifugation at    g  which suggests that fibril formation is preceded by formation of soluble aggregates next we used matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation maldi mass spectrometry to measure hydrogen   deuterium h h exchange in di  mono and non palmitoylated sp c in acidified aqueous organic solvents all three species contain a rigid  helix in their monomeric forms and no difference in deuterium uptake between sp c with and without palmitoyl groups could be detected the decreased stability of mono and non palmitoylated sp c observed by es mass spectrometry is thus not associated with partial unwinding of the helix in solution finally sp c was shown to unfold during the es process where ions are transferred from the solution to the gas phase and the unfolded forms of di  mono and non palmitoylated sp c undergo h h exchange this together with the findings from maldi h h experiments that the  helix does not exchange indicates that no partly helical intermediates exist and that the unfolding is highly cooperative
