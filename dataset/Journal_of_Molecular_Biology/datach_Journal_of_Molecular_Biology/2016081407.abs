glycosylation quality control by the golgi structure
glycosylation is a ubiquitous modification that occurs on proteins and lipids in all living cells consistent with their high complexity glycans play crucial biological roles in protein quality control and recognition events asparagine linked protein n glycosylation the most complex glycosylation initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum and matures in the golgi apparatus this process not only requires an accurate distribution of processing machineries such as glycosyltransferases glycosidases and nucleotide sugar transporters but also needs an efficient and well organized factory that is responsible for the fidelity and quality control of sugar chain processing in addition accurate glycosylation must occur in coordination with protein trafficking and sorting these activities are carried out by the golgi apparatus a membrane organelle in the center of the secretory pathway to accomplish these tasks the golgi has developed into a unique stacked structure of closely aligned flattened cisternae in which golgi enzymes reside in mammalian cells dozens of golgi stacks are often laterally linked into a ribbon like structure here we review our current knowledge of how the golgi structure is formed and why its formation is required for accurate glycosylation with the focus on how the golgi stacking factors grasp  and grasp  generate the golgi structure and how the conserved oligomeric golgi complex maintains golgi enzymes in different golgi subcompartments by retrograde protein trafficking
