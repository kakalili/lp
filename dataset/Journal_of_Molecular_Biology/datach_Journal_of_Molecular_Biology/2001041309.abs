selection of ligands by panning of domain libraries displayed on phage lambda reveals new potential partners of synaptojanin  edited by j karn
one of the goals of functional genomics is the description of reliable and complete protein interaction networks to facilitate ligand discovery from complex protein mixtures we have developed an improved approach that is affected by a negligible fraction of false positives we have combined a novel technique based on the display of cdna libraries on the capsid of bacteriophage lambda and an efficient plaque assay to reveal phage displaying ligands that are enriched after only a couple of affinity purification steps we show that the lambda display system has a unique ability to display at high density proteins ranging in size from a few to at least   amino acid residues this characteristic permits attenuation of the size bias in the selection procedure and at the same time offers a sensitive plaque assay that permits us to do away with the ligand background without unduly increasing the number of selection cycles by using a proline rich fragment of the synaptojanin  protein as a bait we have identified in a brain cdna display library seven ligands all containing either sh or ww domains four of these correspond to proteins that have already been validated as physiological partners while the remaining three are new partners whose physiological relevance remains to be established two different proline rich regions of the p  activated protein kinase  pak  and wave scar protein retrieve from the library different proteins containing sh or ww domains
