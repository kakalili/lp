folding and stability of the leucine rich repeat domain of internalin b from listeria monocytogenes
internalin b inlb  a surface protein of the human pathogen listeria monocytogenes promotes invasion into various host cell types by inducing phagocytosis of the entire bacterium the n terminal half of inlb residues      inlb   which is sufficient for this process contains a central leucine rich repeat lrr domain that is flanked by a small  helical cap and an immunoglobulin ig like domain here we investigated the spectroscopic properties stability and folding of inlb  and of a shorter variant lacking the ig like domain inlb   the circular dichroism spectra of both protein variants in the far ultraviolet region are very similar with a characteristic minimum found at    nm possibly resulting from the high   helical content in the lrr domain upon addition of chemical denaturants both variants unfold in single transitions with unusually high cooperativity that are fully reversible and best described by two state equilibria the free energies of gdmcl induced unfolding determined from transitions at   c are      kcal mol for inlb  and      kcal mol for inlb   inlb  is also more stable against thermal denaturation as observed by scanning calorimetry this suggests that the ig like domain which presumably does not directly interact with the host cell receptor during bacterial invasion plays a critical role for the in vivo stability of inlb
