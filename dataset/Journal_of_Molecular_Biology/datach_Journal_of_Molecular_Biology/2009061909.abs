alternative exon  encoded relay domains affect more than one communication pathway in the drosophila myosin head
we investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of one of the four alternative regions within the drosophila myosin catalytic domain the relay domain encoded by exon  this domain of the myosin head transmits conformational changes in the nucleotide binding pocket to the converter domain which is crucial to coupling catalytic activity with mechanical movement of the lever arm to study the function of this region we used chimeric myosins ifi b and emb a  which were generated by exchange of the exon  encoded domains between the native embryonic body wall emb and indirect flight muscle isoforms ifi  kinetic measurements show that exchange of the exon  encoded region alters the kinetic properties of the myosin s head this is reflected in reduced values for atp induced actomyosin dissociation rate constant k k  and adp affinity kad  measured for the chimeric constructs ifi b and emb a compared to wild type ifi and emb values homology models indicate that in addition to affecting the communication pathway between the nucleotide binding pocket and the converter domain exchange of the relay domains between ifi and emb affects the communication pathway between the nucleotide binding pocket and the actin binding site in the lower  kda domain loop   these results suggest an important role of the relay domain in the regulation of actomyosin cross bridge kinetics
