resolution crystal structures of the ternary complexes of human phenylalanine hydroxylase catalytic domain with tetrahydrobiopterin and   thienyl l alanine or l norleucine substrate specificity and molecular motions related to substrate binding
the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of human phenylalanine hydroxylase hpheoh in complex with the physiological cofactor  r l erythro     tetrahydrobiopterin bh  and the substrate analogues   thienyl l alanine tha or l norleucine nle have been determined at    resolution the ternary tha complex confirms a previous    structure and the ternary nle complex shows that similar large conformational changes occur on binding of nle as those observed for tha both structures demonstrate that substrate binding triggers structural changes throughout the entire protomer including the displacement of tyr  from a surface position to a buried position at the active site with a maximum displacement of    for its hydroxyl group two hinge bending regions centred at leu  and asn   act in consort upon substrate binding to create further large structural changes for parts of the c terminus thus tha l phe binding to the active site is likely to represent the epicentre of the global conformational changes observed in the full length tetrameric enzyme the carboxyl and amino groups of tha and nle are positioned identically in the two structures supporting the conclusion that these groups are of key importance in substrate binding thus explaining the broad non physiological substrate specificity observed for artificially activated forms of the enzyme however the specific activity with nle as the substrate was only about  of that with tha which is explained by the different affinities of binding and different catalytic turnover
