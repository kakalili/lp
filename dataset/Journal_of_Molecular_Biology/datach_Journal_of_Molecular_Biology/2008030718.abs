directed evolution to low nanomolar affinity of a tumor targeting epidermal growth factor receptor binding affibody molecule
the epidermal growth factor receptor  egfr is overexpressed in various malignancies and is associated with a poor patient prognosis a small receptor specific high affinity imaging agent would be a useful tool in diagnosing malignant tumors and in deciding upon treatment and assessing the response to treatment we describe here the affinity maturation procedure for the generation of affibody molecules binding with high affinity and specificity to egfr a library for affinity maturation was constructed by rerandomization of selected positions after the alignment of first generation binding variants new binders were selected with phage display technology using a single oligonucleotide in a single library effort and the best second generation binders had an approximately  fold improvement in affinity kd     nm for the soluble extracellular domain of egfr in biospecific interaction analysis using biacore the dissociation equilibrium constant kd was also determined for the affibody with highest affinity using egfr expressing a  cells in flow cytometric analysis kd   nm  a retained high specificity for egfr was verified by a dot blot assay showing staining only of egfr proteins among a panel of serum proteins and other egfr family member proteins her  her  and her  the egfr binding affibody molecules were radiolabeled with indium   showing specific binding to egfr expressing a  cells and successful targeting of the a  tumor xenografts with    injected activity per gram accumulated in the tumor  h postinjection
