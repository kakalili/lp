high pressure nmr reveals that apomyoglobin is an equilibrium mixture from the native to the unfolded
pressure induced reversible conformational changes of sperm whale apomyoglobin have been studied between  bar and   bar on individual residue basis by utilizing h  n hetero nuclear single quantum coherence two dimensional nmr spectroscopy at ph   and   c apomyoglobin showed a series of pressure dependent nmr spectra as a function of pressure assignable to the native n  intermediates i  molten globule mg and unfolded u conformers at  bar the native fold n shows disorder only in the f helix between  bar and   bar a series of locally disordered conformers i are produced in which local disorder occurs in the c helix the cd loop the g helix and part of the h helix at   bar most cross peaks exhibit severe line broadening suggesting the formation of a molten globule but at   bar all the cross peaks reappear showing that the molten globule turns into a well hydrated mobile unfolded conformation u since all the spectral changes were reversible with pressure apomyoglobin is considered to exist as an equilibrium mixture of the n i mg and u conformers at all pressures mg is situated at      kcal mol above n at bar and the unfolding transition from the combined n  i state to mg is accompanied by a loss of partial molar volume by    ml mol on the basis of these observations we postulate a theorem that the partial molar volume of a protein decreases in parallel with the loss of its conformational order
