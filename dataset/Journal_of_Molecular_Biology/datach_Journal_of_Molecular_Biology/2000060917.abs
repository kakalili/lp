volumetric and spectroscopic characterizations of the native and acid induced denatured states of staphylococcal nuclease edited by p e wight
we have characterized the acid induced denaturation of staphylococcal nuclease snase at different urea concentrations by a combination of ultrasonic velocimetry high precision densimetry and cd spectroscopy our cd spectroscopic results suggest that at low salt and acidic ph the protein is unfolded with disrupted secondary and tertiary structures furthermore as judged by far uv cd spectra the protein is further unfolded at acidic ph upon the addition of urea up to the concentration of   m the midpoint of the transition shifts to more neutral ph values and the cooperativity of the transition decreases as the acid induced denaturation of snase occurs at higher urea concentrations we find that the change in volume    accompanying the acid induced denaturation of snase increases from     cm g       cm mol   in the absence of urea to    cm g     cm mol   at   m urea at all urea concentrations the partial specific adiabatic compressibility k s of the protein decreases upon its unfolding with the values of  k s equal to             cm mol   bar                cm mol   bar                cm mol   bar    and             cm mol   bar   cm g   bar   at urea concentrations of       and   m respectively in general our volumetric results suggest that the acid induced denatured state of snase is only partially unfolded with the solvent exposed surface area equal to      of that expected for the fully extended conformation
