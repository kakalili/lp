purification and characterization of the   mda ccr not complex identifies two novel components of the complex edited by d draper
the ccr not complex is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory complex that is involved in controlling mrna initiation elongation and degradation the ccr not proteins from saccharomyces cerevisiae exist in two complexes      da and     da   mda in size and individual components of these complexes display such disparate functions as binding to and restricting tfiid functions contacting saga and contributing to mrna deadenylation as a first step in characterizing the functional roles of the   mda complex we have purified it to near homogeneity mass spectrometric analysis was subsequently used to identify all the components of the complex the   mda complex was found to contain ccr  caf  not  and two new proteins caf  and caf   caf  and caf  are two unique yeast proteins with caf  displaying extensive homology to proteins from other eukaryotes immunoprecipitation and gel filtration experiments confirmed that caf  and caf  are components of both of the   mda and   mda ccr not complexes biochemical analysis indicated that the caf  and caf  proteins bind to the not protein and exist in a location separate from the two other subsets of proteins in the complex the ccr and caf proteins and the not  not and not proteins moreover caf  was able to interact with human not  suggesting that human caf  would also be a component of the recently identified human ccr not complex analysis of caf  and caf  deletions indicated that they elicited phenotypes shared by defects in other ccr not genes the distinct location of caf  and caf  and the evolutionary conservation of caf  implicate them in novel roles in the function of the ccr not complex
