In order to characterize the mechanisms regulating neuronal expression of the nematode SNAP-25 gene, we identified the SNAP-25 genes of Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. Comparative sequence analysis and reporter assays revealed two putative 5â€² regulatory elements, P1 and P2, and four elements, I1h, I1m, I2h, and I2m, in the first intron. Nuclear extracts contained activities that bound the P2 and I1h elements. Different elements were required for SNAP-25 expression in different neuronal subsets; P1 was required in DA and DD motor neurons, and I1m and I2m were required in DB and DA neurons, respectively. P2 was active in amphid and phasmid neurons, I1h in pharyngeal neurons, and I2h in touch receptor neurons. The I2h element contained a putative binding site for transcription factor UNC-86. Both UNC-86 and MEC-3 were required for I2h activity in the mechanosensory neurons: in these neurons, GFP expression driven by I2h was abolished in animals bearing either an unc-86 null or a mec-3 null mutation, or an unc-86 mutation that leads to defective interaction with MEC-3. Deletion of the MEC-3 binding site also abolished the GFP expression. Gel mobility-shift assay results suggest that transcriptional regulation of SNAP-25 may involve multiple transcription factors.
