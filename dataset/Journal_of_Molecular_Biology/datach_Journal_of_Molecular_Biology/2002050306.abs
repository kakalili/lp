water contributes actively to the rapid crossing of a protein unfolding barrier
the cold shock protein cspb folds rapidly in a n   u two state reaction via a transition state that is about   native in its interactions with denaturants and water this suggested that the energy barrier to unfolding is overcome by processes occurring in the protein itself rather than in the solvent nevertheless cspb unfolding depends on the solvent viscosity we determined the activation volumes of unfolding and refolding by pressure jump and high pressure stopped flow techniques in the presence of various denaturants the results obtained by these methods agree well the activation volume of unfolding is positive  vnu      ml mol and virtually independent of the nature and the concentration of the denaturant we suggest that in the transition state the protein is expanded and water molecules start to invade the hydrophobic core they have however not yet established favorable interactions to compensate for the loss of intra protein interactions the activation volume of refolding is positive as well  vun      ml mol and above m urea independent of the concentration of the denaturant at low concentrations of urea or guanidinium thiocyanate  vun  decreases significantly suggesting that compact unfolded forms become populated under these conditions
