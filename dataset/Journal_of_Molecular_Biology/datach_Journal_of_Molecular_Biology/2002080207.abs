solution structure of human and bovine   glycoprotein i revealed by small angle x ray scattering
glycoprotein i   gpi is a highly glycosylated phospholipid binding plasma protein comprised of four complement control protein ccp domains and a distinct fifth domain the structural organisation of human and bovine  gpi in aqueous solution was studied by small angle x ray scattering saxs  low resolution models that match the saxs experimental data best were independently constructed by three different ab initio d reconstruction algorithms similar elongated s shaped models with distinct side arms which were correlated to the position of the carbohydrate chains were restored from all three algorithms due to an additional glycosylation site located on the ccp domain of bovine  gpi a small change in the characteristic saxs parameters was observed which coincided with results obtained from sds  page in comparison to the human analogue the corresponding restored low resolution models displayed a similar s shape with less bending in the middle part as the experimental saxs curves fit poorly to the simulated scattering curves calculated from the crystallographic coordinates of human  gpi the crystal structure was modified first additional carbohydrate residues missing from the crystal structure were modelled second on the basis of the low resolution models the j shaped crystal structure was rotated between ccp and ccp assuming the greatest interdomain flexibility between these domains an s shaped model with a tilt angle of     between ccp and ccp yielded the best fit to the experimental saxs data since there is evidence that  gpi can adopt different conformations which reveal distinct differences in autoantibody recognition our data clearly point to a reorientation of the flexible domains which may be an essential feature for binding of autoantibodies
