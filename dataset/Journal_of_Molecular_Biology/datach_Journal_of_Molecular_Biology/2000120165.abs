solution structure of a dna three way junction containing two unpaired thymidine bases identification of sequence features that decide conformer selection edited by i timoco
the solution structure of a dna three way junction  h containing two unpaired thymidine bases at the branch site  ht  was determined by nmr arms a and b of the ht form a quasi continuous stacked helix which is underwound at the junction and has an increased helical rise the unstacked arm c forms an acute angle of approximately   with the unique arm a the stacking of the unpaired thymidine bases on arm c resembles the folding of hairpin loops from this data combined with the reported stacking behavior of  other hs s two rules are derived that together correctly reproduce their stacking preference these rules predict from the sequence of any hs  its stacking preference the structure also suggests a plausible mechanism for structure specific recognition of branched nucleic acids by proteins
