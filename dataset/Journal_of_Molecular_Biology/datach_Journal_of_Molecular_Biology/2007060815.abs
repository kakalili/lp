a scfv antibody mutant isolated in a genetic screen for improved export via the twin arginine transporter pathway exhibits faster folding
proteins destined for export across the cytoplasmic membrane via the post translational sec dependent route have to be maintained in a largely unfolded state within the cytoplasm in sharp contrast only proteins that have folded into a native like state within the cytoplasm are competent for export via the twin arginine translocation tat pathway proteins that contain disulfide bonds such as scfv antibody fragments can be translocated via tat only when expressed in escherichia coli trxb gor mutant strains having an oxidizing cytoplasm however export is poor with the majority of the protein accumulating in the cytoplasm and only a fraction exported to the periplasmic space using a high throughput fluorescence screen we isolated a mutant of the anti digoxin    scfv from a large library of random mutants that is exported with a higher yield into the periplasm in vitro refolding experiments revealed that the mutant scfv exhibits a   increase in the rate constant of the critical second phase of folding this result suggests that tat export competence is related to the protein folding rate and could be exploited for the isolation of faster folding protein mutants
