a novel mutant of the type i restriction modification enzyme ecor  i is altered at a key stage of the subunit assembly pathway edited by j karn
the hsds subunit of a type i restriction modification r m system plays an essential role in the activity of both the modification methylase and the restriction endonuclease this subunit is responsible for dna binding but also contains conserved amino acid sequences responsible for protein protein interactions the most important protein protein interactions are those between the hsds subunit and the hsdm methylation subunit that result in assembly of an independent methylase mtase of stoichiometry m s  here we analysed the impact on the restriction and modification activities of the change trp    arg in the distal border of the central conserved region of the ecor  i hsds subunit we demonstrate that this point mutation significantly influences the ability of the mutant hsds subunit to assemble with the hsdm subunit to produce a functional mtase as a consequence of this the mutant mtase has drastically reduced dna binding which is restored only when the hsdr restriction subunit binds with the mtase therefore hsdr acts as a chaperon allowing not only binding of the enzyme to dna but also restoring the methylation activity and at sufficiently high concentrations in vitro of hsdr restoring restriction activity
