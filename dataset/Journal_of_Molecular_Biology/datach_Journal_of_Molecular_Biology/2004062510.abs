the stability of the intact envelope glycoproteins is a major determinant of sensitivity of hiv siv to peptidic fusion inhibitors
c peptides derived from the hiv envelope glycoprotein transmembrane subunit gp  c terminal heptad repeat c hr region are potent hiv fusion inhibitors these peptides interact with the gp  n terminal heptad repeat n hr region and block the gp  six helix bundle formation that is required for fusion however the parameters that govern this inhibition have yet to be elucidated we address this issue by comparing the ability of c  derived from hiv  hiv  and siv gp  to inhibit hiv  hiv  and siv envelope mediated fusion and the ability of these peptides to form stable six helix bundles with n  peptides derived from gp  of these three viruses the ability to form six helix bundles was examined by circular dichroism spectroscopy and hiv siv env mediated membrane fusion was monitored by a dye transfer assay hiv  n  formed stable helix bundles with hiv  hiv  and siv c  which all inhibited hiv  env mediated fusion at ic  lt  nm the three c  peptides were poor inhibitors of hiv  and siv fusion ic  gt  nm  although hiv  and siv n  formed stable helix bundles with siv c  priming experiments with scd indicate that in contrast to hiv  hiv  and siv env do not expose their n hr region to siv c  following cd binding but rapidly proceed to co receptor engagement and six helix bundle formation resulting in fusion our results suggest that several factors including six helix bundle stability and the ability of cd to destabilize the envelope glycoprotein serve as determinants of sensitivity to entry inhibitors
