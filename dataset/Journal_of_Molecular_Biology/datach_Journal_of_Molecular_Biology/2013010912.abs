the binding of multiple nuclear receptors to a single regulatory region is important for the proper expression of edg a in drosophilamelanogaster
nuclear receptor transcription factor family members share target sequence similarity however little is known about how these factors exert their specific regulatory control here we examine the mechanism regulating the expression of the drosophila edg a gene a target gene of the orphan nuclear receptor  ftz f  as a model to study the cooperative behavior among nuclear receptors we show that the three nuclear receptors  ftz f  dhr  and dhr  bind to a common element in the edg a promoter the expression level of the edg a promoter lacz reporter genes in dhr  induced and mutant animals respectively suggests that dhr  works as a repressor the activity of a reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing dhr binding was reduced in ftz f mutants and rescued by the induced expression of  ftz f  suggesting that dhr and  ftz f activate the edg a gene in a redundant manner a reporter gene carrying a mutation that abolishes dhr  and ftz f binding was prematurely expressed and the expression level of the reporter gene carrying a mutation preventing dhr binding was reduced these findings suggest that the temporal expression of this gene is mainly controlled by  ftz f but that the binding of dhr is also important comparison of the binding site sequence among drosophila species suggests that dhr binding ability was gained after the melanogaster subgroup evolved and this ability may contribute to the robust expression of this gene these results show the complicated regulatory mechanisms utilized by multiple nuclear receptors to properly regulate the expression of their target gene through a single target site
