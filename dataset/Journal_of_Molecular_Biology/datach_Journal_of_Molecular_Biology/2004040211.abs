integrating three views of arf activation dynamics
the proteins arno and gea of the sec family can promote gdp  gtp exchange on arf  a small gtp binding protein which coordinates coated vesicle formation for protein transport within the cell crystal structures of the essential sec domain sec d of gea in the free and arf bound forms suggest that conformational dynamics of the sec d as well as those of the g protein play a role in nucleotide exchange starting from a set of complementary crystal structures we compared the collective movements of unbound gea and arno sec domains arf gdp and the arf  gea sec d nucleotide free complex using normal modes analyses in all unbound sec d analyses significant low energy movements were found to lead to closure of the hydrophobic groove towards the form seen in the arf  gea sec d complex suggesting that groove closure is a general feature of the sec family low energy movements in arf gdp implicate critical switch  and  residues which are coupled to modifications in the myristoylated n terminal helix binding site at the other end of the  interswitch  beta hairpin it is suggested that sec d groove closure upon docking of the two molecules may permit extraction of switch  from arf gdp and prepare the complex for movement of the interswitch which is central to the membrane linked exchange activity large scale collective movements in the arf  sec d complex appear to participate in the insertion of the sec d glu finger into the gdp binding site to promote actual nucleotide release
