intrinsically disordered regions of human plasma membrane proteins preferentially occur in the cytoplasmic segment
a systematic survey of intrinsically disordered id regions was carried out in   human plasma membrane proteins with full assignment of the transmembrane topology with respect to the lipid bilayer id regions with  consecutive residues or more were detected in    of the human proteins a much higher percentage than the corresponding figure    for inner membrane proteins of escherichia coli the domain organization of each of the membrane protein in terms of transmembrane helices structural domains id and unassigned regions as well as the distinction of inside or outside of the cell was determined long id regions constitute   and   of the human plasma membrane proteins on the inside and outside of the cell respectively showing that they preferentially occur on the cytoplasmic side we interpret this phenomenon as a reflection of the general scarcity of id regions on the extracellular side and their relative abundance on the cytoplasmic side in multicellular eukaryotic organisms
