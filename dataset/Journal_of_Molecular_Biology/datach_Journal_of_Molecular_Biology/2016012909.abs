regions   and   of the rna polymerase  subunit promote dna melting and attenuate action of the antibiotic lipiarmycin
initiation of rna synthesis by bacterial rna polymerase rnap requires melting of promoter dna which is nucleated by the  subunit during formation of the  open  promoter complex rpo  the antibiotic lipiarmycin lpm inhibits promoter melting by blocking access of the template dna strand to the rnap active site cleft here we show that escherichia coli rnap holoenzymes containing either housekeeping    with a deletion in the region   or the stationary phase  s subunits exhibited hypersensitivity to lpm and increased cold sensitivity of rpo formation similar effects were produced by mutation located    away from the lpm binding site within   region   controlling    promoter element recognition our data suggested that template strand single stranded dna competes with lpm for binding to rnap and that   regions   and   attenuate lpm action by promoting dna duplex opening
