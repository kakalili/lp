Transcription of the late (Class 3) flagellar promoters in Salmonella typhimurium is dependent upon the flagellar specific sigma factor, σ28, encoded by the fliA gene. σ28-dependent transcription is inhibited by an anti-sigma factor, FlgM, through a direct interaction. FlgM can bind both to free σ28 to prevent it from forming a complex with core RNA polymerase, and to σ28 holoenzyme to destabilize the complex. A collection of fliA mutants defective for negative regulation by FlgM (fliA∗ mutants) were isolated. This collection included 27 substitution mutations that conferred insensitivity to FlgM in vivo. The distribution of mutations defined three potential FlgM binding domains in conserved sigma factor regions 2.1, 3.1 and 4 of σ28. A subset of mutants from each region was assayed for FlgM binding and transcriptional activity in vitro. The results strongly support a multipartite interaction between σ28 and FlgM. Region 4 mutations, but not region 2.1 or 3.1 mutations, interfered with the ability of FlgM to destabilize σ28 from core RNA polymerase. We present refined models for FlgM inhibition of σ28, and for FlgM destabilization of σ28 holoenzyme.
