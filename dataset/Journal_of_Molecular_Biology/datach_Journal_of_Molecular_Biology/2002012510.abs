polymerisation of chemically cross linked actin thymosin   complex to filamentous actin alteration in helical parameters and visualisation of thymosin   binding on f actin edited by w baumeister
the  thymosins are intracellular monomeric g actin sequestering proteins forming   complexes with g actin here we analysed the interaction of thymosin   with f actin thymosin   at    m was chemically cross linked to f actin in the presence of phalloidin the chemically cross linked actin thymosin   complex was incorporated into f actin these mixed filaments were of normal appearance when inspected by conventional transmission electron microscopy after negative staining we purified the chemically cross linked actin thymosin   complex which polymerised only when phalloidin and the gelsolin  actin complex were present simultaneously using scanning transmission electron microscopy the mass per length of control and actin thymosin   filaments was found to be       kda nm and       kda nm respectively indicating an increase in subunit mass of   kda analysis of the helical parameters revealed an increase of the crossover spacing of the two right handed long pitch helical strands from   to   nm difference map analysis of  d helical reconstruction of control and actin thymosin   filaments yielded an elongated extra mass qualitatively the overall size and shape of the difference mass were compatible with published data of the atomic structure of thymosin   the deduced binding sites of thymosin   to actin were in agreement with those identified previously however parts of the difference map might represent subtle conformational changes of both proteins occurring upon complex formation
