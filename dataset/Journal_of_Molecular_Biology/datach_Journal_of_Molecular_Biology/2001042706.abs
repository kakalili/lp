the x ray crystal structure of the trichoderma reesei family  endoglucanase  cel a at    resolution edited by a r fersht
we present the three dimensional structure of trichoderma reesei endoglucanase  cel a  a small   amino acid residue    kda  neutral pi glycoside hydrolase family  cellulase that lacks a cellulose binding module the structure has been determined using x ray crystallography and refined to    resolution the asymmetric unit consists of six non crystallographic symmetry related molecules that were exploited to improve initial multiple isomorphous replacement phasing and subsequent structure refinement the enzyme contains one disulfide bridge and is glycosylated at asp  by a single n acetyl glucosamine residue the protein has the expected fold for a glycoside hydrolase clan c family  enzyme it contains two  sheets of six and nine strands packed on top of one another and one  helix the concave surface of the nine stranded  sheet forms a large substrate binding groove in which the active site residues are located in the active site we find a carboxylic acid trio similar to that of glycoside hydrolase families  and   the strictly conserved asp  hydrogen bonds to the nucleophile the invariant glu   the binding crevice is lined with both aromatic and polar amino acid side chains which may play a role in substrate binding the structure of the fungal family  enzyme presented here allows a complete structural characterization of the glycoside hydrolase c clan
