pcp consensus sequences of flaviviruses correlating variance with vector competence and disease phenotype
backgroundcomputational methods are needed to design multivalent vaccines against flaviviruses fvs such as the west nile virus or the dengue virus denv objectivewe aimed to use physicochemical property pcp consensus sequences of fv strains to delineate conserved motifs areas of maximum variability and specific loci that correlate with arthropod vector serotype and disease severity methodspcp consensus sequences for  species were prepared from   annotated sequences catalogued in flavitrack alignments of these correlated well with the known structures of the ns protease domain and envelope e proteins the pcpmer suite was used to identify motifs common to all fvs areas of pcp variability that correlated with phenotype were plotted on the structures resultsdespite considerable diversity at the amino acid level pcps for both proteins were well conserved throughout the fvs a series of insertions in e separated tick from mosquito borne viruses and all arthropod borne viruses from isolates with no known vector or directly from insects comparison of a pcp consensus sequence of e derived from   denv strains denv   with individual ones for denv  denv showed that most major serotype specific variation occurs near these insertions the denv  differed from one prepared from eight hemorrhagic or fatal strains from four denv serotypes at only three positions two of which overlap known escape mutant sites conclusionscomparing consensus sequences showed that substantial changes occur in only a few areas of the e protein pcp consensus sequences can contribute to the design of multivalent vaccines
