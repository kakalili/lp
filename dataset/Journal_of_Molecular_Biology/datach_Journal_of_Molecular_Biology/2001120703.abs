tumor cell growth inhibition and extracellular signal regulated kinase erk phosphorylation by novel k vitamins edited by m yaniv
hydroxy ethylsulfanyl  methyl   naphthoquinone or cpd  a k vitamin analog was previously indicated to be a potent growth inhibitor for hep b hepatoma cells in vitro here we show that cpd  and two newly synthesized analogs    hydroxy ethylsulfanyl  methyl  nitro   naphthoquinone pd   and   hydroxy ethylsulfanyl  methyl  acetylamino   naphthoquinone pd   are potent growth inhibitors of  different human cancer cell lines with ic  values in the range of    m phospho erk was induced by each of three k vitamin analogs in every cell line in a dose dependent manner at growth inhibitory doses erk phosphorylation and growth inhibitory effects were strongly correlated with p     for cpd  p     for pd  and p     for pd   the induction of phospho erk and growth inhibition were antagonized by thiol containing anti oxidants but not by catalase consistent with a possible arylating mechanism the data show a novel class of growth inhibitors with a wide spectrum of action that induces erk hyper phosphorylation as a possible new growth inhibitory feature
