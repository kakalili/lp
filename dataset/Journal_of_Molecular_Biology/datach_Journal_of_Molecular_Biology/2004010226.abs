destabilization of a non pathological variant of ataxin  results in fibrillogenesis via a partially folded intermediate a model for misfolding in polyglutamine disease
ataxin  is a member of the polyglutamine family of proteins which are associated with at least nine different neurodegenerative diseases in the disease state expansion of the polyglutamine tract leads to dysfunction and death of neurons as well as formation of proteinaceous aggregates known as nuclear inclusions intriguingly both expanded and non expanded forms of ataxin  are observed within these nuclear inclusions ataxin  is the smallest of the polyglutamine disease proteins and in its expanded form causes the neurodegenerative disorder machado  joseph disease using a non pathological variant containing  residues in its polyglutamine tract we have probed the folding and misfolding pathways of ataxin  we describe here the first equilibrium folding pathway delineated for any polyglutamine protein and show that ataxin  folds reversibly via a single intermediate species we have also explored further the misfolding potential of the protein and found that partial destabilization of ataxin  by chemical denaturation leads to the formation of fibrillar aggregates by the non pathological variant these results provide an insight into the possible mechanisms by which polyglutamine expansion may affect the stability and conformation of the protein the implications of this are considered in the wider context of the development and pathogenesis of polyglutamine diseases
