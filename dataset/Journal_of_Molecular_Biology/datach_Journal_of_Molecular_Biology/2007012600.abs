crystal structure of archaeal photolyase from sulfolobus tokodaii with two fad molecules implication of a novel light harvesting cofactor
uv exposure of dna molecules induces serious dna lesions the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer cpd photolyase repairs cpd type  lesions by using the energy of visible light two chromophores for different roles have been found in this enzyme family one catalyzes the cpd repair reaction and the other works as an antenna pigment that harvests photon energy the catalytic cofactor of all known photolyases is fad whereas several light harvesting cofactors are found currently    methenyltetrahydrofolate mthf   hydroxy  deaza riboflavin  hdf and fmn are the known light harvesting cofactors and some photolyases lack the chromophore three crystal structures of photolyases from escherichia coli ec photolyase  anacystis nidulans an photolyase  and thermus thermophilus tt photolyase have been determined however no archaeal photolyase structure is available a similarity search of archaeal genomic data indicated the presence of a homologous gene st   on sulfolobus tokodaii strain  an enzymatic assay reveals that st   encodes photolyase from s tokodaii st photolyase  we have determined the crystal structure of the st photolyase protein to confirm its structural features and to investigate the mechanism of the archaeal dna repair system with light energy the crystal structure of the st photolyase is superimposed very well on the three known photolyases including the catalytic cofactor fad surprisingly another fad molecule is found at the position of the light harvesting cofactor this second fad molecule is well accommodated in the crystal structure suggesting that fad works as a novel light harvesting cofactor of photolyase in addition two of the four cpd recognition residues in the crystal structure of an photolyase are not found in st photolyase which might utilize a different mechanism to recognize the cpd from that of an photolyase
