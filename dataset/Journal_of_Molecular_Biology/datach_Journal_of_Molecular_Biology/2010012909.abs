mechanical coupling in myosin v a simulation study
myosin motor function depends on the interaction between different domains that transmit information from one part of the molecule to another the interdomain coupling in myosin v is studied with restrained targeted molecular dynamics using an all atom representation in explicit solvent to elucidate the origin of the conformational change due to the binding of atp targeting forces are applied to small sets of atoms the forcing sets fss in the direction of their displacement from the rigor conformation which has a closed actin binding cleft to the post rigor conformation in which the cleft is open the  minimal  fs that results in extensive structural changes in the overall myosin conformation is composed of atp switch  and the nearby hf hg and hh helices addition of switch  to the fs is required to achieve a complete opening of the actin binding cleft the restrained targeted molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanical coupling pathways between i the nucleotide binding pocket nbp and the actin binding cleft  ii the nbp and the converter and iii the actin binding cleft and the converter closing of the nbp due to atp binding is tightly coupled to the opening of the cleft and leads to the rupture of a key hydrogen bond f  n a  o between switch  and the sh helix the actin binding cleft may mediate the rupture of this bond via a connection between the hw helix the relay helix and switch  the findings are consistent with experimental studies and a recent normal mode analysis the present method is expected to be useful more generally in studies of interdomain coupling in proteins
