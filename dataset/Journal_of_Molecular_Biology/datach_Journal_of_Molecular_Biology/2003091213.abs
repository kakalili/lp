a    structure of fve a member of the new fungal immunomodulatory protein family
fve a major fruiting body protein from flammulina velutipes a mushroom possessing immunomodulatory activity stimulates lymphocyte mitogenesis suppresses systemic anaphylaxis reactions and edema enhances transcription of il  ifn  and tnf   and hemagglutinates red blood cells it appears to be a lectin with specificity for complex cell surface carbohydrates fve is a non covalently linked homodimer containing no cys his or met residues it shares sequence similarity only to the other fungal immunomodulatory proteins fips lz  gts vvo and vvl all of unknown structure the    structure of fve solved by single anomalous diffraction of nabr soaked crystals is novel each monomer consists of an n terminal  helix followed by a fibronectin iii fniii fold the fniii fold is the first instance of  pseudo h type  topology a transition between the seven  stranded s type and the eight  stranded h type topologies the structure suggests that dimerization critical for the activity of fips occurs by  d domain swapping of the n terminal helices and is stabilized predominantly by hydrophobic interactions the structure of fve is the first in this lectin family to be reported and the first of an fniii domain containing protein of fungal origin
