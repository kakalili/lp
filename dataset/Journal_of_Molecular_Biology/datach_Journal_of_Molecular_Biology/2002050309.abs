structures of glycopeptide antibiotics with peptides that model bacterial cell wall precursors
the vancomycin related antibiotics balhimycin and degluco balhimycin have been crystallized in complexes with di  tri and pentapeptides that emulate bacterial cell wall precursors and four structures determined at atomic resolution  lt    in addition to the features expected from previous structural and spectroscopic studies two new motifs were observed that may prove important in the design of antibiotics modified to overcome bacterial resistance a changed binding mode was found in two dipeptide complexes and a new type of face to face oligomerization in addition to the well established back to back dimerization was seen when the model peptide reaches a critical fraction of the size of the cell wall precursor pentapeptide the extensive interactions involving both antibiotic and peptide molecules in this interface should appreciably enhance the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of the complexes in the pentapeptide complex the relative positions of the peptides are close to those required for d ala elimination so this structure may provide a realistic model for the prevention of the enzyme catalyzed cell wall crosslinking by antibiotic binding
