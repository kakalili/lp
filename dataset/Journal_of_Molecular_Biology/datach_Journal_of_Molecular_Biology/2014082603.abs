kif  binds tightly to microtubules and adopts a rigor like conformation
the mitotic kinesin motor protein kif  is essential for cytokinesis during cell division and has been implicated in cerebral development and a variety of human cancers here we show that the mouse kif  motor domain binds tightly to microtubules and does not display typical nucleotide dependent changes in this affinity it also has robust atpase activity but very slow motility a crystal structure of the adp bound form of the kif  motor domain reveals a dramatically opened atp binding pocket as if ready to exchange its bound adp for mg atp in this state the central  sheet is twisted    beyond the maximal amount observed in other kinesins this configuration has only been seen in the nucleotide free states of myosins  known as the  rigor like  state fitting of this atomic model to electron density maps from cryo electron microscopy indicates a distinct binding configuration of the motor domain to microtubules we postulate that these properties of kif  are well suited for stabilizing midbody microtubules during cytokinesis
