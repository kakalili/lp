The SR (arginine-serine rich) protein ASF/SF2 (also called human alternative splicing factor), an essential splicing factor, contains two functional modules consisting of tandem RNA recognition motifs (RRMs; RRM1–RRM2) and a C-terminal arginine-serine repeat region (RS domain, a domain rich in arginine-serine repeats). The SR-specific protein kinase (SRPK) 1 phosphorylates the RS domain at multiple serines using a directional (C-terminal-to-N-terminal) and processive mechanism—a process that directs the SR protein to the nucleus and influences protein–protein interactions associated with splicing function. To investigate how SRPK1 accomplishes this feat, the enzyme–substrate complex was analyzed using single-turnover and multiturnover kinetic methods. Deletion studies revealed that while recognition of the RS domain by a docking groove on SRPK1 is sufficient to initiate the processive and directional mechanism, continued processive phosphorylation in the presence of building repulsive charge relies on the fine-tuning of contacts with the RRM1–RRM2 module. An electropositive pocket in SRPK1 that stabilizes newly phosphorylated serines enhanced processive phosphorylation of later serines. These data indicate that SRPK1 uses stable, yet highly flexible protein–protein interactions to facilitate both early and late phases of the processive phosphorylation of SR proteins.
