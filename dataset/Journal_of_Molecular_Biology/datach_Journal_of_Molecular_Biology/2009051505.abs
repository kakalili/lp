fuel specificity of the hepatitis c virus ns helicase
the hepatitis c virus hcv ns protein is a helicase capable of unwinding duplex rna or dna this study uses a newly developed molecular beacon based helicase assay mbha to investigate how nucleoside triphosphates ntps fuel hcv helicase catalyzed dna unwinding the mbha monitors the irreversible helicase catalyzed displacement of an oligonucleotide bound molecular beacon so that rates of helicase translocation can be directly measured in real time the mbha reveals that hcv helicase unwinds dna at different rates depending on the nature and concentration of ntps in solution such that the fastest reactions are observed in the presence of ctp followed by atp utp and gtp    deoxy ntps generally support faster dna unwinding with dttp supporting faster rates than any other canonical d ntp the presence of an intact ns protease domain makes hcv helicase somewhat less specific than truncated ns bearing only its helicase region ns h  various ntps bind ns h with similar affinities but each ntp supports a different unwinding rate and processivity studies with ntp analogs reveal that specificity is determined by the nature of the watson  crick base pairing region of the ntp base and the nature of the functional groups attached to the   and   carbons of the ntp sugar the divalent metal bridging the ntp to ns h also influences observed unwinding rates with mn  supporting about  times faster unwinding than mg  unlike mg  mn  does not support hcv helicase catalyzed atp hydrolysis in the absence of stimulating nucleic acids results are discussed in relation to models for how atp might fuel the unwinding reaction
