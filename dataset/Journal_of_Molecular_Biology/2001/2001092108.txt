In order to define the mean DNA bend angle and distribution of DNA bend angles in the catabolite activator protein (CAP)-DNA complex in solution under standard transcription initiation conditions, we have performed nanosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements quantifying energy transfer between a probe incorporated at a specific site in CAP, and a complementary probe incorporated at each of five specific sites in DNA. The results indicate that the mean DNA bend angle is 77(±3)°–consistent with the mean DNA bend angle observed in crystallographic structures (80(±12)°). Lifetime-distribution analysis indicates that the distribution of DNA bend angles is relatively narrow, with &lt;10% of DNA bend angles exceeding 100°. Millisecond time-resolved luminescence measurements using lanthanide-chelate probes provide independent evidence that the upper limit of the distribution of DNA bend angles is ∼100°. The methods used here will permit mutational analysis of CAP-induced DNA bending and the role of CAP-induced DNA bending in transcriptional activation.
