chloramphenicol biosynthesis the structure of cmls a flavin dependent halogenase showing a covalent flavin  aspartate bond
chloramphenicol is a halogenated natural product bearing an unusual dichloroacetyl moiety that is critical for its antibiotic activity the operon for chloramphenicol biosynthesis in streptomyces venezuelae encodes the chloramphenicol halogenase cmls which belongs to the large and diverse family of flavin dependent halogenases fdh  s  cmls was previously shown to be essential for the formation of the dichloroacetyl group here we report the x ray crystal structure of cmls determined at     resolution revealing a flavin monooxygenase domain shared by all fdhs but also a unique  winged helix  c terminal domain that creates a t shaped tunnel leading to the halogenation active site intriguingly the c terminal tail of this domain blocks access to the halogenation active site suggesting a structurally dynamic role during catalysis the halogenation active site is notably nonpolar and shares nearly identical residues with chondromyces crocatus tyrosyl halogenase cndh  including the conserved lys k  that forms the reactive chloramine intermediate the exception is y   which could be used to stabilize enolate formation during substrate halogenation the strictly conserved residue e  located near the isoalloxazine ring of the bound flavin adenine dinucleotide fad cofactor is optimally positioned to function as a remote general acid through a water mediated proton relay which could accelerate the reaction of the chloramine intermediate during substrate halogenation or the oxidation of chloride by the fad c    ooh intermediate strikingly the   carbon of the fad cofactor is observed to be covalently attached to d  of cmls a residue that is highly conserved in the fdh family in addition to representing a new type of flavin modification this has intriguing implications for the mechanism of fdhs based on the crystal structure and in analogy to known halogenases we propose a reaction mechanism for cmls
