the crystal structure of the c a domain of otoferlin reveals an unconventional top loop region
otoferlin otof  whose genetic mutations cause profound deafness in humans is a protein composed of at least six c domains which are known as ca  binding and phospholipid binding regions mammalian ferlin proteins are proposed to act in membrane fusion events with otof being specifically required for exocytosis in auditory hair cells ferlin c domains exhibit a rather low level of sequence similarity to those of synaptotagmins protein kinase c isoforms or phospholipases here we report the crystal structure of the n terminal c domain of otof c a at     resolution in contrast to previous predictions we found that this c domain is complete with eight  strands comparing the structure of otof c a to those of other c domains revealed one top loop in otof to be significantly shorter this results in a depression of the surface which is positively charged for the otof c a domain and contrasts with the head like protrusion surrounded by a negatively charged  neck  typically found in other c domains isothermal titration calorimetry and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies confirmed that otof c a is unable to bind ca  while the synaptotagmin  c a domain exhibited ca  binding under the same conditions furthermore floatation assays revealed a failure of otof c a to bind to phospholipid membranes accordingly no positively charged  groove like surface structure which is known to bind phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate in other c domains was found at the respective position in otof c a taken together these data demonstrate that the otof c a domain differs structurally and functionally from other c domains
