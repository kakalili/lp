crystal structure of the pdz domain of human na h exchanger regulatory factor provides insights into the mechanism of carboxyl terminal leucine recognition by class i pdz domains edited by d rees
the na h exchanger regulatory factor nherf also known as ebp  contains two pdz domains that mediate the assembly of transmembrane and cytosolic proteins into functional signal transduction complexes the nherf pdz domain interacts specifically with the motifs dsll dsfl and dtrl present at the carboxyl termini of the   adrenergic receptor   ar  the platelet derived growth factor receptor pdgfr  and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr  respectively and plays a central role in the physiological regulation of these proteins the crystal structure of the human nherf pdz has been determined at    resolution using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing the overall structure is similar to known pdz structures with notable differences in the nherf pdz carboxylate binding loop that contains the gygf motif and the variable loop between the   and   strands in the crystalline state the carboxyl terminal sequence deql of pdz occupies the peptide binding pocket of a neighboring pdz molecule related by  fold crystallographic symmetry this structure reveals the molecular mechanism of carboxyl terminal leucine recognition by class i pdz domains and provides insights into the specificity of nherf interaction with the carboxyl termini of several membrane receptors and ion channels including the  ar pdgfr and cftr
