solid state nmr reveals structural differences between fibrils of wild type and disease related a t mutant  synuclein
fibrils from the parkinson s disease related a t mutant of  synuclein were investigated by solid state nmr spectroscopy electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy sequential solid state nmr resonance assignments were obtained for a large fraction of the fibril core experiments conducted above and below the freezing point suggest that the fibrils contain regions with increased mobility and structural elements different from  strand character in addition to the rigid  sheet rich core region as in earlier studies on wild type  synuclein the c terminus was found to be flexible and unfolded whereas the main core region was highly rigid and rich in  sheets compared to fibrils from wild type  synuclein the well ordered  sheet region extends to at least l  and l   these results demonstrate that a disease related mutant of  synuclein differs in both aggregation kinetics and fibril structure
