structural and biochemical analysis of human pathogenic astrovirus serine protease at     resolution
astroviruses are single stranded rna viruses with a replication strategy based on the proteolytic processing of a polyprotein precursor and subsequent release of the viral enzymes of replication so far the catalytic properties of the astrovirus protease as well as its structure have remained uncharacterized in this study the three dimensional crystal structure of the predicted protease of human pathogenic astrovirus has been solved to     resolution the protein displays the typical properties of trypsin like enzymes but also several characteristic features  i a catalytic asp his ser triad in which the aspartate side chain is oriented away from the histidine being replaced by a water molecule  ii a non common conformation and composition of the s pocket and iii the lack of the typical surface  ribbons together with a  featureless  shape of the substrate binding site hydrolytic activity assays indicate that the s pocket recognises glu and asp side chains specifically which therefore are predicted to occupy the p position on the substrate cleavage site the positive electrostatic potential featured by the s region underlies this specificity the comparative structural analysis highlights the peculiarity of the astrovirus protease and differentiates it from the human and viral serine proteases
