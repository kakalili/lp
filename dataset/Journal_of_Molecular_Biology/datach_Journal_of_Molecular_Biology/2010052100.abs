the branched photocycle of the slow cycling channelrhodopsin  mutant c  t
channelrhodopsins chrs of green algae such as chlamydomonas are used as neuroscience tools to specifically depolarize cells with light a crude model of the chr photocycle has been recently established but details of the photoreactions are widely unknown here we present the photoreactions of a slow cycling chr mutant step function rhodopsin  with c  replaced by threonine and   fold extended lifetime of the conducting state p   at a late state of the photocycle a fraction of the proteins branches off into an inactive species p   which accumulates during prolonged illumination at neutral ph p  is converted into p   a species with a characteristic fine structured spectrum that is interpreted as retroretinyl chromophore the described branching reactions should be considered when chr is used as a neuroscience tool especially in the case of fluorescence imaging at high light intensities
