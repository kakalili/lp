structural and biochemical analysis of sliding clamp ligand interactions suggest a competition between replicative and translesion dna polymerases
most dna polymerases interact with their cognate processive replication factor through a small peptide this interaction being absolutely required for their function in vivo we have solved the crystal structure of a complex between the  sliding clamp of escherichia coli and the  residue c terminal peptide of pol iv p   the seven c terminal residues bind to a pocket located at the surface of one  monomer this region was previously identified as the binding site of another  clamp binding protein the  subunit of the  complex we show that peptide p  competitively prevents  clamp mediated stimulation of both pol iv and  subunit dna polymerase activities suggesting that the site of interaction of the  subunit with  is identical with or overlaps that of pol iv this common binding site for   pol iv and  subunit is shown to be formed by residues that are highly conserved among many bacterial  homologs thus defining an evolutionarily conserved hydrophobic crevice for sliding clamp ligands and a new target for antibiotic drug design
