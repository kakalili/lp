crystal structure of a cohesin module from clostridium cellulolyticum implications for dockerin recognition edited by r huber
in the assembly of the clostridium cellulolyticum cellulosome the multiple cohesin modules of the scaffolding protein cipc serve as receptors for cellulolytic enzymes which bear a dockerin module the x ray structure of a type i c cellulolyticum cohesin module cc cohesin has been solved using molecular replacement and refined at    resolution despite a rather low sequence identity of    this module has a fold close to those of the two clostridium thermocellum cohesin ct cohesin modules whose d structures have been determined previously cc cohesin forms a dimer in the crystal as do the two ct cohesins we show here that the dimer exists in solution and that addition of dockerin containing proteins dissociates the dimer this suggests that the dimerization interface and the cohesin dockerin interface may overlap the nature of the overall surface and of the dimer interface of cc cohesin differ notably from those of the ct cohesin modules being much less polar and this may explain the species specificity observed in the cohesin dockerin interaction of c cellulolyticum and c thermocellum we have produced a topology model of a c cellulolyticum dockerin and of a cc cohesin dockerin complex using homology modeling and available biochemical data our model suggests that a special residue pair already identified in dockerin sequences is located at the center of the cohesin surface putatively interacting with the dockerin
