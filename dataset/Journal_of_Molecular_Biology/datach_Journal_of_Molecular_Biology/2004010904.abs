altering the rna binding mode of the u a rbd protein
the n terminal rna binding domain rbd  of the human u a protein is evolutionarily designed to bind its rna targets with great affinity and specificity the physical mechanisms that modulate the coupling local cooperativity among amino acid residues on the extensive binding surface of rbd are investigated here using mutants that replace a highly conserved glycine residue this glycine residue at the strand loop junction of   loop  is found in u a rbd  and in most rbd domains suggesting it has a specific role in modulation of rna binding here two rbd proteins are constructed in which that residue gly  is replaced by either alanine or valine these new proteins are shown by nmr methods and molecular dynamics simulations to be very similar to the wild type rbd  both in structure and in their backbone dynamics however rna binding assays show that affinity for the u snrna stem loop ii rna target is reduced by nearly   fold for the rbd g a protein and by     fold for rbd g v the mode of rna binding by rbd g a is similar to that of rbd wt displaying its characteristic non additive free energies of base recognition and its salt dependence the binding mode of rbd g v is altered having lost its salt dependence and displaying site independence of base recognition the molecular basis for this alteration in rna binding properties is proposed to result from the inability of the rna to induce a change in the structure of the free protein to produce a high affinity complex
