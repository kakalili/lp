differentiating ligand and inhibitor interactions of a single antiporter
regulatory mechanisms of ion and solute transporters are in focus of biomedical and biochemical studies and build a key for disease therapies inhibition of sodium proton exchangers efficiently prevents ischemic heart disease and reperfusion development in humans but molecular mechanisms behind are not clear using single molecule force spectroscopy we observe the binding of the inhibitor  aminoperimidine ap to sodium proton antiporters nhaa from escherichia coli deactivating interactions were significantly suppressed at enhanced sodium concentrations of   mm as well as in the ph locked inactive conformation of nhaa new molecular interactions were quantified and localized within the protein occurring upon a competitive inhibitor binding the inhibitor which was targeted and bound to the ligand binding pocket altered interactions established at  helix ix these molecular mechanisms deactivating the antiporter were different to those established upon ligand binding and activation of nhaa
