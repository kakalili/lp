the evolution of aggregative multicellularity and cell  cell communication in the dictyostelia
aggregative multicellularity resulting in formation of a spore bearing fruiting body evolved at least six times independently amongst both eukaryotes and prokaryotes amongst eukaryotes this form of multicellularity is mainly studied in the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum in this review we summarise trends in the evolution of cell type specialisation and behavioural complexity in the four major groups of dictyostelia we describe the cell  cell communication systems that control the developmental programme of d discoideum highlighting the central role of camp in the regulation of cell movement and cell differentiation comparative genomic studies showed that the proteins involved in camp signalling are deeply conserved across dictyostelia and their unicellular amoebozoan ancestors comparative functional analysis revealed that camp signalling in d discoideum originated from a second messenger role in amoebozoan encystation we highlight some molecular changes in camp signalling genes that were responsible for the novel roles of camp in multicellular development
