the ligand binding site of bovine  lactoglobulin evidence for a function
ever since the fortuitous observation that  lactoglobulin   lg  the major whey protein in the milk of ruminants bound retinol the details of the binding have been controversial   lg is a lipocalin like plasma retinol binding protein so that ligand association was expected to make use of the central cavity in the protein however an early crystallographic analysis and some of the more recent solution studies indicated binding elsewhere we have now determined the crystal structures of the complexes of the trigonal form of  lg at ph   with bound retinol r    for   reflections between  and    resolution rfree    and with bound retinoic acid r    for   reflections between  and    resolution rfree     both ligands are found to occupy the central calyx in a manner similar to retinol binding in retinol binding protein we find no evidence of binding at the putative external binding site in either of these structural analyses further competition between palmitic acid and retinol reveals only palmitate bound to the protein an explanation is provided for the lack of ligand binding to the orthorhombic crystal form also obtained at ph   finally the possible function of  lg is discussed in the light of its species distribution and similarity to other lipocalins
