thermodynamic characterization of the interaction between prefoldin and group ii chaperonin
prefoldin pfd is a hexameric chaperone that captures a protein substrate and transfers it to a group ii chaperonin cpn to complete protein folding we have studied the interaction between pfd and cpn using those from a hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus strain ks  t ks   in this study we determined the crystal structure of the t ks  pfd  subunit and characterized the interactions between t ks  cpns cpn  and cpn  and t ks  pfds pfd     and pfd      as predicted from its amino acid sequence the pfd  subunit conforms to a structure similar to those of the pfd  subunit and the pyrococcus horikoshii ot pfd  subunit with the exception of the tip of its coiled coil domain which is thought to be the cpn interaction site the interactions between t ks  cpns and pfds cpn  and pfd      cpn  and pfd      cpn  and pfd      and cpn  and pfd      were analyzed using the biacore t  system at various temperatures ranging from  to    c the affinities between pfds and cpns increased with an increase in temperature the thermodynamic parameters calculated from association constants showed that the interaction between pfd and cpn is entropy driven among the four combinations of pfd  cpn interactions the entropy difference in binding between cpn  and pfd     was the largest and affinity significantly increased at higher temperatures considering that expression of pfd     and cpn  subunit is induced upon heat shock our results suggest that pfd     is a general pfd for t ks  cpns whereas pfd     is specific for cpn
