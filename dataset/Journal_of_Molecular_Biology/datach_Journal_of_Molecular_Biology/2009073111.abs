isoform selective interaction of the adaptor protein tks fish with sos and dynamins
the adaptor protein tks fish tyrosine kinase substrate  five sh domains hereafter termed tks  is a crucial component of a protein network that controls the invasiveness of cancer cells and progression of alzheimer s disease tks consists of an amino terminal px domain that is followed by five sh domains sh a  e  and two different splice variants are expressed we identified son of sevenless  sos  as a novel binding partner of tks and found colocalization of tks with sos in human epithelial lung carcinoma a   cells and in podosomes of src transformed nih t cells we observe synergistic binding of sh a and sh b to sos when peptide arrays are used indicating that the tandem sh a and sh b domains of tks can potentially bind in a supersh binding mode as was described for the homologous protein p phox these results are further corroborated by pull down assays and isothermal titration calorimetry showing that both intact sh domains are required for efficient binding to the entire proline rich domain of sos  the presence of a basic insertion between the sh a and sh b domains in the long splice variant of tks decreases the affinity to sos isoforms about  fold as determined by analytical ultracentrifugation furthermore it leads to an alteration in the recognition of binding motifs for the interaction with sos  while the insertion abrogates the interaction with the majority of peptides derived from the proline rich domains of sos and dynamin that are recognized by the short splice isoform it enables binding to a different set of peptides including a sequence comprising the splice insertion in the long isoform of sos  sos   in the absence of the basic insertion tks was found to bind a range of sos and dynamin peptides including conventional proline rich motifs and atypical recognition sequences hereby the tandem sh domains in tks employ two distinct types of binding modes one class of peptides is recognized by single sh domains whereas a second class of peptides requires the presence of both domains to bind synergistically we conclude that the tandem sh a and sh b domains of tks constitute a versatile module for the implementation of isoform specific protein  protein interactions
