characterization of vibrio cholerae hfq provides novel insights into the role of the hfq c terminal region
hfq is a bacterial rna binding protein that facilitates small rna mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation in vibrio cholerae hfq and four hfq dependent small rnas are essential for the expression of virulence genes but little is known about this mechanism at the molecular level to better understand v cholerae hfq structure and mechanism we characterized the protein alongside escherichia coli hfq for comparison using biochemical and biophysical techniques the n terminal domain ntd of the two proteins is highly conserved but the c terminal regions ctrs vary in both sequence and length small angle x ray scattering studies showed that both proteins adopt a star shaped hexameric structure in which the conserved ntd adopts the expected sm fold while the variable ctr is disordered and extends radially outwards from the folded core despite their structural similarity sds page stability assays and collision induced dissociation mass spectrometry revealed that the v cholerae hexamer is less stable than that of e coli we propose that this is due to minor differences between the intersubunit interface formed by the ntds and the ability of the e coli ctr to stabilize this interface however based on electrophoretic mobility shift assays the divergent ctrs do appear to perform a common function with regard to rna binding specificity overall the similarities and differences in the fundamental properties of v cholerae and e coli hfq provide insight into their assembly and molecular mechanisms
