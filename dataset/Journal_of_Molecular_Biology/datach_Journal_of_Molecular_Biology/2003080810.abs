a core mutation affecting the folding properties of a soluble domain of the atpase protein copa from bacillus subtilis
the two n terminal domains of the p type copper atpase copaa and copab from bacillus subtilis differ in their folding capabilities in vitro whereas copab has the typical       structure and is a rigid protein copaa is found to be largely unfolded a sequence analysis of the two and of orthologue homologous proteins indicates that ser  in copaa may destabilise the hydrophobic core as also confirmed through a bioinformatic energy study copab has a val in the corresponding position the s v and s a mutants are found to be folded although the latter displays multiple conformations s vcopaa in both apo and copper i loaded forms has very similar structural and dynamic properties with respect to copab besides a different length of strand   and   it is intriguing that the oxygen of thr  is found close though at longer than bonding distance to copper in both domains as it also occurs in a human orthologue domain this study contributes to understanding the behaviour of proteins that do not properly fold in vitro a possible biological significance of the peculiar folding behaviour of this domain is discussed
