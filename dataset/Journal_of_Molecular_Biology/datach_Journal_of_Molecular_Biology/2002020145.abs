suppression of  lipoxygenase synthesis by hnrnp e is dependent on repetitive nature of lox mrna   utr control element dice edited by j karn
cytidine rich  lipoxygenase differentiation control element   lox dice is a multifunctional cis element found in the   utr of numerous eukaryotic mrnas it binds kh domain proteins of the type hnrnp e and k thus mediating mrna stabilization and translational control translational silencing is caused by formation of a simple binary complex between dice and recombinant hnrnp e  e  electromobility shift assays and sucrose gradient centrifugation demonstrate that rabbit  lox dice which is composed of ten subunits of the sequence ccccpucccucuuccccaag    r is able to bind up to ten molecules of e  protein rna interaction was studied with different subunits and submotifs of the  r structure binding appears to be dependent on the degree of polymerization of the c clusters  r lt  r lt  r lt  r  but not on their order the minimal motif which still functioned in e binding contained two c clusters ccccpucccucuu for efficient translational control e binding is a necessary but not sufficient condition translational inhibition by e is only observed when at least a dimeric r configuration of the dice is present in the   utr of a reporter mrna we conclude that binding of at least two e molecules activate or expose a binding site to enable the complex to interact with the   end of the mrna and the translational machinery dice motifs are widely distributed in nature the utr database utrnr contains  entries of mrnas with  lox dices most dices were two to fourfold repetitive but also highly repetitive structures were found as in quail myelin protein mrna   repeats and hyperglycemic hormone mrna of two crayfish species nine and  repeats
