global folds of proteins with low densities of noes using residual dipolar couplings application to the   residue maltodextrin binding protein edited by p e wright
the global fold of maltose binding protein in complex with the substrate  cyclodextrin was determined by solution nmr methods the two domain protein is comprised of a single polypeptide chain of   residues with a molecular mass of  kda distance information in the form of hn hn hn ch and ch ch noes was recorded on  n  h and  n  c  h labeled proteins with methyl protonation in val leu and ile c  only residues distances to methyl protons critical for the structure determination comprised   of the long range restraints initial structures were calculated on the basis of   noes   hydrogen bond and   dihedral angle restraints a global pair wise backbone rmsd of    was obtained for these initial structures with rmsd values for the n and c domains of   and     respectively direct refinement against one bond hn  n  c   co  n  co two bond hn  co and three bond hn  c  dipolar couplings resulted in structures with large numbers of dipolar restraint violations as an alternative to direct refinement against measured dipolar couplings we have developed an approach where discrete orientations are calculated for each peptide plane on the basis of the dipolar couplings described above the orientation which best matches that in initial nmr structures calculated from noe and dihedral angle restraints exclusively is used to refine further the structures using a new module written for cns modeling studies from four different proteins with diverse structural motifs establishes the utility of the methodology when applied to experimental data recorded on mbp the precision of the family of structures generated improves from   to     while the rmsd with respect to the x ray structure  dmb is reduced from   to
