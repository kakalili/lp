structural organisation of the rotavirus nonstructural protein nsp
rotavirus is one of the leading agents of gastroenteritis worldwide during infection viral factories viroplasms are formed the rotavirus nonstructural proteins nsp and nsp are the major building blocks of viroplasms however nsp function and organisation remain elusive in this report we present a structural characterisation of nsp  multi angle laser light scattering sedimentation velocity and equilibrium sedimentation experiments demonstrate that recombinant full length nsp forms a decamer in solution far western pull down and multi angle laser light scattering experiments show that nsp has two oligomerisation regions the first region residues      is involved in nsp dimerisation whereas the second region residues      is responsible for nsp decamerisation circular dichroism analyses of full length and truncated forms of nsp reveal that the decamerisation region is helical whereas the dimerisation region involves  sheets from these circular dichroism experiments we also show that the nsp protomers contain two  helices a disordered n terminal half and a c terminal half that is primarily composed of  sheet folds this extensive structural characterisation of nsp led us to propose a model for its quaternary organisation finally co expression of nsp fragments and nsp in uninfected cells shows that the nsp decamerisation region is required for viroplasm like structure formation however in vitro the nsp decamerisation region partially inhibits the nsp  nsp interaction our nsp model suggests that steric hindrance prevents nsp from binding to all nsp protomers some protomers may thus be free to interact with other nsp binding partners such as viral rnas and the viral polymerase vp  to perform functions other than viroplasm organisation
