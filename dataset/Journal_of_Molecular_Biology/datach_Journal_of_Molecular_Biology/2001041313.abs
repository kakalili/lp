rad  protein stimulates heteroduplex dna formation in the synaptic phase of dna strand exchange via specific interactions with the presynaptic rad  nucleoprotein filament edited by m belfort
rad  is an important member of the rad  group of genes that carry out recombinational repair of dna damage in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae rad  protein is a member of the snf swi protein family of dna dependent stimulated atpases and its atpase activity is crucial for rad  protein function rad  protein and rad  k  r a mutant protein defective in the walker a box atp binding fold were fused to glutathione s transferase gst and purified to near homogeneity in vivo gst rad  protein carried out the functions required for methyl methanesulfonate sulfate mms  uv and dsb repair in vitro gst rad  protein exhibited dsdna specific atpase activity rad  protein stimulated rad  rpa mediated dna strand exchange by specifically increasing the kinetics of joint molecule formation this stimulation was accompanied by a concurrent increase in the formation of heteroduplex dna our results suggest that rad  protein interacts specifically with established rad  nucleoprotein filaments before homology search on the duplex dna and heteroduplex dna formation rad  protein did not stimulate dna strand exchange by increasing presynaptic complex formation we conclude that rad  protein acts during the synaptic phase of dna strand exchange and after the formation of presynaptic rad  protein ssdna filaments
