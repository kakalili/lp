functional contacts between mper and the anti hiv  broadly neutralizing antibody e  extend into the core of the membrane
the exceptional breadth of broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs against the membrane proximal external region mper of the transmembrane protein gp  makes this class of antibodies an ideal model to design hiv vaccines from a practical point of view however the preparation of vaccines eliciting bnabs is still a major roadblock that limits their clinical application fresh mechanistic insights are necessary to develop more effective strategies in particular the function of the unusually long complementarity determining region three of the heavy chain cdrh  of e  an anti mper bnab is an open question that fascinates researchers in the field residues comprising the apex region are dispensable for engagement of the epitope in solution still their single mutation profoundly impairs the neutralization capabilities of the antibody since this region is very hydrophobic it has been proposed that the apex is essential for anchoring the antibody to the viral membrane where mper resides herein we have critically examined this idea using structural biophysical biochemical and cell based approaches our results demonstrate that the apex region is not just a  greasy  spot merely increasing the affinity of the antibody for the membrane we demonstrate the three dimensional engagement of the apex region of the cdrh with the conglomerate of gp  epitope and membrane lipids as a means of effective binding and neutralization of the virus this mechanism of recognition suggests a standard route of antibody ontogeny therefore we need to focus our efforts on recreating a more realistic mper lipid immunogen in order to generate more effective anti hiv  vaccines
