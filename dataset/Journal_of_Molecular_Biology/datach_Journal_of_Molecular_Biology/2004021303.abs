crystal structure of a camp dependent protein kinase mutant at     new insights into the catalytic mechanism
the catalytic subunit of camp dependent protein kinase has served as a paradigm for the entire kinase family in the course of studying the structure  function relationship of the p  loop leu   leu   of the kinase we have solved the crystal structure of the tyr  to ala mutant in complexes with mg atp and an inhibitory peptide at     with overall structure very similar to that of the wild type protein however at the nucleotide binding site atp was found largely hydrolyzed with the products adp po retained in the structure high resolution refinement suggests that   of the molecules contain the intact atp whereas   have the hydrolyzed products the observation of the substrate and product states in the same structure adds significant information to our understanding of the phosphoryl transfer process structural examination of the mutation site substantiates and extends the emerging concept that the hydrophobic core in the large lobe of the kinase might serve as a stable platform for anchoring key segments involved in catalysis we propose that tyr  is critical for anchoring the p  loop to the core further analysis has highlighted two major connections between the p  loop and the catalytic loop arg   asn   one emphasizes the hydrophobic packing of tyr  and leu  mediated through residues from the  f helix recently recognized as a signal integration motif which together with the  e helix forms the center of the hydrophobic core network the other connection is mediated by the hydrogen bond interaction between thr  and asp   in a substrate dependent manner we speculate that the latter interaction may be important for the kinase to sense the presence of substrate and prepare itself for the catalytic reaction thus the p  loop is not merely involved in substrate binding it mediates the communication between substrate and catalytic residues
