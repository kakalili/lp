the crystal structure of the sorcin calcium binding domain provides a model of ca  dependent processes in the full length protein  edited by r huber
sorcin is a   kda calcium binding protein expressed in a number of mammalian tissues that belongs to the small recently identified penta ef hand pef family like all members of this family sorcin undergoes a ca  dependent translocation from cytosol to membranes where it binds to target proteins for sorcin the targets differ in different tissues indicating that it takes part in a number of ca  regulated processes the sorcin monomer is organized in two domains like in all pef proteins a flexible hydrophobic glycine rich n terminal region and a calcium binding c terminal domain in vitro the pef proteins are dimeric in their ca  free form but have a marked tendency to precipitate when bound to calcium stabilization of the dimeric structure is achieved by pairing of the uneven ef hand ef  sorcin can also form tetramers at acid ph the sorcin calcium binding domain scbd residues      expressed in escherichia coli was crystallized in the ca  free form the structure was solved by molecular replacement and was refined to    with a crystallographic r factor of     interestingly the asymmetric unit contains two dimers the structure of the scbd leads to a model that explains the solution properties and describes the ca  induced conformational changes phosphorylation studies show that the n terminal domain hinders phosphorylation of scbd i e the rate of phosphorylation increased twofold in the absence of the n terminal region in addition previous fluorescence studies indicated that hydrophobic residues are exposed to solvent upon ca  binding to full length sorcin the model accounts for these data by proposing that ca  binding weakens the interactions between the two domains and leads to their reorientation which exposes hydrophobic regions facilitating the ca  dependent binding to target proteins at or near membranes
