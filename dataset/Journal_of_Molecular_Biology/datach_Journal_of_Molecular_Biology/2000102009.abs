polymerization three dimensional structure and mechanical properties of dictyostelium versus rabbit muscle actin filaments edited by w baumeister
to assess more systematically functional differences among non muscle and muscle actins and the effect of specific mutations on their function we compared actin from dictyostelium discoideum d actin with actin from rabbit skeletal muscle r actin with respect to the formation of filaments their three dimensional structure and mechanical properties with mg  occupying the single high affinity divalent cation binding site the course of polymerization is very similar for the two types of actin in contrast when ca  is bound d actin exhibits a significantly longer lag phase at the onset of polymerization than r actin crossover spacing and helical screw angle of negatively stained filaments are similar for d and r f actin filaments irrespective of the tightly bound divalent cation however three dimensional helical reconstructions reveal that the intersubunit contacts along the two long pitch helical strands of d ca f actin filaments are more tenuous compared to those in r ca f actin filaments d mg f actin filaments on the other hand exhibit more massive contacts between the two long pitch helical strands than r mg f actin filaments moreover in contrast to the structure of r f actin filaments which is not significantly modulated by the divalent cation the intersubunit contacts both along and between the two long pitch helical strands are weaker in d ca f actin compared to d mg f actin filaments consistent with these structural differences d ca f actin filaments were significantly more flexible than d mg f actin taken together this work documents that despite being highly conserved muscle and non muscle actins exhibit subtle differences in terms of their polymerization behavior and the three dimensional structure and mechanical properties of their f actin filaments which in turn may account for their functional diversity
