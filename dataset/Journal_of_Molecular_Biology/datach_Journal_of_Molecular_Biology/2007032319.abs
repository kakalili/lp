structural insights into the non additivity effects in the sequence to reactivity algorithm for serine peptidases and their inhibitors
sequence to reactivity algorithms sras for proteins have the potential of being broadly applied in molecular design recently laskowski et al have reported an additivity based sra that accurately predicts most of the standard free energy changes of association for variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain omtky  with six serine peptidases one of which is streptogrisin b commonly known as streptomyces griseus peptidase b sgpb  non additivity effects for residues  i and  i and for residues  i and  i of omtky occurred when the associations with sgpb were predicted using the sra to elucidate precisely the mechanics of these non additivity effects in structural terms we have determined the crystal structures of the unbound omtky  with gly i as in the wild type amino acid sequence at a resolution of      the unbound ala i variant of omtky at a resolution of      and the sgpb omtky ala i complex equilibrium association constant ka     m   at     c  ph   at a resolution of      extensive comparisons with the crystal structure of the unbound omtky confirm our understanding of some previously addressed non additivity effects unexpectedly sgpb and omtky ala i form a   complex in the crystal comparison with the sgpb omtky complex shows a conformational change in the sgpb omtky ala i complex resulting from a hinged rigid body rotation of the inhibitor caused by the steric hindrance between the methyl group of ala ia of the inhibitor and pro  be of the peptidase this perturbs the interactions among residues  i  i  i and  i of the inhibitor probably resulting in the above non additivity effects this conformational change also introduces residue  i as an additional hyper variable contact residue to the sra
