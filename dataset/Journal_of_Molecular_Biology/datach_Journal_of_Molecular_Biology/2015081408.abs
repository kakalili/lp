structure of hepatitis c virus envelope glycoprotein e antigenic site      in complex with antibody igh
hepatitis c virus hcv is a positive strand rna virus within the flaviviridae family the viral  spike  of hcv is formed by two envelope glycoproteins e and e  which together mediate viral entry by engaging host receptors and undergoing conformational changes to facilitate membrane fusion while e can be readily produced in the absence of e  e cannot be expressed without e and few reagents including monoclonal antibodies mabs  are available for study of this essential hcv glycoprotein a human mab to e  igh   was previously reported to cross neutralize different hcv isolates and therefore we sought to further characterize the igh  neutralizing epitope to obtain information for vaccine design we found that mab igh  bound to a discontinuous epitope but with a major component corresponding to e residues      the crystal structure of igh  fab with this e glycopeptide at    resolution revealed that the antibody binds to one face of an  helical peptide single mutations on the helix substantially lowered igh  binding but did not affect neutralization indicating either that multiple mutations are required or that additional regions are recognized by the antibody in the context of the membrane associated envelope oligomer molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the free peptide is flexible in solution suggesting that it requires stabilization for use as a candidate vaccine immunogen
