polymerase  simulations suggest that arg  rotation is a slow step rather than large subdomain motions per se edited by b honig
the large scale opening motion of mammalian dna polymerase  is followed at atomic resolution by dynamic simulations that link crystal  closed  and  open  conformations the closing opening conformational change is thought to be key to the ability of polymerases to choose a correct nucleotide through  induced fit   and hence maintain dna repair synthesis fidelity corroborating available structural and kinetic measurements our studies bridge static microscopic crystal structures with macroscopic kinetic data by delineating a specific sequence phe  ring flip large thumb movement arg  rotation with release of catalytic mg  together with estimated time scales that suggest the arg  rearrangement as a limiting factor of large subdomain motions if similarly slow in the closing motion this conformational change might be restricted further when an incorrect nucleotide binds and thus play a role in pol   s selectivity for the correct nucleotide these results suggest new lines of experimentation in the study of polymerase mechanisms e g enzyme mutants  which should provide further insights into mechanisms of error discrimination and dna synthesis fidelity
