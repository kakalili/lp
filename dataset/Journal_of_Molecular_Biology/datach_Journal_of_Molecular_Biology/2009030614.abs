kinetics of deoxy ctp incorporation opposite a dg c n  aminofluorene adduct by a high fidelity dna polymerase
the model carcinogen n  acetylaminofluorene covalently binds to the c position of guanine to form two adducts the n    deoxyguanosine  yl aminofluorene g af and the n     deoxyguanosine  yl acetylaminofluorene g aaf  although they are chemically closely related their biological effects are strongly different and they are processed by different damage tolerance pathways g af is bypassed by replicative and high fidelity polymerases while specialized polymerases ensure synthesis past of g aaf we used the dna polymerase i fragment of a bacillus stearothermophilus strain as a model for a high fidelity polymerase to study the kinetics of incorporation of deoxy ctp dctp opposite a single g af pre steady state kinetic experiments revealed a drastic reduction in dctp incorporation performed by the g af modified ternary complex two populations of these ternary complexes were identified  i a minor productive fraction    that readily incorporates dctp opposite the g af adduct with a rate similar to that measured for the adduct free ternary complexes and ii a major fraction of unproductive complexes    that slowly evolve into productive ones in the light of structural data we suggest that this slow rate reflects the translocation of the modified base within the active site from the pre insertion site into the insertion site by making this translocation rate limiting the g af lesion reveals a novel kinetic step occurring after dntp binding and before chemistry
