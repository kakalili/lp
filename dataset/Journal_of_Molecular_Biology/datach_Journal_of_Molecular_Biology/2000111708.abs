phage   dna polymerase residues involved in the proper stabilisation of the primer terminus at the      exonuclease active site edited by j karn
three highly conserved amino acid residues have been characterised here as ssdna ligands at the      exonuclease active site of   dna polymerase the functional role of tyr  his  and phe  residues of   dna polymerase belonging to exo ii motif previously described as containing an invariant catalytic aspartate residue and two highly conserved ssdna ligands was assayed by biochemical analysis of six site directed mutants at those residues these studies revealed that the mutations introduced severely affected their ssdna binding capacity and as a consequence the      exonuclease activity on ssdna substrates was also severely impaired producing drastic defects in the maintenance of replication fidelity crystal structures of klenow fragment of pol ik and thermococcus gorgonarius dna polymerase complexed with ssdna at their      exonuclease active sites revealed that residues gln  of the former and tyr  of the latter the counterparts of his  of   dna polymerase are making contacts with the penultimate phosphodiester bond of ssdna substrate here the functional role of this residue is described
