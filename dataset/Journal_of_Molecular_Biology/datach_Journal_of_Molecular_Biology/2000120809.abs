movement of the decoding region of the  s ribosomal rna accompanies trna translocation
the ribosome undergoes pronounced periodic conformational changes during protein synthesis of particular importance are those occurring around the decoding site the region of the  s rrna interacting with the mrna trna  complex we have incorporated structural information from x ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance into cryo electron microscopic maps of ribosomal complexes designed to capture structural changes at the translocation step of the polypeptide elongation cycle the a site region of the decoding site actively participates in the translocation of the trna from the a to the p site upon gtp hydrolysis by elongation factor g shifting approximately   toward the p site this implies that elongation factor g actively pushes both the decoding site and the mrna trna complex during translocation
