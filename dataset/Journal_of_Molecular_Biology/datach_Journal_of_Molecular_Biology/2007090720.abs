stabilisation of a     barrel protein designed from identical half barrels
it has been suggested that the common     barrel enzyme fold has evolved by the duplication and fusion of identical     half barrels followed by the optimisation of their interface in our attempts to reconstruct these events in vitro we have previously linked in tandem two copies of the c terminal half barrel hisf c of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase from thermotoga maritima and subsequently reconstituted in the fusion construct hisf cc a salt bridge cluster present in wild type hisf the resulting recombinant protein hisf c c which was produced in an insoluble form and unfolded with low cooperativity at moderate urea concentrations has now been stabilised and solubilised by a combination of random mutagenesis and selection in vivo for this purpose escherichia coli cells were transformed with a plasmid based gene library encoding hisf c c variants fused to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cat  stable and soluble variants were identified by the survival of host cells on solid medium containing high concentrations of the antibiotic the selected hisf c c proteins which were characterised in vitro in the absence of cat contained eight different amino acid substitutions one of the exchanges y  c stabilised hisf c c by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond three of the substitutions g  r v  m l  q were located in the long loop connecting the two hisf c copies whose subsequent truncation from  to  residues yielded the stabilised variant hisf c c   from the remaining substitutions y  h and v  m were most beneficial and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that they strengthen the interactions between the half barrels by establishing a hydrogen bonding network and an extensive hydrophobic cluster respectively by combining the loop deletion of hisf c c  with the y  h and v  m substitutions the variant hisf c c was generated recombinant hisf c c is produced in soluble form forms a pure monomer with its tryptophan residues shielded from solvent and unfolds with similar cooperativity as hisf our results show that starting from two identical and fused half barrels few amino acid exchanges are sufficient to generate a highly stable and compact     barrel protein with wild type like structural properties
