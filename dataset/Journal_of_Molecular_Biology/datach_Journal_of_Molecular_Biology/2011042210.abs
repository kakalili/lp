structures of the tetr like simocyclinone efflux pump repressor simr and the mechanism of ligand mediated derepression
simocyclinone d  sd  a potent dna gyrase inhibitor made by streptomyces antibioticus is exported from the producing organism by the simx efflux pump the expression of simx is under the control of simr a member of the tetr family of transcriptional regulators simr represses simx transcription by binding to operators in the intergenic region between simr and simx previously we have shown that the mature antibiotic sd or its biosynthetic intermediate simocyclinone c  can dissociate simr from its operators leading to derepression of simx and export of sd from the cell this provides a mechanism that couples the biosynthesis of the antibiotic to its export here we report the crystal structures of simr alone and in complex with either sd or simocyclinone c  the ligand binding pocket is unusual compared to those of other characterized tetr family transcriptional regulators the structures show an extensive ligand binding pocket spanning both monomers in the functional dimeric unit with the aminocoumarin moiety of sd buried in the protein core while the angucyclic polyketide moiety is partially exposed to bulk solvent through comparisons of the structures we postulate a derepression mechanism for simr that invokes rigid body motions of the subunits relative to one another coupled with a putative locking mechanism to restrict further conformational change
