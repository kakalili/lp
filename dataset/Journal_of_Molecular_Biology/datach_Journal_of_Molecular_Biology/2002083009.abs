sequence plasticity in the antigen binding site of a therapeutic anti her antibody
we have examined the plasticity of the antigen combining site of a high affinity antibody in phage displayed fab libraries selected cdr positions and one fr position of the humanized anti her antibody hu d were substituted with all  amino acids antigen binding selections were used to enrich for high affinity variants and a large number of sequences were obtained prior to convergence of the selected pool to a small set of clones as expected sequence variability of the antigen binding site is overall diminished compared to known igg sequences however certain positions retain much higher variability than others the sequence variability map of the hu d binding site is compared with a map derived from previous alanine scanning of the antibody affinities of soluble fab fragments for antigen confirm that multiple variants were selected with high affinity for antigen including one variant with a single point mutation that was about threefold improved in affinity compared to the parental hu d  interestingly this mutation is one of the most radical in terms of changing side chain chemistry trp for asp and occurs at the most plastic site as calculated by the wu  kabat variability coefficient thus variability mapping yields information about the antibody  antigen interaction that is useful and complementary to that obtained by alanine scanning mutagenesis
