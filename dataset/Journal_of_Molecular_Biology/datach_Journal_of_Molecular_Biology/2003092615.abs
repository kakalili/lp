muscle type creatine kinase interacts with central domains of the m band proteins myomesin and m protein
muscle type creatine kinase mm ck is a member of the ck isoenzyme family with key functions in cellular energetics mm ck interacts in an isoform specific manner with the m band of sarcomeric muscle where it serves as an efficient intramyofibrillar atp regenerating system for the actin activated myosin atpase located nearby on both sides of the m band four mm ck specific and highly conserved lysine residues are thought to be responsible for the interaction of mm ck with the m band a yeast two hybrid screen led to the identification of mm ck as a binding partner of a central portion of myomesin my   an interaction was observed with domains six to eight of the closely related m protein but not with several other ig like domains including an m band domain of titin the observed interactions were corroborated and characterised in detail by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy biacore  in both cases they were ck isoform specific and the mm ck specific lysine residues k  k  k  and k   are involved in this interaction at ph   the dissociation constants for the myomesin mm ck and the m protein mm ck binding were in the range of     nm and around   m respectively the binding showed pronounced ph dependence and indicates a dynamic association dissociation behaviour which most likely depends on the energy state of the muscle our data propose a simple model for the regulation of this dynamic interaction
