a novel method for sampling alpha helical protein backbones
we present a novel technique of sampling the configurations of helical proteins assuming knowledge of native secondary structure we employ assembly rules gathered from a database of existing structures to enumerate the geometrically possible three dimensional arrangements of the constituent helices we produce a library of possible folds for  helical protein cores in each case our method finds significant numbers of conformations close to the native structure in addition we assign coordinates to all atoms for four of the  proteins and show that this has a small effect on the number of near native conformations in the context of database driven exhaustive enumeration our method performs extremely well yielding significant percentages of conformations between    and   within   of the native structure the method s speed and efficiency make it a valuable tool for predicting protein structure
