the code for directing proteins for translocation across er membrane srp cotranslationally recognizes specific features of a signal sequence
the signal recognition particle srp cotranslationally recognizes signal sequences of secretory proteins and targets ribosome nascent chain complexes to the srp receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane initiating translocation of the nascent chain through the sec  translocon although signal sequences do not have homology they have similar structural regions a positively charged n terminus a hydrophobic core and a more polar c terminal region that contains the cleavage site for the signal peptidase here we have used site specific photocrosslinking to study srp  signal sequence interactions a photoreactive probe was incorporated into the middle of wild type or mutated signal sequences of the secretory protein preprolactin by in vitro translation of mrnas containing an amber stop codon in the signal peptide in the presence of the n   azido  nitrobenzoyl lys trnaamb amber suppressor a homogeneous population of srp  ribosome nascent chain complexes was obtained by the use of truncated mrnas in translations performed in the presence of purified canine srp quantitative analysis of the photoadducts revealed that charged residues at the n terminus of the signal sequence or in the early part of the mature protein have only a mild effect on the srp  signal sequence association however deletions of amino acid residues in the hydrophobic portion of the signal sequence severely affect srp binding the photocrosslinking data correlate with targeting efficiency and translocation across the membrane thus the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence is primarily responsible for its recognition and binding by srp while positive charges fine tune the srp  signal sequence affinity and targeting to the translocon
