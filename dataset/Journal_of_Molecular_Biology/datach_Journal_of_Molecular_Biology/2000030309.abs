is folding of  lactoglobulin non hierarchic intermediate with native like  sheet and non native  helix edited by c r matthews
the refolding of  lactoglobulin a  barrel protein consisting of  strands  a  i and one major helix is unusual because non native  helices are formed at the beginning of the process we studied the refolding kinetics of bovine  lactoglobulin a at ph  using the stopped flow circular dichroism and manual h h exchange pulse labeling coupled with heteronuclear nmr the protection pattern from the h h exchange of the native state indicated the presence of a stable hydrophobic core consisting of  f  g and  h strands the protection pattern of the kinetic intermediate obtained about one second after initiating the reaction was compared with that of the native state in this relatively late kinetic intermediate which still contains some non native helical structure the disulfide bonded  hairpin made up of  g and  h strands was formed but the rest of the molecule was fluctuating where the non native  helices may reside subsequently the core  sheet extends accompanied by a further  helix to  sheet transition thus the refolding of  lactoglobulin exhibits two elements the critical role of the core  sheet is consistent with the hierarchic mechanism whereas the  helix to  sheet transition suggests the non hierarchic mechanism
