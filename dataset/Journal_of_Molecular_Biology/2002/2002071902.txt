Now that complete genome sequences are available for a variety of organisms, the elucidation of potential gene products function is a central goal in the post-genome era. Domain fusion analysis has been proposed recently to infer the functional association of the component proteins. Here, we took a new approach to the analysis of the structural features of the proteins involved in fusion events. An exhaustive survey of fusion events within 30 completely sequenced genomes and subsequent structure annotations to the component proteins at a SCOP superfamily level with hidden Markov models was carried out. A domain fusion map was then constructed. The results revealed that proteins with the class α/β fold are frequently involved in fusion events, around 86% of the total 676 assigned single-domain fusion pairs including at least one component protein belonging to the α/β fold class. Moreover, the domain fusion map in our work may offer an attractive framework for designing chimeric enzymes following Nature's lead, and may give useful hints for exploring the evolutionary history of proteins.
