Mutation of the glycine 98 residue to arginine in αA-crystallin has been shown to cause presenile cataract in an Indian family. Our earlier study showed that the mutant protein exhibits folding defects that lead to aggregation and inclusion body formation in Escherichia coli. Despite the presence of a normal copy, the pathology is seen in the heterozygous individuals. Formation of mixed oligomers between wild-type and the mutant subunits might be crucial for manifestation of such dominant negative character. We have investigated the role of G98R mutation in αA-crystallin in its structural stability and subunit exchange. G98R αA-crystallin unfolds at lower concentrations of urea compared to wild-type αA-crystallin. The mutant protein is more susceptible to proteolysis than the wild-type protein and transiently populates fragments that are prone to aggregation. Subunit exchange studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer show that the mutant protein forms mixed oligomers with the wild-type protein. The mutant protein is more susceptible to thermal aggregation, whereas mixed oligomer formation leads to a decreased propensity to aggregate. Co-expression of wild-type αA-crystallin with G98R αA-crystallin in E. coli rescues the mutant αA-crystallin from formation of inclusion bodies. These observations may underlie the molecular basis for the presenile onset, not congenital cataract, in spite of severe folding defect and aggregation of the mutant. Our study shows that the mixed oligomers of wild-type and G98R αA-crystallin exhibit properties dominated by those of the mutant protein in structural aspects, oligomeric size, urea-induced unfolding and, more importantly, the chaperone activity, which may provide the molecular basis for presenile cataract formation in affected individuals.
