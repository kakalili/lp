sec   and tram are sequentially adjacent to a nascent viral membrane protein during its er integration
co translational integration of a nascent viral membrane protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane takes place via the translocon we have been studying the early stages of the integration of a double spanning plant viral movement protein to gain insights into how viral membrane proteins are transferred from the hydrophilic interior of the translocon into the hydrophobic environment of the bilayer where the transmembrane tm segments of the viral proteins can diffuse freely photocrosslinking experiments reveal that this integration involves the sequential passage of the tm segments past sec   and translocating chain associating membrane protein tram  each tm segment is first adjacent to sec   and subsequently is adjacent to tram tram crosslinking extends for a long period during nascent chain biogenesis in addition the replacement of the first viral tm segment with a non viral tm sequence still yields nascent chain photo adducts with tram tram therefore appears to be involved in viral membrane protein integration and nascent chain recognition by tram does not appear to rely solely on the tm domains
