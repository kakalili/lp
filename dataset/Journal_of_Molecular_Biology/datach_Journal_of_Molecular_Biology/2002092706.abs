the rna splicing factor asf sf inhibits human topoisomerase i mediated dna relaxation
human topoisomerase i interacts with and phosphorylates the sr family of rna splicing factors including asf sf  and has been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of rna splicing here we present evidence to support the theory that the regulation can go the other way around with the sr proteins controlling topoisomerase i dna activity we demonstrate that the splicing factor asf sf inhibits relaxation by interfering with the dna cleavage and or dna binding steps of human topoisomerase i catalysis the inhibition of relaxation correlated with the ability of various deletion mutants of the two proteins to interact directly suggesting that an interaction between the rs domain of asf sf and a region between amino acid residues      on topoisomerase i accounts for the observed effect consistently phosphorylation of the rs domain with either topoisomerase i or a human cell extract reduced the inhibition of relaxation activity taken together with the previously published studies of the topoisomerase i kinase activity these observations suggest that topoisomerase i activity is shifted from relaxation to kinasing by specific interaction with sr splicing factors
