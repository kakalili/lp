genetic evidence for a novel interaction between transcriptional activator soxs and region  of the   subunit of rna polymerase at class ii soxs dependent promoters in escherichia coli
escherichia coli soxs activates transcription of the genes of the soxrs regulon which provide the cell s defense against oxidative stress in response to this stress soxs is synthesized de novo because the dna binding site of soxs is highly degenerate soxs efficiently activates transcription by the mechanism of prerecruitment in prerecruitment newly synthesized soxs first forms binary complexes with rna polymerase these complexes then scan the chromosome for class i and ii soxs dependent promoters using the specific dna recognition properties of soxs and   to distinguish soxs dependent promoters from the vast excess of sequence equivalent soxboxes that do not reside in promoters previously we determined that soxs interacts with rna polymerase in two ways by making protein  protein interactions with the dna binding determinant of the  subunit and by interacting with   region     r  both  on dna  and  off dna   here we address the question of how soxs and   r coexist at class ii promoters where the binding site for soxs either partially or completely overlaps the    region of the promoter which is usually bound by   r  to do so we created a tri alanine scanning library that covers all of   r  we determined that interactions between   r and the dna in the promoter s    region are required for activation of class i promoters where the binding site lies upstream of the    hexamer but they are not required at class ii promoters in contrast specific three amino acid stretches are required for activation of class i lac and class ii galp  cyclic amp receptor protein dependent promoters we conclude from these data that soxs and   r interact with each other in a novel way at class ii soxs dependent promoters such that the two proteins do not accommodate one another in the    region but instead soxs binding there occludes the binding of   r
