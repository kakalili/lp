spectroscopy and a high resolution crystal structure of tyr  mutants of cyanobacterial phytochrome cph
phytochromes are biliprotein photoreceptors that can be photoswitched between red light absorbing state pr and far red light absorbing state pfr  although three dimensional structures of both states have been reported the photoconversion and intramolecular signaling mechanisms are still unclear here we report uv  vis absorbance fluorescence and cd spectroscopy along with various photochemical parameters of the wild type and y  f y  h and y  s mutants of the cph photosensory module as well as a    resolution crystal structure of the y  f mutant in its pr ground state although y  is conserved we show that the aromatic character but not the hydroxyl group of y  is important for pfr formation the crystal structure of the y  f mutant protein data bank id  zq  reaffirms the zzzssa chromophore configuration and provides a detailed picture of its binding pocket particularly conformational heterogeneity around the chromophore comparison with other phytochrome structures reveals differences in the relative position of the phy phytochrome specific domain and the interaction of the tongue with the extreme n terminus our data support the notion that native phytochromes in their pr state are structurally heterogeneous
