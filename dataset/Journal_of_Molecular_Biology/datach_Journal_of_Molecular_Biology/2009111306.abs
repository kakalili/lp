kinetic advantage of intrinsically disordered proteins in coupled folding  binding process a critical assessment of the  fly casting  mechanism
intrinsically disordered proteins idps are recognized to play important roles in many biological functions such as transcription and translation regulation cellular signal transduction protein phosphorylation and molecular assemblies the coupling of folding with binding through a  fly casting  mechanism has been proposed to account for the fast binding kinetics of idps in this article experimental data from the literature were collated to verify the kinetic advantages of idps while molecular simulations were performed to clarify the origin of the kinetic advantages the phosphorylated kid  kinase inducible domain interacting domain kix complex was used as an example in the simulations by modifying a coarse grained model with a native centric g  like potential we were able to continuously tune the degree of disorder of the phosphorylated kid domain and thus investigate the intrinsic role of chain flexibility in binding kinetics the simulations show that the  fly casting  effect is not only due to the greater capture radii of idps the coupling of folding with binding of idps leads to a significant reduction in binding free energy barrier such a reduction accelerates the binding process although the greater capture radius has been regarded as the main factor in promoting the binding rate of idps we found that this parameter will also lead to the slower translational diffusion of idps when compared with ordered proteins as a result the capture rate of idps was found to be slower than that of ordered proteins the main origin of the faster binding for idps are the fewer encounter times required before the formation of the final binding complex the roles of the interchain native contacts fraction qb and the mass  center distance  r as reaction coordinates are also discussed
