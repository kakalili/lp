heat induced unfolding of neocarzinostatin a small all  protein investigated by small angle x ray scattering edited by m f moody
neocarzinostatin is an all  protein   amino acid residues long with an immunoglobulin like fold its thermal unfolding has been studied by small angle x ray scattering preliminary differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence measurements suggest that the transition is not a simple two state transition the apparent radius of gyration is determined using three different approaches the validity of which is critically assessed using our experimental data as well as a simple two state model similarly each step of data analysis is evaluated and the underlying assumptions plainly stated the existence of at least one intermediate state is formally demonstrated by a singular value decomposition of the set of scattering patterns we assume that the pattern of the solution before the onset of the transition is that of the native protein and that of the solution at the highest temperature is that of the completely unfolded protein given these actually not very restrictive boundary constraints a least squares procedure yields a scattering pattern of the intermediate state however this solution is not unique a whole class of possible solutions is derived by adding to the previous linear combination of the native and completely unfolded states varying the initial conditions of the least squares calculation leads to very similar solutions whatever member of the class is considered the conformation of this intermediate state appears to be weakly structured probably less than the transition state should be according to some proposals finally we tried and used the classical model of three thermodynamically well defined states to account for our data the failure of the simple thermodynamic model suggests that there is more than the single intermediate structure required by singular value decomposition analysis formally there could be several discrete intermediate species at equilibrium or an ensemble of conformations differently populated according to the temperature in the latter case a third state would be a weighted average of all non native and not completely unfolded states of the protein but since the weights change with temperature no meaningful curve is likely to be derived by a global analysis using the simple model of three thermodynamically well defined states
