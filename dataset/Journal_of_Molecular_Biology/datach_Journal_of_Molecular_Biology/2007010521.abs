tetrameric structure of thermostable direct hemolysin from vibrio parahaemolyticus revealed by ultracentrifugation small angle x ray scattering and electron microscopy
the thermostable direct hemolysin tdh is a major virulence factor of vibrio parahaemolyticus we have characterized the conformational properties of tdh by small angle x ray scattering saxs  ultracentrifugation and transmission electron microscopy sedimentation equilibrium and velocity studies revealed that the protein is tetrameric in aqueous solvents the guinier plot derived from saxs data provided a radius of gyration of      the elongated pattern with a shoulder of a pair distance distribution function derived from saxs data suggested the presence of molecules with an anisotropic shape having a maximum diameter of     electron microscopic image analysis of the negatively stained tdh oligomer showed the presence of c symmetric particles with edge and diagonal lengths of    and     respectively shape reconstruction was carried out by ab initio calculations using the saxs data with a c symmetric approximation these results suggested that the tetrameric tdh assumes an oblate structure the hydrodynamic parameters predicted from the ab initio model differed slightly from the experimental values suggesting the presence of flexible segments
