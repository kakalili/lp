engineered oligomerization state of ompf protein through computational design decouples oligomer dissociation from unfolding
biogenesis of  barrel membrane proteins is a complex multistep and as yet incompletely characterized process the bacterial porin family is perhaps the best studied protein family among  barrel membrane proteins that allows diffusion of small solutes across the bacterial outer membrane in this study we have identified residues that contribute significantly to the protein  protein interaction ppi interface between the chains of outer membrane protein f ompf  a trimeric porin using an empirical energy function in conjunction with an evolutionary analysis by replacing these residues through site directed mutagenesis either with energetically favorable residues or substitutions that do not occur in natural bacterial outer membrane proteins we succeeded in engineering ompf mutants with dimeric and monomeric oligomerization states instead of a trimeric oligomerization state moreover our results suggest that the oligomerization of ompf proceeds through a series of interactions involving two distinct regions of the extensive ppi interface two monomers interact to form a dimer through the ppi interface near g  this dimer then interacts with another monomer through the ppi interface near g  to form a trimer we have found that perturbing the ppi interface near g  results in the formation of the monomeric ompf only thermal denaturation of the designed dimeric ompf mutant suggests that oligomer dissociation can be separated from the process of protein unfolding furthermore the conserved site near g  and g  is important for the ppi interface and might provide the essential scaffold for ppis
