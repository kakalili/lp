modulation of dna conformations through the formation of alternative high order hu  dna complexes
hu is an abundant highly conserved protein associated with the bacterial chromosome it belongs to a small class of proteins that includes the eukaryotic proteins tbp sry hmg i and lef i which bind to dna non specifically at the minor groove hu plays important roles as an accessory architectural factor in a variety of bacterial cellular processes such as dna compaction replication transposition recombination and gene regulation in an attempt to unravel the role this protein plays in shaping nucleoid structure we have carried out fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements of hu  dna oligonucleotide complexes both at the ensemble and single pair levels our results provide direct experimental evidence for concerted dna bending by hu and the abrogation of this effect at hu to dna ratios above about one hu dimer per     bp these findings support a model in which a number of hu molecules form an ordered helical scaffold with dna lying in the periphery the abrogation of these nucleosome like structures for high hu to dna ratios suggests a unique role for hu in the dynamic modulation of bacterial nucleoid structure
