mhc  peptide binding is assisted by bound water molecules
water plays an important role in determining the high affinity of epitopes to the class i mhc complex to study the energy and dynamics of water interactions in the complex we performed molecular dynamics simulation of the class i mhc  hla complex bound to the hiv reverse transcriptase epitope ilkepvhgv and in the absence of the epitope each simulation was extended for ns we studied the processes of water penetration in the interface between mhc and peptide and identified  water molecules that stay bound for periods longer than ns in regions previously identified by crystallography these water molecules in the interface perform definite  tasks  contributing to the binding energy hydrogen bond bridges between mhc and peptide and filling empty spaces in the groove which enhance affinity without contributing to epitope specificity we calculate the binding energy for interfacial water molecules and find that there is an overall gain in free energy resulting from the formation of water clusters at the epitope  mhc interface water molecules serving the task of filling empty spaces bind at the interface with a net gain in entropy relative to their entropy in bulk we conclude that water molecules at the interface play the role of active mediators in the mhc  peptide interaction and might be responsible for the large binding affinity of the mhc complex to a large number of epitope sequences
