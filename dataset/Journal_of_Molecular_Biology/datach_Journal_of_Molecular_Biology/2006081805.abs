linker histone h binds to disease associated amyloid like fibrils
alzheimer s disease ad and parkinson s disease pd are the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system these two diseases share a common feature in that a normally soluble peptide amyloid   or protein   synuclein aggregates into an ordered fibrillar structure as well as structural similarities observed between fibrillar aggregates related to these diseases common pathological processes of increased oxidative injury excitotoxicity and altered cell cycle are also evident it was the aim of this study to identify novel interacting proteins to the amyloid like motif and therefore identify common potential pathways between neurodegenerative diseases that share biophysical properties common to classical amyloid fibrils optimal ageing of recombinant proteins to form amyloid like fibrils was determined by electron microscopy congo red birefringement and photo induced cross linking using pull down assays the strongest detected interacting protein to the amyloid like motifs of amyloid    synuclein and lysozyme was identified as histone h  the interaction with the amyloid like motif was confirmed by techniques including surface plasmon resonance and immunohistochemistry histone h is known to be an integral part of chromatin within the nucleus with a primary role of binding dna that enters and exits from the nucleosome and facilitating the shift in equilibrium of chromatin towards a more condensed form however phosphorylated histone h is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and as yet the functional significance of this translocation is unknown this study also found that histone h is localised within the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes from areas affected by disease as well as amyloid plaques supporting the hypothesis that histone h favoured binding to an ordered fibrillar motif we conclude that the binding of histone h to a general amyloid like motif indicates that histone h may play an important common role in diseases associated with amyloid like fibrils
