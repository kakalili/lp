computer modeling of the membrane interaction of fyve domains
fyve domains are membrane targeting domains that are found in proteins involved in endosomal trafficking and signal transduction pathways most fyve domains bind specifically to phosphatidylinositol  phosphate pi  p  a lipid that resides mainly in endosomal membranes though the specific interactions between fyve domains and the headgroup of pi  p have been well characterized principally through structural studies the available experimental structures suggest several different models for fyve membrane association thus the manner in which fyve domains adsorb to the membrane surface remains to be elucidated towards this end recent experiments have shown that fyve domains bind pi  p in the context of phospholipid bilayers and that hydrophobic residues on a conserved loop are able to penetrate the membrane interface in a pi  p dependent manner here the finite difference poisson  boltzmann fdpb method has been used to calculate the energetic interactions of fyve domains with phospholipid membranes based on the computational analysis it is found that   recruitment to membranes is facilitated by non specific electrostatic interactions that occur between basic residues on the domains and acidic phospholipids in the membrane   the energetic analysis can quantitatively differentiate among the modes of membrane association proposed by the experimentally determined structures   fdpb calculations predict energetically feasible models for the membrane associated states of fyve domains   these models are consistent with the observation that conserved hydrophobic residues insert into the membrane interface and   the calculations provide a molecular model for the hydrophobic partitioning binding of pi  p significantly neutralizes positive potential in the region of the hydrophobic residues which acts as an  electrostatic switch  by reducing the energetic barrier for membrane penetration finally the computational results are extended to fyve domains of unknown structure through the construction of high quality homology models for human fyve sequences
