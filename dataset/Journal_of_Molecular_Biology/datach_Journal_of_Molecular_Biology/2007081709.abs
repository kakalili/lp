high resolution electron microscopy of helical specimens a fresh look at tobacco mosaic virus
the treatment of helical objects as a string of single particles has become an established technique to resolve their three dimensional  d structure using electron cryo microscopy it can be applied to a wide range of helical particles such as viruses microtubules and helical filaments we have made improvements to this approach using tobacco mosaic virus tmv as a test specimen and obtained a map from     asymmetric units at a resolution better than    this was made possible by performing a full correction of the contrast transfer function of the microscope alignment of helical segments was helped by constraints derived from the helical symmetry of the virus furthermore symmetrization was implemented by multiple inclusions of symmetry related views in the d reconstruction we used the density map to build an atomic model of tmv the model was refined using a real space refinement strategy that accommodates multiple conformers the atomic model shows significant deviations from the deposited model for the helical form of tmv at the lower radius region residues  to    this region appears more ordered with well defined secondary structure compared with the earlier helical structure the rna phosphate backbone is sandwiched between two arginine side chains stabilizing the interaction between rna and coat protein a cluster of two or three carboxylates is buried in a hydrophobic environment isolating it from neighboring subunits these carboxylates may represent the so called caspar carboxylates that form a metastable switch for viral disassembly overall the observed differences suggest that the new model represents a different more stable state of the virus compared with the earlier published model
