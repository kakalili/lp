importance of two atp binding sites for oligomerization atpase activity and chaperone function of mitochondrial hsp  protein edited by m yaniv
the yeast mitochondrial chaperone hsp  a homologue of yeast cytosolic hsp  and bacterial clpb is required for maintenance of mitochondrial functions under heat stress here hsp  was purified to homogeneity and shown to form a homo hexameric complex with an apparent molecular mass of approximately   kda in an atp dependent manner analysis of its atpase activity reveals that the observed positive cooperativity effect depends both on hsp  and atp concentration site directed mutagenesis of the two putative hsp  nucleotide binding domains suggest that the first nucleotide binding domain is responsible for atp hydrolysis and the second one for protein oligomerization studies on the chaperone activity of hsp  show that its cooperation with the mitochondrial hsp  system consisting of ssc p mdj p and mge p is needed for the efficient reactivation of substrate proteins these studies also suggest that the oligomerization but not the hsp  atpase activity is essential for its chaperone activity
