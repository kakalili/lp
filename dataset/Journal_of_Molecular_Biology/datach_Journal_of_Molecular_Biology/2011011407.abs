effects of mutations f a and a v in the fingers subdomain of hiv  reverse transcriptase on the translocational equilibrium
changes of the translocational status of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  reverse transcriptase rt can affect susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs the pyrophosphate analogue phosphonoformic acid pfa binds specifically to and traps the pretranslocated complex of hiv  rt while nucleotide competing rt inhibitors trap the posttranslocated conformation here we attempted to assess the potential role of residues in the fingers subdomain as determinants of polymerase translocation the fingers can exist in open and closed conformations however the relationship between such conformational changes and the translocation status of hiv  rt remains elusive we focused on substitution f a and the neighboring a v that is frequently associated with drug resistance conferring mutations the proximity of these residues to the nucleic acid substrate suggested a possible role in translocation for these amino acid changes we employed site specific footprinting binding assays and dna synthesis inhibition experiments to study f a and a v alone and against a background of known drug resistance mutations we demonstrate that f a causes a strong bias to the posttranslocational state while a v shows a subtle bias toward pretranslocation regardless of the mutational background increases in the population of pretranslocated complexes were accompanied by increases in pfa activity while f a is literally resistant to pfa our data shed light on equilibria between pre and posttranslocated complexes with the fingers subdomain in its open or closed conformations we propose that a binary pretranslocated complex in a closed conformation is stabilized with a v and destabilized with f a
