the malignant brain tumor repeats of human scml bind to peptides containing monomethylated lysine
scml  sex comb on midleg like  is a constituent of the polycomb repressive complex  a large multiprotein assembly required for the repression of developmental control genes it contains two mbt malignant brain tumor repeats the mbt is a protein module structurally similar to domains that bind to methylated histones we have used nmr spectroscopy to examine the binding specificity of these repeats our data show that they preferentially bind histone peptides monomethylated at lysine residues with no apparent sequence specificity the crystal structure of the complex between the protein and monomethyllysine reveals that the modified amino acid binds to an aromatic rich pocket at one end of the  barrel of the second repeat
