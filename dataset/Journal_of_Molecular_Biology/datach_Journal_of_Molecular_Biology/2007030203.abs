flexibility and variability of timp binding x ray structure of the complex between collagenase  mmp  and timp
the excessive activity of matrix metalloproteinases mmps contributes to pathological processes such as arthritis tumor growth and metastasis if not balanced by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases timps  in arthritis the destruction of fibrillar type ii collagen is one of the hallmarks with mmp  collagenase  and mmp   collagenase  being identified as key players in arthritic cartilage mmp   furthermore has been found in highly metastatic tumors we have solved the     crystal structure of the complex between the catalytic domain of human mmp   cdmmp   and bovine timp  the overall structure resembles our previously determined mt mmp timp  complex in that the wedge shaped timp  inserts with its edge into the entire mmp  active site cleft however the inhibitor is according to a relative rotation of     oriented differently relative to the proteinase upon timp binding the catalytic zinc the zinc ligating side chains the enclosing mmp loop and the s   wall forming segment move significantly and in concert relative to the rest of the cognate mmp and the active site cleft constricts slightly probably allowing a more favourable interaction between the cys timp  amino group of the inhibitor and the catalytic zinc ion of the enzyme thus this structure supports the view that the central n terminal timp segment essentially defines the relative positioning of the timp while the flanking edge loops determine the relative orientation depending on the individual target mmp
