base coupling in sequence specific site recognition by the ets domain of murine pu
the ets domain of murine pu  tolerates a large number of dna cognates bearing a central consensus   ggaa   that is flanked by a diverse combination of bases on both sides previous attempts to define the sequence selectivity of this dna binding domain by combinatorial methods have not successfully predicted observed patterns among in vivo promoter sequences in the genome and have led to the hypothesis that energetic coupling occurs among the bases in the flanking sequences to test this hypothesis we determined using thermodynamic cycles the complex stabilities and base coupling energies of the pu  ets domain for a set of  cognate variants based on the  b site of the ig   enhancer    aataaaaggaagtgaaaccaa    in which flanking sequences up to three bases upstream and or two bases downstream of the core consensus are substituted we observed that both cooperative and anticooperative coupling occurs commonly among the flanking sequences at all the positions investigated this phenomenon extends at least three bases in the   side and is at least on our experimental data due exclusively to pairwise interactions between the flanking bases and not changes in the local environment of the dna groove floor energetic coupling also occurs between the flanking sides across the core consensus suggesting long range conformational effects along the dna target and or in the protein our data provide an energetic explanation for the pattern of flanking bases observed among in vivo promoter sequences and reconcile the apparent discrepancies raised by the combinatorial experiments we also discuss the significance of base coupling in light of an indirect readout mechanism in ets dna site recognition
