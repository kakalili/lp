human polynucleotide phosphorylase hpnpase is localized in mitochondria
the human gene encoding a polynucleotide phosphorylase hpnpase has been recently identified as strongly up regulated in two processes leading to irreversible arrest of cell division progeroid senescence and terminal differentiation here we demonstrate that the hpnpase is localized in mitochondria our finding suggests the involvement of mitochondrial rna metabolism in cellular senescence
