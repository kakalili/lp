structural and functional studies of  carboxyglutamic acid domains of factor viia and activated protein c role of magnesium at physiological calcium
crystal structures of factor f viia soluble tissue factor tf  obtained under high mg   mm mg  mm ca   have three of seven ca  sites in the  carboxyglutamic acid gla domain replaced by mg  at positions    and  we now report structures under low mg    mm mg  mm ca  as well as under high ca   mm mg   mm ca   under low mg  four ca  and three mg  occupy the same positions as in high mg  structures conversely under low mg  reexamination of the structure of gla domain of activated protein c apc complexed with soluble endothelial protein c receptor sepcr has position  occupied by ca  and positions  and  by mg  nonetheless in direct binding experiments mg  replaced three ca  sites in the unliganded protein c or apc further the high ca  condition was necessary to replace mg in the fviia soluble tf structure in biological studies mg  enhanced phospholipid binding to fviia and apc at physiological ca  additionally mg  potentiated phospholipid dependent activations of fix and fx by fviia tf and inactivation of activated factor v by apc since apc and fviia bind to sepcr involving similar interactions we conclude that under the low mg  condition sepcr binding to apc gla or fviia gla replaces mg by ca with an attendant conformational change in the gla domain  loop moreover since phospholipid and sepcr bind to fviia or apc via the  loop we predict that phospholipid binding also induces the functional ca conformation in this loop cumulatively the data illustrate that mg  and ca  act in concert to promote coagulation and anticoagulation
