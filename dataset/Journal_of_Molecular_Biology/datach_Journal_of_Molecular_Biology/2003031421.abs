flexibility of  helices results of a statistical analysis of database protein structures
helices stand out as common and relatively invariant secondary structural elements of proteins however   helices are not rigid bodies and their deformations can be significant in protein function e g coiled coils  to quantify the flexibility of  helices we have performed a structural principal component analysis of helices of different lengths from a representative set of protein folds in the protein data bank we find three dominant modes of flexibility two degenerate bend modes and one twist mode the data are consistent with independent gaussian distributions for each mode the mode eigenvalues which measure flexibility follow simple scaling forms as a function of helix length the dominant bend and twist modes and their harmonics are reproduced by a simple spring model which incorporates hydrogen bonding and excluded volume as an application we examine the amount of bend and twist in helices making up all coiled coil proteins in scop incorporation of  helix flexibility into structure refinement and design is discussed
