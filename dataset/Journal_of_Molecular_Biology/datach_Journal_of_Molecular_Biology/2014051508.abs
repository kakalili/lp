the histone h tail regulates the conformation of the atp binding pocket in the snf h chromatin remodeling enzyme
the chromatin remodeling complex acf helps establish the appropriate nucleosome spacing for generating repressed chromatin states acf activity is stimulated by two defining features of the nucleosomal substrate a basic patch on the histone h n terminal tail and the specific length of flanking dna however the mechanisms by which these two substrate cues function in the acf remodeling reaction is not well understood using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with spin labeled atp analogs to probe the structure of the atp active site under physiological solution conditions we identify a closed state of the atp binding pocket that correlates with atpase activity we find that the h tail promotes pocket closure we further show that atpase stimulation by the h tail does not require a specific structure connecting the h tail and the globular domain in the case of many dna helicases closure of the atp binding pocket is regulated by specific dna substrates pocket closure by the h tail may analogously provide a mechanism to directly couple substrate recognition to activity surprisingly the flanking dna which also stimulates atp hydrolysis does not promote pocket closure suggesting that the h tail and flanking dna may be recognized in different reaction steps
