probing catalytically essential domain orientation in histidine kinase envz by targeted disulfide crosslinking
envz a dimeric transmembrane histidine kinase belongs to the family of his asp phosphorelay signal transduction systems the cytoplasmic kinase domain of envz can be dissected into two independently functioning domains a and b whose nmr solution structures have been individually determined here we examined the topological arrangement of these two domains in the envz dimer a structure that is key to understanding the mechanism underlying the autophosphorylation activity of the kinase a series of cysteine substitution mutants were constructed to test the feasibility of chemical crosslinking between the two domains these crosslinking data demonstrate that helix i of domain a of one subunit in the envzc dimer is in close proximity to domain b of the other subunit in the same dimer while helix ii of domain a of one subunit interacts with domain b of the same subunit in the envzc dimer this is the first demonstration of the topological arrangement between the central dimerization domain containing the active center his residues domain a and the atp binding catalysis assisting domain domain b in a class i histidine kinase
