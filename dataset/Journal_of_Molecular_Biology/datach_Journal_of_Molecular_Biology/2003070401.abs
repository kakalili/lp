consensus structural features of purified bacterial tatabc complexes
the twin arginine translocation tat system transports folded proteins across bacterial plasma membranes and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane here we investigate the composition and structural organization of three different purified tat complexes from escherichia coli salmonella typhimurium and agrobacterium tumefaciens first we demonstrate the functional activity of these tat systems in vivo since expression of the tatabc operons from s typhimurium or a tumefaciens in an e coli tat null mutant strain resulted in efficient tat dependent export of an e coli cofactor containing substrate tmao reductase the three isolated affinity tagged tat complexes comprised tata tatb and tatc in each case demonstrating a strong interaction between these three subunits single particle electron microscopy studies of all three complexes revealed approximately oval shaped asymmetric particles with maximal dimensions up to  nm a common feature is a number of stain excluding densities surrounding more or less central pools of stain suggesting protein lined pores or cavities the characteristics of size variation among the particles suggest a modular form of assembly and or the recruitment of varying numbers of tatbc tata units despite low levels of sequence homology the combined data indicate structural and functional conservation in the tat systems of these three bacterial species
