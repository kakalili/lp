extensive methylation of a part of the cpg island located      kbp upstream to the chicken alpha globin gene cluster may contribute to silencing the globin genes in non erythroid cells edited by m yaniv
here we show that in the chicken genome the domain of  globin genes is preceded by a cpg island of which the downstream part     kbp is heavily methylated in lymphoid cells it is either non methylated or undermethylated in erythroid cells recombinant plasmids were constructed with the corresponding dna fragment called  ucpg   placed upstream to a reporter cat gene expressed from the promoter of the  d chicken globin gene selective methylation of cpg dinucleotides within the ucpg fragment suppressed fivefold the expression of the cat gene when neither this gene itself nor the  d promoter were methylated methylation of cpg dinucleotides within the  d gene promoter did not modify the suppression effect exerted by methylated ucpg we interpret these results within the frame of the hypothesis postulating that methylation of the upstream cpg island of the chicken  globin gene domain may play an essential role in silencing the  globin genes in non erythroid cells
