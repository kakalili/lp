dna binding specificity of the replication initiator protein dnaa from helicobacter pylori
the key protein in the initiation of helicobacter pylori chromosome replication dnaa has been characterized the amount of the dnaa protein was estimated to be approximately   molecules per single cell a large part of the protein was found in the inner membrane the h pylori dnaa protein has been analysed using in vitro gel retardation assay and surface plasmon resonance spr  as well as in silico comparative computer modeling studies dnaa binds a single dnaa box as a monomer while binding to the fragment containing several dnaa box motifs the oric region leads to the formation of high molecular mass nucleoprotein complexes in comparison with the escherichia coli dnaa the h pylori dnaa protein exhibits lower dna binding specificity however it prefers oric over non box dna fragments as determined by gel retardation techniques the h pylori dnaa binds with a moderate level of affinity to its origin of replication  nm  comparative computer modelling showed that there are nine residues within the binding domain which are possible determinants of the reduced h pylori dnaa specificity of these the most interesting is probably the triad ptl all three residues show significant divergence from the consensus and thr  is the most divergent residue of all
