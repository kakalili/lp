functional characterization of fdx  evidence for an evolutionary relationship between p  type and isc type ferredoxins
ferredoxins are ubiquitous proteins with electron transfer activity involved in a variety of biological processes in this work we investigated the characteristics and function of fdx from sorangium cellulosum so ce  by using a combination of bioinformatics and of biochemical biophysical approaches we were able to experimentally confirm a role of fdx in the iron  sulfur cluster biosynthesis by in vitro reduction studies with cluster loaded so ce  iscu and by transfer studies of the cluster from the latter protein to apo aconitase a moreover we found that fdx can replace mammalian adrenodoxin in supporting the activity of bovine cyp a  this makes s cellulosum fdx the first prokaryotic ferredoxin reported to functionally interact with this mammalian enzyme although the interaction with cyp a is non physiological this is  to the best of our knowledge  the first study to experimentally prove the activity of a postulated isc type ferredoxin in both the isc assembly and a cytochrome p  system this proves that a single ferredoxin can be structurally able to provide electrons to both cytochromes p  and iscu and thus support different biochemical processes combining this finding with phylogenetic and evolutionary trace analyses led us to propose the evolution of eukaryotic mitochondrial p  type ferredoxins and isc type ferredoxins from a common prokaryotic isc type ancestor
