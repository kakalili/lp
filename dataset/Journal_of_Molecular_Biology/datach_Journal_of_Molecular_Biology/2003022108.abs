interaction of t asia with its target sites in the rna polymerase   subunit leads to distinct and opposite effects on transcription
bacteriophage t asia is a homodimeric protein that orchestrates a switch from the host and early viral transcription to middle viral transcription by binding to the   subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase holoenzyme e   and preventing promoter complex formation on most e coli and early t promoters in addition e  asia but not e   is a substrate of transcription activation by t encoded dna binding protein mota a co activator of transcription from middle viral promoters the molecular determinants of    asia interaction necessary for transcription inhibition reside in the   conserved region   which recognizes the    promoter consensus element the molecular determinants of    asia interaction necessary for mota dependent transcription activation have not been identified here we show that in the absence of   region   asia interacts with   conserved region   and activates transcription in a mota independent manner further we show that the asia dimer must dissociate to interact with either region   or region   of    we propose that mota may co activate transcription by restricting asia binding to   region
