structural domains in the type iii restriction endonuclease ecop i characterization by limited proteolysis mass spectrometry and insertional mutagenesis
the type iii restriction endonuclease ecop i forms a hetero oligomeric enzyme complex that consists of two modification mod subunits and two restriction res subunits structural data on type iii restriction enzymes in general are lacking because of their remarkable size of more than   kda and the laborious and low yield protein purification procedures we took advantage of the ecop i overexpressing vector pqep  and affinity chromatography to generate a quantity of ecop i high enough for comprehensive proteolytic digestion studies and analyses of the proteolytic fragments by mass spectrometry we show here that in the presence of specific dna the entire mod subunit is protected from trypsin digestion whereas in the absence of dna stable protein domains of the mod subunit were not detected in contrast the res subunit is comprised of two trypsin resistant domains of approximately     kda and     kda respectively the cofactor atp and the presence of dna either specific or unspecific are important stabilizers of the res subunit the large n terminal domain of res contains numerous functional motifs that are predicted to be involved in atp binding and hydrolysis and or dna translocation the c terminal small domain harbours the catalytic center based on our data we conclude that both structural res domains are connected by a flexible linker region that spans  amino acid residues to confirm this conclusion we have investigated several ecop i enzyme mutants obtained by insertion mutagenesis in and around the predicted linker region within the res subunit all mutants tolerated the genetic manipulation and did not display loss of function or alteration of the dna cleavage position
