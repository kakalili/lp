widespread and extensive editing of mitochondrial mrnas in dinoflagellates
we report evidence of extensive substitutional editing of mitochondrial mrnas in the dinoflagellate species pfiesteria piscicida prorocentrum minimum and crypthecodinium cohnii based on a comparison of genomic and corresponding cdna sequences determined for two mitochondrial dna encoded genes cox  cytochrome oxidase subunit  and cob apocytochrome b  in the cox mrna we identify  substitutions at  sites in  codons whereas in cob mrna we infer  editing events at  sites in  codons editing which takes place in distinct clusters changes    of the total sequence occurs predominantly at first and second positions of codons and involves mostly but not exclusively a  g    u  c    and c  u    substitutions in all but four of the   cases editing changes the identity of the specified amino acid at   cox  and   cob sites the same nucleotide change is observed at the same position in at least two of the species investigated at about one third of the sites editing results in an amino acid change that increases similarity between the dinoflagellate cox and cob sequences and their homologs in other organisms presumably editing at these sites is of particular functional significance overall about half of the editing events either maintain or increase similarity between the dinoflagellate protein sequences and their non dinoflagellate homologs while a further one third of the alterations are  dinoflagellate specific   i e they involve a change to an amino acid residue selectively conserved in at least two of the dinoflagellate species at a given position  the nature pattern and phylogenetic distribution of the inferred edits implies either that more than one type of previously described editing process operates on a given transcript in dinoflagellate mitochondria or that a mechanistically unique type of mitochondrial mrna editing has evolved within the dinoflagellate lineage
