structure based redesign of the binding specificity of anti apoptotic bcl xl
many native proteins are multi specific and interact with numerous partners which can confound analysis of their functions protein design provides a potential route to generating synthetic variants of native proteins with more selective binding profiles redesigned proteins could be used as research tools diagnostics or therapeutics in this work we used a library screening approach to reengineer the multi specific anti apoptotic protein bcl xl to remove its interactions with many of its binding partners making it a high affinity and selective binder of the bh region of pro apoptotic protein bad to overcome the enormity of the potential bcl xl sequence space we developed and applied a computational experimental framework that used protein structure information to generate focused combinatorial libraries sequence features were identified using structure based modeling and an optimization algorithm based on integer programming was used to select degenerate codons that maximally covered these features a constraint on library size was used to ensure thorough sampling using yeast surface display to screen a designed library of bcl xl variants we successfully identified a protein with    fold improvement in binding specificity for the bh region of bad over the bh region of bim although negative design was targeted only against the bh region of bim the best redesigned protein was globally specific against binding to  other peptides corresponding to native bh motifs our design framework demonstrates an efficient route to highly specific protein binders and may readily be adapted for application to other design problems
