the ribonuclease h activity of the reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency viruses type  and type  is affected by the thumb subdomain of the small protein subunits edited by j karn
retroviral reverse transcriptases rts have both dna polymerase and ribonuclease h rnase h activities the rts of hiv  and hiv  are heterodimers of p  p  and p  p  subunits respectively the smaller subunit lacks the c terminal segment of the larger subunit which is the rnase h domain  the structure of the dna polymerase domain of hiv  rt resembles a right hand with fingers palm and thumb subdomains  linked to the rnase h domain via the connection subdomain the rnase h activity of the rod strain of hiv  rt is about tenfold lower than that of hiv  rt while the dna polymerase activity of these rts is similar a chimeric rt in which residues      which constitute a small part of the palm and the entire thumb and connection subdomains of the rod strain of hiv  rt were replaced by the corresponding segment from hiv  rt has an rnase h activity as high as hiv  rt despite the fact that the rnase h domain is derived from hiv  rt we analyzed the rnase h activity of wild type hiv  rt from the d   strain and compared it with this activity of the rt from the rod strain of hiv  and hiv  rt the level of this activity of both hiv  rt strains was low suggesting that low rnase h activity is a general property of hiv  isolates the in vitro rnase h digestion pattern of the three wild type rts was indistinguishable despite the difference in the level of rnase h activity we constructed new chimeric hiv  hiv  rts in which protein segments and or subunits were exchanged the dna polymerase activity of the parental hiv  and hiv  rts was similar as expected the specific activity of the polymerases of all the hybrid rts were also similar however the rnase h specific activity of the chimeric rts was either high like hiv  rt or low like hiv  rt  the origin of the thumb subdomain in the small subunit of the chimeric rts residues      determines the level of the rnase h activity the strand transfer activity of the chimeric rts is also affected by the thumb subdomain of the small subunit transfer was much more efficient if this subdomain was derived from hiv  rt the data can be explained from the three dimensional structure of hiv  rt the thumb of the smaller subunit contacts the rnase h domain it is through these contacts that the thumb affects the level of the rnase h activity of rt
