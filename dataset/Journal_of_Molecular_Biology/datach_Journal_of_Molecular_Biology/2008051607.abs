steric zipper of the amyloid fibrils formed by residues      of the syrian hamster prion protein
we report the results of atomic force microscopy fourier transform infrared spectroscopy solid state nuclear magnetic resonance and molecular dynamics md calculations for amyloid fibrils formed by residues      of the syrian hamster prion protein h  our data reveal that h fibrils contain no more than two  sheet layers the peptide strands of h fibrils are antiparallel with the a  residues aligned to form a linear chain in the direction of the fibril axis the molecular structure of the h fibrils which adopts the motif of steric zipper is highly uniform in the region of the palindrome sequence agaaaaga the closest distance between the two adjacent  sheet layers is found to be about    the structural features of the molecular model of h fibrils obtained by md simulations are consistent with the experimental results overall our solid state nmr and md simulation data indicate that a steric zipper which was first observed in the crystals of fibril forming peptides can be formed in h fibrils near the region of the palindrome sequence
