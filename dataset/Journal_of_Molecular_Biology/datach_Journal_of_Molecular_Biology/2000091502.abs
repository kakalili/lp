a chemical phylogeny of group i introns based upon interference mapping of a bacterial ribozyme edited by d draper
despite its small size the   nt group i intron from azoarcus trnaile is an exceptionally stable self splicing rna this ic class intron retains the conserved secondary structural elements common to group i ribozymes but lacks several peripheral helices these features make it an ideal system to establish the conserved chemical basis of group i intron activity we collected nucleotide analog interference mapping naim data of the azoarcus intron using  analogs that modified the phosphate backbone the ribose sugar or the purine base functional groups in conjunction with a complete interference set collected on the tetrahymena group i intron ic class  these data define a  chemical phylogeny  of functional groups that are important for the activity of both introns and that may be common chemical features of group i intron catalysts the data identify the functional moieties most likely to play a conserved role as ligands for catalytic metal ions the substrate helix and the guanosine cofactor these include backbone functional groups whose nucleotide identity is not conserved and hence are difficult to identify by standard phylogenetic sequence comparisons the data suggest that both introns utilize an equivalent set of long range tertiary interactions for   splice site selection between the p substrate helix and its receptor in the j  asymmetric bulge as well as an equivalent set of   oh groups for p helix docking into most of the single stranded segment j   however the azoarcus intron appears to make an alternative set of interactions at the base of the p helix and at the   end of the j   extensive differences were observed within the intron peripheral domains particularly in p and p where the azoarcus data strongly support the proposed formation of a tetraloop tetraloop receptor interaction this chemical phylogeny for group i intron catalysis helps to refine structural models of the rna active site and identifies functional groups that should be carefully investigated for their role in transition state stabilization
