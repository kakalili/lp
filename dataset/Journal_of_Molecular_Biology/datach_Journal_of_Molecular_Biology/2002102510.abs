the structure of an ff domain from human hypa fbp
the ff domain is a  amino acid residue phosphopeptide binding module found in a variety of eukaryotic proteins including the transcription elongation factor ca   the splicing factor prp  and p  rhogap we have determined the structure of an ff domain from hypa fbp  the domain is composed of three  helices arranged in an orthogonal bundle with a   helix in the loop between the second and third  helices the structure differs from those of other phosphopeptide binding domains and represents a novel phosphopeptide binding fold
