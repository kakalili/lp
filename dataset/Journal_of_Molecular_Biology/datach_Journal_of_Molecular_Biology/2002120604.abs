fluorescently labelled guanine nucleotide binding proteins to analyse elementary steps of gap catalysed reactions
downregulation of small guanine nucleotide binding proteins gnbps requires the interaction with their corresponding gtpase activating proteins gaps  which increase the slow intrinsic gtpase reaction by several orders of magnitude on the basis of the structure of h ras in complex with the catalytic domain of p  gap we have developed a set of site specifically labelled ras variants one of which turned out to be particularly sensitive for studying the interaction with ras specific gaps this specific fluorescent reporter group and the use of manganese to increase the rate of the chemical reaction step allowed us to identify differences in the rate limiting step of either the gap   or nf   catalyzed reaction the assay was also applied to study the interaction of the ras related protein rap b with rap gap for which no detailed kinetic analysis was available single turnover experiments of this reaction show that the low affinity of the complex   m is due to a slow association rate as well as a fast dissociation rate rapgap promotes alfx binding to rap b even though it does not contain a catalytic arginine the rate limiting step of the rapgap catalysed reaction is release of inorganic phosphate which is about five times slower than the chemical cleavage step our data reveal marked differences in gap target interactions even between closely related systems and suggest that the fluorescent reporter group method might be generally applicable to many other gnbps and their cognate gaps
