protein protein interaction among hnrnps shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm edited by j karn
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins hnrnps are involved in several rna related biological processes such as transcription pre mrna processing mature mrna transport to the cytoplasm and translation about  major hnrnps from a to u are known among them hnrnp a d e i and k are known to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm hnrnp e has been seen to stabilize  globin mrna and to enhance polioviral mrna translation hnrnp k modulates transcription and translation of some mrnas hnrnp i and its homologue hnrnp l have been suggested to enhance translation of some ires dependent mrnas in order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the biological functions of hnrnps we investigated protein protein interactions of six hnrnps hnrnp a  c  e  i k and l using the yeast two hybrid system and in vitro co precipitation assays all of the hnrnps tested exerted homomeric interactions and hnrnp e  i k and l interacted with each other in the case of hnrnp e and hnrnp k the n terminal half of the proteins containing two kh k homologous domains were required for protein protein interaction and the second quarter of hnrnp i and hnrnp l containing rrm  rna recognition motif  was essential for protein protein interaction hnrnp a and c did not form complexes with other hnrnps in our assay systems this suggests that the hnrnps could fall into two groups one group including hnrnp a and c  involved in hnrnp core complex formation and another group including hnrnp e  i k and l involved in a variety of rna related biological processes different combinations of the proteins of the second group may facilitate different biological processes in conjunction with other factors
