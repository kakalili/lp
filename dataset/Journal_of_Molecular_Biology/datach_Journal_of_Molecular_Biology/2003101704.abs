conversion of wild type p  core domain into a conformation that mimics a hot spot mutant
the wild type p  protein can be driven into a conformation corresponding to that adopted by structural mutant forms by heterodimerization with a mutant subunit to seek partially folded states of the wild type p  core domain p c we used high hydrostatic pressure hp and subzero temperatures aggregation of the protein was observed in parallel with its pressure denaturation at  and   c however when hp experiments were performed at   c the extent of denaturation and aggregation was significantly less pronounced on the other hand subzero temperatures under pressure led to cold denaturation and yielded a non aggregated alternative conformation of p c nuclear magnetic resonance  h n nmr data showed that the alternative p c conformation resembled that of the hot spot oncogenic mutant r  q this alternative state was as susceptible to denaturation and aggregation as the mutant r  q when subjected to hp at   c together these data demonstrate that wild type p c adopts an alternative conformation with a mutant like stability consistent with the dominant negative effect caused by many mutants this alternative conformation is likely related to inactive forms that appear in vivo usually driven by interaction with mutant proteins therefore it can be a valuable target in the search for ways to interfere with protein misfolding and hence to prevent tumor development
