role of the non template strand of the elongation bubble in intrinsic transcription termination
intrinsic transcription terminators of escherichia coli and other bacteria consisting primarily of an rna hairpin preceding a terminal uridine rich rna segment suffice to dissociate the otherwise stable elongation complex of core rna polymerase the essential functions of the hairpin and u rich segments have been established although the precise mechanism of termination is unknown we identify another element of the terminator namely the non template dna strand in the region of the terminal transcription bubble failure of the terminal bubble to rewind through complementary base pairing strongly reduces the efficiency of terminator function suggesting that the natural pathway of termination consists of coupled rewinding of the dna template and unwinding of the rna dna hybrid at the site of release
