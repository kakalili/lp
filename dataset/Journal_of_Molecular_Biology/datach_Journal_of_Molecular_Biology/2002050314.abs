fis modulates the kinetics of successive interactions of rna polymerase with the core and upstream regions of the tyrt promoter
we have applied laser uv photo footprinting to characterise kinetically complexes involving the activator protein fis rna polymerase and the tyrt promoter of escherichia coli fis photo footprints strongly to three binding sites upstream of the core promoter the polymerase photo footprints in the near consensus    hexamer on the non template strand of dna in a fashion similar to that of stable complexes involving the lacuv promoter the kinetics of the interactions of polymerase alone with the tyrt promoter differ from those observed previously at the lacuv promoter in the absence of fis we observe an upstream polymerase induced signal at    within fis site iii that occurs subsequent to changes in the core promoter region and is strongly dependent on negative supercoiling these observations support the proposal that the upstream region of the promoter is wrapped around the polymerase we propose that the wrapped dna allows the polymerase to overcome at least in part the barrier to dna untwisting imparted by the g c rich discriminator we further suggest that fis plays a similar role and may facilitate polymerase escape
