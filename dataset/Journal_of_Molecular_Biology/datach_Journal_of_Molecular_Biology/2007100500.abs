crystal structure of the radical sam enzyme catalyzing tricyclic modified base formation in trna
wyosine and its derivatives such as wybutosine found in eukaryotic and archaeal trnas are tricyclic hypermodified nucleosides in eukaryotes wybutosine exists exclusively in position     adjacent to the anticodon of trnaphe where it ensures correct translation by stabilizing the codon anticodon base pairing during the ribosomal decoding process recent studies revealed that the wyosine biosynthetic pathway consists of multistep enzymatic reactions starting from a guanosine residue among these steps tyw catalyzes the second step to form the tricyclic ring structure by cyclizing n methylguanosine in this study we solved the crystal structure of tyw from methanocaldococcus jannaschii at     resolution tyw assumes an incomplete tim barrel with     topology which closely resembles the reported structures of radical sam enzymes hence tyw was considered to catalyze the cyclization reaction by utilizing the radical intermediate comparison with other radical sam enzymes allowed us to build a model structure complexed with s adenosylmethionine and two  fe s clusters mutational analyses in yeast supported the validity of this complex model structure which provides a structural insight into the radical reaction involving two  fe s clusters to create a complex tricyclic base
