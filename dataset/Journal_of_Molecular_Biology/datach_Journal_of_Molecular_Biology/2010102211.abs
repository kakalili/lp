conserved hydrophobic clusters on the surface of the caf a usher c terminal domain are important for f antigen assembly
the outer membrane usher protein caf a of the plague pathogen yersinia pestis is responsible for the assembly of a major surface antigen the f capsule the f capsule is mainly formed by thin linear polymers of caf  capsular antigen fraction  protein subunits the caf a usher promotes polymerization of subunits and secretion of growing polymers to the cell surface the usher monomer    aa    kda consists of a large transmembrane  barrel that forms a secretion channel and three soluble domains the periplasmic n terminal domain binds chaperone  subunit complexes supplying new subunits for the growing fiber the middle domain which is structurally similar to caf and other fimbrial subunits serves as a plug that regulates the permeability of the usher here we describe the identification characterization and crystal structure of the caf a usher c terminal domain caf ac  caf ac is shown to be a periplasmic domain with a seven stranded  barrel fold analysis of c terminal truncation mutants of caf a demonstrated that the presence of caf ac is crucial for the function of the usher in vivo but that it is not required for the initial binding of chaperone  subunit complexes to the usher two clusters of conserved hydrophobic residues on the surface of caf ac were found to be essential for the efficient assembly of surface polymers these clusters are conserved between the fgl family and the fgs family of chaperone  usher systems
