structural effects of cofilin on longitudinal contacts in f actin
structural effects of yeast cofilin on skeletal muscle and yeast actin were examined in solution cofilin binding to native actin was non cooperative and saturated at a   molar ratio with kd     m for both caatp  g actin and f actin cofilin binding enhanced the fluorescence of dansyl ethylenediamine ded attached to gln  on the dnase i binding loop of skeletal muscle f actin and decreased the fluorescence of aedans at cys  on yeast q c c  s mutant f actin however cofilin had no effect on the spectral properties of ded or aedans on caatp  g actin fluorescence energy transfer fret from tryptophan residues to ded at gln  on skeletal muscle actin and to aedans at cys  on yeast q c c  s actin was decreased by cofilin binding to f but not to g actin cofilin inhibited strongly the rate of interprotomer disulfide cross linking of cys  to cys  on yeast q c mutant f actin binding of cofilin enhanced excimer formation between pyrene probes attached to cys  and cys  on q c f actin these results indicate that cofilin alters the interface between subdomains  and  and shifts the dnase i binding loop away from subdomain  of an adjacent actin protomer cofilin reduced fret from tryptophan residues to  azido  nitrophenyl putrescine anp at gln  in skeletal muscle f but not in g actin however following the interprotomer cross linking of gln  to cys  in f actin by anp cofilin binding did not change fret from the tryptophan residues to anp this suggests that cofilin binding and the conformational effect on f actin are not coupled tightly overall this study provides solution evidence for the weakening of longitudinal subdomain   contacts in f actin by cofilin
