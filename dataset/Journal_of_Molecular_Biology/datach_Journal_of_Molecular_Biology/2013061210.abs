combined micrococcal nuclease and exonuclease iii digestion reveals precise positions of the nucleosome core linker junctions implications for high resolution nucleosome mapping
micrococcal nuclease mnase is extensively used in genome wide mapping of nucleosomes but its preference for at rich dna leads to errors in establishing precise positions of nucleosomes here we show that the mnase digestion of nucleosomes assembled on a strong nucleosome positioning sequence widom s clone   releases nucleosome cores whose sizes are strongly affected by the linker dna sequence our experiments produced nucleosomal dna sizes varying between   and  bp with positions of the mnase cuts reflecting positions of the a  t pairs rather than the nucleosome core linker junctions determined by x ray crystallography extent of chromatosomal dna protection by linker histone h also depends on the linker dna sequence remarkably we found that a combined treatment with mnase and exonuclease iii exoiii overcomes mnase sequence preference producing nucleosomal dna trimmed symmetrically and precisely at the core linker junctions regardless of the underlying dna sequence we propose that combined mnase exoiii digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by dna sequences at the core linker junctions the same approach can be also used for the precise mapping of the extent of linker dna protection by h and other protein factors associated with nucleosome linkers
