phhr binds to target sequences at different distances with respect to rna polymerase in order to activate transcription
the ntrc family phhr protein of pseudomonas putida is involved in the control of the metabolism of aromatic amino acids and it is a dual regulatory protein when phhr acts as an activator it stimulates transcription from its cognate promoters with rna polymerase   rather than with    as is the case for most members of the family the target binding sites in repressed and activated promoters are defined by the   tgtaaan tttaca   consensus sequence phhr binds to target sites as a dimer with affinity in the range of   to    m as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry phhr activates transcription from both the pp   and pp   promoters regardless of the absence or presence of aromatic amino acids whereas phhr stimulates transcription from certain positively regulated promoters pphha ppp   ppp   and phmg  only in the presence of phenylalanine and tyrosine or their corresponding keto acids i e  phenylpyruvate and p hydroxyphenylpyruvate  a surprising feature of phhr mediated transcriptional activation is that phhr may bind to one or two upstream target sequences that are located at different distances from the rna polymerase binding site this allows phhr to function as a class i regulator target sites at        a class ii regulator target sites around     as well as an enhancer protein target sites gt     when functioning as an enhancer protein phhr mediated transcription is modulated by the integration host factor protein phhr represses transcription from its own promoter and the promoter of the paay gene by steric hindrance
