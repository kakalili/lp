Type IIS restriction endonucleases recognize asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands at fixed positions downstream of the recognition site. The restriction endonuclease BpuJI recognizes the asymmetric sequence 5′-CCCGT; however, it cuts at multiple sites in the vicinity of the target sequence. BpuJI consists of two physically separate domains, with catalytic and dimerization functions in the C-terminal domain and DNA recognition functions in the N-terminal domain. Here we report the crystal structure of the BpuJI recognition domain bound to cognate DNA at 1.3-Å resolution. This region folds into two winged-helix subdomains, D1 and D2, interspaced by the DL subdomain. The D1 and D2 subdomains of BpuJI share structural similarity with the similar subdomains of the FokI DNA-binding domain; however, their orientations in protein–DNA complexes are different. Recognition of the 5′-CCCGT target sequence is achieved by BpuJI through the major groove contacts of amino acid residues located on both the helix–turn–helix motifs and the N-terminal arm. The role of these interactions in DNA recognition is also corroborated by mutational analysis.
