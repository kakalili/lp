solution structure of the rous sarcoma virus nucleocapsid protein    rna packaging signal complex
the   untranslated region    utr of retroviral genomes contains elements required for genome packaging during virus assembly for many retroviruses the packaging elements reside in non contiguous segments that span most or all of the   utr the rous sarcoma virus rsv is an exception in that its genome can be packaged efficiently by a relatively short   nt segment of the   utr called    the rsv   utr also contains three translational start codons aug  aug  and aug  that have been controvertibly implicated in translation initiation and genome packaging one of which aug  resides within the   sequence we demonstrated recently that   is capable of binding to the cognate rsv nucleocapsid protein nc with high affinity dissociation constant kd    nm  and that residues of aug  are essential for tight binding we now report the solution structure of the nc   complex determined using nmr data obtained for samples containing  c  n labeled nc and h enriched nucleotide specifically protonated rnas upon nc binding    adopts a stable secondary structure that consists of three stem loops sl a sl b and sl c and an  bp stem o  binding is mediated by the two zinc knuckle domains of nc the n terminal knuckle interacts with a conserved u   gcg tetraloop a member of the uncg family n a u g or c  and the c terminal zinc knuckle binds to residues that flank sl a including residues of aug  mutations of critical nucleotides in these sequences compromise or abolish viral infectivity our studies reveal novel structural features important for nc rna binding and support the hypothesis that aug  is conserved for genome packaging rather than translational control
