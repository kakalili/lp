structure of c phycocyanin from the thermophilic cyanobacterium synechococcus vulcanus at     structural implications for thermal stability in phycobilisome assembly edited by r huber
the crystal structure of the light harvesting phycobiliprotein c phycocyanin from the thermophilic cyanobacterium synechochoccus vulcanus has been determined by molecular replacement to    resolution the crystal belongs to space group r  with cell parameters a  b       c                      with one    monomer in the asymmetric unit the structure has been refined to a crystallographic r factor of     r free factor is     for all data to     the crystals were grown from phycocyanin     trimers that form     hexamers in the crystals in a fashion similar to other phycocyanins comparison of the primary tertiary and quaternary structures of the s vulcanus phycocyanin structure with phycocyanins from both the mesophilic fremyella diplsiphon and the thermophilic mastigocladus laminosus were performed we show that each level of assembly of oligomeric phycocyanin which leads to the formation of the phycobilisome structure can be stabilized in thermophilic organisms by amino acid residue substitutions each substitution can form additional ionic interactions at critical positions of each association interface in addition a significant shift in the position of ring d of the b  phycocyanobilin cofactor in the s vulcanus phycocyanin enables the formation of important polar interactions at both the    monomer and     hexamer association interfaces
