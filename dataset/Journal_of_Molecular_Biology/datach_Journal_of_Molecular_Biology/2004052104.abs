regulation of lip level and ros formation through interaction of h ferritin with g csf receptor
a variety of hematopoietic factors including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gm csf  granulocyte colony stimulating factor g csf  interleukin  il  and thrombopoietin tpo induce a rapid increase of intracellular reactive oxygen species ros  ros induces the activation of many signaling molecules including shc lck syk pkc mapk stat  through inhibition of protein phosphatase each growth factor has a specific cell surface receptor which activates both unique and shared signal transduction pathways the processes of signal transduction linking cell surface receptor to the formation of intracellular ros have not been elucidated fully ferritins are composed of two subunit types h and l and made of  subunits that sequester up to   atoms of iron when the stored iron atoms are released from h ferritin through iron catalyzed reaction they have the capacity to promote the formation of ros here the interaction of g csfr and h ferritin was confirmed by yeast two hybrid screen mammalian two hybrid assays glutathione s transferase gst pull down experiments and immunoprecipitation studies in vitro and in vivo additional immunofluorescence assay showed that the two proteins colocalized along the plasma membrane and partly in the cytoplasm the binding site for h ferritin was demonstrated to locate to the box motif on the c terminal region of granulocyte colony timulating factor receptor g csfr  furthermore we found the interaction of full length g csfr with h ferritin was dissociated at  minutes after g csf induction and then began to assemble at  minutes the labile iron pool lip is a pool of redox active iron complexes which is regulated tightly by the expression of h ferritin experiments showed that the level of lip increased significantly at  minutes after g csf stimulation and intracellular ros formation changed in a pattern similar to lip response to g csf in bone marrow hematopoietic cells g csf induced changes in the level of lip and ros formation could be blocked by pretreatment with iron chelators that repressed the expression of h ferritin in addition the phosphorylation of stat induced by g csf was decreased in iron chelator treated hematopoietic cells these data suggested that lip may be released from the dissociated h ferritin and then induce intracellular ros formation in the bone marrow hematopoietic cells ros acting as a second messenger might take part in g csf receptor signal transduction so here a new g csfr h ferritin lip ros pathway is proposed for regulation of intracellular ros formation in bone marrow hematopoietic cells
