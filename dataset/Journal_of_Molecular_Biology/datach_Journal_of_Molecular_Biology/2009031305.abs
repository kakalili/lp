a generic mechanism of   microglobulin amyloid assembly at neutral ph involving a specific proline switch
although numerous measurements of amyloid assembly of different proteins under distinct conditions in vitro have been performed the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific self association of proteins into amyloid fibrils remain obscure elucidating the nature of the events that initiate amyloid formation remains a particularly difficult challenge because of the heterogeneity and transient nature of the species involved here we have used site directed mutagenesis to create five proline to glycine variants in the naturally amyloidogenic protein   microglobulin   m  one of these variants p g allowed us to isolate and characterise an intermediate containing a non native trans pro  backbone conformation a feature that is known to be required for amyloid elongation at neutral ph by analysing oligomerisation and amyloid formation using analytical size exclusion chromatography multi angle static light scattering analytical ultracentrifugation circular dichroism and thioflavin t fluorescence we reveal a pathway for  m amyloid assembly at ph   that does not require the addition of metal ions detergents co solvents or other co factors that have been used to facilitate amyloid formation at physiological ph and temperature assembly is shown to involve the transient formation of a non native monomer containing a trans p  backbone conformation this is followed by the formation of dimeric species and higher molecular mass oligomers that accumulate before the development of amyloid fibrils on the basis of these results we propose a generic mechanism for  m fibrillogenesis at neutral ph that is consistent with the wide range of published studies of this protein in this mechanism amyloid formation is initiated by a specific cis to trans proline switch the rate of which we show to be controlled by the amino acid sequence proximal to p  and to the applied solution conditions
