nucleosomal locations of dominant dna sequence motifs for histone  dna interactions and nucleosome positioning
dna sequence is an important determinant of the positioning stability and activity of nucleosomes yet the molecular basis of these effects remains elusive a  consensus dna sequence  for nucleosome positioning has not been reported and while certain dna sequence preferences or motifs for nucleosome positioning have been discovered how they function is not known here we report that an unexpected observation concerning the reassembly of nucleosomes during salt gradient dialysis has allowed a breakthrough in our efforts to identify the nucleosomal locations of the dna sequence motifs that dominate histone  dna interactions and nucleosome positioning we conclude that a previous selection experiment for high affinity nucleosome forming dna sequences exerted selective pressure chiefly on the central stretch of the nucleosomal dna this observation implies that algorithms for aligning the selected dna sequences should seek to optimize the alignment over much less than the full   bp of nucleosomal dna a new alignment calculation implemented these ideas and successfully aligned  of the  sequences in a non redundant database of selected high affinity nucleosome positioning sequences the resulting alignment reveals strong conservation of several stretches within a central  bp of the nucleosomal dna the alignment further reveals an inherent palindromic symmetry in the selected dnas it makes testable predictions of nucleosome positioning on the aligned sequences and for the creation of new positioning sequences both of which are upheld experimentally and it suggests new signals that may be important in translational nucleosome positioning
