structural and functional divergence of the aldolase fold in toxoplasma gondii
parasites of the phylum apicomplexa are highly successful pathogens of humans and animals worldwide as obligate intracellular parasites they have significant energy requirements for invasion and gliding motility that are supplied by various metabolic pathways aldolases have emerged as key enzymes involved in these pathways and all apicomplexans express one or both of fructose   bisphosphate f bp aldolase and  deoxyribose  phosphate dr p aldolase dera  intriguingly toxoplasma gondii a highly successful apicomplexan parasite expresses f bp aldolase tgald  d rp aldolase tgdera  and a divergent dr p aldolase like protein tgdpa exclusively in the latent bradyzoite stage while the importance of tgald in glycolysis is well established and tgdera is also likely to be involved in parasite metabolism the detailed function of tgdpa remains elusive to gain mechanistic insight into the function of different t gondii aldolases we first determined the crystal structures of tgald and tgdpa structural analysis revealed that both aldolases adopt a tim barrel fold accessorized with divergent secondary structure elements structural comparison of tgald and tgdpa with members of their respective enzyme families revealed that while the active site residues are conserved in tgald  key catalytic residues are absent in tgdpa consistent with this observation biochemical assays showed that while tgald was active on f bp tgdpa was inactive on dr p intriguingly both aldolases are competent to bind polymerized actin in vitro altogether structural and biochemical analyses of t gondii aldolase and aldolase like proteins reveal diverse functionalization of the classic tim barrel aldolase fold
