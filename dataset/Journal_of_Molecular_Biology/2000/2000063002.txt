Native-state amide hydrogen exchange monitored by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) has the potential to provide detailed residue-level information regarding correlated motions occurring on the microseconds to seconds timescale. To expand the applicability of MS to these studies, a new algorithm has been developed to interpret MS data for exchange occurring between the EX2 and EX1 kinetic limits. Re-interpretation of MS data for ovomucoid third domain reveals multiple unfolding or partial unfolding reactions.
