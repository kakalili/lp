the ganc tetraloop a novel motif in the group iic intron structure
tetraloops are a common building block for rna tertiary structure and most tetraloops fall into one of three well characterized classes gnra uncg and cuyg here we present the sequence and structure of a fourth highly conserved class of tetraloop that occurs only within the      interaction of group iic introns this ganc tetraloop was identified along with an unusual cognate receptor in the crystal structure of the group iic intron and through phylogenetic analysis of intron rna sequence alignments unlike conventional tetraloop  receptor interactions which are stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding interactions the ganc  receptor interaction is limited to a single base stack between the conserved adenosine of the tetraloop and a single purine of the receptor which consists of a one to three nucleotide bulge and does not contain an a platform unlike gnra tetraloops the ganc tetraloop forms a sharp angle relative to the adjacent helix bending by approximately   toward the major groove side of the helix these structural attributes allow ganc tetraloops to fit precisely within the group iic intron core thereby demonstrating that structural motifs can adapt to function in a specific niche
