surface growth of a motile bacterial population resembles growth in a chemostat
the growth behavior in well  mixed bacterial cultures is relatively well understood however bacteria often grow in heterogeneous conditions on surfaces where their growth is dependent on spatial position especially in the case of motile populations for such populations the relation between growth motility and spatial position is unclear we developed a microscope based assay for quantifying in situ growth and gene expression in space and time and we observe these parameters in populations of escherichia coli swimming in galactose soft agar plates we find that the bacterial density and the shape of the motile population after an initial transient are constant in time by considering not only the advancing population but also the fraction that lags behind we propose a growth model that relates spatial distribution motility and growth rate this model that is similar to bacterial growth in a chemostat predicts that the fraction of the population lagging behind is inversely proportional to the velocity of the motile population we test this prediction by modulating motility using inducible expression of the flagellar sigma factor flia finally we observe that bacteria in the chemotactic ring express higher relative levels of the chemotaxis and galactose metabolism genes flic flil and gale than those that stay behind in the center of the plate
