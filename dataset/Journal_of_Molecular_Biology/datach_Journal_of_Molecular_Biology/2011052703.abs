new lessons from random x chromosome inactivation in the mouse
x chromosome inactivation xci ensures dosage compensation in mammals random xci is a process where a single x chromosome is silenced in each cell of the epiblast of mouse female embryos operating at the level of an entire chromosome xci is a major paradigm for epigenetic processes here we review the most recent discoveries concerning the role of long noncoding rnas pluripotency factors and chromosome structure in random xci
