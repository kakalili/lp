backbone flexibility of cdr and immune recognition of antigens
conformational entropy is an important component of protein  protein interactions however there is no reliable method for computing this parameter we have developed a statistical measure of residual backbone entropy in folded proteins by using the     distributions of the  amino acids in common secondary structures the backbone entropy patterns of amino acids within helix sheet or coil form clusters that recapitulate the branching and hydrogen bonding properties of the side chains in the secondary structure type the same types of residues in coil and sheet have identical backbone entropies while helix residues have much smaller conformational entropies we estimated the backbone entropy change for immunoglobulin complementarity determining regions cdrs from the crystal structures of  low affinity t cell receptors and  high affinity fabs as a result of the formation of protein complexes surprisingly we discovered that the computed backbone entropy loss of only the cdr  but not all cdrs correlated significantly with the kinetic and affinity constants of the  selected complexes consequently we propose a simple algorithm to introduce proline mutations that restrict the conformational flexibility of cdrs and enhance the kinetics and affinity of immunoglobulin interactions combining the proline mutations with rationally designed mutants from a previous study led to   fold increase in the affinity of the a t cell receptor for tax hlaa  however this mutational scheme failed to induce significant binding changes in the already high affinity c   fab huegfr interface our results will serve as a roadmap to formulate more effective target functions to design immune complexes with improved biological functions
