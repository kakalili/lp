backbone dynamics of the c terminal sh domain of the p   subunit of phosphoinositide  kinase effect of phosphotyrosine peptide binding and characterization of slow conformational exchange processes edited by p e wright
the backbone dynamics of the c terminal sh domain from the regulatory subunit p   p   c sh  of phosphoinositide  kinase has been investigated in the absence of and in complex with a high affinity phosphotyrosine containing peptide ligand derived from the platelet derived growth factor receptor  n r and r relaxation rates and steady state  h  n noe values were measured by means of h  n correlated two dimensional methods and were analyzed within the framework of the model free formalism several residues in the bc loop and in the neighbouring secondary structural elements display fast local dynamics in the absence of phosphotyrosine peptide ligand as evidenced by below average  h  n noe values furthermore residue gln  bc  displays conformational exchange phenomena as indicated by an above average r relaxation rate upon binding of the phosphotyrosine peptide the noe values increase to values observed for regular secondary structure and the exchange contribution to the r relaxation rate for gln  bc  vanishes these observations indicate a loss of backbone flexibility upon ligand binding substantial exchange contributions for his   d  and cys   d  which are known to make important interactions with the ligand are attenuated upon ligand binding several residues in the  d  fb region and the bg loop which contribute to the ligand binding surface of the protein exhibit exchange terms which are reduced or vanish when the ligand is bound together these observations suggest that ligand binding is accompanied by a loss of conformational flexibility on the ligand binding face of the protein however comparison with other sh domains reveals an apparent lack of consensus in the changes in dynamics induced by ligand binding exchange rates for individual residues were quantified in peptide complexed p   c sh from the dependence of the exchange contributions on the cpmg delay in an r series and show that peptide complexed p   c sh is affected by multiple conformational exchange processes with exchange rate constants from   s   to    s   mapping of the exchange rate constants on the protein surface show a clustering of residues with similar exchange rate constants and suggests that clustered residues are affected by a common predominant exchange process
