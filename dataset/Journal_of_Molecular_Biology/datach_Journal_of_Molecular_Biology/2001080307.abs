nmr evidence for mechanical coupling of phosphate bi bii transitions with deoxyribose conformational exchange in dna edited by i tinoco
the conformational exchange of the phosphate and deoxyribose groups of the dna oligomers d gcgtacgc  and d cgctagcg  have been investigated using a combination of homonuclear and heteronuclear nmr techniques two state exchange between phosphate bi and bii conformations and deoxyribose n and s conformations was expressed as percent population of the major conformer  bi or s sequence context dependent variations in bi and s were observed the positions of the phosphate and deoxyribose equilibria provide a quantitative measure of the ps to ns timescale dynamic exchange processes in the dna backbone linear correlations between bi  s and previously calculated model free  c order parameters s  were observed the bi of the phosphates were found to be correlated to the s of the flanking c   and c   atoms the bi was also found to be correlated with the s and c   s of the deoxyribose ring   of the phosphates the bi of opposing phosphates is correlated while the bi of sequential phosphates is anti correlated these correlations suggest that conformational exchange processes in dna are coupled to each other and are modulated by dna base sequence which may have important implications for dna protein interactions
