contribution of surface salt bridges to protein stability guidelines for protein engineering
the small globular protein ubiquitin contains a pair of oppositely charged residues k  and e  that according to the three dimensional structure are located on the surface of this protein with a spatial orientation characteristic of a salt bridge we investigated the strength of this salt bridge and its contribution to the global stability of the ubiquitin molecule using the  double mutant cycle  analysis the strength of the pairwise interactions between k  and e  was estimated to be favorable by  kj mol further the salt bridge of the reverse orientation i e e  k  can be formed and is found to have a strength   kj mol similar to that of the k  e  pair however the global stability of the k  e  variant of ubiquitin is  kj mol higher than that of the e  k  variant the difference in the contribution of the opposing salt bridge orientations to the overall stability of the ubiquitin molecule is attributed to the difference in the charge  charge interactions between residues forming the salt bridge and the rest of the ionizable groups in this protein on the basis of these results we concluded that surface salt bridges are stabilizing but their contribution to the overall protein stability is strongly context dependent with charge  charge interactions being the largest determinant analysis of  salt bridges from six different proteins for which detailed experimental data on energetics have been reported support the conclusions made from the analysis of the salt bridge in ubiquitin implications of these findings for engineering proteins with enhanced thermostability are discussed
