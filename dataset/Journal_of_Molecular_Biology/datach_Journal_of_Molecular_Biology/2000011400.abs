thermodynamics of a  hairpin structure evidence for cooperative formation of folding nucleus edited by p e wright
to elucidate early nucleation stages in protein folding multi probed thermodynamic characterization was applied to the  hairpin structural formation of g peptide which is a c terminal fragment of the b domain of streptococcal protein g the segment corresponding to the sequence of g peptide is believed to act as a nucleus during the folding process of the b domain in spite of the broad thermal transition of g peptide nuclear magnetic resonance nmr melting measurements combined with our original analytical theory enabled us to obtain the thermodynamic properties of the  hairpin formation with considerable accuracy additionally all the thermodynamic properties determined by every nmr probe on both the main chain and the side chains were quite similar and also comparable to the values that were independently determined by calorimetric analysis of g peptide these results demonstrate that g peptide folds cooperatively throughout the molecule in other words the formation of the  hairpin is interpreted as the fashion of a first order phase transition between two states without any distinguishable intermediates this cooperative formation of the short linear peptide consisting of only  residues provides insight into not only the first folding events of the b domain but also the general principles of proteins in terms of structural hierarchy stability and folding mechanism
