The tryptophan biosynthesis genes of several Bacilli are controlled through terminator/anti-terminator transcriptional attenuation. This process is regulated by tryptophan-dependent binding of the trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (TRAP) to the leader region of the trp operon mRNA, precluding formation of the antiterminator RNA hairpin, and allowing formation of the less stable terminator hairpin. Crystal structures are available of TRAP in complex with tryptophan and in ternary complex with tryptophan and RNA. However, no structure of TRAP in the absence of tryptophan is available; thus, the mechanism of allostery remains unclear. We have used transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based NMR experiments to study the mechanism of ligand-mediated allosteric regulation in the 90.6kDa 11-mer TRAP. By recording a series of two-dimensional 15N-edited TROSY NMR spectra of TRAP from the thermophile Bacillus stearothermophilus over an extended range of temperatures, we have found tryptophan binding to be temperature-dependent, in agreement with the previously observed temperature-dependent RNA binding. Triple-resonance TROSY-based NMR spectra recorded at 55Â°C have allowed us to obtain backbone resonance assignments for uniformly 2H,13C,15N-labeled TRAP in the inactive form and in the active form (free and bound to tryptophan). On the basis of ligand-dependent differential line-broadening and chemical shift perturbations, coupled with the results of proteolytic sensitivity measurements, we infer that tryptophan-modulated protein flexibility (dynamics) plays a central role in TRAP function by altering its RNA-binding affinity. Furthermore, because the crystal structures show that the ligand is buried completely in the bound state, we speculate that such dynamic behavior may be important to enable rapid response to changes in intracellular tryptophan levels. Thus, we propose that allosteric control of TRAP is accomplished by ligand-altered protein dynamics.
