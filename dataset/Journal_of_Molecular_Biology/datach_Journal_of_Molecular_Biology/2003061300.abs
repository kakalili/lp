catalytic mechanism of dna cytosine c  methyltransferases revisited covalent intermediate formation is not essential for methyl group transfer by the murine dnmt a enzyme
co transfections of reporter plasmids and plasmids encoding the catalytic domain of the murine dnmt a dna methyltransferase lead to inhibition of reporter gene expression as dnmt a mutants with c  a and e  a exchanges in the conserved pcq and env motifs in the catalytic center of the enzyme also cause repression we checked for their catalytic activity in vitro surprisingly the activity of the cysteine variant and of the corresponding full length dnmt a variant is only two to sixfold reduced with respect to wild type dnmt a in contrast enzyme variants carrying e  a e  d or e  q exchanges of the env glutamate are catalytically almost inactive demonstrating that this residue has a central function in catalysis since the glutamic acid residue contacts the flipped base its main function could be to hold the target base at a position that supports methyl group transfer whereas wild type dnmt a and the env variants form covalent complexes with  fluorocytidine modified dna the pcn variant does not therefore covalent complex formation is not essential in the reaction mechanism of dnmt a we propose that correct positioning of the flipped base and the cofactor and binding to the transition state of methyl group transfer are the most important roles of the dnmt a enzyme in the catalytic cycle of methyl group transfer
