X-linked lymphoproliferative disease is caused by mutations in the protein SAP, which consists almost entirely of a single SH2 domain. SAP interacts with the Tyr281 site of the Tâ†”B cell signaling protein SLAM via its SH2 domain. Interestingly, binding is not dependent on phosphorylation but does involve interactions with residues N-terminal to the Tyr. We have used 15N and 2H NMR relaxation experiments to investigate the motional properties of the SAP SH2 domain backbone amides and side-chain methyl groups in the free protein and complexes with phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated peptides derived from the Tyr281 site of SLAM. The most mobile methyl groups are in side-chains with large RMSD values between the three crystal structures of SAP, suggesting that fast time-scale dynamics in side-chains is associated with conformational plasticity. The backbone amides of two residues which interact with the C-terminal part of the peptides experience fast time-scale motions in the free SH2 domain that are quenched upon binding of either the phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated peptide. Of most importance, the mobility of methyl groups in and around the binding site for residues in the N-terminus of the peptide is significantly restricted in the complexes, underscoring the dominance of this interaction with SAP and demonstrating a correlation between changes in rapid side-chain motion upon binding with local binding energy.
