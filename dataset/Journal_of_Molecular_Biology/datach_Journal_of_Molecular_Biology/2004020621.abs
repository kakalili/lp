structural distortion of p  by the mutation r  s and its rescue by a designed peptide implications for  mutant conformation
missense mutations in the dna binding core domain of the tumour suppressor protein p  are frequent in cancer many of them result in loss of native structure the mutation r  s is one of the six most common cancer associated p  mutations   hot spots   as it is highly frequent in hepatocellular carcinoma its rescue is an important therapeutic target we have used nmr techniques to study the structural effects of the r  s mutation the overall fold of the core domain is retained in r  s and it does not take up a denatured  mutant conformation   however the  sandwich had increased flexibility and according to changes in chemical shift there was local distortion throughout the dna binding interface it is likely that the r  s mutation resulted in an ensemble of native and native like conformations in a dynamic equilibrium the peptide fl cdb that was designed to rescue mutants of p  by binding specifically to its native structure was found to revert the chemical shifts of r  s back towards the wild type values and so reverse the structural effects of mutation we discuss the implications for a rescue strategy and also for the analysis of antibody binding data
