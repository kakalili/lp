Repair of mismatched DNA occurs mainly by the long-patch mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, requiring Msh2 and Pms1. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe mismatches can be repaired by a short-patch repair system, containing nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors. We studied mismatch correction efficiency in cells with inactivated DNA repair nucleases Rad13, Rad2 or Uve1 in MMR proficient and deficient background. Rad13 incises 3′ of damaged DNA during NER. Rad2 has a function in the Uve1-dependent repair of DNA damages and in replication. Loss of Rad13 caused a strong reduction of short-patch processing of mismatches formed during meiotic recombination. Mitotic mutation rates were increased, but not to the same extent as in the NER mutant swi10, which is defective in 5′ incision. The difference might be caused by an additional role of Rad13 in base excision repair or due to partial redundancy with other 3′ endonucleases. Meiotic mismatch repair was not or only slightly affected in rad2 and uve1 mutants. In addition, inactivation of uve1 caused only weak effects on mutation avoidance. Mutation rates were elevated when rad2 was mutated, but not further increased in swi10 rad2 and rad13 rad2 double mutants, indicating an epistatic relationship. However, the mutation spectra of rad2 were different from that of swi10 and rad13. Thus, the function of Rad2 in mutation avoidance is rather independent of NER. rad13, swi10 and rad2, but not uve1 mutants were sensitive to the DNA-damaging agent methyl methane sulphonate. Cell survival was further reduced in the double mutants swi10 rad2, rad13 rad2 and, surprisingly, swi10 rad13. These data confirm that NER and Rad2 act in distinct damage repair pathways and further indicate that the function of Rad13 in repair of alkylated bases is partially independent of NER.
