solution structure of the complex formed between human complement c d and full length complement receptor type
complement receptor type  cr  cd  is a cell surface protein that links the innate and adaptive immune response during the activation of b cells through its binding to c d a cleavage fragment of the major complement component c  the extracellular portion of cr comprises  or  short complement regulator scr domains in a partially folded back but flexible structure here the effect of c d binding to cr was determined by analytical ultracentrifugation and x ray scattering the sedimentation coefficient of unbound cr is   s in   mm nacl because this agrees well with a value of   s in   mm nacl the overall cr structure is unaffected by change in ionic strength unbound c d exists in monomer dimer and monomer trimer equilibria in   mm nacl but as a monomer only in   mm nacl in c s size distribution analyses an equimolar mixture of the cr  c d complex in   mm nacl revealed a single peak shifted to   s when compared to unbound cr at   s to show that the complex had formed the cr  c d complex in   mm nacl showed two peaks at   s and   s to show that this had dissociated solution structural models for the cr scr   complex with c d and cr scr   were superimposed these gave an average sedimentation coefficient of   s for the complex in good agreement with the observed value of   s it is concluded that cr does not detectably change conformation when c d is bound to it consistent with previous analyses its c d complex is not formed in physiological salt conditions the implications of these solution results for its immune role are discussed to our knowledge this is the first solution structural study of a large multidomain scr protein cr bound to its physiological ligand c d
