solution structure of an a tract dna bend edited by i tinoco
the solution structure of a dna dodecamer d ggcaaaaaacgg d ccgttttttgcc containing an a tract has been determined by nmr spectroscopy with residual dipolar couplings the structure shows an overall helix axis bend of   in a geometry consistent with solution and gel electrophoresis experiments fourteen degrees of the bending occurs in the gc regions flanking the a tract the remaining   is spread evenly over its six at base pairs the a tract is characterized by decreasing minor groove width from the   to the   direction along the a strand this is a result of propeller twist in the at pairs and the increasing negative inclination of the adenine bases at the   side of the run of adenine bases the four central thymine bases all have negative inclination throughout the a tract with an average value of      although this negative inclination makes the geometry of the a tract different from all x ray structures the proton on n of adenine and the o of thymine one step down the helix are within distance to form bifurcated hydrogen bonds the   bend of   occurs at the junction between the gc flank and the a tract through a combination of tilt and roll the larger   bend    occurs in two base steps the first composed of tilt      and the second a combination of tilt      and roll     this second step is a direct consequence of the change in inclination between an adjacent cytosine base which has an inclination of     and the next base a guanine which has   inclination this bend is a combination of tilt and roll the large change in inclination allows the formation of a hydrogen bond between the protons of n of the   cytosine and the o of the next   base a guanine stabilizing the roll component in the bend these structural features differ from existing models for a tract bends for comparison we also determined the structure of the control sequence d ggcaagaaacgg d ccgtttcttgcc  with an at to gc transition in the center of the a tract this structure has no negative inclination in most of the bases within the a tract resulting in a bend of only   when ligated in phase the control sequence has nearly normal mobility in gel electrophoresis experiments
