study of the functional interaction of the   tetraloop of  s ribosomal rna with helix  within the bacterial ribosome
the   tetraloop that caps helix  of  s ribosomal rna rrna is amongst the most conserved regions of rrna this tetraloop forms a gnra motif that docks into the minor groove of three base pairs at the bottom of helix  of  s rrna in the  s subunit both the tetraloop and its receptor in helix  contact the  s rrna forming the intersubunit bridge b c here we investigated the interaction between the   tetraloop and its receptor by genetic complementation we used a specialized ribosome system in combination with an in vivo instant evolution approach to select mutations in helix  compensating for a mutation in the   tetraloop a  g that severely decreases ribosomal activity impairing subunit association and translational fidelity we selected two mutants where the g  c  base pair of helix  was substituted with either u a or c a when these mutations in helix  were investigated in the context of a wild type   tetraloop the c a but not the u a mutation severely impaired ribosome activity interfering with subunit association and decreasing translational fidelity in the presence of the a  g mutation both mutations in helix  increased the ribosome activity to the same extent subunit association and translational fidelity were increased to the same level computer modeling was used to analyze the effect of the mutations in helix  on the interaction between the tetraloop and its receptor this study demonstrates the functional importance of the interaction between the   tetraloop and helix
