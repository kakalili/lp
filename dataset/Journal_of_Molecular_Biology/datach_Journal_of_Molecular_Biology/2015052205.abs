the molecular motor f atp synthase is targeted by the tumoricidal protein hamlet
hamlet human alpha lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells interacts with multiple tumor cell compartments affecting cell morphology metabolism proteasome function chromatin structure and viability this study investigated if these diverse effects of hamlet might be caused in part by a direct effect on the atp synthase and a resulting reduction in cellular atp levels a dose dependent reduction in cellular atp levels was detected in a  lung carcinoma cells and by confocal microscopy co localization of hamlet with the nucleotide binding subunits   non catalytic and   catalytic of the energy converting f f atp synthase was detected as shown by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy hamlet binds to the f domain of the f f atp synthase with a dissociation constant kd of    m increasing concentrations of the tumoricidal protein hamlet added to the enzymatically active     complex of the f atp synthase lowered its atpase activity demonstrating that hamlet binding to the f atp synthase effects the catalysis of this molecular motor single molecule analysis was applied to study hamlet      complex interaction whereas the     complex of the f atp synthase rotated in a counterclockwise direction with a mean rotational rate of     s   no rotation could be observed in the presence of bound hamlet our findings suggest that direct effects of hamlet on the f atp synthase may inhibit atp dependent cellular processes
