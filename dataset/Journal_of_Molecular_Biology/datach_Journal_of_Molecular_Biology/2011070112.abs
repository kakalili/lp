multiple pot  tpp proteins coat and compact long telomeric single stranded dna
telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that cap and protect the ends of linear chromosomes in humans telomeres end in      nt of g rich single stranded dna ssdna overhangs protection of telomeres  pot  binds with nanomolar affinity to the ssdna overhangs and forms a dimer with another telomere end binding protein called tpp  whereas most previous studies utilized telomeric oligonucleotides comprising single pot  tpp binding sites here we examined   to   nt tracts of telomeric dna containing    pot  tpp binding sites using electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy we analyzed telomeric nucleoprotein complexes containing pot alone pot  tpp  and a truncated version of pot  pot n that maintains its dna binding domain the results revealed that pot n and pot  tpp can completely coat long telomeric ssdna substrates furthermore we show that ssdna coated with human pot  tpp heterodimers forms compact potentially ordered structures
