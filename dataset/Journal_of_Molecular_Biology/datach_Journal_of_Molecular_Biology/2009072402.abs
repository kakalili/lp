multiple tight phospholipid binding modes of  synuclein revealed by solution nmr spectroscopy
in dopaminergic neurons   synuclein  s partitions between a disordered cytosolic state and a lipid bound state binding of  s to membrane phospholipids is implicated in its functional role in synaptic regulation but also impacts fibril formation associated with parkinson s disease we describe here a solution nmr study in which  s is added to small unilamellar vesicles of a composition mimicking synaptic vesicles the results provide evidence for multiple distinct phospholipid binding modes of  s exchange between the free state and the lipid bound  s state and between different bound states is slow on the nmr timescale being in the range of     s   partitioning of the binding modes is dependent on lipid  s stoichiometry and tight binding with slow exchange kinetics is observed at stoichiometries as low as   in all lipid bound states a segment of residues starting at the n terminus of  s adopts an  helical conformation while succeeding residues retain the characteristics of a random coil the  c terminal residues remain dynamically disordered even at high lipid concentrations but can also bind to lipids to an extent that appears to be determined by the fraction of cis x pro peptide bonds in this region while lipid bound  s exhibits dynamic properties that preclude its direct observation by nmr its exchange with the nmr visible free form allows for its indirect characterization rapid amide  amide nuclear overhauser enhancement buildup points to a large  helical conformation and a distinct increase in fluorescence anisotropy attributed to tyr  indicates an ordered environment for this  dark state   titration of  s with increasing amounts of lipids suggests that the binding mode under high lipid conditions remains qualitatively similar to that in the low lipid case the nmr data appear incompatible with the commonly assumed model where  s lies in an  helical conformation on the membrane surface and instead suggest that considerable remodeling of the vesicles is induced by  s
