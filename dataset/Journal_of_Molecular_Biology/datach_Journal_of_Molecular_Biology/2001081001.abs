bergerac sh   frustation  induced by stabilizing the folding nucleus edited by a r fersht
the influence of an inserted exogenous independent folding element on the thermodynamics and folding properties of sh domain from  spectrin has been investigated by creating a fused form between this small all  domain and a stable  hairpin bh   nmr analysis of synthetic peptides shows that insertion of bh  nucleates formation of the original natural  hairpin distal loop that is part of the sh folding nucleus the resulting protein bergerac shh is more stable folds faster and contains an elongated hairpin protruding from the globular domain as determined by d nmr   protein engineering  analysis of the inserted region shows that it is folded in the transition state interestingly stabilisation by insertion of the distal loop region results in the appearance of a compact intermediate revealed by a curved chevron plot at low denaturant concentration this effect is eliminated at low salt concentrations by a single mutation of a hydrophobic residue within bh  sequence which is most probably involved in non native interactions local stabilisation by enlargement and reinforcement of the folding nucleus global compaction by the addition of salt and non native interactions are shown to contribute to the observed deviation from the two state behaviour
