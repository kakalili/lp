defective membrane interactions of familial parkinson  s disease mutant a p  synuclein edited by i b holland
synuclein   syn is an abundant presynaptic protein of unknown function which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinson  s disease   syn has been suggested to play a role in lipid transport and synaptogenesis and growing evidence suggests that  syn interactions with cellular membranes are physiologically important in the current study we demonstrate that the familial parkinson  s disease linked a p mutant  syn is defective in binding to phospholipid vesicles in vitro as determined by vesicle ultracentrifugation circular dichroism spectroscopy and low angle x ray diffraction interestingly our data also suggest that  syn may bind to the lipid vesicles as a dimer which suggest that this species could be a physiologically relevant and functional entity in contrast the naturally occurring murine a t substitution which is also linked to parkinson  s disease displayed a normal membrane binding activity that was comparable to wild type  syn a double mutant a t a p  syn showed defective membrane binding similar to the a p protein indicating that the proline mutation is dominant in terms of impairing the membrane binding activity with these observations we suggest that the a t and a p mutants may have different physiological consequences in vivo and could possibly contribute to early onset parkinson  s disease via unique mechanisms
