hyper recombinogenic reca protein from pseudomonas aeruginosa with enhanced activity of its primary dna binding site
according to one prominent model each protomer in the activated nucleoprotein filament of homologous recombinase reca possesses two dna binding sites the primary site binds   single stranded dna ssdna to form presynaptic complex and   the newly formed double stranded ds dna whereas the secondary site binds   dsdna of a partner to initiate strand exchange and   the displaced ssdna following the strand exchange reca protein from pseudomonas aeruginosa recapa promotes in escherichia coli hyper recombination in an sos independent manner earlier we revealed that recapa rapidly displaces e coli ssb protein ssb ec from ssdna to form presynaptic complex here we show that this property   is based on increased affinity of ssdna for the recapa primary dna binding site while the affinity for the secondary site remains similar to that for e coli reca   is not specific for ssb ec but is also observed for ssb protein from p aeruginosa that in turn predicts a possibility of enhanced recombination repair in this pathogenic bacterium
