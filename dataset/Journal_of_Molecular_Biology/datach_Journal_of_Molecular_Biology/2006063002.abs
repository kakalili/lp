structure of a complex of tandem hmg boxes and dna
the high mobility group protein hmgb contains two tandem dna binding hmg box domains a and b linked by a short flexible linker that allows the two domains to behave independently in the free protein there is no structural information on how the linked domains and linker behave when bound to dna mainly due to the lack of any dna sequence preference of hmgb  we report the structure determination by nmr spectroscopy of a well defined complex of two tandem hmg boxes bound to a   bp oligonucleotide the protein is an engineered version of the ab di domain of hmgb  in which the a box has been replaced by the hmg box of the sequence specific transcription factor sry to give sry b in the sry b dna complex both hmg boxes bind in the minor groove and contribute to the overall dna bending by intercalation of bulky hydrophobic residues between base pairs the bends reinforce each other and the basic linker lies partly in the minor groove as well as being the first structure of an hmg box di domain bound to dna this provides the first structure of the b domain of hmgb bound to dna
