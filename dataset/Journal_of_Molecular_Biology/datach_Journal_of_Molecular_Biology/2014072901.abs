molecular conformation of the full length tumor suppressor nf merlin  a small angle neutron scattering study
the tumor suppressor protein merlin inhibits cell proliferation upon establishing cell  cell contacts because merlin has high level of sequence similarity to the ezrin radixin moesin family of proteins the structural model of ezrin radixin moesin protein autoinhibition and cycling between closed resting and open active conformational states is often employed to explain merlin function however recent biochemical studies suggest alternative molecular models of merlin function here we have determined the low resolution molecular structure and binding activity of merlin and a merlin s  d mutant that mimics the inactivating phosphorylation at s  using small angle neutron scattering and binding experiments small angle neutron scattering shows that in solution both merlin and merlin s  d adopt a closed conformation but binding experiments indicate that a significant fraction of either merlin or merlin s  d is capable of binding to the target protein nherf  upon binding to the phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate lipid the wild type merlin adopts a more open conformation than in solution but merlin s  d remains in a closed conformation this study supports a rheostat model of merlin in nherf binding and contributes to resolving a controversy about the molecular conformation and binding activity of merlin
