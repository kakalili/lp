nfatc with ap  site binding specificity mediates gene expression of prostate specific membrane antigen
prostate specific membrane antigen psma is a marker protein expressed primarily in prostate epithelium its prostate specific expression is conferred by psma enhancer psme  localized within the third intron of psma encoding gene folh  we recently reported that the   end  bp of psme harbored crucial enhancer elements for high psma expression deletion of this  bp sequence called psme del  significantly diminished psme activity we have further analyzed the regulatory elements in this  bp by transient transfection of linker scanning mutants two mutants ln  and   which harbored an ap  site and an ap  site respectively exhibited significantly lower enhancer activity subsequent site directed mutagenesis changing the ap  site abolished the enhancer activity of psme but not ap  indicating that ap  was the key cis element enabling high psma expression in addition a  bp ap  site was able to enhance psme del  activity by almost   higher compared to full length psme however ap  alone retained just the basal level of activity indicating that the action by ap  was mediated by cooperation with other transcription factors binding to the psme del  region transcription factor nfatc isoforms in nuclear extract were co precipitated with the biotinylated ap  site by immobilized agarose beads and the genomic dna containing psme was precipitated by antibodies reactive to nfatc  demonstrating that nfatc isoforms bound to the ap  site in psme in vivo furthermore ionomycin calcium ionophore and tpa augmented the enhancer activity of psme implying that calcium is an important regulator for psma expression in prostate cancer cell
