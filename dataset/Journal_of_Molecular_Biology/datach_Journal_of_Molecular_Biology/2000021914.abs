an ef hand phage display study of calmodulin subdomain pairing edited by j a wells
the interaction between the two ef hands ef and ef  in the c terminal domain of vertebrate calmodulin is addressed using an ef hand phage display library significant specificity is observed in the presence of ca  as ef ef heterodimers are favored over ef ef and ef ef homodimers primarily ef type and not ef type amino acids are selected when an ef peptide is used as the target and vice versa the results show that this specificity is promoted by several factors there are three positions corresponding to phe  ala   and leu   that are strongly selected as ef type hydrophobic residues with an ef target when ef is the target peptide ef type residues ile   tyr  and phe   are selected remarkably this subset consists of the same three residue positions in ef or ef and seems to be involved in specifying the heterodimer preference in both cases in addition electrostatic repulsion between the acidic monomers in an ef homodimer may further influence the preferred stability of heterodimers this hypothesis is based on the observation that positively charged residues are strongly selected at four positions when ef is the target a survey of ef hand pairs suggests that charge separation is a common way to achieve efficient attraction of ca  without causing electrostatic repulsion between the subdomains no significant specificity of binding is observed in the ion free state or in the presence of magnesium as no sequence is preferentially selected the residues at the interface between the two ef hands are thus highly optimized for the ca  bound state at some residue positions ef type amino acids are chosen with ef target in the presence of ca  these residues are not involved in the preference for heterodimer over homodimer formation but represent key positions to mutate in the intact domain to stabilize its ca  bound state
