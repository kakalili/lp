dna sequence context conceals  anomeric lesions
dna sequence context has long been known to modulate detection and repair of dna damage recent studies using experimental and computational approaches have sought to provide a basis for this observation we have previously shown that an  anomeric adenosine  a flanked by cytosines   c ac    resulted in a kinked dna duplex with an enlarged minor groove comparison of different flanking sequences revealed that a dna duplex containing a   c ag   motif exhibits unique substrate properties however this substrate was not distinguished by unusual thermodynamic properties to understand the structural basis of the altered recognition we have determined the solution structure of a dna duplex with a   c ag   core using an extensive set of restraints including dipolar couplings and backbone torsion angles the nmr structure exhibits an excellent agreement with the data total rx lt    the  a base is intrahelical in a reverse watson  crick orientation and forms a weak base pair with a thymine of the opposite strand in comparison to the dna duplex with a   c ac   core we observe a significant reduction of the local perturbation backbone stacking tilt roll and twist  resulting in a straighter dna with narrower minor groove overall these features result in a less perturbed dna helix and obscure the presence of the lesion compared to the   c ac   sequence the improved stacking of the   c ag   core also affects the energetics of the dna deformation that is required to form a catalytically competent complex these traits provide a rationale for the modulation of the recognition by endonuclease iv
