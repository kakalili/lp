significant proportions of nuclear transport proteins with reduced intracellular mobilities resolved by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
nuclear transport requires freely diffusing nuclear transport proteins to facilitate movement of cargo molecules through the nuclear pore we analyzed dynamic properties of importin   importin   ran and ntf in nucleus cytoplasm and at the nuclear pore of neuroblastoma cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy mobile components were quantified by global fitting of autocorrelation data from multiple cells immobile components were quantified by analysis of photobleaching kinetics wild type ran was compared to various mutant ran proteins to identify components representing gtp or gdp forms of ran untreated cells were compared to cells treated with nocodazole or latrunculin to identify components associated with cytoskeletal elements the results indicate that freely diffusing importin   importin   ran and ntf are in dynamic equilibrium with larger pools associated with immobile binding partners such as microtubules in the cytoplasm these findings suggest that formation of freely diffusing nuclear transport intermediates is in competition with binding to immobile partners variation in concentrations of freely diffusing nuclear transport intermediates among cells indicates that the nuclear transport system is sufficiently robust to function over a wide range of conditions
