crystal structure and biochemical characterization of recombinant human calcyphosine delineates a novel ef hand containing protein family
calcyphosine is an ef hand protein involved in both ca  phosphatidylinositol and cyclic amp signal cascades as well as in other cellular functions the crystal structure of ca  loaded calcyphosine was determined up to     resolution and reveals a protein containing two pairs of ca  binding ef hand motifs calcyphosine shares a highly similar overall topology with calmodulin however there are striking differences between ef hand  both n terminal and c terminal regions and interdomain linkers the c terminal domain of calcyphosine possesses a large hydrophobic pocket in the presence of calcium ions that might be implicated in ligand binding while its n terminal hydrophobic pocket is almost shielded by an additional terminal helix calcyphosine is largely monomeric regardless of the presence of ca  differences in structure oligomeric state in the presence and in the absence of ca  a highly conserved sequence with low similarity to other proteins and phylogeny define a new ef hand containing family of calcyphosine proteins that extends from arthropods to humans
