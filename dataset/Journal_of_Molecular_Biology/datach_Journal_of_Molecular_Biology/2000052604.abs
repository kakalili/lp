genomic sequence and analysis of the atypical temperate bacteriophage n  edited by m gottesman
n  is a temperate bacteriophage that forms stable lysogens in escherichia coli while its virion is morphologically very similar to phage lambda and its close relatives it is unusual in that the prophage form replicates autonomously as a linear dna molecule with closed hairpin telomeres here we describe the genomic architecture of n  and its global pattern of gene expression which reveal that n  contains several plasmid derived genes that are expressed in n  lysogens the tel site at which processing occurs to form the prophage ends is close to the center of the genome in a similar location to that occupied by the attachment site attp in lambda and its relatives and defines the boundary between the left and right arms the left arm contains a long cluster of structural genes that are closely related to those of the lambda like phages but also includes homologs of umud   which encodes a dna polymerase accessory protein and the plasmid partition genes sopa and sopb the right arm likewise contains a mixture of apparently phage and plasmid derived genes including genes encoding plasmid replication functions a phage repressor a transcription antitermination system as well as phage host cell lysis genes and two putative dna methylases the unique structure of the n  genome suggests that the large global population of bacteriophages may exhibit a much greater diversity of genomic architectures than was previously recognized
