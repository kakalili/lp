hcle cgi   a human protein that interacts with the influenza virus polymerase is a mrna transcription modulator
the human protein hcle was previously identified by its interaction with the pa subunit of influenza virus polymerase it exhibits a sequence similarity of   with the yeast spt  component of the fact complex which is involved in transcriptional regulation therefore we studied the possible relationship of hcle with the transcription machinery here we show that hcle and different phosphorylated forms of the rna polymerase ii rnap ii largest subunit co immunoprecipitate and colocalize by confocal microscopy analysis furthermore hcle was found in nuclear sites of active mrna synthesis as demonstrated by its colocalization with spots of in situ br utp incorporation silencing of hcle expression by rna interference inhibited the synthesis of rnap ii transcripts around   accordingly the expression profiling in hcle silenced cells studied by microarray analysis showed that among the genes that exhibited a differential expression under hcle silencing more than   were down regulated collectively these results indicate that hcle works as a positive modulator of the rna polymerase ii activity
