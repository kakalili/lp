the saccharomyces cerevisiae histone acetyltransferase gcn has a role in the photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair of uv induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the mfa gene edited by j karn
how dna repair enzymes or complexes gain access to chromatin is still not understood here we have studied the role of the s cerevisiae histone acetyltransferase gcn in photoreactivation pr and nucleotide excision repair ner at the level of the genome the mfa and rpb genes and at specific nucleotides within mfa  the deletion of gcn markedly reduced the pr and ner of uv induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in mfa but much less so in rpb  whereas no detectable defect was seen for repair of the genome overall in  gcn  the mfa mrna level is reduced by fourfold while transcription from rpb is reduced only to    these changes in transcription correlate with the changes in ner and pr found in the  gcn mutant however changes in mfa transcription cannot account for the decrease in ner in the non transcribed strand and the control region of mfa where global genome repair ggr operates we conclude that the histone acetyltransferase gcn influences pr and ner at mfa in both its transcribed and non transcribed dna yet it has little effect on these processes for most of the yeast genome as a result we speculate that histone acetylation allows efficient access of the repair machinery to chromosomal dna damages either indirectly via influencing transcription or directly via modifying chromatin structure irrespective of transcription
