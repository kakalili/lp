volume expansivity and isothermal compressibility changes associated with temperature and pressure unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease edited by c r mathews
we have characterized the temperature and pressure induced unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease snase using high precision densitometric measurements the changes in the apparent specific volume expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility were determined by these measurements to our knowledge these are the first measurements of the volume and isothermal compressibility changes of a protein undergoing pressure induced unfolding in order to aid in interpreting the temperature and pressure dependence of the apparent specific volume of snase we have also carried out differential scanning calorimetry under the solution conditions which are used for the volumetric studies we have seen that large compensating volume and compressibility effects accompany the temperature and pressure induced protein unfolding measurements of the apparent specific volume and thermal expansion coefficient of snase at ambient pressure indicate the formation of a pre transitional molten globule type of intermediate structure about   c below the actual unfolding temperature of the protein compared to the folded state the apparent specific volume of the unfolded protein is about      smaller in addition we investigated the pressure dependence of the apparent specific volume of snase at a number of different temperatures at   c we calculate a decrease in apparent specific volume due to pressure induced unfolding of        cm g   or    cm mol   the threefold increase in compressibility between  and  mpa reflects a transition to a partially unfolded state which is consistent with our results obtained for the radius of gyration of the pressure denatured state of snase at the lower temperature of   c a significant increase in compressibility around  mpa is indicative of the formation of a pressure induced molten globule like intermediate changes in the apparent volume expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility are discussed in terms of instrinsic hydrational and thermal contributions accompanying the unfolding transition
