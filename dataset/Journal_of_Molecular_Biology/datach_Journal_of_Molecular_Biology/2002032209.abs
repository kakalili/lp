identification of two middle promoters upstream dna ligase gene  of bacteriophage t  edited by m gottesman
bacteriophage t dna ligase gene  lies in the cluster of prereplicative genes located counterclockwise from map units   to   based on the early transcription studies this gene has been considered as a typical early gene of bacteriophage t  in agreement with this assignment two strong t early promoters pe       and pe        located about   and   kb upstream from gene  have been revealed by promoter mapping and sequence analysis in addition the existence of a putative early promoter just upstream of gene  was proposed from the sequence data however here we show that the putative early promoter just upstream of gene  is in fact a t middle promoter furthermore we detected one more middle promoter located in the genomic region between early promoter pe       and dna ligase gene  in the coding region of gene    both new middle promoters have differences from the consensus mota box while their    regions match the   consensus sequence very well the   ends of mota dependent transcripts directed from these promoters as well as the kinetics of   end accumulation in the cells have been determined by primer extension analysis the results of these analyses indicate that both mota dependent and mota independent promoters control the transcription of t dna ligase gene  in vivo moreover we show that the first transcripts for gene  are directed from its own middle promoter pm
