structure and function of the mouse dna methyltransferase gene dnmt shows a tripartite structure  edited by j karn
dnmt is the predominant dna methyltransferase mtase in mammals the c terminal domain of dnmt clearly shares sequence similarity with many prokaryotic mc methyltransferases and had been proposed to be sufficient for catalytic activity we show here by deletion analysis that the c terminal domain alone is not sufficient for methylating activity but that a large part of the n terminal domain is required in addition since this complex structure of dnmt raises issues about its evolutionary origin we have compared several eukaryotic mtases and have determined the genomic organization of the mouse dnmt gene the   most part of the n terminal domain is dispensible for enzyme activity includes the major nuclear import signal and comprises tissue specific exons interestingly the functional subdivision of dnmt correlates well with the structure of the dnmt gene in terms of intron exon size distribution as well as sequence conservation our results based on functional structural and sequence comparison data suggest that the gene has evolved from the fusion of at least three genes
