crystal structures of streptococcus pneumoniaen acetylglucosamine  phosphate uridyltransferase glmu in apo form at    resolution and in complex with udp n acetylglucosamine and mg  at    resolution
n acetylglucosamine  phosphate uridyltransferase glmu is an essential bacterial enzyme with both an acetyltransferase and a uridyltransferase activity which have been mapped to the c terminal and n terminal domains respectively glmu performs the last two steps in the synthesis of udp n acetylglucosamine udp glcnac  which is an essential precursor in both the peptidoglycan and the lipopolysaccharide metabolic pathways glmu is therefore an attractive target for potential antibiotics knowledge of its three dimensional structure would provide a basis for rational drug design we have determined the crystal structures of streptococcus pneumoniae glmu spglmu in apo form at    resolution and in complex with udp n acetyl glucosamine and the essential co factor mg  at    resolution the protein structure consists of an n terminal domain with an    fold containing the uridyltransferase active site and a c terminal domain with a long left handed  sheet helix l h domain an insertion loop containing the highly conserved sequence motif asn tyr asp gly protrudes from the left handed  sheet helix domain in the crystal s pneumoniae glmu forms exact trimers mainly through contacts between left handed  sheet helix domains udp n acetylglucosamine and mg  are bound at the uridyltransferase active site which is in a closed form we propose a uridyltransferase mechanism in which the activation energy of the double negatively charged phosphorane transition state is lowered by charge compensation of mg  and the side chain of lys
