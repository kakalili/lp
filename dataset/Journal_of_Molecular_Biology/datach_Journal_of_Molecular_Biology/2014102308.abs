phosphorylation and nucleotide binding induced changes to the stability and hydrogen exchange patterns of jnk   provide insight into its mechanisms of activation
many studies have characterized how changes to the stability and internal motions of a protein during activation can contribute to their catalytic function even when structural changes cannot be observed here unfolding studies and hydrogen  deuterium exchange hx mass spectrometry were used to investigate the changes to the stability and conformation conformational dynamics of jnk   induced by phosphorylative activation equivalent studies were also employed to determine the effects of nucleotide binding on both inactive and active jnk   using the atp analogue   adenylyl imidodiphosphate amp pnp  jnk   phosphorylation alters hx in regions involved in catalysis and substrate binding changes that can be ascribed to functional modifications in either structure and or backbone flexibility increased hx in the hinge between the n and c terminal domains implied that it acquires enhanced flexibility upon phosphorylation that may be a prerequisite for interdomain closure in combination with the finding that nucleotide binding destabilizes the kinase the patterns of solvent protection by amp pnp were consistent with a novel mode of nucleotide binding to the c terminal domain of a destabilized and open domain conformation of inactive jnk   solvent protection by amp pnp of both n and c terminal domains in active jnk   revealed that the domains close around nucleotide upon phosphorylation concomitantly stabilizing the kinase this suggests that phosphorylation activates jnk   in part by increasing hinge flexibility to facilitate interdomain closure and the creation of a functional active site by uncovering the complex interplay that occurs between nucleotide binding and phosphorylation we present new insight into the unique mechanisms by which jnk   is regulated
