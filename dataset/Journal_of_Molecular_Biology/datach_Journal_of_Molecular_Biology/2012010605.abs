pou f mediated activation of hgh n by deoxyribonuclease i hypersensitive site ii of the human growth hormone locus control region
the human growth hormone gene hgh n is regulated by a distal locus control region lcr composed of five deoxyribonuclease i hypersensitive sites hss  the region encompassing hsi and hsii contains the predominant pituitary somatotrope specific hgh n activation function of the lcr this activity was attributed primarily to pou f  pit  elements at hsi as linkage to hsi was sufficient for properly regulated hgh n expression in transgenic mice while hsii alone had no activity however the presence of hsii in conjunction with hsi further enhanced hgh n transgene expression indicating additional determinants of pituitary hgh n activation in the hsii region but limitations of transgenic models and previous ex vivo systems have prevented the characterization of hsii in the present study we employ a novel minichromosome model of the hgh n regulatory domain and show that hsii confers robust pou f dependent activation of hgh n in this system this effect was accompanied by pou f dependent histone acetylation and methylation throughout the minichromosome lcr hgh n domain a series of in vitro dna binding experiments revealed that pou f binds to multiple sites at hsii consistent with a direct role in hsii function remarkably pou f binding was localized in part to the   untranslated region of a primate specific line  long interspersed nuclear element  retrotransposon suggesting that its insertion during primate evolution may have conferred function to the hsii region in the context of pituitary gh gene regulation these observations clarify the function of hsii expanding the role of pou f in hgh lcr activity and provide insight on the molecular evolution of the lcr
