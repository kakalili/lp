biochemical and structural analysis of substrate promiscuity in plant mg  dependent o methyltransferases
plant s adenosyl l methionine dependent class i natural product o methyltransferases omts  related to animal catechol omts are dependent on bivalent cations and strictly specific for the meta position of aromatic vicinal dihydroxy groups while the primary activity of these class i enzymes is methylation of caffeoyl coenzyme a omts a distinct subset is able to methylate a wider range of substrates characterized by the promiscuous phenylpropanoid and flavonoid omt the observed broad substrate specificity resides in two regions the n terminus and a variable insertion loop near the c terminus which displays the lowest degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies structural and biochemical data based on site directed mutagenesis and domain exchange between the two enzyme types present evidence that only small topological changes among otherwise highly conserved  d structures are sufficient to differentiate between an enzymatic generalist and an enzymatic specialist in plant natural product methylation
