tagging ribosomal protein s allows rapid identification of mutants defective in assembly and function of  s subunits edited by d e draper
ribosomal protein s nucleates folding of the  s rrna   major domain which ultimately forms the head of the  s ribosomal subunit recent crystal structures indicate that s lies on the interface side of the  s subunit near the trna binding sites of the ribosome to map the functional surface of s  we have tagged the protein with a protein kinase a recognition site and engineered alanine substitutions that target each exposed conserved residue we have also deleted conserved features of s  using its structure to guide our design by radiolabeling the tag sequence using protein kinase a we are able to track the partitioning of each mutant protein into  s   s and polyribosome fractions in vivo overexpression of s confers a growth defect and we observe a striking correlation between this phenotype and proficiency in  s subunit assembly among our collection of mutants we find that the side chain of k  is required for efficient assembly of s into  s subunits in vivo whereas those of at least  other conserved exposed residues are not required in addition an s derivative lacking the n terminal  residues causes ribosomes to accumulate on mrna to abnormally high levels indicating that our approach can yield interesting mutant ribosomes
