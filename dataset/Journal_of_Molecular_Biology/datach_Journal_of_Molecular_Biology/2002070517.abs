the systematic substitutions around the conserved charged residues of the cytoplasmic loop of na driven flagellar motor component poma
poma a homolog of mota in the h driven flagellar motor is an essential component for torque generation in the na driven flagellar motor previous studies suggested that two charged residues r  and e  which are in the single cytoplasmic loop of mota are directly involved in this process these residues are conserved in poma of vibrio alginolyticus as r  and e  respectively to explore the role of these charged residues in the na driven motor we replaced them with other amino acids however unlike in the h driven motor both of the single and the double poma mutants were functional several other positively and negatively charged residues near r  and e  namely k  e  and e  were neutralized motility was retained in a strain producing the r a k a e q e q e q aaqqq poma protein the swimming speed of the aaqqq strain was as fast as that of the wild type poma strain but the direction of motor rotation was abnormally counterclockwise biased we could however isolate non motile or poorly motile mutants when certain charged residues in poma were reversed or neutralized the charged residues at positions     of poma may not be essential for torque generation in the na driven motor and might play a role in motor function different from that of the equivalent residues of the h driven motor
