opus dom applying the folding based method vecfold to determine protein domain boundaries
in this article we present a de novo method for predicting protein domain boundaries called opus dom the core of the method is a novel coarse grained folding method vecfold which constructs low resolution structural models from a target sequence by folding a chain of vectors representing the predicted secondary structure elements opus dom generates a large ensemble of folded structure decoys by vecfold and labels the domain boundaries of each decoy by a domain parsing algorithm consensus domain boundaries are then derived from the statistical distribution of the putative boundaries and three empirical sequence based domain profiles opus dom generally outperformed several state of the art domain prediction algorithms over various benchmark protein sets even though each vecfold generated structure contains large errors collectively these structures provide a more robust delineation of domain boundaries the success of opus dom suggests that the arrangement of protein domains is more a consequence of limited coordination patterns per domain arising from tertiary packing of secondary structure segments rather than sequence specific constraints
