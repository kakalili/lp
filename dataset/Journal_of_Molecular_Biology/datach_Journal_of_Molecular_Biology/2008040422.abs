rgia a novel conotoxin that blocks the     nachr structure and identification of key receptor binding residues
conotoxins are small disulfide constrained peptides from cone snails that act as antagonists at specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs  the  residue peptide  conotoxin rgia   rgia is a member of the    family of  conotoxins and selectively blocks the     nachr subtype in contrast to another well characterized member of this family   conotoxin imi   imi  which is a potent inhibitor of the   and    nachr subtypes in this study we have altered side chains in both the four residue and the three residue loops of  rgia and have modified its c terminus the effects of these changes on activity against     and   nachrs were measured the solution structures of  rgia and its y w d e and p v analogues were determined from nmr data and resonance assignments were made for  rgia r a  the structures for  rgia and its three analogues were well defined except at the chain termini comparison of these structures with reported structures of  imi reveals a common two loop backbone architecture within the    family but with variations in side chain solvent accessibility and orientation asp  pro  and arg in loop  are critical for blockade of both the     and the   subtypes in loop    rgia y w had activity near that of wild type  rgia with high potency for     and low potency for   and had a structure similar to that of wild type by contrast arg in loop  is critical for specific binding to the     subtype probably because it is larger and more solvent accessible than ala in  imi our findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis for antagonism of the     nachr subtype which is a target for the development of analgesics for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain
