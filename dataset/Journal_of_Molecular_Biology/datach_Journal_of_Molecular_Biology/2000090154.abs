in vitro evolution of the hammerhead ribozyme to a purine specific ribozyme using mutagenic pcr with two nucleotide analogues edited by j karn
the conventional hammerhead ribozyme cleaves rna   to nucleotide triplets with the general formula nuh where n is any nucleotide u is uridine and h is any nucleotide except guanosine in order to isolate hammerhead ribozyme sequences capable of cleaving   to the gug triplet we performed a mutagenic selection protocol starting with the conventional sequence of an nuh cleaving ribozyme the  nucleotides in the core and the stem loop ii region were subjected to mutagenic pcr using the two nucleotide analogues   deoxy  d ribofuranosyl   dihydro h pyrimido   c    oxazin  one and of  oxo   deoxyguanosine after five repetitions of the selection cycle several clones showed cleavage activity one sequence having one deletion showed at least a  times higher in trans cleavage rate than the starting ribozyme it cleaved   to gug and gua the sequence of this ribozyme is essentially identical with that obtained previously by selection for aug cleavage starting with a randomised core and stem loop ii region this identical result of two independent selection procedures supports the notion that sequences for nur cleavage where r is a purine nucleotide are not compatible with the classical hammerhead structure and that the sequence space for this cleavage specificity is very limited the cleavage of nur triplets is not restricted to the sequence of the substrate that was used for selection but is sequence independent for in trans cleavage although the sequence context influences the value for the cleavage rate somewhat analysis of cleavage activities indicates the importance of a at position l  in loop ii
