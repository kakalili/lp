Synthetic antibody libraries have proven immensely useful for the de novo isolation of antibodies without the need for animal immunization. Recently, focused libraries designed to recognize particular classes of ligands, such as haptens or proteins, have been employed to facilitate the selection of high-affinity antibodies. Focused libraries are built using V regions encoding combinations of canonical structures that resemble the structural features of antibodies that bind the desired class of ligands and sequence diversity is introduced at residues typically involved in recognition. Here we describe the generation and experimental validation of two different single-chain antibody variable fragment libraries that efficiently generate binders to peptides, a class of molecules that has proven to be a difficult target for antibody generation. First, a human anti-peptide library was constructed by diversifying a scaffold: the human variable heavy chain (VH) germ line gene 3-23, which was fused to a variant of the human variable light chain (VL) germ line gene A27, in which L1 was modified to encode the canonical structure found in anti-peptide antibodies. The sequence diversity was introduced into 3-23 (VH) only, targeting for diversification residues commonly found in contact with protein and peptide antigens. Second, a murine library was generated using the antibody 26-10, which was initially isolated based on its affinity to the hapten digoxin, but also binds peptides and exhibits a canonical structure pattern typical of anti-peptide antibodies. Diversity was introduced in the VH only using the profile of amino acids found at positions that frequently contact peptide antigens. Both libraries yielded binders to two model peptides, angiotensin and neuropeptide Y, following screening by solution phage panning. The mouse library yielded antibodies with affinities below 20Â nM to both targets, although only the VH had been subjected to diversification.
