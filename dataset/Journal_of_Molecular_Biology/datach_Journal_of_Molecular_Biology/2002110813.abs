observation of slow dynamic exchange processes in ras protein crystals by  p solid state nmr spectroscopy
the folding structure and biological function of many proteins are inherently dynamic properties of the protein molecule often the respective molecular processes are preserved upon protein crystallization leading in x ray diffraction experiments to a blurring of the electron density map and reducing the resolution of the derived structure nuclear magnetic resonance nmr is known to be an alternative method to study molecular structure and dynamics we designed and built a probe for phosphorus solid state nmr that allows for the first time to study static properties as well as dynamic processes in single crystals of a protein by nmr spectroscopy the sensitivity achieved is sufficient to detect the nmr signal from individual phosphorus sites in a  mm size single crystal of gtpase ras bound to the nucleotide gppnhp that is the signal from approximately   phosphorus nuclei the nmr spectra obtained are discussed in terms of the conformational variability of the active center of the ras  nucleotide complex we conclude that in the crystal the protein complex exists in three different conformations magic angle spinning mas nmr spectra of a powder sample of ras  gppnhp show a splitting of one of the phosphate resonances and thus confirm this conclusion the mas spectra provide furthermore evidence of a slow temperature dependent dynamic exchange process in the ras protein crystal
