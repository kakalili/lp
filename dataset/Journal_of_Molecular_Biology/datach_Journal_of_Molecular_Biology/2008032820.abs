the last step in cephalosporin c formation revealed crystal structures of deacetylcephalosporin c acetyltransferase from acremonium chrysogenum in complexes with reaction intermediates
deacetylcephalosporin c acetyltransferase dac at catalyses the last step in the biosynthesis of cephalosporin c a broad spectrum  lactam antibiotic of large clinical importance the acetyl transfer step has been suggested to be limiting for cephalosporin c biosynthesis but has so far escaped detailed structural analysis we present here the crystal structures of dac at in complexes with reaction intermediates providing crystallographic snapshots of the reaction mechanism the enzyme is found to belong to the    hydrolase class of acetyltransferases and the structures support previous observations of a double displacement mechanism for the acetyl transfer reaction in other members of this class of enzymes the structures of dac at reported here provide evidence of a stable acyl  enzyme complex thus underpinning a mechanism involving acetylation of a catalytic serine residue by acetyl coenzyme a followed by transfer of the acetyl group to deacetylcephalosporin c through a suggested tetrahedral transition state
