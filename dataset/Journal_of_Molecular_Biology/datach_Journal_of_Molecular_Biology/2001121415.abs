unrestrained  ns molecular dynamics simulation of a cisplatin dna   gg adduct provides a rationale for the nmr features and reveals increased conformational flexibility at the platinum binding site edited by i tinoco
a  ns unrestrained molecular dynamics md simulation of the dna duplex d gccg  g  atcgc d gcgatccggc  bearing a cis pt nh   unit crosslinking the two g  guanine bases is reported the md trajectory was a posteriori correlated with nmr data determined for the same adduct and it is shown that interproton distances and the characteristic chemical shifts are accounted for by the simulation the simulation and its confrontation with the nmr data have confirmed the finding derived early from static models that the cytosine complementary to the   g   c  is mobile with respect to its adjacent bases however in contrast to our previous description of this mobility which included rupture of the watson crick hydrogen bonds and formation of non watson crick hydrogen bonds the md simulation indicated that the g   c  pair moves continuously along a trajectory roughly perpendicular to the local helix axis with retention of all three watson crick hydrogen bonds the simulation indicated the reversible formation of a hydrogen bond between the   oriented nh ligand of platinum and the c pg   phosphate group in accord with our former prediction furthermore the simulation has disclosed previously undetected bi   bii transitions at the g  pa and a pt steps connected to formation rupture of a hydrogen bond between the   oriented nh ligand of platinum and the n atom of a  all these conformational equilibria affect the form of the minor groove and increase the conformational flexibility at the platination site and are thus likely to facilitate recognition by cellular proteins
