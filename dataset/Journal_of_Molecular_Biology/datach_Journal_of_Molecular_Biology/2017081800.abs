revisiting the structure of hemoglobin and myoglobin with cryo electron microscopy
sixty years ago the first protein structure of myoglobin was determined by john kendrew and his colleagues hemoglobin followed shortly thereafter for quite some time it seemed that only x ray crystallography would be capable of determining the structure of proteins to high resolution in recent years cryo electron microscopy has emerged as a viable alternative and indeed in many cases the preferred approach it is capable of studying proteins that span a size range from several megadaltons to proteins as small as myoglobin and hemoglobin
