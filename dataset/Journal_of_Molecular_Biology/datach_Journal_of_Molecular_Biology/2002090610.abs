quantifying  sheet stability by phage display
the small immunoglobulin g igg binding protein gb is a favored model system for the study of individual residue contributions to the stability of  sheets nevertheless only a few of the many possible combinations of mutations have been characterized leaving many questions unanswered in order to allow the simultaneous evaluation of libraries of mutants we have adapted a phage display method called shotgun scanning this method combines a binding i e stability selection with high throughput sequence analysis relative folding free energies determined from gb phage sequence data agree well with published gb thermal stability studies validating the use of phage display to conduct quantitative stability studies on gb  and further suggesting that this method is generally applicable to mutational analysis of protein stability examination of residue pairing in our large collection of gb mutants indicates that specific side chain  side chain interactions are much less important to  sheet stability than individual residue contributions the discrepancy between this observation and published studies can be traced to anomalous stability of the alanine substituted gb variants typically used as reference states in double mutant cycle analyses finally the combination of large library sizes and a quantitative stability selection should allow phage based  computation  to be applied to protein design problems
