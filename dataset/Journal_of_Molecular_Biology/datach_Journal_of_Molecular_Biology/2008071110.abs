intron retention as a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism of neurotoxin expression at early life stages of the starlet anemone nematostella vectensis
sea anemones use an arsenal of peptide neurotoxins accumulated in special stinging cells nematocytes for defense and predation intriguingly genomic analysis of nematostella vectensis revealed only a single toxin nv  n vectensis toxin   encoded by multiple extremely conserved genes we examined the toxic potential of nv and whether it is produced by the three developmental stages embryo planula and polyp of nematostella nv was expressed in recombinant form and similarly to type i sea anemone toxins inhibited the inactivation of voltage gated sodium channels however in contrast to the other toxins nv revealed high specificity for insect over mammalian voltage gated sodium channels transcript analysis indicated that multiple nv loci are transcribed at all developmental stages of n vectensis whereas splicing of these transcripts is restricted to the polyp stage this finding suggests that regulation of nv synthesis is posttranscriptional and that the embryo and planula stages do not produce the nv toxin this rare phenomenon of intron retention at the early developmental stages is intriguing and raises the question as to the mechanism enabling such differential expression in sea anemones
