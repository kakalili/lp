the   kda subunit of the cpsf complex binds to the hiv  ltr promoter and functions as a negative regulatory factor that is inhibited by the hiv  tat protein
gene expression in eukaryotes requires the post transcriptional cleavage of mrna precursors into mature mrnas the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor cpsf is critical for this process and its   kda subunit cpsf   mediates cleavage coupled to polyadenylation and histone pre mrna processing using cpsf  over expression and sirna mediated knockdown experiments this study identifies cpsf  as an important regulatory protein that represses the basal transcriptional activity of the hiv  ltr promoter similar results were found with over expression of the cpsf  homologue rc   but not with cpsf   kda subunit cpsf   and rc   chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the physical interaction of cpsf  with the hiv  ltr promoter further experiments revealed indirect cpsf  binding to the region between    to    within the   upstream region functional assays revealed the importance for the   upstream region     to     of the ltr for cpsf  mediated transcription repression we also show that hiv  tat protein interacts with cpsf  and counteracts its repressive activity on the hiv  ltr promoter our results clearly show a novel function for cpsf  and add another candidate protein for explaining the molecular mechanisms underlying hiv  latency
