polar n terminal residues conserved in type  secretion pseudopilins determine subunit targeting and membrane extraction steps during fibre assembly
bacterial type  secretion systems t ss  type  pili and archaeal flagella assemble fibres from initially membrane embedded pseudopilin and pilin subunits fibre subunits are made as precursors with positively charged n terminal anchors whose cleavage via the prepilin peptidase essential for pilin membrane extraction and assembly is followed by n methylation of the mature pseudo pilin n terminus the conserved glu residue at position  e  of mature pseudo pilins is essential for assembly unlike t pilins where e residue substitutions also abolish n methylation the e a variant of t ss pseudopilin pulg remains n methylated but is affected in interaction with the t ss component pulm here biochemical and functional analyses showed that the pulm interaction defect only partly accounts for the pulge a assembly defect first pulgt a variant equally defective in pulm interaction remained partially functional furthermore pseudopilus assembly defect of pulg e a mutant was stronger than that of the pulm deletion mutant to understand the dominant effect of e a mutation we used molecular dynamics simulations of pulge a methylated pulgwt mepulgwt  and mepulge a variant in a model membrane these simulations pointed to a key role for an intramolecular interaction between the pseudopilin n terminal amine and e to limit polar interactions with membrane phospholipids n methylation of the n terminal amine further limited its interactions with phospholipid head groups to facilitate pseudopilin membrane escape by binding to polar residues in the conserved n terminal region of pulg we propose that pulm acts as chaperone to promote pseudopilin recruitment and coordinate its membrane extraction with subsequent steps of the fibre assembly process
