amyloidogenic propensities and conformational properties of proiapp and iapp in the presence of lipid bilayer membranes
human islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp  which is considered the primary culprit for  cell loss in type  diabetes mellitus patients is synthesized in  cells of the pancreas from its precursor pro islet amyloid polypeptide proiapp  which may be important in early intracellular amyloid formation as well we compare the amyloidogenic propensities and conformational properties of proiapp and hiapp in the presence of negatively charged lipid membranes which have been discussed as loci of initiation of the fibrillation reaction circular dichroism studies verify the initial secondary structures of proiapp and hiapp to be predominantly unordered with small amounts of ordered secondary structure elements and exhibit minor differences between these two peptides only using attenuated total reflection  fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thioflavin t fluorescence spectroscopy as well as atomic force microscopy we show that in the presence of negatively charged membranes proiapp exhibits a much higher amyloidogenic propensity than in bulk solvent compared to hiapp it is still much less amyloidogenic however although differences in the secondary structures of the aggregated species of hiapp and proiapp at the lipid interface are small they are reflected in morphological changes unlike hiapp proiapp forms essentially oligomeric like structures at the lipid interface besides the interaction with anionic membranes   dioleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dopc x  dioleoyl sn glycero  phospho rac  glycerol   interaction with zwitterionic homogeneous dopc and heterogeneous   dipalmitoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dopc cholesterol    model raft mixture membranes has also been studied both peptides do not aggregate significantly at dopc bilayers in the presence of the model raft membrane hiapp aggregates markedly as well conversely proiapp clusters into less ordered structures and to a minor extent at raft membranes only the addition of proiapp to hiapp retards the hiapp fibrillation process also in the presence of negatively charged lipid bilayers in excess proiapp increased aggregation levels are finally observed however which could be attributed to seed induced cofibrillation of proiapp
