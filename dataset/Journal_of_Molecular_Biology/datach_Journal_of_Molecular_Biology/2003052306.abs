an atomic model for actin binding by the ch domains and spectrin repeat modules of utrophin and dystrophin
utrophin and dystrophin link cytoskeletal f actin filaments to the plasmalemma genetic strategies to replace defective dystrophin with utrophin in individuals with muscular dystrophy requires full characterization of these proteins both contain homologous n terminal actin binding motifs composed of a pair of calponin homology ch domains ch and ch  that are connected by spectrin repeat modules to c terminal membrane binding sequences here electron microscopy and d reconstruction of f actin decorated with utrophin and dystrophin actin binding constructs were performed using utr   utrophin s ch domain pair  utr   utrophin s ch domains and first spectrin repeat and dys   dystrophin s ch domain pair  the lozenge like utrophin ch domain densities localized to the upper surface of actin subdomain  and extended azimuthally over subdomain  toward subdomains  and  the cylinder shaped spectrin repeat was located at the end of the ch domain pair and was aligned longitudinally along the cleft between inner and outer actin domains where tropomyosin is present when on thin filaments the connection between the spectrin repeat module and the ch domains defined the orientation of ch and ch on actin resolution of utrophin s ch domains and spectrin repeats permitted docking of crystal structures into respective em densities leading to an atomic model where both ch and spectrin domains bind actin the ch domain  actin interaction for dystrophin was found to be more complex than for utrophin binding assays showed that utr  and utr  interacted with f actin as monomers whereas dys  appeared to associate as a dimer consistent with a bilobed dys  structure observed on f actin in electron microscope reconstructions one of the lobes was similar in shape position and orientation to the monomeric ch domains of utr   while the other lobe apparently represented a second set of ch domains in the dimeric dys   the extensive contact made by dystrophin on actin may be used in vivo to help muscles dissipate mechanical stress from the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix
