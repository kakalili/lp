mechanism based inhibitors of cytokinin oxidase dehydrogenase attack fad cofactor
cytokinin oxidases dehydrogenases ckos mediate catabolic regulation of cytokinin levels in plants several substrate analogs containing an unsaturated side chain were studied for their possible inhibitory effect on maize cko zmcko  by use of various bioanalytical methods two allenic derivatives n  buta   dienyl adenine ha  and n  penta   dienyl adenine ha   were identified as strong mechanism based inhibitors of the enzyme despite exhaustive dialysis the enzyme remained inhibited conversely substrate analogs with a triple bond in the side chain were much weaker inactivators the crystal structures of recombinant zmcko complexed with ha  or ha  were solved to     resolution together with raman spectra of the inactivated enzyme it was revealed that reactive imine intermediates generated by oxidation of the allenic inhibitors covalently bind to the flavin adenine dinucleotide fad cofactor the binding occurs at the c a atom of the isoalloxazine ring of fad the planarity of which is consequently disrupted all the compounds under study were also analyzed for binding to the arabidopsis cytokinin receptors ahk and ahk in a bacterial receptor assay and for cytokinin activity in the amaranthus bioassay ha  and ha  were found to be good receptor ligands with a significant cytokinin activity nevertheless due to their ability to inactivate cko in the desired time intervals or developmental stages they both represent attractive compounds for physiological studies as the inhibition mechanism of ha  and ha  is mainly fad dependent
