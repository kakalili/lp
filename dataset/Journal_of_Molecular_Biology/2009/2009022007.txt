NhaA, the main sodium–proton exchanger in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli, regulates the cytosolic concentrations of H and Na. It is inactive at acidic pH, becomes active between pH 6 and pH 7, and reaches maximum activity at pH 8. By cryo-electron microscopy of two-dimensional crystals grown at pH 4 and incubated at higher pH, we identified two sequential conformational changes in the protein in response to pH or substrate ions. The first change is induced by a rise in pH from 6 to 7 and marks the transition from the inactive state to the pH-activated state. pH activation, which precedes the ion-induced conformational change, is accompanied by an overall expansion of the NhaA monomer and a local ordering of the N-terminus. The second conformational change is induced by the substrate ions Na and Li at pH above 7 and involves a 7-Å displacement of helix IVp. This movement would cause a charge imbalance at the ion-binding site that may trigger the release of the substrate ion and open a periplasmic exit channel.
