influence of strand number on antiparallel  sheet stability in designed three and four stranded  sheets
we describe experiments that probe whether antiparallel  sheet secondary structure becomes more stable as the number of strands increases several groups including ours have explored this issue with pepides designed to adopt three stranded  sheet conformations but the conclusions have not been consistent in this study we examine the effect on conformational stability of  sheet lengthening perpendicular to the strand direction via analysis of designed peptides that adopt three stranded or four stranded antiparallel  sheet conformations in aqueous solution the findings reported here along with the context provided by earlier studies suggest that antiparallel  sheet does in general become more stable when the number of strands is increased from two to three we show that this conclusion is not influenced by the rigidity of the loop segment used to link adjacent  strands d pro gly versus asn gly  we show that further extension from three strands to four leads to a further increase in antiparallel  sheet stability
