the pax paired domain and homeodomain function as a single binding module in vivo to regulate subnuclear localization and mobility by a mechanism that requires base specific recognition
the transcription factor pax is essential for myogenesis and neural crest development and is one of several genes mutated in human waardenburg syndrome analysis of disease causing missense mutations in pax has established the interdependence of its two dna binding domains the paired domain pd and the homeodomain hd  as well as defects in localization and mobility paradoxically mutants that retained dna binding activity exhibited the greatest defects in localization and mobility regardless of the domain in which they reside in the present study structure  function analyses were used to determine the mechanistic basis of this effect in the context of the isolated dna binding domains hd mutants adopted an increase in mobility proportional to their loss in dna binding while pd mutants continued to display the inverse relationship observed in the full length protein at the structural level this reflected an unexpected dependence on base specific contacts in the pd whereas hd mobility was more severely affected by loss of backbone contacts as has been observed with other dna binding proteins this requires that the hd switch to a base specific mode in the full length protein moreover both domains underwent substantial reduction in mobility and altered localization when in a contiguous polypeptide with the endogenous linker segment notably although the hd conferred localization to heterochromatin this activity was masked when linked to the pd despite the absence of determinants for subnuclear compartmentalization in the pd or linker last the propensity for pax heterochromatin localization was modulated by sequences at the amino and carboxy termini supporting a model in which alternate conformations lead to unmasking of the hd these data indicate that the pd and the hd functionally interact in vivo and behave as a single binding module whose mobility and localization are dependent on sequence specific contacts
