exploring the biological and chemical complexity of the ligases
using a novel method to map and cluster chemical reactions we have re examined the chemistry of the ligases enzyme commission ec class  and their associated protein families in detail the type of bond formed by the ligase can be automatically extracted from the equation of the reaction replicating the ec subclass division however this subclass division hides considerable complexities especially for the c  n forming ligases which fall into at least three distinct types the lower levels of the ec classification for ligases are somewhat arbitrary in their definition and add little to understanding their chemistry or evolution by comparing the multi domain architecture of the enzymes and using sequence similarity networks we examined the links between overall reaction and evolution of the ligases these show that whilst many enzymes that perform the same overall chemistry group together both convergent similar function different ancestral lineage and divergent different function common ancestor evolution of function are observed however a common theme is that a single conserved domain often the nucleoside triphosphate binding domain is combined with ancillary domains that provide the variation in substrate binding and function
