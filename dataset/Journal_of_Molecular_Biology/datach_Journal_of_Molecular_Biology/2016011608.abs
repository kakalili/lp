insights from the structure of mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase i with a novel protein fold
the dna topoisomerase i enzyme of mycobacterium tuberculosis mttop  is essential for the viability of the organism and survival in a murine model this topoisomerase is being pursued as a novel target for the discovery of new therapeutic agents for the treatment of drug resistant tuberculosis in this study we succeeded in obtaining a structure of mttop by first predicting that the c terminal region of mttop contains four repeated domains that do not involve the zn binding tetracysteine motifs seen in the c terminal domains of escherichia coli topoisomerase i a construct amino acids a  t   mttop   t that includes the n terminal domains d  d  and the first predicted c terminal domain d  of mttop was expressed and found to retain dna cleavage  religation activity and catalyze single stranded dna catenation mttop   t was crystallized and a structure of    resolution limit was obtained the structure of the mttop n terminal domains has features that have not been observed in other previously available bacterial topoisomerase i crystal structures the first c terminal domain d forms a novel protein fold of a four stranded antiparallel  sheet stabilized by a crossing over  helix since there is only one type ia topoisomerase present in mycobacteriaceae and related actinobacteria this subfamily of type ia topoisomerase may be required for multiple functions in dna replication transcription recombination and repair the unique structural features observed for mttop may allow these topoisomerase i enzymes to carry out physiological functions associated with topoisomerase iii enzyme in other bacteria
