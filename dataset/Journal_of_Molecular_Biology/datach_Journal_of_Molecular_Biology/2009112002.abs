sox represses  sarcoglycan gene expression in early myogenic differentiation
alpha sarcoglycan   sg is highly expressed in differentiated striated muscle and its disruption causes limb girdle muscular dystrophy accordingly the myogenic master regulator myod finely modulates its expression however the mechanisms preventing  sg gene expression at early stages of myogenic differentiation remain unknown in this study we uncovered sox  which was not previously known to directly bind muscle gene promoters as a negative regulator of  sg gene expression reporter gene and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed three functional sox binding sites that mediate  sg promoter activity repression during early myogenic differentiation in addition we show that sox mediated inhibition of  sg gene expression is independent of myod moreover we provide evidence suggesting that smad enhances the repressive activity of sox over  sg gene expression in a transforming growth factor  dependent manner on the basis of these results we propose that sox and smad are responsible for preventing precocious activation of  sg gene expression during myogenic differentiation
