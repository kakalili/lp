a conserved glu  arg salt bridge connects coevolved motifs that define the eukaryotic protein kinase fold
eukaryotic protein kinases epks feature two coevolved structural segments the activation segment which starts with the asp phe gly dfg and ends with the ala pro glu ape motifs and the helical ghi subdomain that comprises  g   h   i helices eukaryotic like kinases have a much shorter activation segment and lack the ghi subdomain they thus lack the conserved salt bridge interaction between the ape glu and an arg from the ghi subdomain a hallmark signature of epks although the conservation of this salt bridge in epks is well known and its implication in diseases has been illustrated by polymorphism analysis its function has not been carefully studied in this work we use murine camp dependent protein kinase protein kinase a as the model enzyme glu  and arg   to examine the role of these two residues we showed that ala replacement of either residue caused a   to   fold decrease in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme due to an increase in km atp and a decrease in kcat crystal structures as well as solution studies also demonstrate that this ion pair contributes to the hydrophobic network and stability of the enzyme we show that mutation of either glu or arg to ala renders both mutant proteins less effective substrates for upstream kinase phosphoinositide dependent kinase  we propose that the glu   arg  pair serves as a center hub of connectivity between these two structurally conserved elements in epks mutations of either residue disrupt communication not only between the two segments but also within the rest of the molecule leading to altered catalytic activity and enzyme regulation
