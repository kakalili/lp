crystal structures of mouse cd d igb complex and its cognate v   t cell receptor suggest a model for dual recognition of foreign and self glycolipids
the semi invariant v  j   t cell receptor tcr is expressed by regulatory nkt cells and has the unique ability to recognize chemically diverse ligands presented by cd d the crystal structure of cd d complexed to a natural endogenous ligand isoglobotrihexosylceramide igb  illustrates the extent of this diversity when compared to the binding of potent exogenous ligands such as  galactosylceramide   galcer  a single mode of recognition for these two classes of ligands would then appear problematic for a single t cell receptor however the v   tcr adopts two different conformations in the crystal where in one configuration the presence of a larger cavity between the two cdr regions could accommodate igb and in the other a smaller cavity fits  galcer more snugly alternatively the extended igb headgroup could be  squashed  upon docking of the tcr and accommodated between the cd and tcr surfaces thus the same tcr may adopt alternative modes of recognition for these foreign and self ligands for nkt cell activation
