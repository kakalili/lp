a role for the basic patch and the c terminus of rangtp in regulating the dynamic interactions with importin   crm and ranbp
transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm involves the recognition of intrinsic localization signals by either import or export receptors the interaction of the receptors with their cargo is regulated by the small gtpase ran in its gtp bound state we have investigated the interaction of rangtp with the import factor importin   the export factor crm  and the ran binding protein ranbp  in solution importin  specifically protected residues in the switch regions and basic patch region of ran against proteolytic cleavage whereas ranbp protected the c terminus moreover the binding of importin  induced a conformational change in the structure of ran leading to an exposure of the c terminus and stimulated the binding of ranbp  mutating the basic patch hrkk   of ran resulted in an increased binding of ranbp and weakened importin  binding in contrast to wild type ran the mutant ran could be released from importin  independently of importin   these data provide experimental support for a model in which the accessibility of the c terminus of ran is influenced by an intramolecular interaction between the basic patch and the c terminal acidic dedddl  motif binding of importin  probably disrupts this interaction causing an exposure of the c terminal extension which is favorable for ranbp binding interestingly basic patch mutations abolish crm interaction indicating that the determinants for rangtp binding to the export factor crm  is different from the import factor importin
