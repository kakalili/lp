multiple monovalent ion dependent pathways for the folding of the l  tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme
synchrotron hydroxyl radical  oh footprinting is a technique that monitors the local changes in solvent accessibility of the rna backbone on milliseconds to minutes time scales the mg  dependent folding of the l  sca  tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme has been followed using this technique at an elevated concentration of monovalent ion   mm nacl and as a function of the initial annealing conditions and substrate previous studies conducted at low concentrations of monovalent ion displayed sequential folding of the p  p domain the peripheral helices and the catalytic core with each protection displaying monophasic kinetics for ribozyme annealed in buffer containing  mm nacl and folded by the addition of  mm mgcl  multiple kinetic phases are observed for  oh protections throughout the ribozyme the independently folding p  p domain is the first to fold with its protections displaying     burst phase amplitudes that the folding of p  p within the ribozyme does not display the   burst phase of isolated p  p at  mm nacl shows that interactions with the remainder of the ribozyme impede this domain s folding in addition  oh protections constituting each side of a tertiary contact are not coincident in some cases consistent with the formation of transient non native interactions while the peripheral contacts and triple helical scaffold exhibit substantial burst phases the slowest protection to appear is j  in the catalytic core which displays a minimal burst amplitude and whose formation is coincident with the recovery of catalytic activity the number of kinetic phases as well as their amplitudes and rates are different when the ribozyme is annealed in low salt buffer and folded by the concomitant addition of monovalent and divalent cations annealed substrate changes the partitioning of the ribozyme among the multiple folding populations these results provide a map of the early steps in the ribozyme s folding landscape and the degree to which the preferred pathways are dependent upon the initial reaction conditions
