structural and functional linkages between subunit interfaces in mammalian pyruvate kinase
mammalian pyruvate kinase pk is a four domain enzyme that is active as a homo tetramer tissue specific isozymes of pk exhibit distinct levels of allosteric regulation pk expressed in muscle tissue m pk shows hyperbolic steady state kinetics whereas pk expressed in kidney tissue m pk displays sigmoidal kinetics rabbit m and m pk are isozymes whose sequences differ in only  out of   residues per subunit and these changes are localized in an inter subunit interface previous studies have shown that a single amino acid mutation to m pk at either the y s  p or z t  m subunit interface can confer a level of allosteric regulation that is intermediate to m pk and m pk in an effort to elucidate the roles of the inter subunit interaction in signal transmission and the functional structural connectivity between these interfaces the s  p mutant of m pk was crystallized and its structure resolved to    although the overall s  p m pk structure is nearly identical with the wild type structure within experimental error significant differences in the conformation of the backbone are found at the site of mutation along the y interface in addition there is a significant change along the z interface namely a loss of an inter subunit salt bridge between asp  of domain b and arg  of domain a of the opposing subunit concurrent with the loss of the salt bridge is an increase in the degree of rotational flexibility of domain b that constitutes the active site comparison of previous pk structures shows a correlation between an increase in this domain movement with the loss of the asp   arg  salt bridge these results identify the structural linkages between the y and z interfaces in regulating the interconversion of conformational states of rabbit m pk
