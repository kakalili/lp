probing interactions between clip   eb  and microtubules
cytoplasmic linker protein   clip   is a microtubule mt plus end tracking protein  tip that dynamically localizes to the mt plus end and regulates mt dynamics the mechanisms of these activities remain unclear because the clip    mt interaction is poorly understood and even less is known about how clip   and other tips act together as a network clip   binds to the acidic c terminal tail of  tubulin however the observation that clip   has two cap gly cytoskeleton associated protein glycine rich motifs and multiple serine rich regions suggests that a single clip   molecule has multiple tubulin binding sites and that these sites might bind to multiple parts of the tubulin dimer using a combination of chemical cross linking and mass spectrometry we find that clip   binds to both  tubulin and  tubulin and that binding is not limited to the acidic c terminal tails we provide evidence that these additional binding sites include the h  helices of both  tubulin and  tubulin and are significant for clip   activity previous work has shown that clip   binds to end binding protein  eb  via the eb c terminus which mimics the acidic c terminal tail of tubulin we find that clip   can utilize its multiple tubulin binding sites to bind to eb and mt simultaneously these observations help to explain how clip   can nucleate mts and alter mt dynamics and they contribute to understanding the significance and properties of the tip network
