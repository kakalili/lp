substrate shuttling between active sites of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is not required to generate coproporphyrinogen
uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase uro d ec      the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway is required for the production of heme vitamin b  siroheme and chlorophyll precursors uro d catalyzes the sequential decarboxylation of four acetate side chains in the pyrrole groups of uroporphyrinogen to produce coproporphyrinogen uro d is a stable homodimer with the active site clefts of the two subunits adjacent to each other it has been hypothesized that the two catalytic centers interact functionally perhaps by shuttling of reaction intermediates between subunits we tested this hypothesis by construction of a single chain protein single chain uro d in which the two subunits were connected by a flexible linker the crystal structure of this protein was shown to be superimposable with wild type activity and to have comparable catalytic activity mutations that impaired one or the other of the two active sites of single chain uro d resulted in approximately half of wild type activity the distributions of reaction intermediates were the same for mutant and wild type sequences and were unaltered in a competition experiment using i and iii isomer substrates these observations indicate that communication between active sites is not required for enzyme function and suggest that the dimeric structure of uro d is required to achieve conformational stability and to create a large active site cleft
