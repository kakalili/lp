crystal structures of glycosyltransferase ugt g reveal the molecular basis for glycosylation and deglycosylation of iso flavonoids
the glycosyltransferase ugt g from medicago truncatula catalyzes the glycosylation of various iso flavonoids such as the flavonols kaempferol and myricetin the isoflavone formononetin and the anthocyanidins pelargonidin and cyanidin it also catalyzes a reverse reaction to remove the sugar moiety from glycosides the structures of ugt g bound with uridine diphosphate or with both uridine diphosphate and myricetin were determined at     resolution revealing detailed interactions between the enzyme and substrates products and suggesting a distinct binding mode for the acceptor product comparative structural analysis and mutagenesis identify glutamate   as a key amino acid for the reverse reaction this information provides a basis for enzyme engineering to manipulate substrate specificity and to design effective biocatalysts with glycosylation and or deglycosylation activity
