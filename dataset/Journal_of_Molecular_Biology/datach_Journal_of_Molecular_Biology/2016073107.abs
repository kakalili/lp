pironetin binds covalently to  cys  and perturbs a major loop and helix of  tubulin to inhibit microtubule formation
microtubule targeting agents are among the most powerful drugs used in chemotherapy to treat cancer patients pironetin is a natural product that displays promising anticancer properties by binding to and potently inhibiting tubulin assembly into microtubules however its molecular mechanism of action remained obscure here we solved the crystal structure of the tubulin  pironetin complex and found that the compound covalently binds to cys  of  tubulin the structure further revealed that pironetin perturbs the t loop and helix h of  tubulin since both these elements are essential for establishing longitudinal tubulin contacts in microtubules this result explains how pironetin inhibits the formation of microtubules together our data define the molecular details of the pironetin binding site on  tubulin and thus offer a promising basis for the rational design of pironetin variants with improved activity profiles they further extend our knowledge on strategies evolved by natural products to target and perturb the microtubule cytoskeleton
