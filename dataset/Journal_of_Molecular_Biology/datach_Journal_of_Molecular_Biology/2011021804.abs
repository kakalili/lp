a new clustering of antibody cdr loop conformations
previous analyses of the complementarity determining regions cdrs of antibodies have focused on a small number of  canonical  conformations for each loop this is primarily the result of the work of chothia and coworkers most recently in    because of the widespread utility of antibodies we have revisited the clustering of conformations of the six cdr loops with the much larger amount of structural information currently available in this work we were careful to use a high quality data set by eliminating low resolution structures and cdrs with high b factors or high conformational energies we used a distance function based on directional statistics and an effective clustering algorithm with affinity propagation with this data set of over   nonredundant antibody structures we were able to cover  cdr  length combinations e g  l length   or  l     in our cdr length nomenclature for l  l  l  h  and h  the chothia analysis covered only  cdr lengths only four of these had more than one conformational cluster of which two could easily be distinguished by gene source mouse human     and one could easily be distinguished purely by the presence and the positions of pro residues l    thus using the chothia analysis does not require the complicated set of  structure determining residues  that is often assumed of our  cdr lengths   have multiple conformational clusters including  for which the chothia analysis had only one canonical class we have a total of  clusters for non h cdrs approximately   of the non h sequences can be assigned to a conformational cluster based on gene source and or sequence we found that earlier predictions of  bulged  versus  nonbulged  conformations based on the presence or the absence of anchor residues arg lys  and asp  of h have not held up since all four combinations lead to a majority of conformations that are bulged thus the earlier analyses have been significantly enhanced by the increased data we believe that the new classification will lead to improved methods for antibody structure prediction and design
