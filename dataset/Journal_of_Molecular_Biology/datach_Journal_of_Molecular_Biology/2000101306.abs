probing the catalytic mechanism of gdp  keto  deoxy d mannose epimerase reductase by kinetic and crystallographic characterization of site specific mutants edited by k nagai
gdp  keto  deoxy d mannose epimerase reductase is a bifunctional enzyme responsible for the last step in the biosynthesis of gdp l fucose the substrate of fucosyl transferases several cell surface antigens including the leukocyte lewis system and cell surface antigens in pathogenic bacteria depend on the availability of gdp l fucose for their expression therefore the enzyme is a potential target for therapy in pathological states depending on selectin mediated cell to cell interactions previous crystallographic investigations have shown that gdp  keto  deoxy d mannose epimerase reductase belongs to the short chain dehydrogenase reductase protein homology family the enzyme active site region is at the interface of an n terminal nadph binding domain and a c terminal domain held to bind the substrate the design expression and functional characterization of seven site specific mutant forms of gdp  keto  deoxy d mannose epimerase reductase are reported here in parallel the crystal structures of the native holoenzyme and of three mutants ser  ala tyr  glu and lys  arg have been investigated and refined at        resolution based on synchrotron data r factors range between    and     the refined protein models show that besides the active site residues ser   tyr  and lys   whose mutations impair the overall enzymatic activity and may affect the coenzyme binding mode side chains capable of proton exchange located around the expected substrate gdp  keto  deoxy d mannose binding pocket are selectively required during the epimerization and reduction steps among these cys  and his  may play a primary role in proton exchange between the enzyme and the epimerization catalytic intermediates finally the additional role of mutated active site residues involved in substrate recognition and in enzyme stability has been analyzed
