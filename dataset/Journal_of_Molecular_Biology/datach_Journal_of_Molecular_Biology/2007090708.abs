structural and functional properties of isocitrate dehydrogenase from the psychrophilic bacterium desulfotalea psychrophila reveal a cold active enzyme with an unusual high thermal stability
isocitrate dehydrogenase idh has been studied extensively due to its central role in the krebs cycle catalyzing the oxidative nad p  dependent decarboxylation of isocitrate to  ketoglutarate and co  here we present the first crystal structure of idh from a psychrophilic bacterium desulfotalea psychrophila dpidh  the structural information is combined with a detailed biochemical characterization and a comparative study with idhs from the mesophilic bacterium desulfitobacterium hafniense dhidh  porcine pcidh  human cytosolic hcidh and the hyperthermophilic thermotoga maritima tmidh  dpidh was found to have a higher melting temperature tm     c than its mesophilic homologues and a suboptimal catalytic efficiency at low temperatures the thermodynamic activation parameters indicated a disordered active site as seen also for the drastic increase in km for isocitrate at elevated temperatures a methionine cluster situated at the dimeric interface between the two active sites and a cluster of destabilizing charged amino acids in a region close to the active site might explain the poor isocitrate affinity on the other hand dpidh was optimized for interacting with nadp and the crystal structure revealed unique interactions with the cofactor the highly acidic surface destabilizing charged residues fewer ion pairs and reduced size of ionic networks in dpidh suggest a flexible global structure however strategic placement of ionic interactions stabilizing the n and c termini and additional ionic interactions in the clasp domain as well as two enlarged aromatic clusters might counteract the destabilizing interactions and promote the increased thermal stability the structure analysis of dpidh illustrates how psychrophilic enzymes can adjust their flexibility in dynamic regions during their catalytic cycle without compromising the global stability of the protein
