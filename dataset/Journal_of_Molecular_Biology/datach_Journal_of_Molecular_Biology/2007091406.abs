the folding pathway of an ff domain characterization of an on pathway intermediate state under folding conditions by  n  c  and  c methyl relaxation dispersion and h h exchange nmr spectroscopy
the ff domain from the human protein hypa fbp  folds via a low energy on pathway intermediate i  elucidation of the structure of such folding intermediates and denatured states under conditions that favour folding are difficult tasks here we investigated the millisecond time scale equilibrium folding transition of the  residue four helix bundle wild type protein by  n  c  and methyl c carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg nmr relaxation dispersion experiments and by h h exchange measurements the relaxation data for the wild type protein fitted a simple two site exchange process between the folded state f and i destabilization of f in mutants a g and q g allowed the detection of the unfolded state u by  n cpmg relaxation dispersion the dispersion data for these mutants fitted a three site exchange scheme u  i  f with i populated higher than u the kinetics and thermodynamics of the folding reaction were obtained via temperature and urea dependent relaxation dispersion experiments along with structural information on i from backbone  n  c  and side chain methyl  c chemical shifts with further information from protection factors for the backbone amide groups from h h exchange notably helices h  h are at least partially formed in i while helix h is largely disordered chemical shift differences for the methyl  c nuclei suggest a paucity of stable native like hydrophobic interactions in i these data are consistent with  analysis of the rate limiting transition state between i and f the combination of relaxation dispersion and  data can elucidate whole experimental folding pathways
