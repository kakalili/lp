apparent homomeric nr currents observed in xenopus oocytes are caused by an endogenous nr subunit
functional n methyl d aspartate receptors nmdars are thought to be heteromeric receptor complexes consisting of nr and nr subunits however recombinant nr subunits expressed in xenopus oocytes assemble functional ion channels even without exogenous nr subunits and with a different pharmacology suggesting a homomeric subunit stoichiometry to explain this phenomenon we screened oocytes for xenopus nr subunits and found all four subunit encoding mrnas xennr a  xennr d to be present endogenously with those encoding the xennr b subunit being particularly abundant we cloned the full length xennr b cdna and co expressed it with nr in oocytes a detailed electrophysiological characterization revealed that the pharmacology of nr xennr b was identical with that of the presumed homomeric nmdars expressed from nr subunits by contrast heteromeric receptors containing the rat nr b subunit showed significant pharmacological differences compared with nr xennr b receptors these results demonstrate that recombinant nr subunits expressed in xenopus oocytes interact with an endogenously expressed nr b subunit and form hybrid heteromeric nmdars these findings confirm the current views that nmdars are obligatory heteromeric complexes and that functional homomeric nmdars do not exist
