carboxyl terminus of nkx  impairs its interaction with p
the transcription factor nkx  plays critical roles in controlling cardiac specific gene expression previous reports demonstrated that nkx  is only a modest transactivator due to the auto inhibitory effect of its c terminal domain deletion of the c terminal domain mimicking conformational change evokes vigorous transactivation activity here we show that a c terminal defective mutant of nkx  improves the occupation of p  at the anf promoter compared with full length nkx   leading to hyperacetylation of histone h  we reveal that p  is a cofactor of nkx   markedly potentiating nkx  dependent transactivation whereas e a antigen impairs nkx  activity furthermore p  can acetylate nkx  and display an acetyltransferase independent mechanism to coactivate nkx   physical interaction between the n terminal activation domain of nkx  and the c h domain of p  are identified by gst pull down assay point mutants of the n terminal modify the transcriptional activity of nkx  and interaction with p   deletion of the c terminal domain greatly facilitates p  binding and improves the susceptibility of nkx  to histone deacetylase inhibitor these results establish that p  acts as an nkx  cofactor and facilitates increased nkx  activity by relieving the conformational impediment of its inhibitory c terminal domain
