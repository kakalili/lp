shape and dna packaging activity of bacteriophage spp procapsid protein components and interactions during assembly edited by j karn
the procapsid of the bacillus subtilis bacteriophage spp is formed by the major capsid protein gp  the scaffolding protein gp  the portal protein gp  and the accessory protein gp  the protein stoichiometry suggests a t   symmetry for the spp procapsid overexpression of spp procapsid proteins in escherichia coli leads to formation of biologically active procapsids procapsid like and aberrant structures co production of gp  gp  and gp is essential for assembly of procapsids competent for dna packaging in vitro presence of gp in the procapsid increases the yield of viable phages assembled during the reaction in vitro five to tenfold formation of closed procapsid like structures requires uniquely the presence of the major head protein and the scaffolding protein the two proteins interact only when co produced but not when mixed in vitro after separate synthesis gp  controls the polymerization of gp  into normal t   and small sized t    procapsids predominant formation of t   procapsids requires presence of the portal protein this implies that the portal protein has to be integrated at an initial stage of the capsid assembly process its presence however does not have a detectable effect on the rate of procapsid assembly during spp infection a stable interaction between gp and the two major procapsid proteins was only detected when the three proteins are co produced efficient incorporation of a single portal protein in the procapsid appears to require a structural context created by gp  and gp  early during assembly rather than strong interactions with any of those proteins gp  which binds directly to gp both in vivo and in vitro is not necessary for incorporation of the portal protein in the procapsid structure
