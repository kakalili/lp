multiparametric fluorescence detection of early stages in the amyloid protein aggregation of pyrene labeled  synuclein
the aggregation of  synuclein a presynaptic protein has an important role in the etiology of parkinson  s disease oligomers or protofibrils adopting the cross  sheet structure characteristic of fibrillating amyloid proteins are presumed to be the primary cytotoxic species current techniques for monitoring the kinetics of  synuclein aggregation based on fluorescent dyes such as thioflavin t and congo red detect only the terminal fibrillar species are discontinuous and notoriously irreproducible we have devised a new fluorescence aggregation assay that is continuous and provides a large set of fluorescence parameters sensitive to the presence of oligomeric intermediates as well as fibrils the approach involves tagging functionally neutral ala to cys variants of  synuclein with the long lifetime fluorophore pyrene upon induction of aggregation at    c the entire family of steady state descriptors of pyrene emission monomer intensity solvent polarity ratio ii iiii  and anisotropy and excimer intensity change dramatically particularly during the early stages in which oligomeric intermediates form and evolve the pyrene probe senses a progressive decrease in polarity an increase in molecular mass and close intermolecular association in a manner dependent on position in the sequence and the presence of point mutations the time resolved decays      ns of intensity and anisotropy exhibited complex characteristic features the new assay constitutes a convenient platform for the high throughput screening of agents useful in the diagnosis and therapy of parkinson  s disease as well as in basic investigations
