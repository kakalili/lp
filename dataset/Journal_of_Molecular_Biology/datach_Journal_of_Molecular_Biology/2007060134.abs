novel families of toxin like peptides in insects and mammals a computational approach
most animal toxins are short proteins that appear in venom and vary in sequence structure and function a common characteristic of many such toxins is their apparent structural stability sporadic instances of endogenous toxin like proteins that function in non venom context have been reported we have utilized machine learning methodology based on sequence derived features and guided by the notion of structural stability in order to conduct a large scale search for toxin and toxin like proteins application of the method to insect and mammalian sequences revealed novel families of toxin like proteins one of these proteins shows significant similarity to ion channel inhibitors that are expressed in cone snail and assassin bug venom and is surprisingly expressed in the bee brain a toxicity assay in which the protein was injected to fish induced a strong yet reversible paralytic effect we suggest that the protein may function as an endogenous modulator of voltage gated ca  channels additionally we have identified a novel mammalian cluster of toxin like proteins that are expressed in the testis we suggest that these proteins might be involved in regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that affect the acrosome reaction and sperm motility finally we highlight a possible evolutionary link between venom toxins and antibacterial proteins we expect our methodology to enhance the discovery of additional novel protein families
