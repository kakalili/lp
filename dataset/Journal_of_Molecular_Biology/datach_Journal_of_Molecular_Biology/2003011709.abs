the structure of the aquaporin  water channel a comparison between cryo electron microscopy and x ray crystallography
three different medium resolution structures of the human water channel aquaporin  aqp  have been solved by cryo electron microscopy cryo em during the last two years recently the structure of the strongly related bovine aqp was solved by x ray crystallography at higher resolution allowing a validation of the original medium resolution structures and providing a good indication for the strengths and limitations of state of the art cryo em methods we present a detailed comparison between the different models which shows that overall the structures are highly similar deviating less than    from each other in the helical backbone regions the two original cryo em structures however also show a number of significant deviations from the x ray structure both in the backbone positions of the transmembrane helices and in the location of the amino acid side chains facing the pore in contrast the third cryo em structure that included information from the x ray structure of the homologous bacterial glycerol facilitator glpf and that was subsequently refined against cryo em aqp data shows a root mean square deviation of    from the x ray structure in the helical backbone regions
