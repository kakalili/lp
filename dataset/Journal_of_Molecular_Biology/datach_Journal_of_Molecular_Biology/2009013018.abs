structure and inhibition of the co sensing carbonic anhydrase can from the pathogenic fungus cryptococcus neoformans
in the pathogenic fungus cryptococcus neoformans a co sensing system is essential for survival in the natural environment      co  and mediates the switch to virulent growth in the human host    co  this system is composed of the carbonic anhydrase ca can  which catalyzes formation of bicarbonate and the fungal bicarbonate stimulated adenylyl cyclase cac  the critical role of these enzymes for fungal metabolism and pathogenesis identifies them as targets for antifungal drugs here we prove functional similarity of can to the ca nce  from candida albicans and describe its biochemical and structural characterization the crystal structure of can reveals that the enzyme belongs to the  plant type    cas but carries a unique n terminal extension that can interact with the active site entrance of the dimer we further tested a panel of compounds identifying nanomolar can inhibitors and present the structure of a can complex with the inhibitor and product analog acetate revealing insights into interactions with physiological ligands and inhibitors
