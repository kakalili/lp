bipolar dual plasmodium falciparum helicase  expressed in the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle is required for parasite growth
helicases are ubiquitous molecular motor proteins that have an important role in the metabolism of nucleic acids the gene encoding a helicase was cloned from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum the polypeptide of   amino acid residues has a molecular mass of   kda contains striking homology to eukaryotic translation initiation factor a eif a and all the conserved domains of the dead box family the recombinantly expressed and homogeneous p falciparum protein pfh  is an atp dependent dna and rna helicase with atpase and atp binding activities pfh  is a unique bipolar helicase that contains both the   to   and   to   directional helicase activities and anti pfh  antibodies curtail all its activities pfh  is expressed in all the intraerythrocytic developmental stages of the parasite and has a role in translation parasite cultures treated with pfh  double stranded rna or purified immunoglobulins against pfh  exhibited    and    growth inhibition respectively this inhibitory effect was due to interference with expression of the cognate messenger and down regulation of synthesis of pfh  protein in the parasite culture and was associated with morphologic deformation of the parasite these studies indicate that pfh  is an indispensable enzyme that is essential for growth and probably survival of p falciparum
