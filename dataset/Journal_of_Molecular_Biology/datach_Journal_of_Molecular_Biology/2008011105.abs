conformational equilibria and rates of localized motion within hepatitis b virus capsids
functional analysis of hepatitis b virus hbv core particles has associated a number of biological roles with the c terminus of the capsid protein one set of functions require the c terminus to be on the exterior of the capsid while others place this domain on the interior according to the crystal structure of the capsid this segment is strictly internal to the capsid shell and buried at a protein  protein interface using kinetic hydrolysis a form of protease digestion assayed by sds  page and mass spectrometry the structurally and biologically important c terminal region of hbv capsid protein assembly domain cp   residues     has been shown to be dynamic in both dimer and capsid forms hbv is an enveloped virus with a t  icosahedral core that is composed of   copies of a homodimer capsid protein free dimer and assembled capsid forms of the protein are readily hydrolyzed by trypsin and thermolysin around residues      indicating that this region is dynamic and exposed to the capsid surface the measured conformational equilibria have an opposite temperature dependence between free dimer and assembled capsid this work helps to explain the previously described allosteric regulation of assembly and functional properties of a buried domain these observations make a critical connection between structure dynamics and function made possible by the first quantitative measurements of conformational equilibria and rates of conversion between protein conformers for a megadalton complex
