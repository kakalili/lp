a new and efficient dna enzyme for the sequence specific cleavage of rna edited by j doudna
a new dna enzyme the  bipartite dnazyme   suitable for the sequence specific cleavage of rna was obtained from a random dna library by in vitro selection only a single family of catalytic molecules emerged from the selection and a  nucleotide consensus sequence common to all clones defined a putative catalytic core the most abundant clone self cleaved at a single internal ribonucleotide phosphodiester with a relatively fast kobs value of   min   in  mm mgcl at   c this dnazyme   bipartite i   required divalent cations with magnesium and manganese most optimally supporting cleavage a reselection from a mutagenized dnazyme pool for the ability to cleave at extended rna substrates yielded an unchanged catalytic core sequence from this re selection a dnazyme   bipartite ii   capable of sequence specifically cleaving extended stretches of rna was derived a rate versus ph analysis of the bipartite ii dnazyme revealed a two phase profile similar to that reported for the hepatitis delta virus hdv ribozyme suggesting that the bipartite ii dnazyme and the hdv ribozyme may share similar catalytic strategies multiple turnover kinetics measured in  mm mgcl  at   c with an hiv  derived rna substrate yielded a kcat value of    min   and a km value of    nm which were of the same order as kcat and km values measured for other ribozymes and dnazymes in general use for rna cleavage the bipartite dnazyme therefore represents a new and potentially useful reagent both for the processing of rna transcripts in vitro and for mrna ablation procedures in vivo
