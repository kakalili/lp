charged amino acids r  e   d   e   r   and k   of cusa are required for metal ion transport in the cus efflux system
gram negative bacteria expel various toxic chemicals via tripartite efflux pumps belonging to the resistance  nodulation  cell division superfamily these pumps span both the inner and outer membranes of the cell the three components of these tripartite systems are an inner  membrane substrate binding transporter or pump  a periplasmic membrane fusion protein or adaptor  and an outer  membrane anchored channel these three efflux proteins interact in the periplasmic space to form the three part complexes we previously presented the crystal structures of both the inner  membrane transporter cusa and membrane fusion protein cusb of the cuscba tripartite efflux system from escherichia coli we also described the co crystal structure of the cusba adaptor  transporter revealing that the trimeric cusa efflux pump assembles with six cusb protein molecules to form the complex cusb  cusa  we here report three different conformers of the crystal structures of cusba  cu i  suggesting a mechanism on how cu i binding initiates a sequence of conformational transitions in the transport cycle genetic analysis and transport assays indicate that charged residues in addition to the methionine pairs and clusters are essential for extruding metal ions out of the cell
