quinone pathways in entire photosynthetic chromatophores of rhodospirillum photometricum
in photosynthetic organisms membrane pigment  protein complexes light harvesting complex  lh  and light harvesting complex  lh  harvest solar energy and convert sunlight into an electrical and redox potential gradient reaction center with high efficiency recent atomic force microscopy studies have described their organization in native membranes however the cytochrome cyt bc complex remains unseen and the important question of how reduction energy can efficiently pass from core complexes reaction center and lh  to distant cyt bc via membrane soluble quinones needs to be addressed here we report atomic force microscopy images of entire chromatophores of rhodospirillum photometricum we found that core complexes influence their molecular environment within a critical radius of       due to the size mismatch with lh  lipid membrane spaces favorable for quinone diffusion are found within this critical radius around cores we show that core complexes form a network throughout entire chromatophores providing potential quinone diffusion pathways that will considerably speed the redox energy transfer to distant cyt bc  these long range quinone pathway networks result from cooperative short range interactions of cores with their immediate environment
