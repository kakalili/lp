deciphering the roles of multicomponent recognition signals by the aaa unfoldase clpx
atp dependent protein remodeling and unfolding enzymes are key participants in protein metabolism in all cells how these often destructive enzymes specifically recognize target protein complexes is poorly understood here we use the well studied aaa unfoldase substrate pair escherichia coli clpx and mua transposase to address how these powerful enzymes recognize target protein complexes we demonstrate that the final transposition product which is a dna bound tetramer of mua is preferentially recognized over the monomeric apo protein through its multivalent display of clpx recognition tags the important peptide tags include one at the c terminus   c tag   that binds the clpx pore and a second one enhancement or  e tag   that binds the clpx n terminal domain we construct a chimeric protein to interrogate subunit specific contributions of these tags efficient remodeling of mua tetramers requires clpx to contact a minimum of three tags one c tag and two or more e tags  and that these tags are contributed by different subunits within the tetramer the individual recognition peptides bind clpx weakly kd gt   m but impart a high affinity interaction kd   m when combined in the mua tetramer when the weak c tag signal is replaced with a stronger recognition tag the e tags become unnecessary and clpx s preference for the complex over mua monomers is eliminated additionally because the spatial orientation of the tags is predicted to change during the final step of transposition this recognition strategy suggests how aaa unfoldases specifically distinguish the completed  end stage  form of a particular complex for the ideal biological outcome
