structural studies on the pseudomonas aeruginosa sialidase like enzyme pa   suggest substrate and mechanistic variations
pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes an enzyme pa   that is annotated as a sialidase or neuraminidase  as it possesses three bacterial neuraminidase repeats that are a signature of nonviral sialidases a recent report showed that when the gene encoding this sialidase is knocked out this led to a reduction in biofilm production in the lungs of mice and it was suggested that the enzyme recognizes pseudaminic acid a sialic acid analogue that decorates the flagella of pseudomonas helicobacter and campylobacter species here we present the crystal structure of the p aeruginosa enzyme and show that it adopts a trimeric structure partly held together by an immunoglobulin like trimerization domain that is c terminal to a classical  propeller sialidase domain the recombinant enzyme does not show any sialidase activity with the standard fluorogenic sialic acid based substrate the proposed active site contains certain conserved features of a sialidase a nucleophilic tyrosine with its associated glutamic acid and two of the usual three arginines that interact with the carboxylic acid group of the substrate but is missing the first arginine and the aspartic acid that acts as an acid base in all sialidases studied to date we show by in silico docking that the active site may accommodate pseudaminic acid but not sialic acid and that this is due in part to a phenylalanine in the hydrophobic pocket that selects for the alternative stereochemistry of pseudaminic acid at c compared to sialic acid mutation of this phenylalanine to an alanine converts the enzyme into a sialidase albeit a poor one which we confirm by kinetics and nmr and this allowed us to probe the function of other amino acids we propose that a histidine plays the role of the acid base whose state is altered through a charge relay system involving a novel his tyr glu triad the location of this relay system precludes the presence of one of the three arginines usually found in a sialidase active site
