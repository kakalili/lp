the effect of parkinson s disease associated mutations on the deubiquitinating enzyme uch l
the neuronal ubiquitin c terminal hydrolase uch uch l has been linked to parkinson s disease pd and other neurodegenerative diseases here we present a study on the structure stability unfolding and dynamics of wild type and mutant uch l  fluorescence far uv cd and nmr measurements were used to establish that the unfolding of uch l is three state under equilibrium conditions and that an intermediate is populated s y and i m mutants which are associated with a decreased risk or an increased risk of pd respectively are less stable than wild type however while there is minimal structural perturbation in the s y mutant the i m mutation is more disruptive in particular the nmr data suggest that there are local rearrangements around the site of the mutation which we propose results in the exposure of hydrophobic surface area this may have two consequences an increased tendency towards firstly aggregation in vivo and secondly aberrant interactions with tubulin and the chaperone mediated autophagy machinery as observed by other groups both of which may be involved in neurodegenerative processes
