regulation of fat storage and reproduction by kr ppel like transcription factor klf and fat associated genes in caenorhabditis elegans
coordinated regulation of fat storage and utilization is essential for energy homeostasis and its disruption is associated with metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis in humans across species kr ppel like transcription factors klfs have been identified as key components of adipogenesis in humans klf  acts as a master transregulator of adipose gene expression in type  diabetes and cis acting expression quantitative trait locus associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol herein we report that in caenorhabditis elegans mutants in klf  accumulate large fat droplets rich in neutral lipids in the intestine this lipid accumulation is associated with an increase in triglyceride levels the klf  mutants show normal pharyngeal pumping however they are sterile or semisterile we explored important genetic interactions of klf  with the genes encoding enzymes involved in fatty acid fa   oxidation in mitochondria or peroxisomes and fa synthesis in the cytosol namely acyl coa synthetase acs  and acs   acyl coa oxidase f a  and f a   and stearoyl coa desaturase fat   we show that mutations or rna interference in these genes increases fat deposits in the intestine of acs  acs  f a   and f a animals we further show that acs  and f a  influence larval development and fertility respectively thus klf may regulate fa utilization in the intestine and reproductive tissue we demonstrate that depletion of f a  activity but not of acs  acs  f a   or fat  activity enhances the fat phenotype of the klf  mutant taken together these results suggest that klf  regulates lipid metabolism along with acs  acs  f a   and f a   by promoting fa  oxidation and in parallel may contribute to normal reproductive behavior and fecundity in c elegans
