solvent accessibility of the thrombin thrombomodulin interface edited by m f moody
the kinetics of solvent accessibility at the protein protein interface between thrombin and a fragment of thrombomodulin tmegf  have been monitored by amide hydrogen deuterium h h exchange detected by maldi tof mass spectrometry the interaction is rapid and reversible requiring development of theory and experimental methods to distinguish h h exchange due to solvent accessibility at the interface from h h exchange due to complex dissociation association and dissociation rate constants were measured by surface plasmon resonance and amide h h exchange rates were measured at different ph values and concentrations of tmegf  when essentially    of the thrombin was bound to tmegf  two segments of thrombin became completely solvent inaccessible as evidenced by the ph insensitivity of the amide h h exchange rates these segments form part of anion binding exosite i and contain the residues for which alanine substitution abolishes tm binding several other regions of thrombin showed slowing of amide exchange upon tmegf  binding but the exchange remained ph dependent suggesting that these regions of thrombin were rendered only partially solvent inaccessible by tmegf  binding these partially inaccessible regions of thrombin form both surface and buried contacts into the active site of thrombin and contain residues implicated in allosteric changes in thrombin upon tm binding
