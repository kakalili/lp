H-NS is an abundant prokaryotic transcription factor that preferentially binds to intrinsically bent DNA. Although H-NS has been shown to reduce the transcription of over 100 genes, evidence suggests that H-NS can also affect the translation of some genes. One such gene, rpoS, specifies a sigma factor, RpoS. The ability of H-NS to bind to the rpoS mRNA and the non-coding RNA regulator, DsrA, was tested. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays yielded an apparent binding affinity of H-NS binding to curved DNA of approximately 1 μM, whereas binding to rpoS mRNA or DsrA RNA was approximately 3 μM. This RNA binding was not prevented by an excess of competitor yeast RNA, suggesting that H-NS specifically bound these RNAs. Footprint analysis with a single strand-specific ribonuclease was used to identify the H-NS binding site(s) on DsrA and rpoS mRNA. Surprisingly, H-NS appeared to enhance the cleavage of DsrA and rpoS mRNA. The enhanced cleavage was at sites that were predicted to be single-stranded and did not result from contaminating nucleases in the H-NS protein preparation or non-specific effects of the nuclease. Quantitative RT-PCR of RNA isolated from wild-type and hns− strains revealed that H-NS also affects the stability of DsrA in vivo. Thus H-NS appears to modulate RNA stability in vivo and in vitro.
