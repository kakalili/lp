ribonuclease a homologues of the zebrafish polymorphism crystal structures of two representatives and their evolutionary implications
the widespread and functionally varied members of the ribonuclease a rnase a superfamily provide an excellent opportunity to study evolutionary forces at work on a conserved protein scaffold representatives from the zebrafish are of particular interest as the evolutionary distance from non ichthyic homologues is large we conducted an exhaustive survey of available zebrafish dna sequences and found significant polymorphism among its four known homologues in an extension of previous nomenclature the variants have been named rnases zf a  c  a  d  a  e and  we present the first x ray crystal structures of zebrafish ribonucleases rnases zf a and e at   and     resolution respectively structure based clustering with ten other ribonuclease structures indicates greatest similarity to mammalian angiogenins and amphibian ribonucleases and supports the view that all present day ribonucleases evolved from a progenitor with three disulphide bonds in their details the two structures are intriguing melting pots of features present in ribonucleases from other vertebrate classes whereas in rnase zf a the active site is obstructed by the c terminal segment as observed in angiogenin  in rnase zf e the same region is open as observed in more catalytically efficient homologues  the progenitor of present day ribonucleases is more likely to have had an obstructive c terminus and the relatively high similarity late divergence of rnases zf  and  infers that the active site unblocking event has happened independently in different vertebrate lineages
