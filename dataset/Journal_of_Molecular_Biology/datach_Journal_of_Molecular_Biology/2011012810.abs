structural basis for langerin recognition of diverse pathogen and mammalian glycans through a single binding site
langerin mediates the carbohydrate dependent uptake of pathogens by langerhans cells in the first step of antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system langerin binds to an unusually diverse number of endogenous and pathogenic cell surface carbohydrates including mannose containing o specific polysaccharides derived from bacterial lipopolysaccharides identified here by probing a microarray of bacterial polysaccharides crystal structures of the carbohydrate recognition domain from human langerin bound to a series of oligomannose compounds the blood group b antigen and a fragment of  glucan reveal binding to mannose fucose and glucose residues by ca  coordination of vicinal hydroxyl groups with similar stereochemistry oligomannose compounds bind through a single mannose residue with no other mannose residues contacting the protein directly there is no evidence for a second ca  independent binding site likewise a  glucan fragment glc    glc    glc binds to langerin through the interaction of a single glucose residue with the ca  site the fucose moiety of the blood group b trisaccharide gal    fuc    gal also binds to the ca  site and selective binding to this glycan compared to other fucose containing oligosaccharides results from additional favorable interactions of the nonreducing terminal galactose as well as of the fucose residue surprisingly the equatorial  oh group and the axial  oh group of the galactose residue in so  gal    glcnac also coordinate ca  a heretofore unobserved mode of galactose binding in a c type carbohydrate recognition domain bearing the glu pro asn signature motif characteristic of mannose binding sites salt bridges between the sulfate group and two lysine residues appear to compensate for the nonoptimal binding of galactose at this site
