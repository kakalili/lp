real time evidence for ef g induced dynamics of helix  in  s rrna
the penultimate stem  loop of  s ribosomal rna rrna  helix   plays a central role in ribosome function using time resolved dimethyl sulfate dms probing we have analyzed time dependent modifications that occur at specific bases in this helix near the decoding region resulting from the binding of elongation factor g ef g in various forms when ef g gtp is bound to  s ribosomes bases a   and a   are immediately protected while other bases in the region show either no change or enhanced modification when apo ef g is bound to  s ribosomes and gtp is added substantial transient time dependent enhancement occurs at bases a   and a   with somewhat less enhancement occurring at base a   all in the first   ms when mrna and deacylated trnas are bound to the  s ribosome and ef g gtp is added bases a   and a   again show substantial and continued enhancement while bases a   a   and a   all show time dependent protection these results provide primary real time evidence that ef g induces direct or indirect structural changes in this region as ef g is bound and as gtp is hydrolyzed
