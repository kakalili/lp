the three dimensional arcitecture of the ejc core
the exon junction complex ejc is a macromolecular complex deposited at splice junctions on mrnas as a consequence of splicing at the core of the ejc are four proteins eif aiii a member of the dexh d box family of ntp dependent rna binding proteins y  magoh and mln  these proteins form a stable heterotetramer that remains bound to the mrna throughout many different cellular environments we have determined the three dimensional  d structure of this ejc core using negative stain random conical tilt electron microscopy this structure represents the first structure of a dexh d box protein in complex with its binding partners the ejc core is a four lobed complex with a central channel and dimensions consistent with its known rna footprint of about ten nucleotides using known x ray crystallographic structures and a model of three of the four components we propose a model for complex assembly on rna and explain how y  magoh may influence eif aiii s rna binding
