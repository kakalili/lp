communication between rna folding domains revealed by folding of circularly permuted ribozymes
to study the role of sequence and topology in rna folding we determined the kinetic folding pathways of two circularly permuted variants of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme using time resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting circular permutation changes the distance between interacting residues in the primary sequence without changing the native structure of the rna in the natural ribozyme tertiary interactions in the p p domain form in  s while interactions in the p p form in    min at    c permutation of the   end to g  in the p helix allowed the stable p p domain to fold in   ms at    c five times faster than in the wild type rna while the other domains folded five times more slowly     min  by contrast circular permutation of the   end to g  in j  decreased the folding rate of the p p domain in this permuted rna regions joining p  p and p were protected in   ms while the p p domain was     folded within  s rnase t digestion and fmn photocleavage showed that circular permutation of the rna sequence alters the initial ensemble of secondary structures thereby changing the tertiary folding pathways our results show that the natural   to   order of the structural domains in group i ribozymes optimizes structural communication between tertiary domains and promotes self assembly of the catalytic center
