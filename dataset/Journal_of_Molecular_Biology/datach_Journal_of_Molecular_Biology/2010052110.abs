the tiam pdz domain couples to syndecan and promotes cell  matrix adhesion
the t cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis gene  tiam  is a guanine exchange factor gef for the rho family gtpase rac that is crucial for the integrity of adherens junctions tight junctions and cell  matrix interactions this gef contains several protein  protein interaction domains including a pdz domain earlier studies identified a consensus pdz binding motif and a synthetic peptide capable of binding to the tiam pdz domain but little is known about its ligand specificity and physiological role in cells here we investigated the structure specificity and function of the tiam pdz domain we determined the crystal structures of the tiam pdz domain free and in complex with a  model  peptide which revealed the structural basis for ligand specificity protein database searches using the consensus pdz binding motif identified two eukaryotic cell adhesion proteins syndecan and caspr  as potential tiam pdz domain binding proteins equilibrium binding experiments confirmed that c terminal peptides derived from syndecan and caspr bound the tiam pdz domain nmr chemical shift perturbation experiments indicated that the tiam pdz syndecan and pdz caspr complexes were structurally distinct and identified key residues likely to be responsible for ligand selectivity moreover cell biological analysis established that syndecan is a physiological binding partner of tiam and that the pdz domain has a function in cell  matrix adhesion and cell migration collectively our data provide insight into the structure specificity and function of the tiam pdz domain importantly our data report on a physiological role for the tiam pdz domain and establish a novel link between two previously unrelated signal transduction pathways both of which are implicated in cancer
