computational identification of cis regulatory elements associated with groups of functionally related genes in saccharomyces cerevisiae edited by f e cohen
alignace is a gibbs sampling algorithm for identifying motifs that are over represented in a set of dna sequences when used to search upstream of apparently coregulated genes alignace finds motifs that often correspond to the dna binding preferences of transcription factors we previously used alignace to analyze whole genome mrna expression data here we present a more detailed study of its effectiveness as applied to a variety of groups of genes in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome published functional catalogs of genes and sets of genes grouped by common name provided   groups resulting in   motifs in conjunction with this analysis we present measures for gauging the tendency of a motif to target a given set of genes relative to all other genes in the genome and for gauging the degree to which a motif is preferentially located in a certain distance range upstream of translational start sites we demonstrate improved methods for comparing and clustering sequence motifs many previously identified cis regulatory elements were found we also describe previously unidentified motifs one of which has been verified by experiments in our laboratory an extensive set of alignace runs on randomly selected sets of genes and on sets of genes whose upstream regions contain known transcription factor binding sites serve as controls
