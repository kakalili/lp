crystal structure and site directed mutagenesis studies of n carbamoyl d amino acid amidohydrolase from agrobacterium radiobacter reveals a homotetramer and insight into a catalytic cleft edited by r huber
the n carbamoyl d amino acid amidohydrolase d ncaase is used on an industrial scale for the production of d amino acids the crystal structure of d ncaase was solved by multiple isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering using xenon and gold derivatives and refined to     resolution to an r factor of     the crystal structure shows a four layer    fold with two six stranded  sheets packed on either side by two  helices one exterior layer faces the solvent whereas the other one is buried and involved in the tight intersubunit contacts a long c terminal fragment extends from a monomer to a site near a dyad axis and associates with another monomer to form a small and hydrophobic cavity where a xenon atom can bind site directed mutagenesis of his   his  and his  revealed strict geometric requirements of these conserved residues to maintain a stable conformation of a putative catalytic cleft a region located within this cleft involving cys   glu  and lys  is proposed for d ncaase catalysis and is similar to the cys asp lys site of n carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase the homologous active site framework of these enzymes with distinct structures suggests convergent evolution of a common catalytic mechanism
