reconstruction of functional  propeller lectins via homo oligomeric assembly of shorter fragments
the modular nature of protein folds suggests that present day proteins evolved via duplication and recombination of smaller functional elements however the reconstruction of these putative evolutionary pathways after many millions of years of evolutionary drift has thus far proven difficult with all attempts to date failing to produce a functional protein tachylecin  is a monomeric   amino acid five bladed  propeller with five sugar binding sites this protein was isolated from a horseshoe crab that emerged ca   million years ago the modular yet ancient nature of tachylectin  makes it an excellent model for exploring the evolution of proteins from smaller subunits to this end we generated genetically diverse libraries by incremental truncation of the tachylectin  gene and screened them for functional lectins a number of    amino acid residue segments were isolated with the ability to assemble into active homo pentamers the topology of most of these segments follows a  hidden  module that differs from the modules observed in wild type tachylectin  yet their biophysical properties and sugar binding activities resemble the wild type s since the pentamer s molecular mass is twofold higher than the wild type     amino acid residues  the structure of these oligomeric forms is likely to also differ our laboratory evolution experiments highlight the versatility and modularity of the  propeller fold while substantiating the hypothesis that proteins with high internal symmetry such as  propellers evolved from short functional gene segments that at later stages duplicated fused and rearranged to yield the folds we recognise today
