The calcium-binding equine lysozyme has been found to undergo conversion into amyloid fibrils during incubation in solution at acidic pH. At pH 4.5 and 57 °C, where equine lysozyme forms a partially unfolded molten globule state, the protein forms protofilaments with a width of ca. 2 nm. In the absence of Ca2+ the protofilaments are present as annular structures with a diameter of 40–50 nm. In the presence of 10 mM CaCl2 the protofilaments of equine lysozyme are straight or curved; they can assemble into thicker threads, but they do not appear to undergo circularisation. At pH 2.0, where the protein is more destabilised compared to pH 4.5, fibril formation occurs at 37 °C and 57 °C. At pH 2.0, both ring-shaped and linear protofilaments are formed, in which periodic repeats of ca 35 nm can be distinguished clearly. The rings constitute about 10% of all fibrillar species under these conditions and they are characterised by a larger diameter of 70–80 nm. All the structures bind Congo red and thioflavine T in a manner similar to fibrils associated with a variety of amyloid diseases. At pH 2.0, fibril formation is accompanied by some acidic hydrolysis, producing specific fragmentation of the protein, leading to the accumulation of two peptides in particular, consisting of residues 1–80 and 54–125. At the initial stages of incubation, however, full-length equine lysozyme represents the dominant species within the fibrils. We propose that the ring-shaped structures observed here, and in the case of disease-associated proteins such as α-synuclein, could be a second generic type of amyloid structure in addition to the more common linear fibrils.
