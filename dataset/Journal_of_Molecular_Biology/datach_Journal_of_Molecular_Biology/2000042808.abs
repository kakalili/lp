high resolution structure of the ompa membrane domain edited by d c rees
the membrane domain of ompa consists of an eight stranded all next neighbor antiparallel  barrel with short turns at the periplasmic barrel end and long flexible loops at the external end the structure analysis has been extended from medium resolution to          nm  and the molecular model has been refined anisotropically to show oriented mobilities of the structural elements the improved data allowed us to locate five further detergent molecules and  more water molecules moreover the two large non polar packing contacts have now been defined in detail the analysis indicates that the  barrel constitutes a solid scaffold such that the long external loops need not contribute to stability these loops are highly mobile and thus cause a major problem during the crystallization process the  barrel was related to those of lipocalins two further crystal forms with exceptionally dense packing arrangements were established at medium resolution
