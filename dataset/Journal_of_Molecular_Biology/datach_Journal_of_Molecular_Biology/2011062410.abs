icf syndrome mutations cause a broad spectrum of biochemical defects in dnmt b mediated de novo dna methylation
the dnmt b de novo dna methyltransferase dnmt plays a major role in establishing dna methylation patterns in early mammalian development but its catalytic mechanism remains poorly characterized here we provide a comprehensive biochemical analysis of human dnmt b function through the characterization of a series of site directed dnmt b variants associated with immunodeficiency centromere instability and facial anomalies icf syndrome our data reveal several novel and important aspects of dnmt b function first dnmt b unlike dnmt a requires a dna cofactor in order to stably bind to s adenosyl l methionine sam  suggesting that it proceeds according to an ordered catalytic scheme second icf mutations cause a broad spectrum of biochemical defects in dnmt b function including defects in homo oligomerization sam binding sam utilization and dna binding third all tested icf mutations including the a  p and r  q variants result in altered catalytic properties without interfering with dnmt l mediated stimulation this indicates that dnmt l is not involved in the pathogenesis of icf syndrome finally our study reveals a novel level of coupling between substrate binding oligomerization and catalysis that is likely conserved within the dnmt family of enzymes
