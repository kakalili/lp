mg  binding to trna revisited the nonlinear poisson boltzmann model edited by b honig
our current understanding of mg  binding to rna in both thermodynamic and structural terms is largely based on classical studies of transfer rnas based on these studies it is clear that magnesium ions are crucial for stabilizing the folded structure of trna we present here a rigorous theoretical model based on the nonlinear poisson boltzmann nlpb equation for understanding mg  binding to yeast trnaphe we use this model to interpret a variety of experimental mg  binding data in particular we find that the nlpb equation provides a remarkably accurate description of both the overall stoichiometry and the free energy of mg  binding to yeast trnaphe without any fitted parameters in addition the model accurately describes the interaction of mg  with localized regions of the rna as determined by the p ka shift of differently bound fluorophores in each case we find that the model also reproduces the univalent salt dependence and the anticooperativity of mg  binding our results lead us to a thermodynamic description of mg  binding to yeast trnaphe based on the nlpb equation in this model mg  binding is simply explained by an ensemble of ions distributed according to a boltzmann weighted average of the mean electrostatic potential around the rna it appears that the entire ensemble of electrostatically bound ions superficially mimics a few strongly coordinated ions in this regard we find that mg  stabilizes the tertiary structure of yeast trnaphe in part by accumulating in regions of high negative electrostatic potential these regions of mg  localization correspond to bound ions that are observed in the x ray crystallographic structures of yeast trnaphe based on our results and the available thermodynamic data there is no evidence that specifically coordinated mg ions have a significant role in stabilizing the native tertiary structure of yeast trnaphe in solution
