determinants of chemotactic signal amplification in escherichia coli edited by i b holland
a well characterized protein phosphorelay mediates escherichia coli chemotaxis towards the amino acid attractant aspartate the protein chey shuttles between flagellar motors and methyl accepting chemoreceptor mcp complexes containing the linker chew and the kinase chea chea chey phosphotransfer generates phospho chey chey p aspartate triggers smooth swim responses by inactivation of the chea bound to the target mcp tar but this mechanism alone cannot explain the observed response sensitivity here we used behavioral analysis of mutants deleted for chez a catalyst of chey p dephosphorylation or the methyltransferase cher and or the methylesterase cheb to examine the roles of accelerated chey p dephosphorylation and mcp methylation in enhancement of the chemotactic response the extreme motile bias of the mutants was adjusted towards wild type values while preserving much of the aspartate response sensitivity by expressing fragments of the mcp tsr that either activate or inhibit chea we then measured responses to small jumps of aspartate generated by flash photolysis of photo labile precursors the stimulus response relation for  chez mutants overlapped that for the host strains  chez excitation response times increased with stimulus size consistent with formation of an occluded chea state thus neither chez dependent or independent increases in chey p dephosphorylation contribute to the excitation response in  cheb cher or  cher mutants the dose for a half maximal response  asp   was ca   m but was elevated to    m in  cheb mutants in addition the stimulus response relation for these mutants was linear consistent with stoichiometric inactivation in contrast to the non linear relation for wild type e coli these data suggest that response sensitivity is controlled by differential binding of cher and or cheb to distinct mcp signaling conformations
