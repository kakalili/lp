hiv  nucleocapsid protein activates transient melting of least stable parts of the secondary structure of tar and its complementary sequence edited by m f summers
the nucleocapsid protein ncp of hiv  possesses a nucleic acid chaperone activity that is critical in minus and plus strand transfer during reverse transcription the minus strand transfer notably relies on the ability of ncp to destabilize the stable stem with five contiguous double stranded segments of both the tar sequence at the   end of the viral genome and the complementary sequence ctar in minus strong stop dna in order to examine the nature and the extent of ncp destabilizing activity we investigated by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy the interaction of tar and ctar with a     ncp peptide containing the zinc finger motifs but lacking the ability to aggregate the oligonucleotides the absorbance changes in the uv band of ctar show that seven to eight base pairs on average are melted per oligonucleotide at a ratio of one peptide to   nucleotides in contrast the melting of tar does not exceed an average of one base pair per oligonucleotide this may be linked to the greater stability of tar since a strong correlation between ncp destabilizing effect and oligonucleotide stability was observed the effect of     ncp on the stem terminus was investigated by using a ctar molecule doubly labeled at the   and   ends by a donor acceptor couple in the absence of the peptide about   of the oligonucleotides are in a dark non fluorescent state having a close proximity of the two dyes the remaining   are distributed between three fluorescent species having either the terminal segment the two terminal segments or all segments of the stem melted this is in line with a fraying mechanism wherein the stem terminus fluctuates rapidly between open and closed states addition of     ncp shifts the equilibrium toward the open species suggesting that nc enhances fraying of the stem terminus taken together our data suggest that ncp activates the transient opening of base pairs in the least stable parts of the stem also this activity of ncp was found to be dependent on the zinc finger motifs since no melting was observed with a fingerless ncp peptide
