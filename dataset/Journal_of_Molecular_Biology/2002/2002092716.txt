A curved DNA segment is known to adopt a preferred end loop localization in superhelical (sc) DNA and thus may organize the overall conformation of the molecule. Through this process it influences the probability of site juxtaposition. We addressed the effect of a curvature on site–site interactions quantitatively by measuring the kinetics of cross-linking of two biotinylated positions in scDNA by streptavidin. The DNA was biotinylated at either symmetric or asymmetric positions with respect to a curved insert via triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) modified with biotin. We used a quench-flow device to mix the DNA with the protein and scanning force microscopy to quantify the reaction products. As a measure of the interaction probability, rate constants of cross-linking and local concentrations jM of one biotinylated site in the vicinity of the other were determined and compared to Monte Carlo simulations for corresponding DNAs. In good agreement with the simulations, a jM value of 1.74μM between two sites 500bp apart was measured for an scDNA without curvature. When a curvature was centered between the sites, the interaction probability increased about twofold over the DNA without curvature, significantly less than expected from the simulations. However, the relative differences of the interaction probabilities due to varied biotin positions with respect to the curvature agreed quantitatively with the theory.
