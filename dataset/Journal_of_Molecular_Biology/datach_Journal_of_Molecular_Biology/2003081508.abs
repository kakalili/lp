the frameshift stimulatory signal of human immunodeficiency virus type  group o is a pseudoknot
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  requires a programmed   ribosomal frameshift to produce gag  pol the precursor of its enzymatic activities this frameshift occurs at a slippery sequence on the viral messenger rna and is stimulated by a specific structure downstream of the shift site while in group m the most abundant hiv  group the frameshift stimulatory signal is an extended bulged stem loop we show here using a combination of mutagenesis and probing studies that it is a pseudoknot in group o the mutagenesis and probing studies coupled to an in silico analysis show that group o pseudoknot is a hairpin type pseudoknot with two coaxially stacked stems of eight base pairs stem  and stem   connected by single stranded loops of nt loop  and  nt loop   mutations impairing formation of stem  or stem  of the pseudoknot reduce frameshift efficiency whereas compensatory changes that allow re formation of these stems restore the frameshift efficiency to near wild type level the difference between the frameshift stimulatory signal of group o and group m supports the hypothesis that these groups originate from a different monkey to human transmission
