structure based protocol for identifying mutations that enhance protein  protein binding affinities
the ability to manipulate protein binding affinities is important for the development of proteins as biosensors industrial reagents and therapeutics we have developed a structure based method to rationally predict single mutations at protein  protein interfaces that enhance binding affinities the protocol is based on the premise that increasing buried hydrophobic surface area and or reducing buried hydrophilic surface area will generally lead to enhanced affinity if large steric clashes are not introduced and buried polar groups are not left without a hydrogen bond partner the procedure selects affinity enhancing point mutations at the protein  protein interface using three criteria   the mutation must be from a polar amino acid to a non polar amino acid or from a non polar amino acid to a larger non polar amino acid   the free energy of binding as calculated with the rosetta protein modeling program should be more favorable than the free energy of binding calculated for the wild type complex and   the mutation should not be predicted to significantly destabilize the monomers the performance of the computational protocol was experimentally tested on two separate protein complexes g i from the heterotrimeric g protein system bound to the rgs  goloco motif and the e  ubch  bound to the e  e ap from the ubiquitin pathway twelve single site mutations that were predicted to be stabilizing were synthesized and characterized in the laboratory nine of the  mutations successfully increased binding affinity with five of these increasing binding by over   kcal mol to further assess our approach we searched the literature for point mutations that pass our criteria and have experimentally determined binding affinities of the eight mutations identified five were accurately predicted to increase binding affinity further validating the method as a useful tool to increase protein  protein binding affinities
