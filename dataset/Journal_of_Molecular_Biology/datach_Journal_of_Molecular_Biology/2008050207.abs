regulation of rna polymerase iii transcription by maf in mammalian cells
rna polymerase pol iii produces essential components of the biosynthetic machinery therefore its output is tightly coupled with the rate of cell growth and proliferation in saccharomyces cerevisiae maf is an essential mediator of pol iii repression in response to starvation we demonstrate that a maf ortholog is also used to restrain pol iii activity in mouse and human cells mammalian maf represses pol iii transcription in vitro and in transfected fibroblasts furthermore genetic deletion of maf elevates pol iii transcript expression thus confirming the role of endogenous maf as an inhibitor of mammalian pol iii output maf is detected at chromosomal pol iii templates in rodent and human cells it interacts with pol iii as well as its associated initiation factor tfiiib and is phosphorylated in a serum sensitive manner in vivo these aspects of maf function have been conserved between yeast and mammals and are therefore likely to be of fundamental importance in controlling pol iii transcriptional activity
