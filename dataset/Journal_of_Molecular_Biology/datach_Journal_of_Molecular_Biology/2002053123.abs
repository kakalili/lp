recognition of dna by p  core domain and location of intermolecular contacts of cooperative binding
we present an analysis by nmr of a  kda complex of the core domain of the tumour suppressor p  with dna that complements and extends the crystal structure analysis binding of specific dna caused significant chemical shifts of residues on the dna binding interface that translated into the  sheet of the protein binding of non specific dna caused weak but qualitatively the same shifts corresponding to weaker binding interactions the observed chemical shift differences correlate with frequency of cancer inducing mutations suggesting that the affected residues contribute to the stability of p  core domain  dna complex we also identified two affected regions on the surface of the protein helix  residues v   c   plus g  and residues l   t   which may represent a dimerisation interface
