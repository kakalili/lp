a    resolution crystal structure of unliganded crm reveals the mechanism of autoinhibition
crm mediates nuclear export of numerous proteins and ribonucleoproteins containing a leucine rich nuclear export signal nes  binding of rangtp to crm in the nucleus stabilizes cargo association with crm  and vice versa but the mechanism underlying the positive cooperativity in rangtp and nes binding to crm remains incompletely understood herein we report a    resolution crystal structure of unliganded saccharomyces cerevisiae crm  xpo p that demonstrates that an internal loop of crm  referred to as heat loop is primarily responsible for maintaining the nes binding cleft in a closed conformation rendering crm incapable of nes binding in the absence of rangtp the structure also shows that the c terminal tail of crm stabilizes the autoinhibitory conformation of the heat loop and thereby reinforces autoinhibition comparison with the structures of crm  nes  rangtp complexes reveals how binding of rangtp is associated with a series of allosteric conformational changes in crm that lead to opening of the nes binding cleft allowing for stable binding of nes cargoes
