biogenesis of yeast mitochondrial cytochrome c a unique relationship to the tom machinery
the import of cytochrome c into the mitochondrial intermembrane space is not understood at a mechanistic level while the precursor apocytochrome c can insert into protein free lipid bilayers the purified translocase of the outer membrane tom complex supports the translocation of apocytochrome c into proteoliposomes we report an in organello analysis of cytochrome c import into yeast mitochondria from wild type cells and different mutants cells each defective in one of the seven tom proteins the import of cytochrome c is not affected by removal of the receptor tom  or tom  moreover neither the transfer protein tom nor the assembly factors tom and tom are needed for import of cytochrome c when the general import pore gip protein tom  is blocked the import of cytochrome c is moderately affected mitochondria lacking the central receptor and organizing protein tom  contain greatly reduced levels of cytochrome c we conclude that up to two components of the tom complex tom  and possibly the gip are involved in the biogenesis of cytochrome c
