structural analysis of the epitope of the anti hiv antibody f sheds light into its mechanism of neutralization and hiv fusion
inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus hiv fusion with the host cell has emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy and rational design of inhibitors and vaccines interfering with this process is a prime target for antiviral research to advance our knowledge of the structural biology of hiv fusion we have studied the membrane proximal region of the fusogenic envelope subunit gp  which includes the epitope eldkwa of the broadly neutralizing human antibody f  the structural evidence available for this region is contradictory with some studies suggesting an overall helical conformation while the x ray structure of the eldkwas peptide bound to the antibody shows it folded in a type i  turn we used a two step strategy firstly by a competition binding assay we identified the proper boundaries of the domain recognized by f  which we found considerably larger than the eldkwas hexapeptide secondly we studied the structure of the resulting  amino acid residue peptide by collecting nmr data and analyzing them by our previously developed statistical method namfis  our study revealed that the increase in binding affinity goes in parallel with stabilization of specific local and global conformational propensities absent from the shorter epitope when compounded with the available biological evidence our structural analysis allows us to propose a specific role for the membrane proximal region during hiv fusion in terms of a conformational transition between the turn and the helical structure at the same time our hypothesis offers a structural explanation for the mechanism of neutralization of mab f
