a tract dna disfavours triplex formation edited by a klug
optimisation of dna triplex stability is of fundamental importance in the anti gene strategy in the present work thermal denaturation studies by uv spectrophotometry and structural and dynamical characterizations by nmr spectroscopy have been used systematically to investigate the effects on triplex stability of isolated insertions of different base triplets into an otherwise homogeneous  mer dt da dt oligo triplex it is found that insertion of a single central c  g c or t d t triplet d   diaminopurine leads to a pronounced stabilization up to  deg c if the cytosine base is c methylated at acidic as well as neutral ph to a smaller degree this is the case also for a c  i c triplet insertion using imino proton exchange measurements it is shown that insertion of a dt base pair in the underlying duplex perturbs the intrinsic a tract structure in the same way as has been shown for a gc insert we propose that the intrinsic properties of a tract duplex dna e g high propeller twist and rigidity are unfavourable for triplex formation and that gc or dt inserts stabilize the triplex by interfering with the a tract features of the underlying duplex the c  i c triplet without the n amino group in the minor groove is readily accommodated within the typical highly propeller twisted a tract structure this might be related to its smaller effect on the stability of the corresponding triplex these results may be valuable for understanding dna triplex formation in vivo as well as for the design of efficient triplex forming oligonucleotides and in choosing suitable target sequences in the anti gene strategy
