identification of residues critical for the function of the vibrio cholerae virulence regulator toxt by scanning alanine mutagenesis
virulence factor expression in vibrio cholerae is controlled by the transcriptional regulatory protein toxt toxt activates transcription of the genes encoding cholera toxin ctx and the toxin co regulated pilus tcp  as well as accessory colonization factor acf genes previous studies of toxt a member of the arac family of proteins have revealed that it consists of two domains an n terminal dimerization and environmental sensing domain and a c terminal dna binding domain in this study comprehensive scanning alanine mutagenesis was utilized to identify amino acids critical for the function of toxt forty eight proteins with ala substitutions of   total exhibited defects in toxt dependent activation  gt   reduction in both a v cholerae acfa phoa reporter strain and a salmonella typhimurium ctxap lacz reporter strain most of these mutant proteins also caused reductions in cholera toxin ct and toxin coregulated pilus tcp expression in a  toxt v cholerae strain under in vitro virulence factor inducing conditions further analysis with a lexa based reporter system revealed that one of the  ala substitutions in the n terminus f  a diminishes dimerization and this residue is located in a region of predicted  helical structure thus identifying a putative dimer interface ala substitutions in two putative helix turn helix hth recognition helices that caused differential promoter activation k  a and s  a did not appear to alter specific dna binding suggesting these residues contribute to other aspects of transcriptional activation a number of ala substitutions were also found that result in a higher level of toxt transcriptional activity and these mutations were almost exclusively found within the n terminus consistent with this domain being involved in modulation of toxt activity this study illuminates the contribution of specific amino acids to the dimerization dna binding and transcriptional activity of toxt
