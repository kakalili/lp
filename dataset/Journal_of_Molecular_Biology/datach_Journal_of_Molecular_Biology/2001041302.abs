regulatory potential phyletic distribution and evolution of ancient intracellular small molecule binding domains edited by f cohen
central cellular functions such as metabolism solute transport and signal transduction are regulated in part via binding of small molecules by specialized domains using sensitive methods for sequence profile analysis and protein structure comparison we exhaustively surveyed the protein sets from completely sequenced genomes for all occurrences of  intracellular small molecule binding domains smbds that are represented in at least two of the three major divisions of life bacteria archaea and eukaryotes  these included previously characterized domains such as pas gaf act and ferredoxins as well as three newly predicted smbds namely the  vinyl reductase  vr domain the nifx domain and the  histidines  h domain although there are only a limited number of different superfamilies of these ancient smbds they are present in numerous distinct proteins combined with various enzymatic transport and signal transducing domains most of the smbds show considerable evolutionary mobility and are involved in the generation of many lineage specific domain architectures frequent re invention of analogous architectures involving functionally related but not homologous domains was detected such as fusion of different smbds to several types of dna binding domains to form diverse transcription regulators in prokaryotes and eukaryotes this is suggestive of similar selective forces affecting the diverse smbds and resulting in the formation of multidomain proteins that fit a limited number of functional stereotypes using the  guilt by association approach   the identification of smbds allowed prediction of functions and mode of regulation for a variety of previously uncharacterized proteins
