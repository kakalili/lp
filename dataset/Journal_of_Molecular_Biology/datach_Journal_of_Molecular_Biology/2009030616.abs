signatures of protein dna recognition in free dna binding sites
one obstacle to achieving complete understanding of the principles underlying sequence dependent recognition of dna is the paucity of structural data for dna recognition sequences in their free unbound state here we carried out crystallization screening of  dna duplexes containing cognate protein binding sites and obtained new crystal structures of free dna binding sites for three distinct modes of dna recognition anti parallel  strands metr  helix turn helix motif  hinge helices purr  and zinc fingers zif   structural changes between free and protein bound dna are manifested differently in each case the new dna structures reveal that distinctive sequence dependent dna geometry dominates recognition by metr protein induced bending of dna dictates recognition by purr and deformability of dna along the a b continuum is important in recognition by zif   together our findings show that crystal structures of free dna binding sites provide new information about the nature of protein  dna interactions and thus lend insights towards a structural code for dna recognition
