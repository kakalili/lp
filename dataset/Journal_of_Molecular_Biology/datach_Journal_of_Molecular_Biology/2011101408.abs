molecular determinants of self association and rearrangement of a trimeric intermediate during the assembly of a parvovirus capsid
the minute virus of mice mvm provides a simple model for the dissection of the molecular determinants of the self assembly stability and dynamics of a biological supramolecular complex mvm assembly involves the trimerization of capsid subunits in the cytoplasm trimers are transported to the nucleus where they suffer a conformational change and are made competent for capsid formation our previous study revealed that capsid assembly from trimers is dependent on stronger intertrimer interactions that are equally spaced in an equatorial belt surrounding each trimer we have now targeted the interfaces between monomers within each trimer to identify the molecular determinants of trimerization and the rearrangement needed for capsid assembly twenty eight amino acid residues per monomer were individually mutated to alanine to remove most of the stronger intersubunit interactions the effects on trimer and capsid assembly and virus infectivity in cells were analyzed no side chain was individually required for trimer assembly in the cytoplasm in contrast half of them were required to make the trimers competent for nuclear capsid assembly even though none was close to intertrimer interfaces these critical side chains are conserved and participate in extensive hydrophobic contacts buried hydrogen bonds or salt bridges between subunits this study on mvm capsid assembly reveals that  i trimerization is a robust process insensitive to removal of individual intersubunit interactions and ii the rearrangement of the trimer intermediate required for capsid assembly is a global process that depends on the establishment of many interactions along the protein  protein interfaces within each trimer
