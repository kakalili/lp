characterization of disease associated single amino acid polymorphisms in terms of sequence and structure properties edited by j thornton
in the present work we use structural information to characterize a set of disease associated single amino acid polymorphisms exhaustively the analysis of different properties such as substitution matrix elements secondary structure accessibility free energies of transfer from water to octanol amino acid volume etc  suggests that many disease causing mutations are associated with extreme changes in the value of parameters relating to protein stability overall our results indicate that while knowledge of protein structure clearly helps in understanding these mutations a finer understanding can come only from a quantitative knowledge of protein stability and of the protein environment in the cell interestingly use of evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments can be used to increase our knowledge of disease associated mutations
