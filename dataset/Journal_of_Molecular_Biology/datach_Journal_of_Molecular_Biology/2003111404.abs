structure determination and ligand interactions of the pdz b domain of ptp bas hptp e  splicing induced modulation of ligand specificity
two versions of the pdz domain of the protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp bas human ptp bl are generated by alternative splicing the domains differ by the insertion of five amino acid residues and their affinity to the tumour suppressor protein apc whereas pdz a is able to bind apc in the nanomolar range pdz b shows no apparent interaction with apc here the solution structure of the splicing variant of pdz with the insertion has been determined using d and d heteronuclear nmr experiments the structural reason for the changed binding specificity is the reorientation of the loop with extra five amino acid residues which folds back onto  strands two and three in addition the side chain of lys  closes the binding site of the apc binding protein and the two helices especially  helix  change their relative position to the protein core consecutively the binding site is sterically no longer fully accessible from the nmr titration studies with a c terminal apc peptide the affinity of the peptide with the protein can be estimated as      m the binding site encompasses part of the analogous binding site of pdz a as already described previously yet specific interaction sites are abolished by the insertion of amino acids in pdz b as shown by high affinity chromatography gst pdz b and gst pdz a bind to phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate pip  micelles with a dissociation constant kd of   m and   m respectively in line with these data pdz b binds isolated dissolved pip and pip  phosphatidylinositol    trisphosphate molecules specifically with a lower kd of      m as detected by nmr spectroscopy the binding site could be located by our studies and involves the residues ile  val  val  asn  gly  ala  glu  arg  gly  and gln  pip and pip binding takes place in the groove of the pdz domain that is normally part of the apc binding site
