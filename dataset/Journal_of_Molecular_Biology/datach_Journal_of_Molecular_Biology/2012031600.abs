interaction of j protein co chaperone jac with fe  s scaffold isu is indispensable in vivo and conserved in evolution
the ubiquitous mitochondrial j protein jac  called hscb in escherichia coli and its partner hsp  play a critical role in the transfer of fe  s clusters from the scaffold protein isu to recipient proteins biochemical results from eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems indicate that formation of the jac  isu complex is important for both targeting of the isu for hsp  binding and stimulation of hsp  s atpase activity however in apparent contradiction we previously reported that an  fold decrease in jac s affinity for isu is well tolerated in vivo raising the question as to whether the jac isu interaction actually plays an important biological role here we report the determination of the structure of jac from saccharomyces cerevisiae taking advantage of this information and recently published data from the homologous bacterial system we determined that a total of eight surface exposed residues play a role in isu binding as assessed by a set of biochemical assays a variant having alanines substituted for these eight residues was unable to support growth of a jac   strain however replacement of three residues caused partial loss of function resulting in a significant decrease in the jac isu interaction a slow growth phenotype and a reduction in the activity of fe  s cluster containing enzymes thus we conclude that the jac isu interaction plays an indispensable role in the essential process of mitochondrial fe  s cluster biogenesis
