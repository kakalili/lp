structure dynamics and heparin binding of the c terminal domain of insulin like growth factor binding protein  igfbp
insulin like growth factor binding protein  igfbp  is the largest member of a family of six proteins igfbp  to  that bind insulin like growth factors i and ii igf i ii with high affinity in addition to regulating igf actions igfbps have igf independent functions the c terminal domains of igfbps contribute to high affinity igf binding and confer binding specificity and have overlapping but variable interactions with many other molecules using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy we have determined the solution structure of the c terminal domain of igfbp  c bp  and analysed its backbone dynamics based on  n relaxation parameters c bp  has a thyroglobulin type  fold consisting of an  helix a three stranded anti parallel  sheet and three flexible loops compared to c bp  and c bp  structural differences that may affect igf binding and underlie other functional differences were found c bp  has a longer disordered loop i and an extended c terminal tail which is unstructured and very mobile the length of the helix is identical with that of c bp  but shorter than that of c bp  reduced spectral density mapping analysis showed that c bp  possesses significant rapid motion in the loops and termini and may undergo slower conformational or chemical exchange in the structured core and loop ii an rgd motif is located in a solvent exposed turn a ph dependent heparin binding site on c bp  has been identified protonation of two histidine residues his  and his   seems to be important for this binding which occurs at slightly acidic ph    and is more significant at ph   but is largely suppressed at ph   possible preferential binding of igfbp  and its c domain fragments to glycosaminoglycans in the acidic extracellular matrix ecm of tumours may be related to their roles in cancer
