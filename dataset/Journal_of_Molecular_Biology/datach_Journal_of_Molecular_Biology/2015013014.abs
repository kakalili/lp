two ball structure of the flagellar hook length control protein flik as revealed by high speed atomic force microscopy
the bacterial flagellar hook is a short and uniquely curved tube that connects the basal body to the filament hook length is controlled at  nm on average by a soluble protein flik in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium the n terminal segment of flik responsible for measuring the hook length is considered to be intrinsically disordered here we show by high speed atomic force microscopy that a flik molecule in solution takes on a shape of two balls linked by a flexible string the larger ball corresponds to the n terminal region and the smaller one corresponds to the c terminal region the n terminal domain is stable but the c terminal domain fluctuates in shape based on these and other features of flik we propose that the folding of the n terminal segment at the tip of the growing hook plays a major role in determining the minimal length of the hook
