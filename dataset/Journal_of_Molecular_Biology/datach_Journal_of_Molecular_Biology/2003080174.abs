changes in thermal stability and microunfolding pattern of collagen helix resulting from the loss of   i chain in osteogenesis imperfecta murine
homozygous mutations resulting in formation of   i  homotrimers instead of normal type i collagen cause mild to severe osteogenesis imperfecta oi in humans and mice limited studies of changes in thermal stability of type i homotrimers were reported previously but the results were not fully consistent we revisited this question in more detail using purified tendon collagen from wild type   i   i heterotrimers and oim   i  mice as well as artificial   i  homotrimers obtained by refolding of rat tail tendon collagen we found that at the same heating rate oim homotrimers completely denature at    deg c higher temperature than wild type heterotrimers as determined by differential scanning calorimetry at the same constant temperature homotrimers denature    times slower than heterotrimers as determined by circular dichroism detailed analysis of proteolytic cleavage at different temperatures revealed that microunfolding of oim homotrimers and wild type heterotrimers occurs at similar rate but within a number of different sites in particular the weakest spot on the oim triple helix is located    amino acid residues from the c terminal end within the cyanogen bromide peptide cb  the same microunfolding site is also present in wild type collagen but the weakest spot of the latter is located close to the n terminal end of cb  amino acid analysis and differential gel electrophoresis showed virtually no posttranslational overmodification of oim mouse tendon collagen moreover thermal stability and microunfolding of artificial rat tail tendon homotrimers were similar to oim homotrimers thus the observed changes are associated with difference in the amino acid composition of   i and   i chains rather than posttranslational overmodification
