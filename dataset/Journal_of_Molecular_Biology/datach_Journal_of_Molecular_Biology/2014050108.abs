the protein kinase ck andante holoenzyme structure supports proposed models of autoregulation and trans autophosphorylation
eukaryotic protein kinases are typically strictly controlled by second messenger binding protein protein interactions dephosphorylations or similar processes none of these regulatory mechanisms is known to work for protein kinase ck  former name  casein kinase    an acidophilic and constitutively active eukaryotic protein kinase ck predominantly exists as a heterotetrameric holoenzyme composed of two catalytic subunits ck   complexed to a dimer of non catalytic subunits ck   one model of ck regulation was proposed several times independently by theoretical docking of the first ck holoenzyme structure according to this model the ck holoenzyme forms autoinhibitory aggregates correlated with trans autophosphorylation and driven by the down regulatory affinity between an acidic loop of ck  and the positively charged substrate binding region of ck  from a neighboring ck heterotetramer circular trimeric aggregates in which one half of the ck  chains show the predicted inhibitory proximity between those regions were detected within the crystal packing of the human ck holoenzyme here we present further in vitro support of the  regulation by aggregation  model by an alternative crystal form in which ck tetramers are arranged as approximately linear aggregates coinciding essentially with the early predictions in this assembly the substrate binding region of every ck  chain is blocked by a ck  acidic loop from a neighboring tetramer we found these crystals with ck andante that contains a ck  variant mutated in a ck  contact helix and described to be responsible for a prolonged circadian rhythm in drosophila the increased propensity of ck andante to form aggregates with completely blocked active sites may contribute to this phenotype
