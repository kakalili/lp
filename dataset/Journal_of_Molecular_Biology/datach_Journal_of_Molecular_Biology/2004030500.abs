interaction of helix d of elongation factor tu with helices  and  of protein l   on the ribosome
elongation factor tu ef tu promotes binding of aminoacyl trna to the a site of the ribosome here we report the effects of mutations in helix d of ef tu and in the c terminal domain of l   on the kinetics of a site binding reaction rates were measured by stopped flow and quench flow techniques the rates of a site binding were decreased by mutations at positions        and   in helix d of ef tu as well as at positions           and  in helices  and  of l   the effect was due primarily to the lower association rate constant of ternary complex binding to the ribosome these results suggest that helix d of ef tu is involved in an initial transient contact with helices  and  of l   that promotes ternary complex binding to the ribosome by analogy to the interaction of helix d of ef tu with the n terminal domain of ef ts the contact area is likely to consist of a hydrophobic patch flanked by two salt bridges
