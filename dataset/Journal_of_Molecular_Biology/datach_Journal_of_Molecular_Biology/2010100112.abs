conformational changes and ligand recognition of escherichia colid xylose binding protein revealed
atp binding cassette transport systems account for most import of necessary nutrients in bacteria the periplasmic binding component or an equivalent membrane anchored protein is critical to recognizing cognate ligand and directing it to the appropriate membrane permease here we report the x ray structures of d xylose binding protein from escherichia coli in ligand free open form ligand bound open form and ligand bound closed form at          and     resolutions respectively the ligand bound open form is the first such structure to be reported at high resolution the combination of the three different forms from the same protein furthermore gives unprecedented details concerning the conformational changes involved in binding protein function as is typical of the structural family the protein has two similar globular domains which are connected by a three stranded hinge region the open liganded structure shows that xylose binds first to the c terminal domain with only very small conformational changes resulting after a   closing motion additional interactions are formed with the n terminal domain changes in this domain are larger and serve to make the structure more ordered near the ligand an analysis of the interactions suggests why xylose is the preferred ligand furthermore a comparison with the most closely related proteins in the structural family shows that the conformational changes are distinct in each type of binding protein which may have implications for how the individual proteins act in concert with their respective membrane permeases
