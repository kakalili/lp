micrornas and hiv  infection antiviral activities and beyond
cellular micrornas mirnas are an important class of small non coding rnas that bind to host mrnas based on sequence complementarity and regulate protein expression they play important roles in controlling key cellular processes including cellular inception differentiation and death while several viruses have been shown to encode for viral mirnas controversy persists over the expression of a functional mirna encoded in the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genome however it has been reported that hiv  infectivity is influenced by cellular mirnas either through directly targeting the viral genome or by targeting host cellular proteins required for successful virus replication multiple cellular mirnas seem to modulate hiv  infection and replication perhaps as a survival strategy hiv  may modulate proteins in the mirna biogenesis pathway to subvert mirna induced antiviral effects global expression profiles of cellular mirnas have also identified alterations of specific mirnas post hiv  infection both in vitro and in vivo in various infected patient cohorts  suggesting potential roles for mirnas in pathogenesis and disease progression however little attention has been devoted in understanding the roles played by these mirnas at a cellular level in this manuscript we review past and current findings pertaining to the field of mirna and hiv  interplay in addition we suggest strategies to exploit mirnas therapeutically for curbing hiv  infectivity replication and latency since they hold an untapped potential that deserves further investigation
