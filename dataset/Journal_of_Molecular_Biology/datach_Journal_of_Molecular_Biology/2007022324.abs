acidic ph induced conformational changes in amyloidogenic mutant transthyretin
several proteins including transthyretin ttr  can generate in tissues extracellular insoluble aggregates in the form of fibrils that are associated with pathological states known as amyloidoses to date more than  different ttr point mutations have been associated with hereditary amyloidosis in humans in vitro the formation of amyloid fibrils by human ttr is known to be triggered by acidic ph we show here that in vitro the natural amyloidogenic i s and the non natural i a ttr mutant forms exhibit a propensity to produce fibrils in an acidic medium significantly higher than that of wild type ttr the two mutant forms have been crystallized at both neutral and acidic ph their neutral ph crystal structures are very similar to that of wild type ttr consistent with previous evidence indicating that only minor structural changes are induced by amyloidogenic mutations on the contrary their crystal structures at moderately low ph    show significant conformational differences as compared to their neutral ph structures remarkably such changes are not induced in wild type ttr crystallized at low ph the most relevant consist of the unwinding of the ttr short  helix and of the change in conformation of the loop connecting the  helix to  strand f only one monomer of the crystallographic dimer is affected causing a disruption of the tetrameric symmetry this asymmetry and a possible destabilization of the tetrameric quaternary structure of ttr may be responsible for the amyloidogenic potential of the two ttr mutant forms at low ph
