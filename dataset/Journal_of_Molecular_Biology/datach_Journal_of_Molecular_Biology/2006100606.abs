two parts of the t s domain of the hook length control protein flik are essential for the substrate specificity switching of the flagellar type iii export apparatus
the switch in export specificity of the type iii flagellar protein export apparatus from rod hook type to filament type is believed to occur upon completion of hook assembly by way of an interaction of the type iii secretion substrate specificity switch t s  domain of the hook length control protein flik with the integral membrane export apparatus component flhb the t s domain of flik flikt s  consisting of amino acid residues      has an unstable and flexible conformation in its last  residues flikct  to investigate the role of flikt s in substrate specificity switching we studied the effect of deletions and point mutations within this domain and characterized suppressor mutations deletions of ten amino acid residues within the region of residues      and five amino acids of residues      abolished switching of export specificity site directed mutagenesis showed that highly conserved residues val   ile   leu   val  and ala   are essential and that the five c terminal residues       are restricted in conformation for the switching process suppressor mutant analysis of the flik s  y mutant which produces extended hooks with filaments attached due to delayed switching suggested that flikt s interacts with the c terminal half of the cytoplasmic domain of flhb flhbc  we propose a two step binding model of flikt s and flhbc in which residues      of flik bind to flhbc upon hook assembly completion at about   nm and then unfolded flikct binds to flhbc to trigger the switch in substrate specificity
