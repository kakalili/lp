RNA molecules have an inherent flexibility that enables recognition of other interacting partners through potential disorder–order transitions, yet studies to quantify such motional dynamics remain few. With an increasing database of three-dimensional structures of biologically important RNA molecules, quantifying such motions becomes important to link structural deformations with function. One such system studied intensely is domain 5 (D5) from the self-splicing group II introns, which is at the heart of its catalytic machinery. We report the dynamics of a 36 nucleotide D5 from the Pylaiella littoralis group II intron in the presence and absence of magnesium ions, and at a range of temperatures (298K–318 K). Using high-resolution NMR experiments of heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE), spin-lattice (R1), and spin–spin (R2) 13C relaxation rates, we determined the rotational diffusion tensor of D5 using the ROTDIF program modified for RNA dynamic analysis (ROTDIF_RNA). The D5 rotational diffusion tensor has an axial symmetric ratio (D||/D⊥) of 1.7±0.3, consistent with an estimated overall rotational correlation time of τm=(2D||+4D⊥)−1 of 6.1(±0.3) ns at 298 K and 4.1(±0.2) ns at 318 K. The measured relaxation data were analyzed with the reduced spectral density mapping formalism using assumed values of the chemical shift anisotropy of the 13C spins. Both the relaxation data and the values of the spectral density function reveal that the functional groups in D5 implicated in magnesium ion binding and catalysis (catalytic triad, internal bulge, and tetraloop regions) exhibit thermally induced motion on a wide variety of timescales. Because these motions parallel those observed in the intramolecular stem–loop of the U6 element within the spliceosome, we hypothesize that such extensive dynamic disorder likely facilitates D5 engaging both binding and catalytic regions of the ribozyme, and these may be a conserved feature of the catalytic machinery essential for catalysis.
