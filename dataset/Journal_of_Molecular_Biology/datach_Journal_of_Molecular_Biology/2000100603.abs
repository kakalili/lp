structural identification of a key protective b cell epitope in lyme disease antigen ospa edited by i a wilson
outer surface protein a ospa is a major lipoprotein of the borrelia burgdorferi spirochete the causative agent of lyme disease vaccination with ospa generates an immune response that can prevent bacterial transmission to a mammalian host during the attachment of an infected tick however the protective capacity of immune sera cannot be predicted by measuring total anti ospa antibody the murine monoclonal antibody la  defines an important protective b cell epitope of ospa against which protective sera have strong levels of reactivity we have now mapped the la  epitope of ospa using both nmr chemical shift perturbation measurements in solution and x ray crystal structure determination la  recognizes the three surface exposed loops of the c terminal domain of ospa that are on the tip of the elongated molecule most distant from the lipid modified n terminus the structure suggests that the natural variation at ospa sequence position   in the first loop is a major limiting factor for antibody cross reactivity between different lyme disease causing borrelia strains the unusual fab dominated lattice of the crystal also permits a rare view of antigen flexibility within an antigen antibody complex these results provide a rationale for improvements in ospa based vaccines and suggest possible designs for more direct tests of antibody protective levels in vaccinated individuals
