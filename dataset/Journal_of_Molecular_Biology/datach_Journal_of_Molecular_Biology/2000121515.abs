from minichaperone to groel  importance of avidity of the multisite ring structure
structural studies on minichaperones and groel imply a continuous ring of binding sites around the neck of groel to investigate the importance of this ring we constructed an artificial heptameric assembly of minichaperones to mimic their arrangement in groel the heptameric gp  co chaperonin from bacteriophage t  an analogue of groes was used as a scaffold to display the groel minichaperones a fusion protein mc  was generated by replacing a part of the highly mobile loop of gp  residues    with the sequence of the minichaperone residues     of groel  the purified recombinant protein assembled into a heptameric ring composed of seven   kda subunits although single minichaperones residues     to     of groel have certain chaperone activities in vitro and in vivo they cannot refold heat and dithiothreitol denatured mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase mtmdh  a reaction that normally requires groel its co chaperonin groes and atp but mc refolded mdh in vitro the expression of mc complements in vivo two temperature sensitive escherichia coli alleles groel  and groel   at   c although mc could not compensate for the complete absence of groel in vivo it enhanced the colony forming ability of cells containing limiting amounts of wild type groel at   c mc also reduces aggregate formation and cell death in mammalian cell models of huntington s disease the assembly of seven minichaperone subunits on a heptameric ring significantly improves their activity demonstrating the importance of avidity in groel function
