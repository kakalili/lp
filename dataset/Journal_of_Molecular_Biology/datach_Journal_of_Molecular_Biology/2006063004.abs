the third  amino acid repeat is the tightest binding site of apc for  catenin
adenomatous polyposis coli apc plays a critical role in the wnt signaling pathway by tightly regulating  catenin turnover and localization the central region of apc is responsible for apc  catenin interactions through its seven  amino acid  aa repeats and three  amino acid  aa repeats using isothermal titration calorimetry we have determined the binding affinities of  catenin with an apc  aa repeat fragment and each of the seven  aa repeats in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states despite sequence homology different  catenin binding repeats of apc have dramatically different binding affinities with  catenin and thus may play different biological roles the third  aa repeat is by far the tightest binding site for  catenin among all the repeats the fact that most apc mutations associated with colon cancers have lost the third  aa repeat underlines the importance of apc   catenin interaction in wnt signaling and human diseases for every  aa repeat phosphorylation dramatically increases its binding affinity for  catenin suggesting phosphorylation has a critical regulatory role in apc function in addition our cd and nmr studies demonstrate that the central region of apc is unstructured in the absence of  catenin and axin and suggest that  catenin may interact with each of the apc  aa and  aa repeats independently
