toxoplasma gondii alba proteins are involved in translational control of gene expression
molecular mechanisms controlling gene expression in apicomplexan parasites remain poorly understood here we report the characterization of two toxoplasma gondii homologs of the ancient archeal alba proteins named tgalba and tgalba  the targeted disruption of tgalba and tgalba genes in both virulent type i and avirulent type ii strains of t gondii reveals that tgalba proteins may have an important role in regulating stress response we found that although the steady state level of the tgalba transcript is increased in the  tgalba null mutant parasites the cognate tgalba protein is undetectable suggesting that tgalba is required for translation of tgalba  using a tandem affinity purification tag strategy combined with proteomic analyses we provide evidence that many factors known to be involved in the translation machinery are co purified with tgalba and tgalba  we further performed rna pull down and microarray analyses to show that tgalba and tgalba bind to more than  rnas including their own transcripts moreover we demonstrate that the tight translational regulation of the tgalba endogenous transcript relies on the presence of both its   untranslated region and that of the tgalba protein thus our findings on tgalba and tgalba are consistent with a role in gene specific translation
