We used an Escherichia coli genetic assay based on the phage T4 td intron to test the ability of the Neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (CYT-18 protein) to suppress mutations that cause structural defects around its binding site in the P4-P6 domain of the group I intron catalytic core. We analyzed all possible combinations of nucleotides at either P4 bp-1 or P6 bp-1, which together form the junction of the P4-P6 stacked helices, and looked for synergistic effects in double mutants. Most mutations at either position inhibit self-splicing, but can be suppressed by CYT-18. CYT-18 can compensate efficiently for mutations that disrupt base-pairing at either P4 bp-1 or P6 bp-1, for mutations at P6 bp-1 that disrupt the base-triple interaction with J3/4-3, and for nucleotide substitutions at either position that are predicted to be suboptimal for base stacking, based on the analysis of DNA four-way junctions. However, CYT-18 has difficulty suppressing combinations of mutations at P4 bp-1 and P6 bp-1 that simultaneously disrupt base-pairing and base stacking. Thermal denaturation and Fe(II)-EDTA analysis showed that mutations at the junction of the P4-P6 stacked helices lead to grossly impaired tertiary-structure formation centered in the P4-P6 domain. CYT-18-suppressible mutants bind the protein with Kd values up to 79-fold higher than that for the wild-type intron, but in all cases tested, the koff value for the complex remains within twofold of the wild-type value, suggesting that the binding site can be formed properly and that the increased Kd value reflects primarily an increased kon value for the binding of CYT-18 to the misfolded intron. Our results indicate that the P4/P6 junction is a linchpin region, where even small nucleotide substitutions grossly disrupt the catalytically-active group I intron tertiary structure, and that CYT-18 binding induces the formation of the correct structure in this region, leading to folding of the group I intron catalytic core.
