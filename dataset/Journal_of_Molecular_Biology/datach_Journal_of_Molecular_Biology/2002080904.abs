lipid triggered conformational switch of apolipophorin iii helix bundle to an extended helix organization
apolipophorin iii apolp iii from the sphinx moth manduca sexta is an  kda protein that binds reversibly to hydrophobic surfaces generated on metabolizing lipoprotein particles it is comprised of amphipathic  helices h  h  organized in an up and down topology forming a helix bundle in the lipid free state upon interaction with lipids apolp iii has been proposed to undergo a dramatic conformational change involving helix bundle opening about putative hinge loops such that h  h and h move away from h and h  in the present study we examine the relative spatial disposition of h and h on discoidal phospholipid complexes and spherical lipoproteins cysteine residues were engineered at position  in h and or at position   in h in apolp iii which otherwise lacks cys yielding a c  a  c and a c a  c  apolp iii tethering of h and h by a disulfide bond between a c and a  c abolished the ability of apolp iii to transform phospholipid vesicles to discoidal particles or to interact with lipoproteins demonstrating that these helices are required to reposition during lipid interaction site specific labeling of a c a  c  apolp iii with n  pyrene maleimide in the lipid free state resulted in intramolecular pyrene  excimer  fluorescence emission indicative of spatial proximity between these sites upon association with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine dmpc discoidal complexes the intramolecular excimer was replaced by intermolecular excimer fluorescence due to proximity between pyrene moieties on a c and a  c in neighboring apolp iii molecules on the discoidal particle no excimer emission was observed in the case of pyrene  a c  apolp iii dmpc or pyrene  a  c  apolp iii dmpc complexes however equimolar mixing of the two labeled single cysteine mutants prior to disc formation resulted in excimer emission in addition intramolecular pyrene excimer formation was diminished upon binding of pyrene  a c a  c  apolp iii to spherical lipoproteins the data are consistent with repositioning of h away from h upon encountering a lipid surface resulting in an extended conformation of apolp iii that circumscribes the discoidal bilayer particle
