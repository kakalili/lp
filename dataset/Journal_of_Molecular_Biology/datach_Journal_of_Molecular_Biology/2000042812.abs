mapping the transition state of the ww domain  sheet edited by c r matthews
the folding kinetics of a three stranded antiparallel  sheet ww domain have been measured by temperature jump relaxation folding and activation free energies were determined as a function of temperature for both the wild type and the mutant domain w f which modifies the     hydrophobic interface the folding rate decreases at higher temperatures as a result of the increase in the activation free energy for folding   values were obtained for thermal perturbations allowing the primary features of the folding free energy surface to be determined the results of this analysis indicate a significant shift from an  early    t    to a  late    t    transition state with increasing temperature the temperature dependent  value analysis of the wild type ww domain and of its more stable w f hydrophobic cluster mutant reveals little participation of residue  in the transition state at lower temperature as the temperature is raised hydrophobic interactions at the     interface gain importance in the transition state and the barrier height of the wild type which contains the larger tryptophan residue increases more slowly than the barrier height of the mutant
