structural analysis of peroxide soaked mnsod crystals reveals side on binding of peroxide to active site manganese
the superoxide dismutase sod enzymes are important antioxidant agents that protect cells from reactive oxygen species the sod family is responsible for catalyzing the disproportionation of superoxide radical to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide manganese and iron containing sod exhibit product inhibition whereas cu znsod does not here we report the crystal structure of escherichia coli mnsod with hydrogen peroxide cryotrapped in the active site crystallographic refinement to     and close inspection revealed electron density for hydrogen peroxide in three of the four active sites in the asymmetric unit the hydrogen peroxide molecules are in the position opposite his  that is normally assumed by water in the trigonal bipyramidal resting state of the enzyme hydrogen peroxide is present in active sites b c and d and is side on coordinated to the active site manganese in chains b and d the peroxide is oriented in the plane formed by manganese and ligands asp  and his  in chain c the peroxide is bound making a   angle to the plane comparison of the peroxide bound active site with the hydroxide bound octahedral form shows a shifting of residue tyr  towards the active site when peroxide is bound comparison with peroxide soaked cu znsod indicates end on binding of peroxide when the sod does not exhibit inhibition by peroxide and side on binding of peroxide in the product inhibited state of mnsod
