early kinetics of amyloid fibril formation reveals conformational reorganisation of initial aggregates
understanding the initial steps of protein aggregation leading to the formation of amyloid fibrils remains a challenge here the kinetics of such a process is determined for a misfolding protein model ada h the double nature of the very early kinetics suggests a step model of aggregation where the denatured polypeptide folds into an aggregated  intermediate that subsequently reorganises into a more organised  sheet richer structure that finally results in amyloid fibre formation to determine the regions of the protein involved in amyloidosis we have analysed a series of mutants previously made to study ada h folding using the algorithm tango we have designed mutants that should enhance or decrease aggregation experimental analysis of the mutants shows that the c terminus of the molecule comprising the last and edge  strand is the major contributor to amyloid fibril formation in good agreement with theoretical predictions comparison with proteins with similar topology reveals that family folds do not necessarily share the same principles of protein folding and or aggregation
