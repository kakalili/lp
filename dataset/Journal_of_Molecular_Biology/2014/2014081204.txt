Sus1p is a common component of transcriptional co-activator, SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyltransferase), and mRNA export complex, TREX-2 (Transcription-export 2), and is involved in promoting transcription and mRNA export. However, it is not clearly understood how Sus1p promotes transcription. Here, we show that Sus1p is predominantly recruited to the upstream activating sequence of a SAGA-dependent gene, GAL1, under transcriptionally active conditions as a component of SAGA to promote the formation of pre-initiation complex (PIC) at the core promoter and, consequently, transcriptional initiation. Likewise, Sus1p promotes the PIC formation at other SAGA-dependent genes and hence transcriptional initiation. Such function of Sus1p in promoting PIC formation and transcriptional initiation is not mediated via its role in regulation of SAGA's histone H2B de-ubiquitylation activity. However, Sus1p's function in regulation of histone H2B ubiquitylation is associated with transcriptional elongation, DNA repair and replication. Collectively, our results support that Sus1p promotes PIC formation (and hence transcriptional initiation) at the SAGA-regulated genes independently of histone H2B de-ubiquitylation and further controls transcriptional elongation, DNA repair and replication via orchestration of histone H2B ubiquitylation, thus providing distinct functional insights of Sus1p in regulation of DNA transacting processes.
