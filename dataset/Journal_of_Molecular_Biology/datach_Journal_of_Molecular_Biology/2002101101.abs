rationalization of gene regulation by a eukaryotic transcription factor calculation of regulatory region occupancy from predicted binding affinities
dna binding proteins regulate gene expression by binding preferentially to a set of related sequences in order to quantify the correlation between gene regulation and the presence of sequence motifs the affinity of a transcription factor for each variant of the binding site must be known or predicted in addition the contribution of multiple binding sites to the regulation of a single gene must be modeled to predict the affinity of the yeast leu transcription factor for genomic binding sites we measured the in vitro equilibrium dissociation constants of  binding site variants and established that the free energy of binding can be approximated as a sum of free energy contributions from each base pair this allows the prediction of an equilibrium dissociation constant for all potential binding sites in the genome and therefore their fractional occupancy at some assumed concentration of free leu  from the occupancy of individual sites the probability that at least one site is occupied within a defined segment upstream of a gene was calculated for all genes in yeast we find that this probability is substantially better correlated with regulation by leu than is the number of binding sites this is true whether the number of binding sites is based on a consensus site definition of the binding site or by enumeration of all variants that have a predicted kd value below some threshold the occupancy calculation was best able to rationalize the leu regulated gene set over a leu concentration range that spans the kd values for the best sites
