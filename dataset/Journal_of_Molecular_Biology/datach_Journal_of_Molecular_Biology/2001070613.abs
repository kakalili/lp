plasmid transcriptional repressor copg oligomerises to render helical superstructures unbound and in complexes with oligonucleotides edited by r huber
copg is a  amino acid residue transcriptional repressor involved in the copy number control of the streptococcal plasmid pmv   to do so it binds to a dna operator that contains a  bp pseudosymmetric dna element binding of copg to its operator results in repression at the transcriptional level of its own synthesis and that of the initiator of replication protein repb biochemical experiments have shown that copg co operatively associates to its target dna at low protein dna ratios completely protecting four helical turns on the same face of the double helix in both directions from the inverted repeat that constitutes the copg primary target this has been correlated with a copg mediated dna bend of about     here we show that binding of copg to dna fragments containing the inverted repeat just at one end led to nucleation of the protein initiating from the inverted repeat nucleation extended to the entire fragment with copg dna contacts occurring on the same face of the dna helix the protein the prototype for a family of homologous plasmid repressors displays a homodimeric ribbon helix helix arrangement it polymerises within the unbound crystal to render a continuous right handed protein superhelix of homodimers around which a bound double stranded ds dna could wrap we have solved the crystal structure of copg in complex with a  bp dsdna oligonucleotide encompassing the cognate pseudosymmetric element in the crystal one protein tetramer binds at one face of the dna with two parallel  ribbons inserted into the major groove the dna is bent about    under compression of both major and minor grooves a continuous right handed complex helix made up mainly by protein protein and some protein dna interactions is observed the protein protein interactions involve regions similar to those observed in the oligomerisation of the native crystals and those employed to set up the functional tetramer a previously solved complex structure of the protein with a  bp dsdna had unveiled a left handed helical superstructure just made up by dna interactions
