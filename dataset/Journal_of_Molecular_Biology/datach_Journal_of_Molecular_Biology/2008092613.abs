crystal structure of a glutamate aspartate binding protein complexed with a glutamate molecule structural basis of ligand specificity at atomic resolution
the crystal structure of a periplasmic l aspartate l glutamate binding protein debp from shigella flexneri complexed with an l glutamate molecule has been determined and refined to an atomic resolution of     there are two debp molecules in the asymmetric unit the refined model contains   non hydrogen protein atoms   water molecules  bound glutamate molecules and  tris molecules from the buffer used in crystallization the final rcryst and rfree factors are    and     respectively the structure has root mean square deviations of      from standard bond lengths and    from standard bond angles the debp molecule is composed of two similarly folded domains separated by the ligand binding region both domains contain a central five stranded  sheet that is surrounded by several  helices the two domains are linked by two antiparallel  strands the overall shape of debp is that of an ellipsoid approximately            in size the binding of ligand to debp is achieved mostly through hydrogen bonds between the glutamate and side chain and main chain groups of debp side chains of residues arg  ser  arg  ser  and his  anchor the deprotonated  carboxylate group of the glutamate with six hydrogen bonds side chains of arg  and arg  form salt bridges with the deprotonated  carboxylate group while the main chain amide groups of thr  and thr  form hydrogen bonds with the same group the positively charged  amino group of the l glutamate forms salt bridge interaction with the side chain carboxylate group of asp  and hydrogen bond interaction with main chain carbonyl oxygen of ser  in addition to these hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions other interactions may also play important roles for example the two methylene groups from the glutamate form van der waals interactions with hydrophobic side chains of debp comparisons with several other periplasmic amino acid binding proteins indicate that debp residues involved in the binding of  amino and  carboxylate groups of the ligand and the pattern of hydrogen bond formation between these groups are very well conserved but the binding pocket around the ligand side chain is not leading to the specificity of debp we have identified structural features of debp that determine its ability of binding glutamate and aspartate two molecules with different sizes but discriminating against very similar glutamine and asparagine molecules
