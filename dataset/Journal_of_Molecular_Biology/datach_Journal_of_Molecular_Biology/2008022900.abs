conformational stability of prp amyloid fibrils controls their smallest possible fragment size
fibril fragmentation is considered to be an essential step in prion replication recent studies have revealed a strong correlation between the incubation period to prion disease and conformational stability of synthetic prions to gain insight into the molecular mechanism that accounts for this correlation we proposed that the conformational stability of prion fibrils controls their intrinsic fragility or the size of the smallest possible fibrillar fragments using amyloid fibrils produced from full length mammalian prion protein under three growth conditions we found a correlation between conformational stability and the smallest possible fragment sizes specifically the fibrils that were conformationally less stable were found to produce shorter pieces upon fragmentation site specific denaturation experiments revealed that the fibril conformational stability was controlled by the region that acquires a cross  sheet structure using atomic force microscopy imaging we found that fibril fragmentation occurred in both directions  perpendicular to and along the fibrillar axis two mechanisms of fibril fragmentation were identified  i fragmentation caused by small heat shock proteins including  b crystallin and ii fragmentation due to mechanical stress arising from adhesion of the fibril to a surface this study provides new mechanistic insight into the prion replication mechanism and offers a plausible explanation for the correlation between conformational stability of synthetic prions and incubation time to prion disease
