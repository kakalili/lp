sequence conservation in ig like domains the role of highly conserved proline residues in the fibronectin type iii superfamily
the role of conserved proline residues in fibronectin type iii fniii domains is investigated surprisingly none of the standard set of explanations for residue conservation applies the proline residues are not apparently conserved for function or stability or to nucleate folding or to promote stabilising interactions across domain boundaries however when the most highly conserved proline residues are mutated to alanine there is an increase in the rate of aggregation of a fniii double module construct the results suggest that proline residues may be conserved at domain  domain boundaries in fniii domains to prevent aggregation in multi modular proteins
