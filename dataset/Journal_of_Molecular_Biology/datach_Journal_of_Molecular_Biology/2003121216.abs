solution structure of the c terminal antiparallel coiled coil domain from escherichia coli osmosensor prop
bacteria respond to increasing medium osmolality by accumulating organic solutes that are compatible with cellular functions transporter prop of escherichia coli a proton symporter and a member of the major facilitator superfamily senses osmotic shifts and responds by importing osmolytes such as glycine betaine prop contains a cytoplasmic c terminal extension that is essential for its activity a peptide corresponding to the c terminal extension of prop forms a homodimeric  helical coiled coil even though some of its heptad a positions are not occupied by hydrophobic amino acid residues unexpectedly amino acid replacement r  i occurring at a heptad a position destabilized the coiled coil formed by the prop peptide and attenuated the response of the intact transporter to osmotic upshifts in vivo thus prop was proposed to dimerize via an antiparallel coiled coil we used nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy to determine the structure of the synthetic peptide corresponding to residues      of prop this region did form an antiparallel coil coil in which critical residue r  specifies the antiparallel coiled coil orientation by forming stabilizing salt bridges charged residues both acidic and basic are clustered on the c g surface of the coiled coil whereas polar residues are distributed on the b e surface this causes the structure to be bent in contrast to other known antiparallel coiled coils those from the hepatitis delta antigen pdb id code a  and the bovine f atpase inhibitor protein pdb id code hf   the coiled coil and its possible importance for osmosensing are discussed
