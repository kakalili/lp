dimer composition and promoter context contribute to functional cooperation between ap  and nfat
the transcription factors activator protein  ap  and nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat cooperate to induce the expression of cytokines during the immune response while much is known about the signaling pathways and physical interactions between nfat and ap  dimers following lymphocyte activation few studies have addressed the role of ap  composition in modulating nfat ap  dependent transcription we examined the function of specific ap  complexes using  tethered  ap  dimers with defined composition we found that nfat can functionally cooperate with all ap  dimers tested noteworthy jun  jun containing dimers which are relatively inactive when tested on an ap  dependent promoter are effective co activators of an nfat ap  dependent promoter interestingly specific ap  dimer combinations behave differently when tested on interleukin  il  and interleukin  il  gene regulatory regions moreover the requirement for nfat to activate each of the promoters is different our results suggest that higher nfat levels are necessary to activate the il promoter hence changes in ap  composition and the level of participating nfat proteins can differentially influence cytokine gene expression resulting in biological consequences for the modulation and dynamics of the immune response
