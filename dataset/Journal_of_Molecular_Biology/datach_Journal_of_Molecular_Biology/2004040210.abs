analysis of the interactions between hiv  and the cellular prion protein in a human cell line
the cellular prion protein prpc is highly conserved in mammals and expressed widely in different tissues but its physiological role remains elusive recently the human prpc was shown to possess nucleic acid binding and chaperoning properties similar to human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  nucleocapsid protein a key viral factor in virus structure and replication these findings prompted us to determine if prpc could influence hiv  replication we used the human  t cell line as a model system since only a very low level of prpc accumulates in these cells expression of prp at a high level resulted in a specific decrease of hiv  env and vpr expression despite similar levels of intracellular gag virus production was reduced by eightfold and infectivity by three to fourfold in the presence of prpc a prpc mutant lacking the glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchor peptide did not impair hiv  production suggesting that prpc trafficking is critical for this inhibitory effect coexpressing hiv  and prpc in these cells also caused a fraction of prpc to become partially proteinase k resistant prpres  further illustrating the interactions between hiv  and prpc
