mapping the spatial neighborhood of the regulatory s rna bound to escherichia coli rna polymerase holoenzyme
bacterial s rna interacts specifically with rna polymerase acting as transcriptional regulator until now no detailed characterization of the spatial arrangement of the non coding rna within the three dimensional structure of rna polymerase has been performed here we present results obtained with the chemical nuclease febabe tethered to distinct positions of rna polymerase   subunit  s rna complexes were formed with a collection of rna polymerases where the cleavage reagent had been fused to   single cysteine variants close to regions involved in promoter recognition febabe induced cleavage sites within the s rna structure were identified indicating close spatial neighborhood between   single cysteine side chains and defined positions of the s rna structure our analysis demonstrates close proximity between the s rna internal hairpin and   domain   normally involved in recognition of    promoter dna defined sections of the internal s rna stem structure flanking the central bubble are positioned near conserved   domains     and   which are implicated in binding and melting dna promoters between the    and    elements moreover we show that u  of s rna is located near rna polymerase active site    domain    fully consistent with its function as starting nucleotide in rna directed prna transcription no neighboring contacts were detected between s rna and   region   or between   and the s rna closing stem structure residues    and       results were used to dock a structural model of s rna to the known three dimensional structure of escherichia coli   rna polymerase holoenzyme
