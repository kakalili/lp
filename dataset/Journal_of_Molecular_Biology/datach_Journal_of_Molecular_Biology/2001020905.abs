crystal structure of the smc head domain an abc atpase with   residues antiparallel coiled coil inserted edited by r huber
smc structural maintenance of chromosomes proteins are large coiled coil proteins involved in chromosome condensation sister chromatid cohesion and dna double strand break processing they share a conserved five domain architecture with three globular domains separated by two long coiled coil segments the coiled coil segments are antiparallel bringing the n and c terminal globular domains together we have expressed a fusion protein of the n and c terminal globular domains of thermotoga maritima smc in escherichia coli by replacing the approximately   residue coiled coil and hinge segment with a short peptide linker the smc head domain smchd binds and condenses dna in an atp dependent manner using selenomethionine substituted protein and multiple anomalous dispersion phasing we have solved the crystal structure of the smchd to    resolution in the monoclinic crystal form six smchd molecules form two turns of a helix the fold of smchd is closely related to the atp binding cassette abc atpase family of proteins and rad  a member of the smc family involved in dna double strand break repair in smchd the abc atpase fold is formed by the n and c terminal domains with the   residue coiled coil and hinge segment inserted in the middle of the fold the crystal structure of an smchd confirms that the coiled coil segments in smc proteins are anti parallel and shows how the n and c terminal domains come together to form an abc atpase comparison to the structure of the mukb n terminal domain demonstrates the close relationship between mukb and smc proteins and indicates a helix to strand conversion when n and c terminal parts come together
