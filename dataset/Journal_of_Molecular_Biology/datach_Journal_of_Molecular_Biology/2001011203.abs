multiple display of peptides and proteins on a macromolecular scaffold derived from a multienzyme complex
the acyltransferase components e  from the family of  oxo acid dehydrogenase multienzyme complexes form large protein scaffolds to which multiple copies of peripheral enzymes bind tightly but non covalently sixty copies of the e polypeptide from the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of bacillus stearothermophilus assemble to form a pentagonal dodecahedral scaffold with icosahedral symmetry this protein scaffold can be modified to present foreign peptides and proteins on its surface we show that it is possible to display two epitopes mal and mal  from the circumsporozoite cs proteins of plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium berghei respectively and a green fluorescent protein egfp  on the e surface immunization with an e scaffold displaying the mal epitope elicited mal specific antibodies in rabbits egfp  kda displayed as an n terminal fusion in each of the  copies of the e chain folded into its active form as judged by its fluorescence and detection in localized foci in escherichia coli cells in vivo simultaneous display of a hexahistidine affinity tag the mal epitope and the green fluorescent protein all on the same e scaffold could be achieved by reversible denaturation and reassembly of mixtures of appropriately modified e chains this new methodology offers several important advantages over other current display technologies not least in the size of insert that can be accommodated and the multiplicity of display that can be achieved
