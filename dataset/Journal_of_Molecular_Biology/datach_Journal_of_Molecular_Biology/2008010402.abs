structural basis for catalysis by onconase
onconase  onc is a homolog of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease rnase a from the frog rana pipiens onc displays antitumoral activity and is in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of cancer here we report the first atomic structures of onc  nucleic acid complexes a t n e a onc    amp complex at     resolution and a wild type onc  d auga complex at     resolution the latter structure and site directed mutagenesis were used to reveal the atomic basis for substrate recognition and turnover by onc the residues in onc that are proximal to the scissile phosphodiester bond his  lys  and his  and uracil nucleobase thr  asp  and phe  are conserved from rnase a and serve to generate a similar bell shaped ph versus kcat km profile for rna cleavage glu  of onc forms two hydrogen bonds with the guanine nucleobase in d auga  and thr  is in close proximity to that nucleobase installing a neutral or cationic residue at position  or an asparagine residue at position  virtually eliminated the   fold guanine adenine preference of onc a variant that combined such substitutions t n e a onc actually preferred adenine over guanine in contrast installing an arginine residue at position  increased the guanine preference and afforded an onc variant with the highest known kcat km value these data indicate that onc discriminates between guanine and adenine by using coulombic interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds the structure of the onc  d auga complex was also used to probe other aspects of catalysis for example the t r substitution designed to create a favorable coulombic interaction between onc and a phosphoryl group in rna increased ribonucleolytic activity by twofold no variant however was more toxic to human cancer cells than wild type onc together these findings provide a cynosure for understanding catalysis of rna cleavage in a system of high medicinal relevance
