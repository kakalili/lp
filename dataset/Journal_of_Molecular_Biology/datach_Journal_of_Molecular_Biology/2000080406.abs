selection of peptidic mimics of digoxin from phage displayed peptide libraries by anti digoxin antibodies edited by i a wilson
since the initial report of the development of methodology to generate high affinity digitalis specific digoxin antibodies these antibodies have proven extremely useful tools to monitor digoxin levels in digitalized patients and as fab fragments to reverse toxic digoxin effects in life threatening digoxin overdoses these antibodies both digoxin specific and ouabain specific have been used extensively by investigators for the identification and characterization of putative endogenous digitalis like factors in this study we used two well characterized mouse anti digoxin monoclonal antibodies mabs  designated     and     as binding templates with which to select short bacteriophage displayed piii protein inserted peptides that are capable of binding to these mabs and mimicking the conformational structure of digoxin selective enrichment from two phage displayed random peptide libraries enabled us to isolate and identify distinct  and  amino acid residue peptide inserts that bind with high avidity and idiotypic specificity to the selecting mabs among these displayed inserts a subset was identified whose mab binding is inhibited by digoxin and whose corresponding synthetic peptides inhibit phage binding they therefore appear to bind at the mabs digoxin binding sites these data provide the first clear evidence that short polypeptides can serve as surrogates for the low molecular mass hapten digoxin
