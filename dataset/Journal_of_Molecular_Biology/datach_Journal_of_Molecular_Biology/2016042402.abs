high resolution mapping of the folding transition state of a ww domain
fast folding ww domains are among the best characterized systems for comparing experiments and simulations of protein folding recent microsecond resolution experiments and long duration totaling milliseconds single trajectory modeling have shown that even mechanistic changes in folding kinetics due to mutation can now be analyzed thus a comprehensive set of experimental data would be helpful to benchmark the predictions made by simulations here we use t jump relaxation in conjunction with protein engineering and report mutational  values  m as indicators for folding transition state structure of  side chain  backbone hydrogen bond and  deletion and or insertion mutants within loop  of the  residue hpin ww domain forty five cross validated consensus mutants could be identified that provide structural constraints for transition state structure within all substructures of the ww domain fold hydrophobic core loop  loop    sheet  we probe the robustness of the two hydrophobic clusters in the folding transition state discuss how local backbone disorder in the native state can lead to non classical  m  values  m gt   in the rate determining loop  substructure and conclusively identify mutations and positions along the sequence that perturb the folding mechanism from loop  limited toward loop  limited folding
