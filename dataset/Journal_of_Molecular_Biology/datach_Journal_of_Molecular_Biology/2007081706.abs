a novel roll and slide mechanism of dna folding in chromatin implications for nucleosome positioning
how eukaryotic genomes encode the folding of dna into nucleosomes and how this intrinsic organization of chromatin guides biological function are questions of wide interest the physical basis of nucleosome positioning lies in the sequence dependent propensity of dna to adopt the tightly bent configuration imposed by the binding of the histone proteins traditionally only dna bending and twisting deformations are considered while the effects of the lateral displacements of adjacent base pairs are neglected we demonstrate however that these displacements have a much more important structural role than ever imagined specifically the lateral slide deformations observed at sites of local anisotropic bending of dna define its superhelical trajectory in chromatin furthermore the computed cost of deforming dna on the nucleosome is sequence specific in optimally positioned sequences the most easily deformed base pair steps ca tg and ta occur at sites of large positive slide and negative roll where the dna bends into the minor groove  these conclusions rest upon a treatment of dna that goes beyond the conventional ribbon model incorporating all essential degrees of freedom of  real  duplexes in the estimation of dna deformation energies indeed only after lateral slide displacements are considered are we able to account for the sequence specific folding of dna found in nucleosome structures the close correspondence between the predicted and observed nucleosome locations demonstrates the potential advantage of our  structural  approach in the computer mapping of nucleosome positioning
