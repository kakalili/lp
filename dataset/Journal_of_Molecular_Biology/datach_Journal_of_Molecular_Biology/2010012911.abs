molecular evolution of multisubunit rna polymerases structural analysis
comprehensive multiple sequence alignments of the multisubunit dna dependent rna polymerase rnap large subunits including the bacterial  and    subunits and their homologs from archaebacterial rnaps eukaryotic rnaps i  iii nuclear  cytoplasmic large double stranded dna virus rnaps and plant plastid rnaps were created lane w j and darst s a     molecular evolution of multisubunit rna polymerases sequence analysis in press  the alignments were used to delineate sequence regions shared among all classes of multisubunit rnaps defining common fundamental rnap features as well as identifying highly conserved positions here we present a systematic detailed structural analysis of these shared regions and highly conserved positions in terms of the rnap structure as well as the rnap structure function relationship when known
