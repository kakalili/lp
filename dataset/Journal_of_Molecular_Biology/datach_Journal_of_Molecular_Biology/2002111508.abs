determination of a transition state at atomic resolution from protein engineering data
we present a method for determining the structure of the transition state ensemble tse of a protein by using  values derived from protein engineering experiments as restraints in molecular dynamics simulations employing a realistic all atom molecular mechanics energy function the method uses a biasing potential to select an ensemble of structures having  values in agreement with the experimental data set an application to acylphosphatase acp  a protein for which  values have been measured for  out of  residues illustrates the approach the properties of the tse determined in this way are compared with those of a coarse grained model obtained using a monte carlo mc sampling method based on a c  representation of the structure the two tses determined at different structural resolution are consistent and complementary while the c  model allows better sampling of the conformation space occupied by the transition state the all atom model offers a more detailed description of the structural and energetic properties of the conformations included in the tse the combination of low resolution c  results with all atom molecular dynamics simulations provides a powerful and general method for determining the nature of tses from protein engineering data
