crystal structure of alkaline phosphatase from the antarctic bacterium tab
alkaline phosphatases aps are non specific phosphohydrolases that are widely used in molecular biology and diagnostics we describe the structure of the cold active alkaline phosphatase from the antarctic bacterium tab  tap  the fold and the active site geometry are conserved with the other ap structures where the monomer has a large central  sheet enclosed by  helices the dimer interface of tap is relatively small and only a single loop from each monomer replaces the typical crown domain the structure also has typical cold adapted features lack of disulfide bridges low number of salt bridges and a loose dimer interface that completely lacks charged interactions the dimer interface is more hydrophobic than that of the escherichia coli ap and the interactions have tendency to pair with backbone atoms which we propose to result from the cold adaptation of tap the structure contains two additional magnesium ions outside of the active site which we believe to be involved in substrate binding as well as contributing to the local stability the m site stabilises an interaction that anchors the substrate coordinating r   the m metal binding site is in a region that stabilises metal coordination in the active site in other aps the m binding area is supported by extensive salt bridge stabilisation as well as positively charged patches around the active site we propose that these charges and the tap m binding influence the release of the product phosphate and thus might influence the rate determining step of the enzyme
