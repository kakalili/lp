formation of tertiary interactions during rrna gtpase center folding
the  nt gtpase center gac of  s rrna has a phylogenetically conserved secondary structure with two hairpin loops and a  way junction it folds into an intricate tertiary structure upon addition of mg  ions which is stabilized by the l  protein in cocrystal structures here we monitor the kinetics of its tertiary folding and mg  dependent intermediate states by observing selected nucleobases that contribute specific interactions to the gac tertiary structure in the cocrystals the fluorescent nucleobase  aminopurine replaced three individual adenines two of which make long range stacking interactions and one that also forms hydrogen bonds each site reveals a unique response to mg  addition and temperature reflecting its environmental change from secondary to tertiary structure stopped flow fluorescence experiments revealed that kinetics of tertiary structure formation upon addition of mgcl are also site specific with local conformational changes occurring from ms to s and with global folding from  to s site specific substitution with  n nucleobases allowed observation of stable hydrogen bond formation by nmr experiments equilibrium titration experiments indicate that a stable folding intermediate is present at stoichiometric concentrations of mg  and suggest that there are two initial sites of mg  ion association
