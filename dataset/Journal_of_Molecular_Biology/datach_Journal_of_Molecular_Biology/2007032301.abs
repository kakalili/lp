molecular and functional dissection of a putative rna binding region in yeast mitochondrialleucyl trna synthetase
aminoacylation and editing by leucyl trna synthetases leurs require migration of the trna acceptor stem end between the canonical aminoacylation core and a separate domain called cp that is responsible for amino acid editing the leurs cp domain can also support group i intron rna splicing in the yeast mitochondria although splicing sensitive sites have been identified on the main body the rdw peptide a highly conserved peptide within an rdw containing motif resides near one of the  strand linkers that connects the main body to the cp domain we hypothesized that the rdw peptide was important for interactions of one or more of the leurs  rna complexes an assortment of x ray crystallography structures suggests that the rdw peptide is dynamic and forms unique sets of interactions with the aminoacylation and editing complexes mutational analysis identified specific sites within the rdw peptide that failed to support protein synthesis activity in complementation experiments in vitro enzymatic investigations of mutations at trp   arg   and arg  in yeast mitochondrial leurs suggested that these sites within the rdw peptide are critical to the aminoacylation complex but impacted amino acid editing activity to a much less extent we propose that these highly conserved sites primarily influence productive trna interactions in the aminoacylation complex
