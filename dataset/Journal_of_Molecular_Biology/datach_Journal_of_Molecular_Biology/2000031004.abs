immunoglobulin superfamily proteins in caenorhabditis elegans edited by g von heijne
the predicted proteins of the genome of caenorhabditis elegans were analysed by various sequence comparison methods to identify the repertoire of proteins that are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily igsf  the igsf is one of the largest families of protein domain in this genome and likely to be one of the major families in other multicellular eukaryotes too this is because members of the superfamily are involved in a variety of functions including cell cell recognition cell surface receptors muscle structure and in higher organisms the immune system sixty four proteins with   i set igsf domains were identified largely by using hidden markov models the domain architectures of the protein products of these  genes are described twenty one of these had been characterised previously we show that another  are related to proteins of known function the c elegans igsf proteins can be classified into five broad categories muscle proteins protein kinases and phosphatases three categories of proteins involved in the development of the nervous system leucine rich repeat containing proteins and proteins without homologues of known function of which there are   the  proteins involved in nervous system development that are not kinases or phosphatases are homologues of neuroglian axonin ncam wrapper klingon iccr and nephrin or belong to the recently identified zig gene family out of the set of  genes   are on the x chromosome this study should be seen as an initial description of the igsf repertoire in c elegans because the current gene definitions may contain a number of errors especially in the case of long sequences and there may be igsf genes that have not yet been detected however the proteins described here do provide an overview of the bulk of the repertoire of immunoglobulin superfamily members in c elegans a framework for refinement and extension of the repertoire as gene and protein definitions improve and the basis for investigations of their function and for comparisons with the repertoires of other organisms
