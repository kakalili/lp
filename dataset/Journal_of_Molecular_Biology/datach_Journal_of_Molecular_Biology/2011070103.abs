structural insights into the novel diadenosine      p p tetraphosphate phosphorylase from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv
rv  c is a diadenosine      p p tetraphosphate ap a phosphorylase from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv sequence analysis suggests that rv  c belongs to the histidine triad hit motif superfamily which includes hit family diadenosine polyphosphate apna hydrolases and ap a phosphorylases however the amino acid sequence of rv  c is more similar to that of hit family apna hydrolases than to that of typical ap a phosphorylases here we report the crystal structure of rv  c which is the first structure of a protein with apna phosphorylase activity and characterized the structural basis of its catalytic activity our results showed that the structure of rv  c is similar to those of other hit superfamily proteins however asn   gly   and ser  in the active site of rv  c replace the corresponding gln gln and thr residues that are normally found in hit family apna hydrolases furthermore analyses of rv  c mutants revealed that asn   gly   and ser  are important active site residues and that asn  has a critical role in catalysis the position of gly  might influence the phosphorylase activity in addition the tetrameric structure of rv  c and the presence of trp  might be essential for the formation of the ap a binding site these structural insights into rv  c may facilitate the development of novel structure based inhibitors for treating tuberculosis
