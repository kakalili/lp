interaction of the p  dna binding domain with its n terminal extension modulates the stability of the p  tetramer
the tetrameric tumor suppressor p  plays a pivotal role in the control of the cell cycle and provides a paradigm for an emerging class of oligomeric multidomain proteins with structured and intrinsically disordered regions many of its biophysical and functional properties have been extrapolated from truncated variants yet the exact structural and functional role of certain segments of the protein is unclear we found from nmr and x ray crystallography that the dna binding domain dbd of human p  usually defined as residues      extends beyond these domain boundaries trp  in the hinge region between the disordered proline rich n terminal domain and the dbd folds back onto the latter and has a cation   interaction with arg   these additional interactions increase the melting temperature of the dbd by up to   c and inhibit aggregation of the p  tetramer they also modulate the dissociation of the p  tetramer the absence of the trp  arg  packing presumably allows nonnative dbd  dbd interactions that both nucleate aggregation and stabilize the interface these data have important implications for studies of multidomain proteins in general highlighting the fact that weak ordered  disordered domain interactions can modulate the properties of proteins of complex structure
