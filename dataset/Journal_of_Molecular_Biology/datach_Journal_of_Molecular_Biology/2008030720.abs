structural insights into ribosome recycling factor interactions with the  s ribosome
at the end of translation in bacteria ribosome recycling factor rrf is used together with elongation factor g to recycle the  s and  s ribosomal subunits for the next round of translation in x ray crystal structures of rrf with the escherichia coli  s ribosome rrf binds to the large ribosomal subunit in the cleft that contains the peptidyl transferase center upon binding of either e coli or thermus thermophilus rrf to the e coli ribosome the tip of ribosomal rna helix  in the large subunit moves away from the small subunit toward rrf by    thereby disrupting a key contact between the small and large ribosomal subunits termed bridge b a in the ribosome crystals the ability of rrf to destabilize bridge b a is influenced by crystal packing forces movement of helix  involves an ordered to disordered transition upon binding of rrf to the ribosome the disruption of bridge b a upon rrf binding to the ribosome seen in the present structures reveals one of the key roles that rrf plays in ribosome recycling the dissociation of  s ribosomes into subunits the structures also reveal contacts between domain ii of rrf and protein s  in the  s subunit that may also play a role in ribosome recycling
