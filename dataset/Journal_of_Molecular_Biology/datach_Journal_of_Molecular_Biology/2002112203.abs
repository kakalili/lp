fast and slow intermediate accumulation and the initial barrier mechanism in protein folding
do stable intermediates form very early in the protein folding process new results and a quantity of literature that bear on this issue are examined here results available provide little support for early intermediate accumulation before an initial search dependent nucleation barrier
