coordinated assembly of ku and p  subunits of the dna dependent protein kinase on dna ends is necessary for xrcc  ligase iv recruitment
repair of dna double strand breaks by the non homologous end joining pathway nhej requires a minimal set of proteins including dna dependent protein kinase dna pk  dna  ligase iv and xrcc proteins dna pk comprises ku  ku  heterodimer and the kinase subunit dna pkcs p   here by monitoring protein assembly from human nuclear cell extracts on dna ends in vitro we report that recruitment to dna ends of the xrcc  ligase iv complex responsible for the key ligation step is strictly dependent on the assembly of both the ku and p  components of dna pk to these ends based on co immunoprecipitation experiments we conclude that interactions of ku and p  with components of the xrcc  ligase iv complex are mainly dna dependent in addition under p  kinase permissive conditions xrcc is detected at dna ends in a phosphorylated form this phosphorylation is dna pk dependent however phosphorylation is dispensable for xrcc  ligase iv loading to dna ends since stable dna pk xrcc  ligase iv dna complexes are recovered in the presence of the kinase inhibitor wortmannin these findings extend the current knowledge of the assembly of nhej repair proteins on dna termini and substantiate the hypothesis of a scaffolding role of dna pk towards other components of the nhej dna repair process
