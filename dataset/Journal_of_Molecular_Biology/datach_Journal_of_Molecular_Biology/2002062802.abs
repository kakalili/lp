reversible dimer formation and stability of the anti tumour single chain fv antibody mfe  by neutron scattering analytical ultracentrifugation and nmr and ft ir spectroscopy
mfe  is a single chain fv scfv antibody molecule used to target colorectal cancer through its high affinity for the tumour marker carcinoembryonic antigen cea  scfv molecules are formed from peptide linked antibody vh and vl domains and many of these form dimers our recent crystal structure for mfe  showed that this formed an unusual symmetric back to back association of two monomers that is consistent with a domain swapped diabody structure neutron scattering and modelling fits showed that mfe  existed as compact vh  vl linked monomers at therapeutically relevant concentrations below mg ml size exclusion gel chromatography showed that the monomeric and dimeric forms of mfe  could be separated and that the proportions of these two forms depended on the starting mfe  concentration sedimentation equilibrium experiments by analytical ultracentrifugation at nine concentrations of mfe  indicated a reversible monomer  dimer self association equilibrium with an association constant of          m   sedimentation velocity experiments using the time derivative g s   method showed that mfe  his has a concentration dependent weight average sedimentation coefficient that increased from  s for the monomer to about   s for the dimer both values agreed with those calculated from the mfe  crystal structure in relation to the thermal stability of mfe   denaturation experiments by h nmr and ft ir spectroscopy showed that the molecule is stable up to   c after which denaturation was irreversible mfe  dimerisation is discussed in terms of a new model for diabody structures in which the vh and vl domains in the monomer are able to dissociate and reassociate to form a dimer or diabody but in which symmetric back to back contacts between the two monomers are formed this dimerisation in solution is attributed to the complementary nature of the c terminal surface of the mfe  monomer crystal structures for seven other scfv molecules have shown that while the contact residues for symmetric back to back dimer formation in mfe  are not fully conserved in principle back to back contacts can be formed in these too this offers possibilities for the creation of other forms of scfv molecules
