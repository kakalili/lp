compaction of a prokaryotic signal anchor transmembrane domain begins within the ribosome tunnel and is stabilized by srp during targeting
cotranslational targeting of membrane proteins is mediated by the universally conserved signal recognition particle srp  in eukaryotes srp attenuates translation during targeting however in prokaryotes a simplified srp is believed to carry out targeting during continuing translation here we show a detailed stepwise analysis of the targeting of subunit c of the f component of the bacterial atp synthase f c to the inner membrane we show that the first transmembrane tm signal anchor domain of f c forms a compacted structure within the distal portion of the ribosome tunnel this structure is formed just prior to the interaction with srp in the absence of srp this structure is lost as the tm domain exits the tunnel however in the presence of srp it is stabilized our results suggest differences in early protein folding of substrates for prokaryotic srp  dependent membrane protein targeting pathways from that of eukaryotic srp targeting these results imply that early tm domain recognition by targeting factors acts to ensure that the efficiency of membrane targeting is maintained
