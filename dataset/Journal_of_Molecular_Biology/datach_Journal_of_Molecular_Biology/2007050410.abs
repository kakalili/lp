crystal structures of the substrate free enzyme and reaction intermediate of the had superfamily member haloacid dehalogenase dehiva from burkholderia cepacia mba
dehiva is a haloacid dehalogenase ec     from the soil and water borne bacterium burkholderia cepacia mba  which belongs to the functionally variable haloacid dehalogenase had superfamily of enzymes the haloacid dehalogenases catalyse the removal of halides from haloacids resulting in a hydroxlated product these enzymes are of interest for their potential to degrade recalcitrant halogenated environmental pollutants and their use in the synthesis of industrial chemicals the haloacid dehalogenases utilise a nucleophilic attack on the substrate by an aspartic acid residue to form an enzyme  substrate ester bond and concomitantly cleaving of the carbon  halide bond and release of a hydroxylated product following ester hydrolysis we present the crystal structures of both the substrate free dehiva refined to     resolution and dehiva covalently bound to l  monochloropropanoate trapped as a reaction intermediate refined to     resolution electron density consistent with a previously unidentified yet anticipated water molecule in the active site poised to donate its hydroxyl group to the product and its proton to the catalytic asp  is evident it has been unclear how substrate enters the active site of this and related enzymes the results of normal mode analysis nma are presented and suggest a means whereby the predicted global dynamics of the enzyme allow for entry of the substrate into the active site in the context of these results the possible role of arg  and asn  in a  lock down  mechanism affecting active site access is discussed in silico substrate docking of enantiomeric substrates has been examined in order to evaluate the enzymes enantioselectivity
