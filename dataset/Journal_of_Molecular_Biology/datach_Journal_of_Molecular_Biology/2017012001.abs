the c box region of maf regulates transcriptional activity and protein stability
maf is a conserved negative regulator of rna polymerase pol iii and intracellular lipid homeostasis across species here we show that the maf c box region negatively regulates its activity mutations in caenorhabditis elegans mafr  that truncate the c box retain the ability to inhibit the transcription of rna pol iii targets reduce lipid biogenesis and lower reproductive output in human cells c box deletion of maf leads to increased maf nuclear localization and enhanced repression of acc and fasn but with impaired repression of rna pol iii targets surprisingly c box mutations render maf insensitive to rapamycin further defining a regulatory role for this region two maf species maf l and maf s are regulated by the c box ysy motif which when mutated alters species stoichiometry and proteasome dependent turnover of nuclear maf  our results reveal a role for the c box region as a critical determinant of maf stability activity and response to cellular stress
