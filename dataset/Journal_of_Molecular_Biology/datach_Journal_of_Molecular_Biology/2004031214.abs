phage peptide display identifies the interferon responsive death activated protein kinase family as a novel modifier of mdm and p waf
phage peptide display is a versatile tool for identifying novel protein  protein interfaces our previous work highlighted the selection of phage peptides that bind to specific isoforms of mdm protein and in this work we subjected the putative mdm binding proteins to phage peptide display to expand further on putative protein interaction maps one peptide that bound mdm had significant homology to members of the death activated protein kinase dapk family an enzyme family of no known direct link to the p  pathway we examined whether a nuclear member of the dapk family named dapk or zip kinase had direct links to the p  pathway zip kinase was cloned purified and the enzyme was able to phosphorylate mdm at ser   a site previously reported to be modified by akt kinase thus demonstrating that zip kinase is a bona fide mdm binding protein native zip kinase fractions were then subjected to phage peptide display and one zip kinase consensus peptide motif was identified in p waf  zip kinase phosphorylates p waf at thr  and alanine substituted mutations in the p waf phosphorylation site alter its ability to be phosphorylated by zip kinase thus although zip kinase consensus sites were then defined as containing a minimal rkkx t s consensus motif alternate contacts in zip kinase binding are implicated since amino acid residues surrounding the phospho acceptor site can effect the specific activity of the kinase transfected zipk can promote the phosphorylation of p waf at thr  in vivo and can increase the half life of p waf  while the half life of p waf t  a is not effected by zip kinase thus phage peptide display identified an interferon responsive protein kinase family as a novel modifier of two components of the p  pathway mdm and p waf  and underscores the utility of phage peptide display for gaining novel insights into biochemical pathways
