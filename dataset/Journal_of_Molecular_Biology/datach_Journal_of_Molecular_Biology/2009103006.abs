receiver domains control the active state stoichiometry of aquifex aeolicus   activator ntrc  as revealed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
a common challenge with studies of proteins in vitro is determining which constructs and conditions are most physiologically relevant    activators are proteins that undergo regulated assembly to form an active atpase ring that enables transcription by   polymerase previous studies of aaa atpase domains from   activators have shown that some are heptamers while others are hexamers because active oligomers assemble from off state dimers it was thought that even numbered oligomers should dominate and that heptamer formation would occur when individual domains of the activators rather than the intact proteins were studied here we present results from electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments characterizing the assembly states of intact ntrc  a   activator from aquifex aeolicus an extreme thermophile  as well as its atpase domain alone and regulatory atpase and atpase dna binding domain combinations we show that the full length and activated regulatory atpase proteins form hexamers whereas the isolated atpase domain unactivated regulatory atpase and atpase dna binding domain form heptamers activation of the n terminal regulatory domain is the key factor stabilizing the hexamer form of the atpase relative to the heptamer
