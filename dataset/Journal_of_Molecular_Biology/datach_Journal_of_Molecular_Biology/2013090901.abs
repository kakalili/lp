characterization of      interactions with integrin tails
integrins are a family of heterodimeric     adhesion receptors that play key roles in many cellular processes integrins are unusual in that their functions can be modulated from both outside and inside the cell inside out signaling is mediated by binding adaptor proteins to the flexible cytoplasmic tails of the   and  integrin subunits talin is one well known intracellular activator but various other adaptors bind to integrin tails including        a member of the    family of dimeric proteins that have a preference for binding phosphorylated sequence motifs phosphorylation of a threonine in the   integrin tail has been shown to modulate        interactions and recently the   integrin tail was reported to bind to      and associate with paxillin in a ternary complex that is regulated by serine phosphorylation here we use a range of biophysical techniques to characterize interactions between      and the cytoplasmic tails of        and   integrins the x ray structure of the        complex indicates a canonical binding mode for the   phospho peptide but unexpected features are also observed residues outside the consensus      binding motif are shown to be essential for an efficient interaction in contrast a short   phospho peptide is sufficient for high affinity binding to      in addition we report novel      integrin tail interactions that are independent of phosphorylation of the integrin tails studied the strongest interaction with      is observed for the  a variant in summary new insights about      integrin tail interactions that have implications for the role of these molecular associations in cells are described
