indirect dna readout on the protein side coupling between histidine protonation global structural cooperativity dynamics and dna binding of the human papillomavirus type  e c domain
dna sequence recognition by the homodimeric c terminal domain of the human papillomavirus type  e protein e c is known to involve both direct readout and dna dependent indirect readout mechanisms while protein dependent indirect readout has been deduced but not directly observed we have investigated coupling between specific dna binding and the dynamics of the unusual e c fold using ph as an external variable nuclear magnetic resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry show that ph titration of his  in the complex interface and his  in the core of the domain is coupled to both binding and the dynamics of the  barrel core of e c with a tradeoff between dimer stability and function specific dna binding is in turn coupled to the slow dynamics and amide hydrogen exchange in the entire  barrel reaching residues far apart from the dna recognition elements but not affecting the two helices of each monomer the changes are largest in the dimerization interface suggesting that the e c  barrel acts as a hinge that regulates the relative position of the dna recognition helices in conclusion the cooperative dynamics of the human papillomavirus type  e c  barrel is coupled to sequence recognition in a protein dependent indirect readout mechanism the patterns of residue substitution in genital papillomaviruses support the importance of the protonation states of his  and his  and suggest that protein dependent indirect readout and histidine ph titration may regulate dna binding in the cell
