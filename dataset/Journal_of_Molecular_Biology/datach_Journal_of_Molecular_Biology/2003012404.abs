post transcriptional regulation of the streptomyces coelicolor stress responsive sigma factor sigh involves translational control proteolytic processing and an anti sigma factor homolog
the sigh gene encodes a sigma factor whose transcription is controlled by stress regulatory systems and the developmental program in streptomyces coelicolor here we describe developmentally regulated post transcriptional control systems for sigh sigh is expressed as three primary translation products sigh    sigh    and sigh    in vitro sigh   was comparable to sigh   in its ability to associate with rna polymerase core enzyme and specifically initiate transcription in vitro while sigh     were the primary gene products observed throughout early phases of growth their abundance decreased during later stages in liquid or solid phase cultures while levels of shorter c terminally encoded products increased these included sigh    a product of the downstream translational initiation site as well as two proteolytic derivatives of sigh      kda and  kda  accumulation of sigh   and processing of sigh     into these stable  kda and  kda derivatives correlated with morphological changes on solid medium and physiological maturation in liquid medium sigh     processing did not occur on medium non permissive for aerial mycelium formation or in one particular developmental mutant brga  the proteolytic activity could be detected in vitro using crude extracts of stationary phase cultures but was absent from exponential phase cultures prsh the gene upstream of sigh having sequence similarity to known anti sigma factors was able to bind to and thus presumably inactivate sigh    sigh    and sigh    we have shown elsewhere that prsh was conditionally required for colonial development thus while at least one transcriptional regulator is known to bring about the accumulation of sigh mrna at different times and different locations in colonies the post transcriptional processes described here regulate the activity of different sigh isoforms and program their temporal accumulation pattern i e the elimination of sigh     and accumulation of sigh   like proteins as a function of development
