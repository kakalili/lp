t rna polymerase elongation complex structure and movement edited by r ebright
we have characterized t rnap elongation complexes ecs halted at different positions on a single template using a combination of digestion with exonuclease iii   exonuclease rnase t  and treatment with kmno  our results indicate that the transcription bubble is approximately nine bases long and that the rna dna hybrid is   bp in size an additional four to six bases of rna immediately   to the hybrid interact with the rnap probably with a site on the n terminal domain when ecs with transcripts of different length were probed in the presence or absence of the incoming ntp we found that the position of the ec on the template and the rna shifted downstream upon ntp binding ntp binding also restricted the lateral mobility of the complex on the template our results indicate that in the absence of bound ntp the rnap is relatively free to slide on the template around a position that usually lies one to two bases upstream of the position from which ntp binding and bond formation occur ntp binding stabilizes the rnap in the post translocated position and keeps it from sliding upstream either due directly to rnap ntp template interactions or to an isomerization which causes the fingers subdomain of the rnap to clamp down on the downstream end of the template strand
