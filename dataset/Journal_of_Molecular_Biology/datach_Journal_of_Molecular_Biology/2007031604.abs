projection map of aquaporin  at    resolution
aquaporin  an aquaglyceroporin present in diverse tissues is unique among aquaporins because it is not only permeable to water urea and glycerol but also allows passage of larger uncharged solutes single particle analysis of negatively stained recombinant rat aquaporin  revealed a particle size characteristic of the tetrameric organization of all members of the aquaporin family reconstitution of aquaporin  into two dimensional crystals enabled us to calculate a projection map at    resolution the projection structure indicates a tetrameric structure similar to glpf with each square like monomer forming a pore a comparison of the pore lining residues between the crystal structure of glpf and a homology model of aquaporin  locates substitutions in these residues predominantly to the hydrophobic edge of the tripathic pore of glpf providing first insights into the structural basis for the broader substrate specificity of aquaporin
