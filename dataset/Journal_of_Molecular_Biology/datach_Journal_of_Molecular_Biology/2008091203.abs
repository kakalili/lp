nm chromatin fibre decompaction requires both h k  acetylation and linker histone eviction
the mechanism by which chromatin is decondensed to permit access to dna is largely unknown here using a model nucleosome array reconstituted from recombinant histone octamers we have defined the relative contribution of the individual histone octamer n terminal tails as well as the effect of a targeted histone tail acetylation on the compaction state of the   nm chromatin fiber this study goes beyond previous studies as it is based on a nucleosome array that is very long   nucleosomes and contains a stoichiometric concentration of bound linker histone which is essential for the formation of the   nm chromatin fiber we find that compaction is regulated in two steps introduction of h acetylated to   on k  inhibits compaction to a greater degree than deletion of the h n terminal tail further decompaction is achieved by removal of the linker histone
