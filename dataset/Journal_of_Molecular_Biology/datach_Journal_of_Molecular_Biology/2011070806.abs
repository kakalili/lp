a new apo caspase  crystal form reveals the active conformation of the apoenzyme
caspase  has been identified as a key component in the pathway of neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer s disease and huntington s disease it has been the focus of drug development for some time but only recently have structural data become available the first study identified a novel noncanonical conformation of apo caspase  contrasting with the typical caspase conformation then the structures of both caspase  zymogen and the ac veid cho peptide inhibitor complex described caspase  in the canonical conformation raising the question of why the intermediate between these two structures mature apo caspase  would adopt the noncanonical conformation in this study we present a new crystal form of the apoenzyme in the canonical conformation by identifying the previous apostructure as a ph inactivated form of caspase  our new apostructure is further compared to the ac veid cho caspase  inhibitor complex the structural comparison allows us to visualize the organization of loops l  l  and l upon ligand binding and how the catalytic groove forms to accommodate the inhibitor
