drop a water analysis program identifies ras gtp specific pathway of communication between membrane interacting regions and the active site
ras gtpase mediates several cellular signal transduction pathways and is found mutated in a large number of cancers it is active in the gtp bound state where it interacts with effector proteins and at rest in the gdp bound state the catalytic domain is tethered to the membrane with which it interacts in a nucleotide dependent manner here we present the program detection of related solvent positions drop for crystallographic water analysis on protein surfaces and use it to study ras drop reads and superimposes multiple protein data bank coordinates transfers symmetry related water molecules to the position closest to the protein surface and ranks the waters according to how well conserved and tightly clustered they are in the set of structures coloring according to this rank allows visualization of the results the effector binding region of ras is hydrated with highly conserved water molecules at the interface between the p loop switch i and switch ii as well as at the raf rbd binding pocket furthermore we discovered a new conserved water mediated h bonding network present in ras gtp but not in ras gdp that links the nucleotide sensor residues r  and r  on helix  to the active site the double mutant rasn a n a where the final link between helix  and the nucleotide is not possible is a severely impaired enzyme while the single mutant rasn a with partial connection to the active site has a wild type hydrolysis rate drop was instrumental in determining the water mediated connectivity networks that link two lobes of the catalytic domain in ras
