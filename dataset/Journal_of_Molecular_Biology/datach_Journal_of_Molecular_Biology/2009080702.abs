yeast phosducin like protein  acts as a stimulatory co factor for the folding of actin by the chaperonin cct via a ternary complex
the eukaryotic chaperonin containing tcp  cct folds the cytoskeletal protein actin the folding mechanism of this  subunit  mda machine is poorly characterised due to the absence of quantitative in vitro assays we identified phosducin like protein  plp p  plp  as an atp elutable binding partner of yeast cct while establishing the cct interactome in a novel in vitro cct  act folding assay that is functional under physiological conditions plp is a stimulatory co factor in a single atp driven cycle plp  cct  act complexes yield  fold more native actin than cct  act complexes plp interacts directly with act through the c terminus of its thioredoxin fold and the cct binding subdomain  of actin the in vitro cct  act  plp folding cycle of the preassembled complex takes   s at    c several times slower than the canonical chaperonin groel the specific interactions between plp  cct and act in the yeast component in vitro system and the pronounced stimulatory effect of plp on actin folding are consistent with in vivo genetic approaches demonstrating an essential and positive role for plp in cellular processes involving actin in saccharomyces cerevisiae in mammalian systems however several members of the plp family including human pdcl  the orthologue of plp  have been shown to be inhibitory toward cct mediated folding of actin in vivo and in vitro here using a rabbit reticulocyte derived in vitro translation system we found that inhibition of  actin folding by pdcl can be relieved by exchanging its acidic c terminal extension for that of plp  it seems that additional levels of regulatory control of cct activity by this plp have emerged in higher eukaryotes
