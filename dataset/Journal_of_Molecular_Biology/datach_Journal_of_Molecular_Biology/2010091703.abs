structural conservation of components in the amino acid sensing branch of the tor pathway in yeast and mammals
the highly conserved rag family gtpases have a role in reporting amino acid availability to the tor target of rapamycin signaling complex which regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to environmental cues the yeast rag proteins gtr p and gtr p were shown in multiple independent studies to interact with the membrane associated proteins gse p ego p and gse p ego p  however mammalian orthologs of gse p and gse p could not be identified we determined the crystal structure of gse p and found it to match the fold of two mammalian proteins mp  mitogen activated protein kinase scaffold protein  and p  which form a heterodimeric complex that had been assigned a scaffolding function in mitogen activated protein kinase pathways the significance of this structural similarity is validated by the recent identification of a physical and functional association between mammalian rag proteins and mp p  together these findings reveal that key components of the tor signaling pathway are structurally conserved between yeast and mammals despite divergence of sequence to a degree that thwarts detection through simple homology searches
