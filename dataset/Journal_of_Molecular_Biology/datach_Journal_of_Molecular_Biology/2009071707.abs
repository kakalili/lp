the promoter of the immunoglobulin j chain gene receives its authentic enhancer activity through the abutting mef and pu  sites in a dna looping interaction
immunoglobulin j chain igj promoter had previously been dissected in the context of a heterologous enhancer and or promoter because its strength was weak and its authentic enhancer was not available at that time thus it has been questioned whether the previous dissection of the igj promoter might also be relevant in the context of its authentic enhancer now that the authentic igj enhancer has been identified redelineation of the igj promoter could be performed in the context of this authentic enhancer in this redelineation the previously identified mef and pu  sites were shown to be critical for communicating with its authentic enhancer and thereby for receiving enhancer activity in accordance with this finding a dna looping interaction between the igj promoter and its enhancer was demonstrated using chromosome conformation capture assays not only in igj expressing s  plasma cells but also during interleukin  induced bcl b cell terminal differentiation furthermore mef was shown to be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated with e  which had been identified to bind to the igj enhancer suggesting that the dna looping interaction between the igj promoter and its enhancer might be mediated by these proteins however the previously identified usf and bsap sites were shown to be not important for igj promoter activity in the context of its authentic enhancer these findings were further supported by in vivo footprinting and or chromatin immunoprecipitation assays which showed the binding of mef and pu   but not the binding of usf and bsap  to the igj promoter
