structural and functional characterization of a novel family gh   o methyl  glucuronidase with specificity for decorated arabinogalactans
glycoside hydrolases are clustered into families based on amino acid sequence similarities and belonging to a particular family can infer biological activity of an enzyme family gh  contains  glucuronidases where several members have been shown to hydrolyze terminal    linked glucuronic acid and  o methylated glucuronic acid from the plant cell wall polysaccharide glucuronoxylan other gh  enzymes show no activity on glucuronoxylan and therefore it has been proposed that family gh  may be a poly specific family in this study we reveal that a putative periplasmic gh  from the human gut symbiont bacteroides thetaiotaomicron btgh  a hydrolyzes terminal  o methyl glucuronic acid residues from decorated arabinogalactan isolated from acacia tree the three dimensional structure of btgh  a reveals that btgh  a has the same domain architecture as the other structurally characterized member of this family boagu  a however the position of the c terminal module is altered with respect to each individual enzyme phylogenetic analysis of gh  amino sequences divides the family into distinct clades that may distinguish different substrate specificities finally we show that btgh  a  glucuronidase activity is necessary for the sequential digestion of branched galactans from acacia gum by a galactan    galactosidase from family gh  however while b thetaiotaomicron grows on larch wood arabinogalactan the bacterium is not able to metabolize acacia gum arabinogalactan suggesting that btgh  a is involved in degradation of arabinogalactan fragments liberated by other microbial species in the gastrointestinal tract
