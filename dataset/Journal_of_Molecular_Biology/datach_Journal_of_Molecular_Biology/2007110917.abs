structural characterization of a new binding motif and a novel binding mode in group  ww domains
formin homology  fh  is a long proline rich region of formins shown to bind to five ww containing proteins named formin binding proteins fbps  fh has several potential binding regions but only the pplpx motif and its interaction with fbp ww has been characterized structurally to detect whether additional motifs exist in fh  we synthesized five peptides and investigated their interaction with fbp ww  fbp ww and fbp ww domains peptides of sequence ptppplpp positive control  ppplipppp and pplipppp new motifs interact with the domains with micromolar affinity we observed that fbp ww and fbp ww behave differently from fbp ww in terms of motif selection and affinity since they prefer a doubly interrupted proline stretch of sequence pplipp we determined the nmr structure of three complexes involving the fbp ww domain and the three ligands depending on the peptide under study the domain interacts with two proline residues accommodated in either the xp or the xp groove this difference represents a one turn displacement of the domain along the ligand sequence to understand what drives this behavior we performed further structural studies with the fbp ww and a mutant of fbp ww mimicking the xp groove of fbp ww  our observations suggest that the nature of the xp groove and the balance of flexibility rigidity around loop  of the domain contribute to the selection of the final ligand positioning in fully independent domains additionally we analyzed the binding of a double ww domain region fbp ww   to a long stretch of fh using fluorescence spectroscopy and nmr titrations with this we show that the presence of two consecutive ww domains may also influence the selection of the binding mode particularly if both domains can interact with consecutive motifs in the ligand our results represent the first observation of protein  ligand recognition where a pair of ww and two consecutive motifs in a ligand participate simultaneously
