mutating the converter  relay interface of drosophila myosin perturbs atpase activity actin motility myofibril stability and flight ability
we used an integrative approach to probe the significance of the interaction between the relay loop and converter domain of the myosin molecular motor from drosophila melanogaster indirect flight muscle during the myosin mechanochemical cycle atp induced twisting of the relay loop is hypothesized to reposition the converter resulting in cocking of the contiguous lever arm into the pre power stroke configuration the subsequent movement of the lever arm through its power stroke generates muscle contraction by causing myosin heads to pull on actin filaments we generated a transgenic line expressing myosin with a mutation in the converter domain r  e at a site of relay loop interaction molecular modeling suggests that the interface between the relay loop and converter domain of r  e myosin would be significantly disrupted during the mechanochemical cycle the mutation depressed calcium as well as basal and actin activated mgatpase vmax by    compared to wild type myosin but there is no change in apparent actin affinity km  while atp or amp pnp adenylyl imidodiphosphate binding to wild type myosin subfragment  enhanced tryptophan fluorescence by    or    respectively enhancement does not occur in the mutant this suggests that the mutation reduces lever arm movement the mutation decreases in vitro motility of actin filaments by     mutant pupal indirect flight muscles display normal myofibril assembly myofibril shape and double hexagonal arrangement of thick and thin filaments two day old fibers have occasional  cracking  of the crystal like array of myofilaments fibers from  week old adults show more severe cracking and frayed myofibrils with some disruption of the myofilament lattice flight ability is reduced in  day old flies compared to wild type controls with no upward mobility but some horizontal flight in  week old adults flight capability is lost thus altered myosin function permits myofibril assembly but results in a progressive disruption of the myofilament lattice and flight ability we conclude that r  in the myosin converter domain is essential for normal atpase activity in vitro motility and locomotion our results provide the first mutational evidence that intramolecular signaling between the relay loop and converter domain is critical for myosin function both in vitro and in muscle
