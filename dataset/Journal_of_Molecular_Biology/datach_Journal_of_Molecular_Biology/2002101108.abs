conformational changes in phosphoglucose isomerase induced by ligand binding
phosphoglucose isomerase pgi ec     is the second enzyme in glycolysis where it catalyzes the isomerization of d glucose  phosphate to d fructose  phosphate it is the same protein as autocrine motility factor differentiation and maturation mediator and neuroleukin here we report a new x ray crystal structure of rabbit pgi rpgi without ligands bound in its active site the structure was solved at    resolution by isomorphous phasing with a previously solved x ray crystal structure of the rpgi dimer containing  phosphogluconate in its active site comparison of the new structure to previously reported structures enables identification of conformational changes that occur during binding of substrate or inhibitor molecules ligand binding causes an induced fit of regions containing amino acid residues           and      this conformational change differs from the change previously reported to occur between the ring opening and isomerization steps in which the helix containing residues      moves toward the bound substrate differences between the liganded and unliganded structures are limited to the region within and close to the active site pocket
