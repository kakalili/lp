relationship between structure dynamics and function of hydrated purple membrane investigated by neutron scattering and dielectric spectroscopy
we investigated the influence of hydration water on the relationship between structure dynamics and function in a biological membrane system for the example of the purple membrane pm with its protein bacteriorhodopsin br  a light driven proton pump complementary information from neutron diffraction quasi elastic neutron scattering qens and dielectric spectroscopy will form a comprehensive picture of the structural and dynamic behavior of the pm in the temperature range between   and   k temperature and humidity dependent changes in the membrane system influence the accessibility of the different photocycle intermediates of br the melting of the  freezing bound water  between   and   k could be related to the transition from the m to the m intermediate which represents the key step in the photocycle the dynamic transition in the vicinity of   k was shown to be necessary to ensure that the m intermediate can be populated and that the melting of crystallized bulk water above   k enables the completion of the photocycle
