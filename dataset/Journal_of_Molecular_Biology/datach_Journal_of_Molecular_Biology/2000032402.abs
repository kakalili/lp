the major surface antigens of entamoeba histolytica trophozoites are gpi anchored proteophosphoglycans edited by i b holland
trophozoites of the parasitic protozoa entamoeba histolytica synthesize a cell surface lipoglycoconjugate termed lipophosphoglycan which is thought to be an important virulence factor and potential vaccine candidate against invasive amebiasis here we show that the e histolytica lipophosphoglycans are in fact glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi anchored proteophosphoglycans ppgs  these ppgs contain a highly acidic polypeptide component which is rich in asp glu and phosphoserine residues this polypeptide component is extensively modified with linear glycan chains having the general structure  glc    nglc   gal where n     these glycan chains can be released after mild acid hydrolysis with trifluoroacetic or hydrofluoric acid and are probably attached to phosphoserine residues in the polypeptide backbone the ppgs are further modified with a gpi anchor which differs from all other eukaryotic gpi anchors so far characterized in containing a glycan core with the structure gal man glcn myo inositol and in being heterogeneously modified with chains of  galactose trophozoites of the pathogenic hm  imss strain synthesize two distinct classes of ppg which have polydisperse molecular masses of     kda ppg  and     kda ppg  and are modified with glucan side chains of different average lengths in contrast the non pathogenic rahman strain synthesizes one class of ppg which is only elaborated with short disaccharide side chains i e glc   gal  however the ppgs are abundant in all strains     copies per cell and are likely to form a protective surface coat
