structural determinants of unique properties of human igg fc
human igg  normally the least abundant of the four subclasses of igg in serum displays a number of unique biological properties it can undergo heavy chain exchange also known as fab arm exchange leading to the formation of monovalent but bispecific antibodies and it interacts poorly with fc rii and fc riii and complement these properties render igg relatively  non inflammatory  and have made it a suitable format for therapeutic monoclonal antibody production however igg is also known to undergo fc mediated aggregation and has been implicated in auto immune disease pathology we report here the high resolution crystal structures at   and     respectively of human recombinant and serum derived igg fc these structures reveal conformational variability at the ch  ch interface that may promote fab arm exchange and a unique conformation for the fg loop in the ch domain that would explain the poor fc rii fc riii and c q binding properties of igg compared with igg and   in contrast to other igg subclasses this unique conformation folds the fg loop away from the ch domain precluding any interaction with the lower hinge region which may further facilitate fab arm exchange by destabilisation of the hinge the crystals of igg fc also display fc  fc packing contacts with very extensive interaction surfaces involving both a consensus binding site in igg fc at the ch  ch interface and known hydrophobic aggregation motifs these fc  fc interactions are compatible with intact igg molecules and may provide a model for the formation of aggregates of igg that can cause disease pathology in the absence of antigen
