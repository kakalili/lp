the solution structure of the conserved   hairpin from escherichia coli  s rrna was determined by nmr spectroscopy the   loop is located at the surface of the  s subunit in the platform region and has been implicated in interactions with p site bound trna e site mrna s  binding if binding and in rna rna interactions with the   loop of  s rrna and domain iv of  s rrna the structure reveals a novel sheared type g   u  base pair with a single hydrogen bond from the g  amino to u    g  and a  also form a sheared pair and u  forms a u turn with an h bond to the a  non bridging phosphate oxygen the sheared pairs and u turn result in the continuous single stranded stacking of five residues from   to u  with their watson crick functional groups exposed in the minor groove the overall fold of the   hairpin is similar to the anticodon loop of trna the structure provides an explanation for chemical protection patterns in the loop upon interaction with trna the  s subunit and s  in vivo genetic studies demonstrate the functional importance of the motifs observed in the solution structure of the   hairpin
