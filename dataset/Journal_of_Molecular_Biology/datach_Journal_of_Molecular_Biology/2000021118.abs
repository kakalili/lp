backbone dynamics and refined solution structure of the n terminal domain of dna polymerase   correlation with dna binding and drp lyase activity edited by p e wright
mammalian dna polymerase  functions in the base excision dna repair pathway filling in short patches    nt in damaged dna and removing deoxyribose   phosphate from the   side of damaged dna the backbone dynamics and the refined solution structure of the n terminal domain of  pol have been characterized in order to establish the potential contribution s of backbone motion to the dna binding and deoxyribose   phosphate lyase function of this domain the n terminal domain is formed from four helices packed as two antiparallel pairs with a   crossing between the pairs the rmsd of the nmr conformers residues     is     for the backbone heavy atoms and     for all heavy atoms nmr characterization of the binding site s for a ssdna mer ssdna mer ssdna mer and dsdna  mer shows a consensus surface for the binding of these various dna oligomers that surrounds and includes the deoxyribose   phosphate lyase active site region connection segments between helices  and  and between helices  and  each contribute to dna binding helix  turn helix  forms a helix hairpin helix motif the highly conserved hairpin sequence lpgvg displays a significant degree of picosecond time scale motion within the backbone that is possibly important for dna binding at the phosphodiester backbone an  loop connecting helices  and  and helix  itself display significant exchange contributions rex at the backbone amides due to apparent conformational type motion on a millisecond time scale this motion is likely important in allowing the  loop and helix  to shift toward and productively interact with gapped dna the deoxyribose   phosphate lyase catalytic residues that include k  which forms the schiff  s base y  which is postulated to promote proton transfer to the aldehyde and k  which assists in phosphate elimination show highly restricted backbone motion h  which apparently participates in detection of the abasic site hole and assists in the opening of the hemiacetal shows conformational exchange
