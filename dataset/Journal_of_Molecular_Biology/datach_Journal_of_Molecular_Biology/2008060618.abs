allosteric and electrostatic protein  protein interactions regulate the assembly of the heterohexameric tim  tim  complex
protein  protein interactions are crucial processes in virtually all cellular events the heterohexameric tim  tim  complex of the mitochondrial intermembrane space plays an important role during import of mitochondrial membrane proteins it consists of three molecules of each subunit arranged alternately in a ring shaped structure while the individual protein tim forms a homodimer tim  is a monomer further to our previous investigation on the complex formation pathway in this study the assembly mechanism of tim  tim  was investigated using a stopped flow technique coupled with mutagenesis we show that while the initial velocity of the assembly depends on tim concentration linearly it presents a sigmoid curve on tim  in addition the overall rate of assembly depends on the ph level in a bell shaped profile and two pka values that are in good agreement with the respective isoelectric points of tim and tim  were determined using a tim f w mutant we were able to show that there was clear salt concentration dependence in the rate of assembly at the early stages taken together the results of ph and salt concentration dependence indicate that electrostatic interactions are important and provide an initial driving force for the complex formation thus this study not only demonstrates that allosteric and electrostatic interactions are two key regulators for the assembly of the tim  tim  complex but also has important implications for our understanding of how proteins interact with their partners
