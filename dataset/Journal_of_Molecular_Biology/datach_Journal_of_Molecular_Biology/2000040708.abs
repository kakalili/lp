the solution structure of the cytokine binding domain of the common  chain of the receptors for granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor interleukin  and interleukin  edited by p e wright
the haemopoietic cytokines granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor interleukin  and interleukin  bind to cell surface receptors comprising ligand specific  chains and a shared  chain the  chain is the critical signalling subunit of the receptor and its fourth domain not only plays a critical role in interactions with ligands hence in receptor activation but also contains residues whose mutation can lead to ligand independent activation of the receptor we have determined the nmr solution structure of the isolated human fourth domain of the  chain the protein has a fibronectin type iii fold with a well defined hydrophobic core and is stabilised by an extensive network of  cation interactions involving trp and arg side chains including two trp residues outside the highly conserved trp ser xaa trp ser motif where xaa is any amino acid that is found in many cytokine receptors most of the residues implicated in factor independent mutants localise to the rigid core of the domain or the  cation stack the loops between the b and c and the f and g strands that contain residues important for interactions with cytokines lie adjacent at the membrane distal end of the domain consistent with their being involved cooperatively in binding cytokines the elucidation of the structure of the cytokine binding domain of the  chain provides insight into the cytokine dependent and factor independent activation of the receptor
