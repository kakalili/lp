structural characterisation of the human  lactalbumin molten globule at high temperature
molten globules are partially folded forms of proteins thought to be general intermediates in protein folding the  n  h hsqc nmr spectrum of the human  lactalbumin   la molten globule at ph  and   c is characterised by broad lines which make direct study by nmr methods difficult this broadening arises from conformational fluctuations throughout the protein on a millisecond to microsecond timescale here we find that an increase in temperature to   c leads to a dramatic sharpening of peaks in the  n  h hsqc spectrum of human  la at ph  far uv cd and ans fluorescence experiments demonstrate that under these conditions human  la maintains a high degree of helical secondary structure and the exposed hydrophobic surfaces that are characteristic of a molten globule analysis of the h  hn and  n chemical shifts of the human  la molten globule at   c leads to the identification of regions of native like helix in the  domain and of non native helical propensity in the  domain the latter may be responsible for the observed overshoot in ellipticity at   nm in kinetic refolding experiments
