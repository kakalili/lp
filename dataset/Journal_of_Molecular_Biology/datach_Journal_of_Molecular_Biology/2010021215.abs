protein  precursor trna contact leads to sequence specific recognition of   leaders by bacterial ribonuclease p
bacterial ribonuclease p rnase p catalyzes the cleavage of   leader sequences from precursor trnas pre trnas  previously all known substrate nucleotide specificities in this system are derived from rna  rna interactions with the rnase p rna subunit here we demonstrate that pre trna binding affinities for bacillus subtilis and escherichia coli rnase p are enhanced by sequence specific contacts between the fourth pre trna nucleotide on the   side of the cleavage site n    and the rnase p protein p protein subunit b subtilis rnase p has a higher affinity for pre trna with adenosine at n    and this binding preference is amplified at physiological divalent ion concentrations measurements of pre trna containing adenosine analogs at n    indicate that specificity arises from a combination of hydrogen bonding to the n exocyclic amine of adenosine and steric exclusion of the n amine of guanosine mutagenesis of b subtilis p protein indicates that f  and y  contribute to selectivity at n    the hydroxyl group of y  enhances selectivity likely by forming a hydrogen bond with the n    nucleotide the sequence preference of e coli rnase p is diminished showing a weak preference for adenosine and cytosine at n    consistent with the substitution of leu for y  in the e coli p protein this is the first identification of a sequence specific contact between p protein and pre trna that contributes to molecular recognition of rnase p additionally sequence analyses reveal that a greater than expected fraction of pre trnas from both e coli and b subtilis contains a nucleotide at n    that enhances rnase p affinity this observation suggests that specificity at n    contributes to substrate recognition in vivo furthermore bioinformatic analyses suggest that sequence specific contacts between the protein subunit and the leader sequences of pre trnas may be common in bacterial rnase p and may lead to species specific substrate recognition
