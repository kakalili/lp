nmr structure of oxidized glutaredoxin  from escherichia coli edited by p e wright
a high precision nmr structure of oxidized glutaredoxin  c y from escherichia coli has been determined the conformation of the active site including the disulphide bridge is highly similar to those in glutaredoxins from pig liver and t phage a comparison with the previously determined structure of glutaredoxin  c s c y in a complex with glutathione reveals conformational changes between the free and substrate bound form which includes the sidechain of the conserved active site tyrosine residue in the oxidized form this tyrosine is solvent exposed while it adopts a less exposed conformation stabilized by hydrogen bonds in the mixed disulfide with glutathione the structures further suggest that the formation of a covalent linkage between glutathione and glutaredoxin  is necessary in order to induce these structural changes upon binding of the glutathione peptide this could explain the observed low affinity of glutaredoxins for s blocked glutathione analogues in spite of the fact that glutaredoxins are highly specific reductants of glutathione mixed disulfides
