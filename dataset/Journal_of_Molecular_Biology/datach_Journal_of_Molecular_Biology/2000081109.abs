crystal structure of glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum sulfolobus solfataricus edited by d rees
the crystal structure of glycosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeum sulfolobus solfataricus km has been solved by multiple isomorphous replacement the enzyme is an  amylase family   with unique exo amylolytic activity for glycosyltrehalosides it cleaves the    glycosidic bond adjacent to the trehalose moiety to release trehalose and maltooligo saccharide unlike most other family  glycosidases the enzyme does not require ca  for activity and it contains an n terminal extension of    amino acid residues that is homologous to n terminal domains found in many glycosidases that recognize branched oligosaccharides crystallography revealed the enzyme to exist as a homodimer covalently linked by an intermolecular disulfide bond at residue c   the existence of the intermolecular disulfide bond was confirmed by biochemical analysis and mutagenesis the n terminal extension forms an independent domain connected to the catalytic domain by an extended linker the functionally essential ca  binding site found in the b domain of  amylases and many other family  glycosidases was found to be replaced by hydrophobic packing interactions the enzyme also contains a very unusual excursion in the     barrel structure of the catalytic domain this excursion originates from the bottom of the     barrel between helix  and strand  but folds upward in a distorted  hairpin structure to form a part of the substrate binding cleft wall that is possibly critical for the enzyme  s unique substrate selectivity participation of an    loop in the formation of the substrate binding cleft is a novel feature that is not observed in other known     enzymes
