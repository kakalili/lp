allele specific protein dna interactions between the single stranded dna binding protein ssa tibf and dna replication determinants in tetrahymena edited by t richmond
type i elements are multifunctional cis acting determinants that regulate the initiation of dna replication replication fork movement and transcription of the tetrahymena thermophila rdna minichromosome previous studies identified a protein ssa tibf that binds specifically to the a rich strand of type i elements here we examine interactions of ssa tibf with the wild type c allele and a natural variant b rdna which manifests a defect in replication initiation and fork pausing purified ssa tibf is a homotetramer that binds one substrate molecule and contacts dna via a single  kda subunit both the a rich and t rich strands of type i elements are bound by ssa tibf suggesting that this protein might stabilize replication origins in their unwound state nucleotides downstream of type i elements contribute to dna binding with the extent of dna protein contact being greater for wild type c rdna compared to b rdna allele specific protein dna contacts also occur within the conserved type i element itself despite these differences the binding affinities of ssa tibf for c and b rdna substrates are indistinguishable consequently the mode of dna binding must account for any role ssa tibf might play in the regulation of rdna replication
