the core of ure p prion fibrils is formed by the n terminal segment in a parallel cross  structure evidence from solid state nmr
intracellular fibril formation by ure p produces the non mendelian genetic element ure  in saccharomyces cerevisiae making ure p a prion protein we show that solid state nmr spectra of full length ure p fibrils seeded with infectious prions from a specific ure  strain and labeled with uniformly  n   c enriched ile include strong sharp signals from ile residues in the globular c terminal domain ctd with both helical and nonhelical  c chemical shifts treatment with proteinase k eliminates these ctd signals leaving only nonhelical signals from the gln rich and asn rich n terminal segment which are also observed in the solid state nmr spectra of ile labeled fibrils formed by residues    of ure p thus the n terminal segment or  prion domain   pd  forms the fibril core while ctd units are located outside the core we additionally show that after proteinase k treatment ile labeled ure p fibrils formed without prion seeding exhibit a broader set of solid state nmr signals than do prion seeded fibrils consistent with the idea that structural variations within the pd core account for prion strains measurements of  c   c magnetic dipole  dipole couplings among  c labeled ile carbonyl sites in full length ure p fibrils support an in register parallel  sheet structure for the pd core of ure p fibrils finally we show that a model in which ctd units are attached rigidly to the parallel  sheet core is consistent with steric constraints
