the metavinculin tail domain directs constitutive interactions with raver and vinculin rna
vinculin is a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton attachment to the cell membrane at cellular adhesion sites which is crucial for processes such as cell motility and migration development survival and wound healing vinculin loss results in embryonic lethality cardiovascular diseases and cancer its tail domain vt is crucial for vinculin activation and focal adhesion turnover and binds to the actin cytoskeleton and acidic phospholipids upon which it unfurls the rna binding protein raver regulates the assembly of focal adhesions transcriptionally by binding to vinculin the muscle specific splice form metavinculin is characterized by a  residue insert in the tail domain mvt and correlates with hereditary idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy here we report that metavinculin can bind to raver in its inactive state our crystal structure explains this permissivity where an extended coil unique to mvt is unfurled in the mvt   raver complex structure our binding assays show that raver forms a ternary complex with mvt and vinculin mrna these findings suggest that the metavinculin raver rna complex is constitutively recruited to adhesion complexes
