maltose binding protein from the hyperthermophilic bacterium thermotoga maritima stability and binding properties edited by r huber
recombinant maltose binding protein from thermotoga maritima tmmbp was expressed in escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity applying heat incubation of the crude extract at   c as taken from the spectral physicochemical and binding properties the recombinant protein is indistinguishable from the natural protein isolated from the periplasm of thermotoga maritima at neutral ph tmmbp exhibits extremely high intrinsic stability with a thermal transition gt   c guanidinium chloride induced equilibrium unfolding transitions at varying temperatures result in a stability maximum at    c at room temperature the thermodynamic analysis of the highly cooperative unfolding equilibrium transition yields  gn  u     kj mol   for the free energy of stabilization compared to mesophilic mbp from e coli as a reference this value is increased by about  kj mol   at temperatures around the optimal growth temperature of t maritima topt    c  the yield of refolding does not exceed    the residual   are misfolded as indicated by a decrease in stability as well as loss of the maltose binding capacity tmmbp is able to bind maltose maltotriose and trehalose with dissociation constants in the nanomolar to micromolar range combining the substrate specificities of the homologs from the mesophilic bacterium e coli and the hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus litoralis fluorescence quench experiments allowed the dissociation constants of ligand binding to be quantified binding of maltose was found to be endothermic and entropy driven with  hb   kj mol   and  sb   j mol   k   extrapolation of the linear vant  hoff plot to topt resulted in kd     m this result is in agreement with data reported for the mbps from e coli and t litoralis at their respective optimum growth temperatures corroborating the general observation that proteins under their specific physiological conditions are in corresponding states
