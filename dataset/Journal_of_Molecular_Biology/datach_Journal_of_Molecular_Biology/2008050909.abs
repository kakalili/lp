salt bridge dynamics control substrate induced conformational change in the membrane transporter glpt
active transport of substrates across cytoplasmic membranes is of great physiological medical and pharmaceutical importance the glycerol  phosphate g p transporter glpt of the e coli inner membrane is a secondary active antiporter from the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily that couples the import of g p to the efflux of inorganic phosphate pi down its concentration gradient integrating information from a novel combination of structural molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical studies we identify the residues involved directly in binding of substrate to the inward facing conformation of glpt thus defining the structural basis for the substrate specificity of this transporter the substrate binding mechanism involves protonation of a histidine residue at the binding site furthermore our data suggest that the formation and breaking of inter and intradomain salt bridges control the conformational change of the transporter that accompanies substrate translocation across the membrane the mechanism we propose may be a paradigm for organophosphate phosphate antiporters
