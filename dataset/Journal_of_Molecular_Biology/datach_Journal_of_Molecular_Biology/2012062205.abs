role of arginine   and glutamine   in communication between catalytic and allosteric sites in yeast ribonucleotide reductase
ribonucleotide reductases rrs catalyze the rate limiting step of de novo deoxynucleotide dntp synthesis eukaryotic rrs consist of two proteins rr    that contains the catalytic site and rr    that houses a diferric tyrosyl radical essential for ribonucleoside diphosphate reduction biochemical analysis has been combined with isothermal titration calorimetry itc  x ray crystallography and yeast genetics to elucidate the roles of two loop  mutations r  a and q  a in saccharomyces cerevisiae rr  scrr  these mutations r  a and q  a cause lethality and severe s phase defects respectively in cells that use scrr as the sole source of rr activity compared to the wild type enzyme activity r  a and q  a mutants show  and   respectively for adp reduction whereas they are   and   respectively for cdp reduction itc data showed that r  a scrr is unable to bind adp and binds cdp with  fold lower affinity compared to wild type scrr  with the q  a scrr mutant there is a  fold loss of affinity for adp binding and a  fold loss of affinity for cdp compared to the wild type x ray structures of r  a scrr complexed with dgtp and amppnp  cdp amppnp adenosine     imido triphosphate tetralithium salt reveal that adp is not bound at the catalytic site and cdp binds farther from the catalytic site compared to wild type our in vivo functional analyses demonstrated that r  a cannot support mitotic growth whereas q  a can albeit with a severe s phase defect taken together our structure activity itc and in vivo data reveal that the arginine   and glutamine   residues of scrr are crucial in facilitating adp and cdp substrate selection
