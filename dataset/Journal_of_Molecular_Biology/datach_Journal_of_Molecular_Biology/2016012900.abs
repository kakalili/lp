pi release limits the intrinsic and rna stimulated atpase cycles of dead box protein  dbp
mrna export from the nucleus depends on the atpase activity of the dead box protein dbp ddx  although dbp has measurable atpase activity alone several regulatory factors e g  rna nucleoporin proteins and the endogenous small molecule insp  modulate catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo to facilitate mrna export an analysis of the intrinsic and regulator activated dbp atpase cycle is necessary to define how these factors control dbp and mrna export here we report a kinetic and equilibrium analysis of the saccharomyces cerevisiae dbp atpase cycle including the influence of rna on dbp activity these data show that atp binds dbp weakly in rapid equilibrium with a binding affinity kt mm comparable to the km for steady state cycling while adp binds an order of magnitude more tightly kd  mm  the overall intrinsic steady state cycling rate constant kcat is limited by slow near irreversible atp hydrolysis and even slower subsequent phosphate release rna increases kcat and rate limiting pi release  fold although pi release continues to limit steady state cycling in the presence of rna in conjunction with rna binding together this work identifies rna binding and pi release as important biochemical transitions within the dbp atpase cycle and provides a framework for investigating the means by which dbp and mrna export is modulated by regulatory factors
