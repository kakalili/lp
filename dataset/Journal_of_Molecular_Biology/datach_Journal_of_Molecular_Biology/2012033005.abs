the transition state of coupled folding and binding for a flexible  finger
flexible and fully disordered protein regions that fold upon binding mediate numerous protein  protein interactions however little is known about their mechanism of interaction one such coupled folding and binding occurs when a flexible region of neuronal nitric oxide synthase adopts a  finger structure upon binding to its protein ligand a pdz psd   postsynaptic density protein   discs large zo  domain from psd   we have analyzed this binding reaction by protein engineering combined with kinetic experiments mutational destabilization of the  finger changed mainly the dissociation rate constant of the proteins and to a lesser extent the association rate constant thus mutation affected late events in the coupled folding and binding reaction our results therefore suggest that the native binding interactions of the  finger are not present in the rate limiting transition state for binding but form on the downhill side in a cooperative manner however by mutation we could destabilize the  finger further and change the rate limiting step such that an initial conformational change becomes rate limiting this switch in rate limiting step shows that multistep binding mechanisms are likely to be found among flexible and intrinsically disordered regions of proteins
