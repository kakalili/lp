The tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR)-containing co-chaperone Hsp-organising protein (Hop) plays a critical role in mediating interactions between Heat Shock Protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp90 as part of the cellular assembly machine. It also modulates the ATPase activity of both Hsp70 and Hsp90, thus facilitating client protein transfer between the two. Despite structural work on the individual domains of Hop, no structure for the full-length protein exists, nor is it clear exactly how Hop interacts with Hsp90, although it is known that its primary binding site is the C-terminal MEEVD motif. Here, we have undertaken a biophysical analysis of the structure and binding of Hop to Hsp90 using a variety of truncation mutants of both Hop and Hsp90, in addition to mutants of Hsp90 that are thought to modulate the conformation, in particular the N-terminal dimerisation of the chaperone. The results establish that whilst the primary binding site of Hop is the C-terminal MEEVD peptide of Hsp90, binding also occurs at additional sites in the C-terminal and middle domain. In contrast, we show that another TPR-containing co-chaperone, CyP40, binds solely to the C-terminus of Hsp90.Truncation mutants of Hop were generated and used to investigate the dimerisation interface of the protein. In good agreement with recently published data, we find that the TPR2a domain that contains the Hsp90-binding site is also the primary site for dimerisation. However, our results suggest that residues within the TPR2b may play a role. Together, these data along with shape reconstruction analysis from small-angle X-ray scattering measurements are used to generate a solution structure for full-length Hop, which we show has an overall butterfly-like quaternary structure.Studies on the nucleotide dependence of Hop binding to Hsp90 establish that Hop binds to the nucleotide-free, ‘open’ state of Hsp90. However, the Hsp90–Hop complex is weakened by the conformational changes that occur in Hsp90 upon ATP binding. Together, the data are used to propose a detailed model of how Hop may help present the client protein to Hsp90 by aligning the bound client on Hsp70 with the middle domain of Hsp90. It is likely that Hop binds to both monomers of Hsp90 in the form of a clamp, interacting with residues in the middle domain of Hsp90, thus preventing ATP hydrolysis, possibly by the prevention of association of N-terminal and middle domains in individual Hsp90 monomers.
