sequence and structure classification of kinases
kinases are a ubiquitous group of enzymes that catalyze the phosphoryl transfer reaction from a phosphate donor usually atp to a receptor substrate although all kinases catalyze essentially the same phosphoryl transfer reaction they display remarkable diversity in their substrate specificity structure and the pathways in which they participate in order to learn the relationship between structural fold and functional specificities in kinases we have done a comprehensive survey of all available kinase sequences  gt     and classified them into  distinct families based on sequence similarities of these families   covering nearly   of all sequences fall into seven general structural folds for which three dimensional structures are known these fold groups include some of the most widespread protein folds such as rossmann fold ferredoxin fold ribonuclease h fold and tim    barrel on the basis of this classification system we examined the shared substrate binding and catalytic mechanisms as well as variations of these mechanisms in the same fold groups cases of convergent evolution of identical kinase activities occurring in different folds are discussed
