exploring the basis of pin  variant differences in psi  induction
certain soluble proteins can form amyloid like prion aggregates indeed the same protein can make different types of aggregates called variants each variant is heritable because it attracts soluble homologous protein to join its aggregate which is then broken into seeds propagons and transmitted to daughter cells  psi  and pin  are respectively prion forms of sup  and rnq  curiously  pin  enhances the de novo induction of psi  different pin  variants do this to dramatically different extents here we investigate the mechanism underlying this effect consistent with a heterologous prion cross seeding model different pin  variants preferentially promoted the appearance of different variants of psi  however we did not detect this specificity in vitro also  pin  variant cross seeding efficiencies were not proportional to the level of rnq coimmunocaptured with sup  or to the number of pin  propagons characteristic for that variant this leads us to propose that pin  variants differ in the cross seeding quality of their seeds following the sup  pin  binding step
