nadp expels both the co factor and a substrate analog from the mycobacterium tuberculosis thyx active site opportunities for anti bacterial drug design
the novel flavin dependent thymidylate synthase thyx is absent in humans but several pathogenic bacteria depend exclusively on thyx activity to synthesize thymidylate reduction of the enzyme bound fad by nadph is suggested to be the critical first step in thyx catalysis we soaked mycobacterium tuberculosis thyx fad brdump ternary complex crystals in a solution containing nadp to gain structural insights into the reductive step of the catalytic cycle surprisingly the nadp displaced both fad and brdump from the active site in the resultant thyx nadp binary complex the amp moiety is bound in a deep pocket similar to that of the same moiety of fad in the ternary complex while the nicotinamide part of nadp is engaged in a limited number of contacts with thyx the additional   phosphate group attached to the amp ribose of nadp could be accommodated with minor rearrangement of water molecules the newly introduced   phosphate groups are engaged in water mediated interactions across the non crystallographic  fold axis of the thyx tetramer suggesting possibilities for design of high affinity bivalent inhibitors of this intriguing enzyme
