unexpected active site flexibility in the structure of human neutrophil elastase in complex with a new dihydropyrimidone inhibitor
human neutrophil elastase hne  a trypsin type serine protease is of pivotal importance in the onset and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd  copd encompasses a group of slowly progressive respiratory disorders and is a major medical problem and the fifth leading cause of death worldwide hne is a major target for the development of compounds that inhibit the progression of long term lung function decline in copd patients here we present the three dimensional structure of a potent dihydropyrimidone inhibitor dhpi non covalently bound to hne at a resolution of     the inhibitor binds to the active site in a unique orientation addressing s and s subsites of the protease to facilitate further analysis of this binding mode we determined the structure of the uncomplexed enzyme at a resolution of      detailed comparisons of the hne dhpi complex with the uncomplexed hne structure and published structures of other elastase inhibitor complexes revealed that binding of dhpi leads to large conformational changes in residues located in the s subsite the rearrangement of residues asp   leu b creates a deep well defined cavity which is filled by the p moiety of the inhibitor molecule to almost perfect shape complementarity the shape of the s subsite in complex with dhpi clearly differs from all other observed hne structures the observed structural flexibility of the s subsite is a key feature for the understanding of the binding mode of dhpis in general and the development of new hne selective inhibitors
