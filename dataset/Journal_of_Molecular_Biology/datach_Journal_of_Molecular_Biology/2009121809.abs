tryptophan fluorescence reveals structural features of  synuclein oligomers
oligomeric  synuclein  s is considered to be the potential toxic species responsible for the onset and progression of parkinson s disease possibly through the disruption of lipid membranes although there is evidence that oligomers contain considerable amounts of secondary structure more detailed data on the structural characteristics and how these mediate oligomer  lipid binding are critically lacking this report is to our knowledge the first study that aimed to address the structure of oligomeric  s on a more detailed level we have used tryptophan trp fluorescence spectroscopy to gain insight into the structural features of oligomeric  s and the structural basis for oligomer  lipid interactions several single trp mutants of  s were used to gain site specific information about the microenvironments of monomeric  s oligomeric  s and lipid bound oligomeric  s acrylamide quenching and spectral analyses indicate that the trp residues are considerably more solvent protected in the oligomeric form compared with the monomeric protein in the oligomers the negatively charged c terminus was the most solvent exposed part of the protein upon lipid binding a blue shift in fluorescence was observed for  s mutants where the trp is located within the n terminal region these results suggest that as in the case of monomeric  s the n terminus is critical in determining oligomer  lipid binding
