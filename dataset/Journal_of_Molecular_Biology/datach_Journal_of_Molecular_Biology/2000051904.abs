a breakdown of symmetry in the folding transition state of protein l edited by c r matthews
the  residue igg binding domain of protein l consists of a central  helix packed on a four stranded  sheet formed by n and c terminal  hairpins the overall topology of the protein is quite symmetric the  hairpins have similar lengths and make very similar interactions with the central helix characterization of the effects of  point mutations distributed throughout the protein on the kinetics of folding and unfolding reveals that this symmetry is completely broken during folding the first  hairpin is largely structured while the second  hairpin and helix are largely disrupted in the folding transition state ensemble the results are not consistent with a  hydrophobic core first  picture of protein folding the first  hairpin appears to be at least as ordered at the rate limiting step in folding as the hydrophobic core
