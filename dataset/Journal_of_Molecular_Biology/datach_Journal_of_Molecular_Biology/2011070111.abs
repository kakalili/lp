the stalk region of the recu resolvase is essential for holliday junction recognition and distortion
the bacillus subtilis recu protein has two activities to recognize distort and cleave four stranded recombination intermediates and to modulate reca activities the recu structure shows a mushroom like appearance with a cap and a stalk region the ruvb interaction and the catalytic residues are located in the cap region of dimeric recu we report here that the stalk region is essential not only for reca modulation but also for holliday junction hj recognition two recu mutants which map in the stalk region were isolated and characterized in vivo a recu variant with a phe  to ala substitution f a was as sensitive to dna damaging agents as a null recu strain and a similar substitution at tyrosine   y a showed an intermediate phenotype recuy a and recuf a poorly recognize and distort hjs recuy a cleaves hjs with low efficiency and ruvb modulates cleavage at high concentrations recuf a binds to hjs but fails to cleave them unlike wild type recu recuy a and recuf a do not inhibit reca datpase and strand exchange activities the recu stalk region is involved in reca interaction but once an hj is bound recu fails to modulate reca activities our biochemical study provides a mechanistic basis for the connections between these two mutually exclusive stages i e  reca modulation and hj resolution of the recombination reaction
