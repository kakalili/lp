molecular adaptation to an extreme environment origin of the thermal stability of the pompeii worm collagen edited by w baumeister
the annelid alvinella pompejana is probably the most heat tolerant metazoan organism known previous results have shown that the level of thermal stability of its interstitial collagen is significantly greater than that of coastal annelids and of vent organisms such as the vestimentiferan riftia pachyptila living in colder parts of the deep sea hydrothermal environment in order to investigate the molecular basis of this thermal behavior we cloned and sequenced a large cdna molecule coding the fibrillar collagen of alvinella including one half of the helical domain and the entire c propeptide domain for comparison we also cloned the   part of the homologous cdna from riftia comparison of the corresponding helical domains of these two species together with that of the previously sequenced domain of the coastal lugworm arenicola marina showed that the increase in proline content and in the number of stabilizing triplets correlate with the outstanding thermostability of the interstitial collagen of a pompejana phylogenetic analysis showed that triple helical and the c propeptide parts of the same collagen molecule evolve at different rates in favor of an adaptive mechanism at the molecular level
