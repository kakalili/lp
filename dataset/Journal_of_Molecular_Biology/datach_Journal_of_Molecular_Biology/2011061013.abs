mechanism of mss  atpase reveals functional diversity of dead box proteins
mss  is a saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial dead box rna helicase protein that is essential for efficient in vivo splicing of all group i and group ii introns and for activation of mrna translation catalysis of intron splicing by mss  is coupled to its atpase activity knowledge of the kinetic pathway s and biochemical intermediates populated during rna stimulated mss  atpase is fundamental for defining how mss  atp utilization is linked to in vivo function we therefore measured the rate and equilibrium constants underlying mss  atp utilization and nucleotide linked rna binding rna accelerates the mss  steady state atpase   fold by promoting rate limiting atp hydrolysis such that inorganic phosphate pi release becomes partially rate limiting rna binding displays strong thermodynamic coupling to the chemical states of the mss  bound nucleotide such that mss  with bound adp pi binds rna more strongly than mss  with bound adp or in the absence of nucleotide the predominant biochemical intermediate populated during in vivo steady state cycling is the strong rna binding mss   adp pi state strong rna binding allows mss  to fulfill its biological role in the stabilization of group ii intron folding intermediates atpase cycling allows for transient population of the weak rna binding adp state of mss  and linked dissociation from rna which is required for the final stages of intron folding in cases where mss  functions as a helicase the data collectively favor a model in which atp hydrolysis promotes a weak to strong rna binding transition that disrupts stable rna duplexes the subsequent strong to weak rna binding transition associated with pi release dissociates mss   rna complexes regenerating free mss
