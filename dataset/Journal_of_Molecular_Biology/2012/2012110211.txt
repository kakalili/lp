Cotranslational targeting of membrane proteins is mediated by the universally conserved signal recognition particle (SRP). In eukaryotes, SRP attenuates translation during targeting; however, in prokaryotes, a simplified SRP is believed to carry out targeting during continuing translation. Here, we show a detailed stepwise analysis of the targeting of subunit c of the F0 component of the bacterial ATP synthase (F0c) to the inner membrane. We show that the first transmembrane (TM) signal-anchor domain of F0c forms a compacted structure within the distal portion of the ribosome tunnel. This structure is formed just prior to the interaction with SRP. In the absence of SRP this structure is lost as the TM domain exits the tunnel; however in the presence of SRP it is stabilized. Our results suggest differences in early protein folding of substrates for prokaryotic SRP‐dependent membrane protein targeting pathways, from that of eukaryotic SRP targeting. These results imply that early TM domain recognition by targeting factors acts to ensure that the efficiency of membrane targeting is maintained.
