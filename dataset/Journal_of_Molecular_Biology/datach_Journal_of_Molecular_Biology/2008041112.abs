crystal structure and rna binding of the tex protein from pseudomonas aeruginosa
tex is a highly conserved bacterial protein that likely functions in a variety of transcriptional processes here we describe two crystal structures of the  kda tex protein from pseudomonas aeruginosa at   and     resolution respectively these structures reveal a relatively flat and elongated protein with several potential nucleic acid binding motifs clustered at one end including an s domain near the c terminus that displays considerable structural flexibility tex binds nucleic acids with a preference for single stranded rna and the tex s domain is required for this binding activity point mutants further demonstrate that the primary nucleic acid binding site corresponds to a surface of the s domain sequence alignment and modeling indicate that the eukaryotic spt transcription factor adopts a similar core structure structural analysis further suggests that the rna polymerase and nucleosome interacting regions of spt flank opposite sides of the tex like scaffold therefore the tex structure may represent a conserved scaffold that binds single stranded rna to regulate transcription in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms
