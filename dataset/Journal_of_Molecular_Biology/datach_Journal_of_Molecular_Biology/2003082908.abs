a proline switch controls folding and domain interactions in the gene  protein of the filamentous phage fd
the amino terminal domains n and n of the gene  protein of phage fd form a bilobal structural and functional entity that protrudes from the phage tip domain n initiates the infection of escherichia coli by binding to the f pilus this binding results in the dissociation of the two domains and allows n to interact with the tola receptor at the cell surface the refolding of the n  n fragment begins with the folding of domain n  which takes a few milliseconds followed by the folding of domain n  which is complete within five minutes the subsequent domain assembly is unusually slow and shows a time constant of   s at   c we found that the rate of this reaction is controlled by the trans to cis isomerization of the gln  pro  bond in the hinge subdomain of n  a region that provides many interactions between n and n in the gene  protein the substitution of pro  by gly accelerated domain association  fold and revealed that the folding of the two individual domains and their assembly are indeed sequential steps in the refolding of the gene  protein in the course of infection the domains must separate to expose the binding site for tola on domain n  the kinetic block of domain reassembly caused by pro  isomerization could ensure that after the initial binding of n to the f pilus the open state persists until n and tola are close enough for their mutual interaction pro  isomerization might thus serve as a slow conformational switch in the function of the gene  protein
