frameshifting in alphaviruses a diversity of   stimulatory structures
programmed ribosomal frameshifting allows the synthesis of alternative n terminally coincident c terminally distinct proteins from the same rna many viruses utilize frameshifting to optimize the coding potential of compact genomes to circumvent the host cell s canonical rule of one functional protein per mrna or to express alternative proteins in a fixed ratio programmed frameshifting is also used in the decoding of a small number of cellular genes recently specific ribosomal   frameshifting was discovered at a conserved u uuu uua motif within the sequence encoding the alphavirus k protein in this case frameshifting results in the synthesis of an additional protein termed tf transframe  this new case of frameshifting is unusual in that the   frame orf is very short and completely embedded within the sequence encoding the overlapping polyprotein the present work shows that there is remarkable diversity in the   sequences that are functionally important for efficient frameshifting at the u uuu uua motif while many alphavirus species utilize a   rna structure such as a hairpin or pseudoknot some species such as semliki forest virus apparently lack any intra mrna stimulatory structure yet just   nt   adjacent to the shift site stimulates up to   frameshifting the analysis both experimental and bioinformatic significantly expands the known repertoire of   frameshifting stimulators in mammalian and insect systems
