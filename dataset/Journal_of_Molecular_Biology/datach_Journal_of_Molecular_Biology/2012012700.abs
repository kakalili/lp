solution structure of the hiv  exon splicing silencer
alternative splicing of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genomic rna is necessary to produce the complete viral protein complement and aberrations in the splicing pattern impair hiv  replication genome splicing in hiv  is tightly regulated by the dynamic assembly disassembly of trans host factors with cis rna control elements the host protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp a  regulates splicing at several highly conserved hiv    splice sites by binding   uag   elements embedded within regions containing rna structure the physical determinants of hnrnp a splice site recognition remain poorly defined in hiv  thus precluding a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of the splicing pattern here the three dimensional structure of the exon splicing silencer  ess  from hiv  has been determined using nmr spectroscopy ess adopts a  nucleotide hairpin with a  bp a form stem that contains a ph sensitive a c wobble pair the seven nucleotide hairpin loop contains the high affinity hnrnp a responsive   uagu   element and a proximal   gau   motif the nmr structure shows that the heptaloop adopts a well organized conformation stabilized primarily by base stacking interactions reminiscent of a u turn the apex of the loop is quasi symmetric with ua dinucleotide steps from the   gau   and   uagu   motifs stacking on opposite sides of the hairpin as a step towards understanding the binding mechanism we performed calorimetric and nmr titrations of several hnrnp a subdomains into ess  the data show that the up domain forms a high affinity kd      nm complex with ess via site specific interactions with the loop
