the nuclease a inhibitor represents a new variation of the rare pr  fold
nuclease a nuca from anabaena sp is a non specific endonuclease able to degrade single and double stranded dna and rna the endonucleolytic activity is inhibited by the nuclease a inhibitor nuia  which binds to nuca with   stoichiometry and picomolar affinity in order to better understand the mechanism of inhibition the solution structure of nuia was determined by nmr methods the fold of nuia is an       sandwich but standard database searches by dali and top revealed no structural homologies a visual inspection of       folds in the cath database revealed similarities to the pr  like fold scop nomenclature  the similarities include the ordering of secondary structural elements a single helix on one face of the       sandwich and three helices on the other face however a major difference is in the iv helix which in the pr  fold is short and perpendicular to the i and iii helices but in nuia is long and parallel to the i and iii helices additionally a strand insertion in the  sheet makes the nuia  sheet completely antiparallel in organization the fast time scale motions of nuia characterized by enhanced flexibility of the extended loop between helices iii and iv also show similarities to p a which is a pr  fold we propose that the purpose of the pr  fold is to form a stable scaffold to present this extended structure for biological interactions with other proteins this hypothesis is supported by data that show that when nuia is bound to nuca significant changes in chemical shift occur in the extended loop between helices iii and iv
