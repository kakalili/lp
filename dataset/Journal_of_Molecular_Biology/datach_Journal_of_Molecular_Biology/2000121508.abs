ge  a resistant mutations in elongation factor tu allow productive aminoacyl trna binding to ef tu gtp ge  a complexes
the antibiotic ge  a prevents stable complex formation between elongation factor tu ef tu and aminoacyl trna aatrna  in escherichia coli we characterized two mutant ef tu species with either g  s or g  a that lead to high ge  a resistance in poly phe synthesis which at least partially explains the high resistance of ef tu from ge  a producer planobispora rosea to its own antibiotic both e coli mutants were unexpectedly found to bind ge  a nearly as well as wild type wt ef tu in their gtp bound conformations both g  s and g  a are in or near the binding site for the   end of aatrna the g  s mutation causes a   fold increase in affinity for aatrna whereas g  a causes a  fold decrease in the presence of ge  a wt ef tu shows a drop in aatrna affinity of at least four orders of magnitude ef tu g  s and ef tu g  a curtail this drop to about two or one order respectively it thus appears that the resistance mutations do not prevent ge  a from binding to ef tu gtp and that the mutant ef tus may accommodate ge  a and aatrna simultaneously interestingly in their gdp bound conformations the mutant ef tus have much less affinity for ge  a than wt ef tu the latter is explained by a recent crystal structure of the ef tu gdp ge  a complex which predicts direct steric problems between ge  a and the mutated g  s or g  a these mutations may cause a dislocation of ge  a in complex with gtp bound ef tu which then no longer prevents aatrna binding as in the wt situation altogether the data lead to the following novel resistance scenario upon arrival of the mutant ef tu gtp ge   aatrna complex at the ribosomal a site the gtpase centre is triggered the affinities of aatrna and ge  a for the gdp bound ef tu are negligible the former stays at the a site for subsequent interaction with the peptidyltransferase centre and the latter two dissociate from the ribosome
