asp to asn substitution at the first position of the dxd toprim motif of recombinant bacterial topoisomerase i is extremely lethal to e coli
the toprim domain found in many nucleotidyl transferases contains a dxd motif involved in magnesium ion coordination for catalysis medium to high copy number plasmid clones of yersinia pestis topoisomerase i yptop with asp to asn substitution at the first aspartate residue d  n of this motif could not be generated in escherichia coli without second site mutation even when expression was under the control of the tightly regulated bad promoter and suppressed by  glucose in the medium arabinose induction of a single copy yptop d  n mutant gene integrated into the chromosome resulted in    fold of cell killing in   h attempt to induce expression of the corresponding e coli topoisomerase i mutant ectop d  n encoded on a high copy number plasmid resulted in either loss of viability or reversion of the clone to wild type high copy number plasmid clones of yptop d  n and ectop d  n with the asn substitution at the second asp of the toprim motif could be stably maintained but overexpression also decreased cell viability significantly the asp to asn substitutions at these toprim residues can selectively decrease mg  binding affinity with minimal disruption of the active site geometry leading to trapping of the covalent complex with cleaved dna and causing bacterial cell death the extreme sensitivity of the first toprim position suggested that this might be a useful site for binding of small molecules that could act as topoisomerase poisons
