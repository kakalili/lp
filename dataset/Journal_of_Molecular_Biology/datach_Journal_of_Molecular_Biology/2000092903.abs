a fast method to predict protein interaction sites from sequences edited by b holland
a simple method for predicting residues involved in protein interaction sites is proposed in the absence of any structural report the procedure identifies linear stretches of sequences as  receptor binding domains   rbds by analysing hydrophobicity distribution the sequences of two databases of non homologous interaction sites eliciting various biological activities were tested      were detected as rbds a statistical analysis of amino acid frequencies was carried out in known interaction sites and in predicted rbds rbds were predicted from the    sequences of the swissprot database in both cases arginine is the most frequently occurring residue the rbd procedure can also detect residues involved in specific interaction sites such as the dna binding    detected and ca binding domains    detected  we report two recent analyses from the prediction of rbds in sequences to the experimental demonstration of the functional activities the examples concern a retroviral gag protein and a penicillin binding protein we support that this method is a quick way to predict protein interaction sites from sequences and is helpful for guiding experiments such as site specific mutageneses two hybrid systems or the synthesis of inhibitors
