the integrity of the sarcin ricin domain of  s ribosomal rna is not required for elongation factor independent peptide synthesis
the elongation stage of protein synthesis consists of repeated cycles of the binding of aminoacyl trna peptide bond formation and translocation the process is normally catalyzed by the elongation factors tu and g however the reactions can proceed at least in prescribed and limited circumstance in the absence of the elongation factors a finding that strongly implies that the chemistry of protein synthesis is inherent in the ribosome the sarcin ricin domain in  s rrna the site of inactivation of ribosomes by ribotoxins is where the elongation factors bind the question that arises is whether the sarcin ricin domain is necessary for factor independent peptide synthesis the answer is that it is not the disruption of the sarcin ricin domain by covalent modification with either sarcin or pokeweed antiviral protein did not affect factor independent peptide synthesis nor did lethal mutations of nucleotides that abolish the binding of elongation factors the results imply that the sole function of the sarcin ricin domain is to provide a binding site for the elongation factors and hence to facilitate the elongation reactions the results also raise the possibility of the co evolution of the sarcin ricin domain and the elongation factors
