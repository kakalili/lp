structural and immunological correlations between the variable blocks of the var csa domain dbl  from two plasmodium falciparum parasite lines
plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein  pfemp  a family of adhesins of the falciparum species of the malaria parasite is exposed on the surface of the infected erythrocyte in general only one pfemp variant is expressed at a time but switching between variants occurs changing both host cell receptor specificity and serotype the pfemp variant var csa causes sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the intervillous spaces of the placenta via the glycosaminoglycan chondroitin sulfate a this leads to pregnancy associated malaria which has severe consequences for the fetus and mother the extracellular region of var csa comprises six dbl duffy binding like domains and a single cidr cysteine rich inter domain region domain the c terminal domain dbl   the most polymorphic domain of var csa has seven regions of high variability termed variable blocks vbs  here we have determined the crystal structure of dbl  from the fcr parasite line and have compared it with the previously determined structure of that from the d line we found significant differences particularly in the n terminal region which contains the first vb vb  although dbl  is the most variable var csa domain dbl  fcr and dbl   d react with igg purified from immune sera of pregnant women furthermore igg purified on one domain cross reacts with the other confirming the presence of cross reactive epitopes we also examined reactivity of immune sera to the four least variable vb vb  vb  vb and vb  using peptides with the consensus sequence closest in turn to the fcr or d domain these results provide new molecular insights into immune escape by parasites expressing the var csa variant
