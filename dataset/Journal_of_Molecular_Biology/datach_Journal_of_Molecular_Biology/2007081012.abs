crystal structure of the bacillus subtilis penicillin binding protein a and its complex with a peptidoglycan mimetic peptide
the genome of bacillus subtilis encodes  penicillin binding proteins pbps involved in the synthesis and or remodelling of the peptidoglycan during the complex life cycle of this sporulating gram positive rod shaped bacterium pbp a encoded by the dacc gene is a low molecular mass pbp clearly exhibiting in vitro dd carboxypeptidase activity we have solved the crystal structure of this protein alone and in complex with a peptide d  aminopymelyl  d alanyl d alanine that mimics the c terminal end of the bacillus peptidoglycan stem peptide pbp a is composed of three domains the penicillin binding domain with a fold similar to the class a  lactamase structure and two domains inserted between the conserved motifs  and  characteristic of the penicillin recognizing enzymes the soaking of pbp a in a solution of d  aminopymelyl  d alanyl d alanine resulted in an adduct between pbp a and a d  aminopimelyl  d alanine dipeptide and an unbound d alanine i e the products of acylation of pbp a by d  aminopymelyl  d alanyl d alanine with the release of a d alanine the adduct also reveals a binding pocket specific to the diaminopimelic acid the third residue of the peptidoglycan stem pentapeptide of b subtilis this pocket is specific for this class of pbps
