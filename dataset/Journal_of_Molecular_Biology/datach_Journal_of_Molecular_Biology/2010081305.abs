intramembrane proteolysis of mgm by the mitochondrial rhomboid protease is highly promiscuous regarding the sequence of the cleaved hydrophobic segment
rhomboids are a family of intramembrane serine proteases that are conserved in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes they are required for numerous fundamental cellular functions such as quorum sensing cell signaling and mitochondrial dynamics mitochondrial rhomboids form an evolutionarily distinct class of rhomboids it is largely unclear how their activity is controlled and which substrate determinants are responsible for recognition and cleavage we investigated these requirements for the mitochondrial rhomboid protease pcp and its substrate mgm  in contrast to several other rhomboid proteases pcp does not require helix breaking amino acids in the cleaved hydrophobic region of mgm  termed  rhomboid cleavage region   rcr  even transmembrane segments of inner membrane proteins that are normally not processed by pcp become cleavable when put in place of the authentic rcr of mgm  we further show that mutational alterations of a highly negatively charged region located c terminally to the rcr led to a strong processing defect moreover we show that the determinants required for mgm processing by mitochondrial rhomboid protease are conserved during evolution as parl the human ortholog of pcp  showed similar substrate requirements these results suggest a surprising promiscuity of the mitochondrial rhomboid protease regarding the sequence requirements of the cleaved hydrophobic segment we propose a working hypothesis on how the mitochondrial rhomboid protease can despite this promiscuity achieve a high specificity in recognizing mgm  this hypothesis relates to the exceptional biogenesis pathway of mgm
