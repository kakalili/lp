epstein barr virus nuclear antigen  retards cell growth induces p waf expression and modulates p  activity post translationally edited by m yaniv
the epstein barr virus ebv nuclear antigen  ebna  has been shown to be required for promotion of cell cycle progression in ebv immortalized b lymphocytes however other studies have indicated that ebna alone in the absence of other ebv genes may retard cell growth to resolve this discrepancy we investigated the effect of ebna on the growth of various cells including ebv target nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells npc tw  and npc tw  we found that ebna could retard cell growth in stable vero hep  and u os cell clones expressing ebna  and in vero    npc tw  and npc tw  cells transiently transfected with ebna  while investigating the mechanism underlying the growth retarding function of ebna  we found that ebna induced p waf expression in these cells this induction of p waf expression was mediated through p  ebna was found to stimulate p  to bind to the p  response element within the p waf promoter possibly by promoting p  phosphorylation this enhancement of p  sequence specific dna binding activity may be the mechanism through which ebna activates the expression of p  regulated genes including p waf and mdm  together these studies reveal a possible intrinsic function of ebna in cell growth regulation and elucidate a novel mechanism by which ebna modulates transcription
