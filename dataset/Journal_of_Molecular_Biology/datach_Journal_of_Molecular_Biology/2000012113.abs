isolation and characterization of the human ugt b  gene localized within a cluster of ugt b genes and pseudogenes on chromosome  edited by j karn
glucuronidation is a major pathway of androgen metabolism and is catalyzed by udp glucuronosyltransferase ugt enzymes ugt b  and ugt b  are   identical in primary structure and are expressed in steroid target tissues where they conjugate c  steroids despite the similarities their regulation of expression are different however the promoter region and genomic structure of only the ugt b  gene have been characterizedx to date to isolate the ugt b  gene and other novel steroid conjugating ugt b genes eight p  derived artificial chromosomes pac clones varying in length from  kb to   kb were isolated the entire ugt b  gene was isolated and characterized from the pac clone    of   kb the ugt b  and ugt b  genes are highly conserved are both composed of six exons spanning approximately  kb have identical exon sizes and have identical exon intron boundaries the homology between the two genes extend into the   flanking region and contain several conserved putative cis acting elements including pbx  c ebp ap  oct  and nf  b however transfection studies revealed differences in basal promoter activity between the two genes which correspond to regions containing non conserved potential elements the high degree of homology in the   flanking region between the two genes is lost upstream of     in ugt b  and suggests a site of genetic recombination involved in duplication of ugt b genes fluorescence in situ hybridization mapped the ugt b  gene to chromosome q      the other pac clones isolated contain exons from the ugt b  ugt b  and ugt b  genes five novel exons which are highly homologous to the exon  of known ugt b genes were also identified however these exons contain premature stop codons and represent the first recognized pseudogenes of the ugt b family the localization of highly homologous ugt b genes and pseudogenes as a cluster on chromosome q  reveals the complex nature of this gene locus and other novel homologous ugt b genes encoding steroid conjugating enzymes are likely to be found in this region of the genome
