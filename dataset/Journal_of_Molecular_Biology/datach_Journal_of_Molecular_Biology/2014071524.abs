intestinal muc mucin supramolecular topology by packing and release resting on d domain assembly
muc is the major gel forming mucin of the colon forming a protective gel barrier organized into an inner stratified and an outer loose layer the muc n terminus d d d  d domains has a dual function in building a net like structure by disulfide bonded trimerization and packing the muc polymer into an n terminal concatenated polygonal platform with the c termini extending perpendicularly by ph and calcium dependent interactions we studied the n terminal d  d domain by producing three recombinant variants with or without myc tag and gfp green fluorescent protein  and analyzed these by gel filtration electron microscopy and single particle image processing the three variants were all trimers when analyzed upon denaturing conditions but eluted as hexamers upon gel filtration under native conditions studies by electron microscopy and three dimensional maps revealed cage like structures with  and  fold symmetries the structure of the muc d domain confirms that the muc mucin forms branched net like structures this suggests that the muc mucin is stored with two n terminal concatenated ring platforms turned by    against each other implicating that every second unfolded muc net in mature mucus is turned upside down
