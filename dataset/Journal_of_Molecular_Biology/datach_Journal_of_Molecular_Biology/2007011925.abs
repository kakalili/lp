dynamics of unfolded polypeptide chains in crowded environment studied by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
proteins have evolved to fold and function within a cellular environment that is characterized by high macromolecular content the earliest step of protein folding represents intrachain contact formation of amino acid residues within an unfolded polypeptide chain it has been proposed that macromolecular crowding can have significant effects on rates and equilibria of biomolecular processes however the kinetic consequences on intrachain diffusion of polypeptides have not been tested experimentally yet here we demonstrate that selective fluorescence quenching of the oxazine fluorophore mr  by the amino acid tryptophan trp in combination with fast fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs can be used to monitor end to end contact formation rates of unfolded polypeptide chains mr  and trp were incorporated at the terminal ends of polypeptides consisting of repetitive units of glycine g and serine s residues end to end contact formation and dissociation result in  off  and  on  switching of mr  fluorescence and underlying kinetics can be revealed in fcs experiments with nanosecond time resolution we revisit previous experimental studies concerning the dependence of end to end contact formation rates on polypeptide chain length showing that kinetics can be described by gaussian chain theory we further investigate effects of solvent viscosity and temperature on contact formation rates demonstrating that intrachain diffusion represents a purely diffusive entropy controlled process finally we study the influence of macromolecular crowding on polypeptide chain dynamics the data presented demonstrate that intrachain diffusion is fast in spite of hindered diffusion caused by repulsive interactions with macromolecules findings can be explained by effects of excluded volume reducing chain entropy and therefore accelerating the loop search process our results suggest that within a cellular environment the early formation of structural elements in unfolded proteins can still proceed quite efficiently in spite of hindered diffusion caused by high macromolecular content
