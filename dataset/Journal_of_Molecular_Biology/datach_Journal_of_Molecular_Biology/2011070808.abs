dissecting a bimolecular process of mgatp   binding to the chaperonin groel
although allosteric transitions of groel by mgatp   have been widely studied the initial bimolecular step of mgatp   binding to groel remains unclear here we studied the equilibrium and kinetics of mgatp   binding to a variant of groel in which tyr  was replaced by tryptophan via isothermal titration calorimetry itc and stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy in the absence of k at     c the allosteric transitions and the subsequent atp hydrolysis by groel are halted and hence the stopped flow fluorescence kinetics induced by rapid mixing of mgatp   and the groel variant solely reflected mgatp   binding which was well represented by bimolecular noncooperative binding with a binding rate constant kon of      m   s   and a dissociation rate constant koff of    s   yielding a binding constant kb  kon koff  of      m   we also successfully performed itc to measure binding isotherms of mgatp   to groel and obtained a kb of      m   and a binding stoichiometric number of   kb was thus in good agreement with that obtained by stopped flow fluorescence in the presence of     mm kcl the fluorescence kinetics consisted of three to four phases the first fluorescence increasing phase followed by one or two exponential fluorescence decreasing phases and the final slow fluorescence increasing phase  and comparison of the kinetics in the absence and presence of k clearly demonstrated that the first fluorescence increasing phase corresponds to bimolecular mgatp   binding to groel the temperature dependence of the kinetics indicated that mgatp   binding to groel was activation controlled with an activation enthalpy as large as     kcal mol
