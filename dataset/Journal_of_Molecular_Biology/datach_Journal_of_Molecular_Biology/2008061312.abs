hinge stiffness is a barrier to rna folding
cation mediated rna folding from extended to compact biologically active conformations relies on a temporal balance of forces the mg  mediated folding of the tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme is characterized by rapid nonspecific collapse followed by tertiary contact induced compaction this article focuses on an autonomously folding portion of the tetrahymena ribozyme its p  p domain in order to probe one facet of the rapid collapse chain flexibility the time evolution of p  p folding was followed by global and local measures as a function of mg  concentration while all concentrations of mg  studied are sufficient to screen the charge on the helices the rates of compaction and tertiary contact formation diverge as the concentration of mg  increases collapse is greatly accelerated by mg  while tertiary contact formation is not these studies highlight the importance of chain stiffness to rna folding at  mm mg  a stiff hinge limits the rate of p  p folding at higher magnesium concentrations the rate limiting step shifts from hinge bending to tertiary contact formation
