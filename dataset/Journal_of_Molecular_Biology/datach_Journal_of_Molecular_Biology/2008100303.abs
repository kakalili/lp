solution structure of the c terminal nucleoprotein  rna binding domain of the vesicular stomatitis virus phosphoprotein
beyond common features in their genome organization and replication mechanisms the evolutionary relationships among viruses of the rhabdoviridae family are difficult to decipher because of the great variability in the amino acid sequence of their proteins the phosphoprotein p of vesicular stomatitis virus vsv is an essential component of the rna transcription and replication machinery in particular it contains binding sites for the rna dependent rna polymerase and for the nucleoprotein here we devised a new method for defining boundaries of structured domains from multiple disorder prediction algorithms and we identified an autonomous folding c terminal domain in vsv p pctd  we show that like the c terminal domain of rabies virus rv p vsv pctd binds to the viral nucleocapsid nucleoprotein  rna complex  we solved the three dimensional structure of vsv pctd by nmr spectroscopy and found that the topology of its polypeptide chain resembles that of rv pctd the common part of both proteins could be superimposed with a backbone rmsd from mean atomic coordinates of     vsv pctd has a shorter n terminal helix    than rv pctd it lacks two  helices helices   and   of rv p  and the loop between strands   and   is longer than that in rv dynamical properties measured by nmr relaxation revealed the presence of fast motions below the nanosecond timescale in loop regions amino acids      and slower conformational exchange in the n and c terminal helices characterization of a longer construct indicated that pctd is preceded by a flexible linker the results presented here support a modular organization of vsv p with independent folded domains separated by flexible linkers which is conserved among different genera of rhabdoviridae and is similar to that proposed for the p proteins of the paramyxoviridae
