alternative conformations of a nucleic acid four way junction edited by j doudna
a crystal structure of a   nucleotide rna dna complex containing a four way junction was solved at    resolution the structure of the junction differs substantially from the  stacked x  conformation observed previously due to a    rotation of the branches comparison of the two conformers provides insight into the factors contributing to the flexibility of four way junctions the stacked x conformation maximizes base stacking but causes unfavorable repulsion between phosphate groups whereas the    rotated  crossed  conformation minimizes electrostatic clashes at the expense of reduced base stacking despite the large rotation of the branches both junction structures exhibit an antiparallel arrangement of the continuous strands and opposite polarity of the crossover strands
