dna polymerase  terminal protein interaction involvement of residues specifically conserved among protein primed dna polymerases
by multiple sequence alignments of dna polymerases from the eukaryotic type family b subgroup of protein primed dna polymerases we have identified five positively charged amino acids specifically conserved located n terminally to the s t lx h motif here we have studied by site directed mutagenesis the functional role of   dna polymerase residues arg  lys   lys   arg  and lys  in specific reactions dependent on a protein priming event mutations introduced at residues arg  arg  and lys  and to a lower extent lys  and lys   showed a defective protein primed initiation step analysis of the interaction with double stranded dna and terminal protein tp displayed by mutant derivatives r a k  a k  a r  a and k  a allows us to conclude that   dna polymerase residue arg  is an important dna tp ligand residue essential to form stable dna polymerase dna tp complexes while residues lys   lys  and arg  could be playing a role in establishing contacts with the tp dna template during the first step of dna replication the importance of residue lys  to make a functionally active dna polymerase tp complex is also discussed these results together with the high degree of conservation of those residues among protein primed dna polymerases strongly suggest a functional role of those amino acids in establishing the appropriate interactions with dna polymerase substrates dna and tp to successfully accomplish the first steps of tp dna replication
