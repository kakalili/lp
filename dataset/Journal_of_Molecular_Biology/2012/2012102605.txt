Excellent results regarding improved therapeutic properties have been often obtained through the conversion of a single‐chain variable fragment (scFv) into a noncovalent dimeric antibody (diabody) via peptide linker shortening. We utilized this approach to obtain a dimeric version of the human scFv 6009F, which was originally engineered to neutralize the Cn2 toxin of Centruroides noxius scorpion venom. However, some envenoming symptoms remained with diabody 6009F. Diabody 6009F was subjected to directed evolution to obtain a variant capable of eliminating envenoming symptoms. After two rounds of biopanning, diabody D4 was isolated. It exhibited a single mutation (E43G) in framework 2 of the heavy‐chain variable domain. Diabody D4 displayed an increase in Tm (thermal transition midpoint temperature) of 6.3°C compared with its dimeric precursor. The importance of the E43G mutation was tested in the context of the human scFv LR, a highly efficient antibody against Cn2, which was previously generated by our group [Riaño-Umbarila, L., Contreras-Ferrat, G., Olamendi-Portugal, T., Morelos-Juárez, C., Corzo, G., Possani, L. D. and Becerril, B. (2011). J. Biol. Chem. 286, 6143–6151]. The new variant, scFv LER, displayed an increase in Tm of 3.4°C and was capable of neutralizing 2 LD50 of Cn2 toxin with no detectable symptoms when injected into mice at a 1:1 toxin-to-antibody molar ratio. These results showed that the E43G mutation might increase the therapeutic properties of these antibody fragments. Molecular modeling and dynamics results suggest that the rearrangement of the hydrogen-bonding network near the E43G mutation could explain the improved functional stability and neutralization properties of both the diabody D4 and scFv LER.
