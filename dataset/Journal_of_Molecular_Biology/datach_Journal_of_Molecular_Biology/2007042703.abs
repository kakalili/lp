structural insight into concerted inhibition of    type aspartate kinase from corynebacterium glutamicum
aspartate kinase ak catalyzes the first step of the biosynthesis of the aspartic acid family amino acids and is regulated via feedback inhibition by end products including thr and lys to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition we determined the crystal structure of the regulatory subunit of ak from corynebacterium glutamicum at     resolution in the thr binding form the first crystal structure of the regulatory subunit of    type ak the regulatory subunit contains two act domain motifs per monomer and is arranged as a dimer two non equivalent act domains from different chains form an effector binding unit that binds a single thr molecule and the resulting two effector binding units of the dimer associate perpendicularly in a face to face manner the regulatory subunit is a monomer in the absence of thr but becomes a dimer by adding thr the dimerization is eliminated in mutant aks with changes in the thr binding region suggesting that the dimerization induced by thr binding is a key step in the inhibitory mechanism of ak from c glutamicum a putative lys binding site and the inhibitory mechanism of cgak are discussed
