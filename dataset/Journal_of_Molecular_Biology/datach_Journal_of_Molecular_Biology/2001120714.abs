dna recombination and rna cleavage activities of the flp protein roles of two histidine residues in the orientation and activation of the nucleophile for strand cleavage edited by m gottesman
using a combination of dna and hybrid dna rna substrates we have analyzed the mechanism of phosphoryl transfer by the flp site specific recombinase in three different reactions dna strand breakage and joining and two types of rna cleavage activities these reactions were then used to characterize flp variants altered at his  and his   amino acid residues that are in close proximity to two key catalytic residues arg  and tyr   these histidine residues are important for strand cutting by tyr   the active site nucleophile of flp but neither residue contributes to the type ii rna cleavage activity or to the strand joining reaction in a pre cleaved substrate strand cleavage reactions using small diffusible nucleophiles indicate that this histidine pair contributes to the correct positioning and activation of tyr  within the shared active site of flp the implications of these results are evaluated against the recently solved crystal structure of flp in association with a holliday junction
