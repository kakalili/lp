repression of the tmeff promoter by c myc
tmeff is a novel transmembrane protein containing two follistatin domains and an epidermal growth factor like motif that is mainly expressed in the prostate and brain recently we showed that expression of tmeff could inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in addition the tmeff gene is frequently hypermethylated in human tumor cells suggesting that it might be a tumor suppressor gene we cloned the   flanking region of the human tmeff gene and using a luciferase reporter assay showed that it contains a functional promoter the  kb region upstream to the tmeff transcription start site encompasses the minimal promoter required for tmeff expression sequence analysis of the tmeff promoter revealed potential binding sites for several transcription factors including sp and an e box that could be recognized by c myc an inverse correlation between tmeff and c myc expression was found in cwr  prostate xenografts reporter gene and mobility shift assays demonstrated that c myc could repress tmeff gene expression through its cognate site in light of the probable role of tmeff in inhibiting cell growth its suppression may contribute to the oncogenic properties of c myc
