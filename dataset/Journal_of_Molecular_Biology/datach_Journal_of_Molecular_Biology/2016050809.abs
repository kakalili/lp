mechanistic and structural insights into the prion disaggregase activity of hsp
hsp  is a dynamic ring translocase and hexameric aaa protein found in yeast which couples atp hydrolysis to disassembly and reactivation of proteins trapped in soluble preamyloid oligomers disordered protein aggregates and stable amyloid or prion conformers here we highlight advances in our structural understanding of hsp  and how hsp  deconstructs sup  prions although the atomic structure of hsp  hexamers remains uncertain volumetric reconstruction of hsp  hexamers in atp s adp alfx atp hydrolysis transition state mimic  and adp via small angle x ray scattering has revealed a peristaltic pumping motion upon atp hydrolysis this pumping motion likely drives directional substrate translocation across the central hsp  channel hsp  initially engages sup  prions immediately c terminal to their cross  structure directional pulling by hsp  then resolves n terminal cross  structure in a stepwise manner first hsp  fragments the prion second hsp  unfolds cross  structure third hsp  releases soluble sup  deletion of the hsp  n terminal domain yields a hypomorphic disaggregase hsp   n with an altered pumping mechanism hsp   n fragments sup  prions without unfolding cross  structure or releasing soluble sup  moreover hsp   n activity cannot be enhanced by mutations in the middle domain that potentiate disaggregase activity thus the n terminal domain is critical for the full repertoire of hsp  activities
