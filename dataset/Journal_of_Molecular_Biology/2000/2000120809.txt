The ribosome undergoes pronounced periodic conformational changes during protein synthesis. Of particular importance are those occurring around the decoding site, the region of the 16S rRNA interacting with the mRNA-(tRNA)2 complex. We have incorporated structural information from X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance into cryo-electron microscopic maps of ribosomal complexes designed to capture structural changes at the translocation step of the polypeptide elongation cycle. The A-site region of the decoding site actively participates in the translocation of the tRNA from the A to the P-site upon GTP hydrolysis by elongation factor G, shifting approximately 8Ã… toward the P-site. This implies that elongation factor G actively pushes both the decoding site and the mRNA/tRNA complex during translocation.
