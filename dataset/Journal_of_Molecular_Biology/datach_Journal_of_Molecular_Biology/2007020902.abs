infection of human immunodeficiency virus and intracellular viral tat protein exert a pro survival effect in a human microglial cell line
the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  with cd  t lymphocytes is well studied and typically results in virally induced cytolysis in contrast relatively little is known concerning the interplay between hiv  and microglia recent findings suggest that counter intuitively hiv  infection may extend the lifespan of microglia we developed a novel cell line model system to confirm and mechanistically study this phenomenon we found that transduction of a human microglial cell line with an hiv  vector results in a powerful cytoprotective effect following apoptotic challenge this effect was reproduced by ectopic expression of a single virus encoded protein tat subsequent studies showed that the pro survival effects of intracellular tat could be attributed to activation of the pi  kinase pi k akt pathway in the microglial cell line furthermore we found that expression of tat led to decreased expression of pten a negative regulator of the pi  k pathway consistent with this decreased p  activity and increased e f activity were observed based on these findings a model of possible regulatory circuits that intracellular tat and hiv  infection engage during the cytoprotective event in microglia has been suggested we propose that the expression of tat may enable hiv  infected microglia to survive throughout the course of infection leading to persistent hiv  production and infection in the central nervous system
