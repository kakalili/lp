a periodic table of coiled coil protein structures
coiled coils are protein structure domains with two or more  helices packed together via interlacing of side chains known as knob into hole packing we analysed and classified a large set of coiled coil structures using a combination of automated and manual methods this led to a systematic classification that we termed a  periodic table of coiled coils   which we have made available at http  coiledcoils chm bris ac uk ccplus search periodic table in this table coiled coil assemblies are arranged in columns with increasing numbers of  helices and in rows of increased complexity the table provides a framework for understanding possibilities in and limits on coiled coil structures and a basis for future prediction engineering and design studies
