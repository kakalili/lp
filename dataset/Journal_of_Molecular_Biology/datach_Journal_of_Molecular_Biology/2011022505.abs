the recognition specificity of the chd chromodomain with modified histone h peptides
histone tail peptides comprise the flexible portion of chromatin the substance which serves as the packaging for the eukaryotic genome according to the histone code hypothesis reader protein domains chromodomains can recognize modifications of amino acid residues within these peptides regulating the expression of genes we have performed simulations on models of chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  complexed with a variety of histone h modifications binding free energies for both the overall complexes and the individual residues within the protein and peptides were computed with molecular mechanics  generalized born surface area the simulation results agree well with experimental data and identify several chromodomain helicase dna binding protein  residues that play key roles in the interaction with each of the h modifications we identified one class of protein residues that bind to h in all of the complexes generally interacting hydrophobically  and a second class of residues that bind only to particular h modifications generally interacting electrostatically  additionally we found that modifications of h r and h t have a dominant effect on the binding affinity methylation of h k has little effect on the interaction strength when h r or h t is modified our findings with regard to the specificity shown by the latter class of protein residues in their binding affinity to certain modifications of h support the histone code hypothesis
