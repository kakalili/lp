crystal structures of the response regulator dosr from mycobacterium tuberculosis suggest a helix rearrangement mechanism for phosphorylation activation
the response regulator dosr is essential for promoting long term survival of mycobacterium tuberculosis under low oxygen conditions in a dormant state and may be responsible for latent tuberculosis in one third of the world s population here we report crystal structures of full length unphosphorylated dosr at     resolution and its c terminal dna binding domain at     resolution the full length dosr structure reveals several features never seen before in other response regulators the n terminal domain of the full length dosr structure has an unexpected     topology instead of the canonical     fold observed in other response regulators the linker region adopts a unique conformation that contains two helices forming a four helix bundle with two helices from another subunit resulting in dimer formation the c terminal domain in the full length dosr structure displays a novel location of helix    which allows gln  to interact with the catalytic asp  residue of the n terminal domain in contrast the structure of the dosr c terminal domain alone displays a remarkable unstructured conformation for helix   residues different from the well defined helical conformations in all other known structures indicating considerable flexibility within the c terminal domain our structures suggest a mode of dosr activation by phosphorylation via a helix rearrangement mechanism
