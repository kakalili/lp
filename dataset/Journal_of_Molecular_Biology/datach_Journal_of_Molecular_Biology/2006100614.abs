subcellular localization of interacting proteins by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in planta
bimolecular fluorescence complementation bifc represents one of the most advanced and powerful tools for studying and visualizing protein  protein interactions in living cells in this method putative interacting protein partners are fused to complementary non fluorescent fragments of an autofluorescent protein such as the yellow spectral variant of the green fluorescent protein interaction of the test proteins may result in reconstruction of fluorescence if the two portions of yellow spectral variant of the green fluorescent protein are brought together in such a way that they can fold properly bifc provides an assay for detection of protein  protein interactions and for the subcellular localization of the interacting protein partners to facilitate the application of bifc to plant research we designed a series of vectors for easy construction of n terminal and c terminal fusions of the target protein to the yellow spectral variant of the green fluorescent protein fragments these vectors carry constitutive expression cassettes with an expanded multi cloning site in addition these vectors facilitate the assembly of bifc expression cassettes into agrobacterium multi gene expression binary plasmids for co expression of interacting partners and additional autofluorescent proteins that may serve as internal transformation controls and markers of subcellular compartments we demonstrate the utility of these vectors for the analysis of specific protein  protein interactions in various cellular compartments including the nucleus plasmodesmata and chloroplasts of different plant species and cell types
