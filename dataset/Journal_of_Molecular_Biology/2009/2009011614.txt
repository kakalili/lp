An early step in the morphogenesis of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophage HK97 is the assembly of a precursor shell (prohead I) from 420 copies of a 384-residue subunit (gp5). Although formation of prohead I requires direct participation of gp5 residues 2–103 (Δ-domain), this domain is eliminated by viral protease prior to subsequent shell maturation and DNA packaging. The prohead I Δ-domain is thought to resemble a phage scaffolding protein, by virtue of its highly α-helical secondary structure and a tertiary fold that projects inward from the interior surface of the shell. Here, we employ factor analysis of temperature-dependent Raman spectra to characterize the thermostability of the Δ-domain secondary structure and to quantify the thermodynamic parameters of Δ-domain unfolding. The results are compared for the Δ-domain within the prohead I architecture (in situ) and for a recombinantly expressed 111-residue peptide (in vitro). We find that the α-helicity (∼70%), median melting temperature (Tm=58 °C), enthalpy (ΔHm=50±5 kcal mol−1), entropy (ΔSm=150±10 cal mol−1 K−1), and average cooperative melting unit (〈nc〉∼3.5) of the in situ Δ-domain are altered in vitro, indicating specific interdomain interactions within prohead I. Thus, the in vitro Δ-domain, despite an enhanced helical secondary structure (∼90% α-helix), exhibits diminished thermostability (Tm=40 °C; ΔHm=27±2 kcal mol−1; ΔSm=86±6 cal mol−1 K−1) and noncooperative unfolding (〈nc〉∼1) vis-à-vis the in situ Δ-domain. Temperature-dependent Raman markers of subunit side chains, particularly those of Phe and Trp residues, also confirm different local interactions for the in situ and in vitro Δ-domains. The present results clarify the key role of the gp5 Δ-domain in prohead I architecture by providing direct evidence of domain structure stabilization and interdomain interactions within the assembled shell.
