Natural products are a valuable source for novel lead structures in drug discovery, but for the majority of isolated bioactive compounds, the cellular targets are unknown. The structurally unique ansa-polyketide kendomycin (KM) was reported to exert its potent cytotoxic effects via impairment of the ubiquitin proteasome system, but the exact mode of action remained unclear. Here, we present a systematic biochemical characterization of KMâ€“proteasome interactions in vitro and in vivo, including complex structures of wild type and mutant yeast 20S proteasome with KM. Our results provide evidence for a polypharmacological mode of action for KM's cytotoxic effect on cancer cells.
