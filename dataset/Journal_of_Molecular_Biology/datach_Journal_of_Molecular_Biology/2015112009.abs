how myxobacteria cooperate
prokaryotes often reside in groups where a high degree of relatedness has allowed the evolution of cooperative behaviors however very few bacteria or archaea have made the successful transition from unicellular to obligate multicellular life a notable exception is the myxobacteria in which cells cooperate to perform group functions highlighted by fruiting body development an obligate multicellular function like all multicellular organisms myxobacteria face challenges in how to organize and maintain multicellularity these challenges include maintaining population homeostasis carrying out tissue repair and regulating the behavior of non cooperators here we describe the major cooperative behaviors that myxobacteria use motility predation and development in addition this review emphasizes recent discoveries in the social behavior of outer membrane exchange wherein kin share outer membrane contents finally we review evidence that outer membrane exchange may be involved in regulating population homeostasis thus serving as a social tool for myxobacteria to make the cyclic transitions from unicellular to multicellular states
