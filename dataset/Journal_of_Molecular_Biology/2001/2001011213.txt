Autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica require two components: an origin of replication (ORI) and centromere (CEN) DNA, both of which are necessary for extrachromosomal maintenance. To investigate this cooperation in more detail, we performed a screen for genomic sequences able to confer high frequency of transformation to a plasmid-borne ORI. Our results confirm a cooperation between ORI and CEN sequences to form an ARS, since all sequences identified in this screen displayed features of centromeric DNA and included the previously characterized CEN1-1, CEN3-1 and CEN5-1 fragments. Two new centromeric DNAs were identified as they are unique, map to different chromosomes (II and IV) and induce chromosome breakage after genomic integration. A third sequence, which is adjacent to, but distinct from the previously characterized CEN1-1 region was isolated from chromosome I. Although these CEN sequences do not share significant sequence similarities, they display a complex pattern of short repeats, including conserved blocks of 9 to 14bp and regions of dyad symmetry. Consistent with their A+T-richness and strong negative roll angle, Y.lipolytica CEN-derived sequences, but not ORIs, were capable of binding isolated Drosophila nuclear scaffolds. However, a Drosophila scaffold attachment region that functions as an ARS in other yeasts was unable to confer autonomous replication to an ORI-containing plasmid. Deletion analysis of CEN1-1 showed that the sequences responsible for the induction of chromosome breakage could be eliminated without compromising extrachromosomal maintenance. We propose that, while Y.lipolyticaCEN DNA is essential for plasmid maintenance, this function can be supplied by several sub-fragments which, together, form the active chromosomal centromere. This complex organization of Y.lipolytica centromeres is reminiscent of the regional structures described in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe or in multicellular eukaryotes.
