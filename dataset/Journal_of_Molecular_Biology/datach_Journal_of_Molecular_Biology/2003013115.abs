probing the role of a mobile loop in substrate binding and enzyme activity of human salivary amylase
mammalian amylases harbor a flexible glycine rich loop  ghgagga   which becomes ordered upon oligosaccharide binding and moves in toward the substrate in order to probe the role of this loop in catalysis a deletion mutant lacking residues          was generated kinetic studies showed that    exhibited   a reduction  gt   fold in the specific activity using starch as a substrate   a reduction in kcat for maltopentaose and maltoheptaose as substrates and   a twofold increase in km maltopentaose as substrate compared to the wild type rhsamy  more cleavage sites were observed for the mutant than for rhsamy suggesting that the mutant exhibits additional productive binding modes further insight into its role is obtained from the crystal structures of the two enzymes soaked with acarbose a transition state analog both enzymes modify acarbose upon binding through hydrolysis condensation or transglycosylation reactions electron density corresponding to six and seven fully occupied subsites in the active site of rhsamy and    respectively were observed comparison of the crystal structures showed that   the hydrophobic cover provided by the mobile loop for the subsites at the reducing end of the rhsamy complex is notably absent in the mutant   minimal changes in the protein  ligand interactions around subsites s and s   where the cleavage would occur   a well positioned water molecule in the mutant provides a hydrogen bond interaction similar to that provided by the his  in rhsamy complex   the active site bound oligosaccharides exhibit minimal conformational differences between the two enzymes collectively while the kinetic data suggest that the mobile loop may be involved in assisting the catalysis during the transition state crystallographic data suggest that the loop may play a role in the release of the product s from the active site
