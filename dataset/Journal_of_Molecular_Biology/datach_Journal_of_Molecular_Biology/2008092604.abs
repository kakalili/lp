divalent metal ion complexes of s  b in the absence and presence of pentamidine
as part of an effort to inhibit s  b structures of pentamidine pnt bound to ca  loaded and zn  ca  loaded s  b were determined by x ray crystallography at      rfree    and      rfree    resolution respectively these data were compared to x ray structures solved in the absence of pnt including ca  loaded s  b and zn  ca  loaded s  b determined here      rfree     in the presence and absence of zn  electron density corresponding to two pnt molecules per s  b subunit was mapped for both drug bound structures one pnt binding site site  was adjacent to a p  peptide binding site on s  b  zn   and the second pnt molecule was mapped to the dimer interface site   zn  and in a pocket near residues that define the zn  binding site on s  b in addition a conformational change in s  b was observed upon the addition of zn  to ca   s  b which changed the conformation and orientation of pnt bound to sites  and  of pnt  zn  ca   s  b when compared to pnt  ca   s  b that pnt can adapt to this zn  dependent conformational change was unexpected and provides a new mode for s  b inhibition by this drug these data will be useful for developing novel inhibitors of both ca  and ca  zn  bound s  b
