molecular basis for the unique deubiquitinating activity of the nf  b inhibitor a
nuclear factor  b nf  b activation in tumor necrosis factor interleukin  and toll like receptor pathways requires lys  linked nondegradative polyubiquitination a  is a specific feedback inhibitor of nf  b activation in these pathways that possesses dual ubiquitin editing functions while the n terminal domain of a  is a deubiquitinating enzyme dub for lys  linked polyubiquitinated signaling mediators such as traf and rip its c terminal domain is a ubiquitin ligase e  for lys  linked degradative polyubiquitination of the same substrates to elucidate the molecular basis for the dub activity of a  we determined its crystal structure and performed a series of biochemical and cell biological studies the structure reveals the potential catalytic mechanism of a  which may be significantly different from papain like cysteine proteases ubiquitin can be docked onto a conserved a  surface this interaction exhibits charge complementarity and no steric clash surprisingly a  does not have specificity for lys  linked polyubiquitin chains instead it effectively removes lys  linked polyubiquitin chains from traf without dissembling the chains themselves our studies suggest that a  does not act as a general dub but has the specificity for particular polyubiquitinated substrates to assure its fidelity in regulating nf  b activation in the tumor necrosis factor interleukin  and toll like receptor pathways
