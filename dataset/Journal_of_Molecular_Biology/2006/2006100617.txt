Catalysis of amino acid activation by Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase involves three allosteric states: (1) Open; (2) closed pre-transition state (PreTS); and (3) closed products (Product). The interconversions of these states entail significant domain motions driven by ligand binding. We explore the application of molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ligand-linked conformational stability changes associated with this catalytic cycle. Multiple molecular dynamics trajectories (5 ns) for 11 distinct liganded and unliganded monomer configurations show that the PreTS conformation is unstable in the absence of ATP, reverting within ∼600 ps nearly to the Open conformation. In contrast, Open and Product state trajectories were stable, even without ligands, confirming the previous suggestion that catalysis entails destabilization of the protein conformation, driven by ATP-binding energies developed as the PreTS state assembles during induced-fit. The simulations suggest novel mechanistic details associated with both induced-fit (Open-PreTS) and catalysis (PreTS-Product). Notably, Mg2+–ATP interactions are coupled to interactions between ATP and active-site lysine side-chains via mechanisms that cannot be captured under the molecular mechanics approximations, and which therefore require restraining potentials for stable simulation. Simulations of Mg2+·ATP-bound PreTS complexes with restraining potentials and with a virtual K111A mutant confirm that these coupling interactions are necessary to sustain the PreTS conformation and, in turn, provide a new model for how the PreTS conformation activates ATP for catalysis. These results emphasize the central role of the PreTS state as a high-energy intermediate structure along the catalytic pathway and suggest that Mg2+ and the KMSKS loop function cooperatively during catalysis.
