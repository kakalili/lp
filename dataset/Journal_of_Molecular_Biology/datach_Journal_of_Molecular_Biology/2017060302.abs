molecular basis for k  linked ubiquitination processes in double strand dna break repair a focus on kinetics and dynamics
cells are exposed to thousands of dna damage events on a daily basis this damage must be repaired to preserve genetic information and prevent development of disease the most deleterious damage is a double strand break dsb  which is detected and repaired by mechanisms known as non homologous end joining nhej and homologous recombination hr  which are components of the dna damage response system nhej is an error prone first line of defense whereas hr invokes error free repair and is the focus of this review the functions of the protein components of hr driven dna repair are regulated by the coordinated action of post translational modifications including lysine acetylation phosphorylation ubiquitination and sumoylation the latter two mechanisms are fundamental for recognition of dsbs and reorganizing chromatin to facilitate repair we focus on the structures and molecular mechanisms for the protein components underlying synthesis recognition and cleavage of k  linked ubiquitin chains which are abundant at damage sites and obligatory for dsb repair the forward flux of the k  linked ubiquitination cascade is driven by the combined activity of e enzyme the heterodimeric e mms ubc  and its cognate e ligases rnf and rnf   which is balanced through the binding and cleavage of chains by the deubiquitinase brcc  and the proteasome and through the binding of chains by recognition modules on repair proteins such as rap  we highlight a number of aspects regarding our current understanding for the role of kinetics and dynamics in determining the function of the enzymes and chain recognition modules that drive k  ubiquitination
