structural basis of the ph dependent assembly of a botulinum neurotoxin complex
botulinum neurotoxins bonts are among the most poisonous biological substances known they assemble with non toxic non hemagglutinin ntnha protein to form the minimally functional progenitor toxin complexes m ptc  which protects bont in the gastrointestinal tract and releases it upon entry into the circulation here we provide molecular insight into the assembly between bont a and ntnha a using small angle x ray scattering we found that the free form bont a maintains a ph independent conformation with limited domain flexibility intriguingly the free form ntnha a adopts ph dependent conformational changes due to a torsional motion of its c terminal domain once forming a complex at acidic ph they each adopt a stable conformation that is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the m ptc our results suggest that assembly of the m ptc depends on the environmental ph and that the complex form of bont a is induced by interacting with ntnha a at acidic ph
