the crystal structure of the dps from deinococcus radiodurans reveals an unusual pore profile with a non specific metal binding site
the crystal structure of recombinant dps  drb   dna protecting protein under starved conditions from the gram positive radiation resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans has been determined in its apo and iron loaded states like other members of the dps family the bacterial drdps assembles as a spherical dodecamer with an outer shell diameter of    and an interior diameter of     a total of five iron sites were located in the iron loaded structure representing the first stages of iron biomineralisation each subunit contains a mononuclear iron ferroxidase centre coordinated by residues highly conserved amongst the dps family of proteins in the structures presented a distinct iron site is observed     from the ferroxidase centre with a unique ligand configuration of mono coordination by the protein and no bridging ligand to the ferroxidase centre a non specific metallic binding site suspected to play a regulative role in iron uptake release from the cage was found in a pocket located near to the external edge of the c terminal  fold channel
