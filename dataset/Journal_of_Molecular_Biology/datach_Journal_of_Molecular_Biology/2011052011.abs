solution structure of the msin a pah  pf sid complex a mad mxd like interaction disrupted by mrg  in the rpd s sin s complex
histone deacetylation constitutes an important mechanism for silencing genes the histone deacetylase associated mammalian rpd s sin s corepressor complex plays key roles in repressing aberrant gene transcription from cryptic transcription initiation sites and in mitigating rna polymerase ii progression in intragenic regions of actively transcribed genes the sin corepressor functions as a molecular adaptor linking histone deacetylases on the one hand with the chromatin targeting subunits pf and mrg  on the other pf also functions as an adaptor by interacting with mrg  and engaging in multivalent interactions with sin targeting among other domains the two n terminal paired amphipathic helix pah domains that serve as sites of interaction with sequence specific dna binding transcription factors here we structurally and functionally evaluate the interaction between the pah domain of msin a and the sin interaction domain  sid  motif of pf and find the structural aspects to be reminiscent of the interaction between the mad mxd transcription factor and sin  pf residues within a highly conserved sequence motif immediately c terminal to sid appear not to be important for the interaction with sin pah  unexpectedly the mrg  subunit competes rather than collaborates with sin for the pf segment encompassing the two conserved motifs implying competition between two subunits for another subunit of the same chromatin modifying complex
