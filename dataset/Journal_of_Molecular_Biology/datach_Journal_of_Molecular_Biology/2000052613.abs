resolution crystal structure of the saccharomyces cerevisiae ran binding protein mog p edited by i b holland
the    resolution x ray crystal structure of ran binding protein mog p shows that it has a unique fold based on a six stranded antiparallel  sheet backed on both sides by an extensive  helix the topology of some elements of mog p secondary structure resemble a portion of nuclear transport factor  ntf  but the hydrophobic cavity and surrounding negatively charged residues that are important in the ntf rangdp interaction are not conserved in mog p in addition to binding rangtp mog p forms a   complex with rangdp and so binds ran independent of its nucleotide state mog p and ntf compete for binding to rangdp indicating that their binding sites on rangdp are sufficiently close to prevent both proteins binding simultaneously although there may be some overlap between the mog p and ntf binding sites on rangdp these sites are not identical sequence analysis of mog p homologues from schizosaccharomyces pombe human and caenorhabditis elegans in the context of the mog p crystal structure indicates the presence of a cluster of highly conserved surface residues consistent with an interaction site for ran
