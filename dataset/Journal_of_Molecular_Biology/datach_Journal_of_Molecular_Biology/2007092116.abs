a stable  helix rich intermediate is formed by a single mutation of the  sheet protein src sh  at ph
recently we have found a transient intermediate on the folding pathway of src sh  intending to investigate the structure of the transient intermediate we tested a mutant of src sh  named a g using circular dichroism fluorescence and x ray solution scattering and incidentally found that it forms a stable  helix rich intermediate ieq  different from the native  sheet based secondary structure at ph   but contains only  sheets at ph   whereas wild type sh forms only  sheets at both ph   and ph   the intermediate ieq shows a circular dichroism measured at         deg cm dmol   indicating a    helix proportion as estimated by the contin program x ray scattering gave the radius of gyration for ieq as     at ph   and     at ph   and kratky plots showed a clear peak at ph     and   indicating that ieq too is compact in these parameters ieq closely resembles the kinetically obtained intermediate ikin which we found on the folding pathway of wild type sh at ph   radius of gyration     and        deg cm dmol    indicating a    helix proportion in our previous paper refolding experiments with a g were done at ph   by stopped flow apparatus monitored by circular dichroism and compared to kinetic experiments with wild type sh at ph   the result showed an  helix rich intermediate at the same dichroism amplitude but nine times slower in formation rate a ph jump experiment from ph   to ph   on a g was also performed this showed no bursts and the rate of conformation change was almost as fast as the refolding rate of a g at ph   these kinetic experiment data would be consistent with ieq being nearly identical to the ikin which appeared on the folding pathways of both wild type sh and a g at ph
