still looking for the magic spot the crystallographically defined binding site for ppgpp on rna polymerase is unlikely to be responsible for rrna transcription regulation
identification of the rna polymerase rnap binding site for ppgpp a central regulator of bacterial transcription is crucial for understanding its mechanism of action a recent high resolution x ray structure defined a ppgpp binding site on thermus thermophilus rnap we report here effects of ppgpp on  mutant escherichia coli rnaps with substitutions for the analogous residues within      of the ppgpp binding site in the t thermophilus cocrystal none of the substitutions in e coli rnap significantly weakened its responses to ppgpp this result differs from the originally reported finding of a substitution in e coli rnap eliminating ppgpp function the e coli rnaps used in that study likely lacked stoichiometric amounts of   an rnap subunit required for responses of rnap to ppgpp in part explaining the discrepancy furthermore we found that ppgpp did not inhibit transcription initiation by t thermophilus rnap in vitro or shorten the lifetimes of promoter complexes containing t thermophilus rnap in contrast to the conclusion in the original report our results suggest that the ppgpp binding pocket identified in the cocrystal is not the one responsible for regulation of e coli ribosomal rna transcription initiation and highlight the importance of inclusion of  in bacterial rnap preparations
