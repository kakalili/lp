mutagenesis based evidence for an asymmetric configuration of the ring shaped transcription termination factor rho
transcription termination factor rho is an atp dependent ring shaped molecular motor that tracks along rna to dissociate rna  dna duplexes and transcription complexes in its path the rho hexamer contains two distinct sites for interaction with rna the primary binding site is composed of pyrimidine specific binding clefts that are located in the n terminal domains and anchor rho to transcripts at c rich rut rho utilization sites components of the secondary binding site sbs in the c terminal domains directly couple rna binding to atp hydrolysis in order to translocate rna through the rho ring published crystal structures of rna bound rho display distinct architectures   trimer of dimers  or asymmetric hexamer and sbs  rna interaction networks that suggested conflicting models of rna  handoff  or  escort  by the rho subunits to probe the mechanism of mechanochemical transduction in rho we have mutated into alanines or glycines the residues that make sbs contacts with rna in the  trimer of dimers  structure supporting the  handoff  model we find that the resulting single point mutants have similar rna binding affinities but exhibit significantly different atp hydrolysis transcription termination and rna  dna unwinding activities that are more compatible with the asymmetric rho structure than with the  trimer of dimers  structure and the resulting  handoff  model we discuss our findings in connection with specific features of the asymmetric rho structure yet argue that a simple rna  escort  model is insufficient to account for all experimental evidence
