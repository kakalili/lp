crystal structure of a symmetric football shaped groel groes atp  complex determined at    reveals rearrangement between two groel rings
the chaperonin groel is an essential chaperone that assists in protein folding with the aid of groes and atp groel forms a double ring structure and both rings can bind groes in the presence of atp recent progress on the groel mechanism has revealed the importance of a symmetric   groel groes complex the  football  shaped complex as a critical intermediate during the functional groel cycle we determined the crystal structure of the football groel groes atp  complex from escherichia coli at    using a groel mutant that is extremely defective in atp hydrolysis the overall structure of the football complex resembled the groes bound groel ring of the asymmetric   groel groes complex the  bullet  complex  however the two groes bound groel rings form a modified interface by an   rotation about the  fold axis as a result the inter ring contacts between the two groel rings in the football complex differed from those in the bullet complex the differences provide a structural basis for the apparently impaired inter ring negative cooperativity observed in several biochemical analyses
