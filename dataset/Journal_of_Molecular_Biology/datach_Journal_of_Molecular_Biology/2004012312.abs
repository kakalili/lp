effect of different anti a  antibodies on a  fibrillogenesis as assessed by atomic force microscopy
extensive data suggest that the conversion of the amyloid   a  peptide from soluble to insoluble forms is a key factor in the pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease ad  in recent years atomic force microscopy afm has provided useful insights into the physicochemical processes involving a  morphology and it can now be used to explore factors that either inhibit or promote fibrillogenesis we used ex situ afm to explore the impact of anti a  antibodies directed against different domains of a  on fibril formation for the afm studies two monoclonal antibodies m d and m    were incubated in solution with a     with a molar ratio of    antibody to a  over several days fibril formation was analyzed quantitatively by determining the number of fibrils per  m and by aggregate size analysis m d  which is directed against an n terminal domain of a  amino acid residues    slowed down fibril formation however m    which is directed against the central domain of a  amino acid residues     appeared to completely prevent the formation of fibrils over the course of the experiment inhibition of fibril formation by both antibodies was also confirmed by thioflavin t tht fluorescence experiments carried out with a     incubated for five days however unlike afm results tht did not differentiate between the samples incubated with m d versus m    these results indicate that afm can be not only reliably used to study the effect of different molecules on a  aggregation but that it can provide additional information such as the role of epitope specificity of antibodies as potential inhibitors of fibril formation
