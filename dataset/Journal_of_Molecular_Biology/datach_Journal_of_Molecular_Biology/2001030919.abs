a multipartite interaction between salmonella transcription factor   and its anti sigma factor flgm implications for   holoenzyme destabilization through stepwise binding edited by r ebright
transcription of the late class  flagellar promoters in salmonella typhimurium is dependent upon the flagellar specific sigma factor    encoded by the flia gene    dependent transcription is inhibited by an anti sigma factor flgm through a direct interaction flgm can bind both to free   to prevent it from forming a complex with core rna polymerase and to   holoenzyme to destabilize the complex a collection of flia mutants defective for negative regulation by flgm flia  mutants were isolated this collection included  substitution mutations that conferred insensitivity to flgm in vivo the distribution of mutations defined three potential flgm binding domains in conserved sigma factor regions     and  of    a subset of mutants from each region was assayed for flgm binding and transcriptional activity in vitro the results strongly support a multipartite interaction between   and flgm region  mutations but not region   or   mutations interfered with the ability of flgm to destabilize   from core rna polymerase we present refined models for flgm inhibition of    and for flgm destabilization of   holoenzyme
