solution structure and phospholipid interactions of the isolated voltage sensor domain from kvap
voltage sensor domains vsds are specialized transmembrane segments that confer voltage sensitivity to many proteins such as ion channels and enzymes the activities of these domains are highly dependent on both the chemical properties and the physical properties of the surrounding membrane environment to learn about vsd  lipid interactions we used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structure and phospholipid interface of the vsd from the voltage dependent k channel kvap prokaryotic kv from aeropyrum pernix  the solution structure of the kvap vsd solubilized within phospholipid micelles is similar to a previously determined crystal structure solubilized by a nonionic detergent and complexed with an antibody fragment the differences observed include a previously unidentified short amphipathic  helix that precedes the first transmembrane helix and a subtle rigid body repositioning of the s  s voltage sensor paddle using  n relaxation experiments we show that much of the vsd including the pronounced kink in s and the s  s paddle is relatively rigid on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale in contrast the kink in s is mobile on the microsecond to millisecond timescale and may act as a hinge in the movement of the paddle during channel gating we characterized the vsd  phospholipid micelle interactions using nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy and showed that the micelle uniformly coats the kvap vsd and approximates the chemical environment of a phospholipid bilayer using paramagnetically labeled phospholipids we show that bilayer forming lipids interact with the s and s helices more strongly than with s and s
