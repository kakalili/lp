smar forms a ternary complex with p  mdm and negatively regulates p  mediated transcription
the intra cellular level of tumor suppressor protein p  is tightly controlled by an autoregulatory feedback loop between the protein and its negative regulator mdm  the role of mdm in down regulating the p  response in unstressed conditions and in the post stress recovery phase is well documented however interplay between the n terminal phosphorylations and c terminal acetylations of p  in this context remains unclear here we show that an mar binding protein smar interacts with mdm and the ser  phosphorylated form of p  forming a ternary complex in the post stress recovery phase this triple complex formation between p  mdm and smar results in recruitment of hdac to deacetylate p  the deacetylated p  binds poorly to the target promoter p   which results in switching off the p  response essential for re entry into the cell cycle interestingly the knock down of smar using sirna leads to a prolonged cell cycle arrest in the post stress recovery phase due to ablation of p   mdm  hdac interaction thus the results presented here for the first time highlight the role of smar in masking the active phosphorylation site of p  enabling the deacetylation of p  by hdac  mdm complex thereby regulating the p  transcriptional response during stress rescue
