torque  speed relationship of the na driven flagellar motor of vibrio alginolyticus
the torque  speed relationship of the na driven flagellar motor of vibrio alginolyticus was investigated the rotation rate of the motor was measured by following the position of a bead attached to a flagellar filament using optical nanometry in the presence of  mm nacl the generated torque was relatively constant     pnnm at lower speeds speeds up to    hz and then decreased steeply similar to the h driven flagellar motor of escherichia coli when the external nacl concentration was varied the generated torque of the flagellar motor was changed over a wide range of speeds this result could be reproduced using a simple kinetic model which takes into consideration the association and dissociation of na onto the motor these results imply that for a complete understanding of the mechanism of flagellar rotation it is essential to consider both the electrochemical gradient and the absolute concentration of the coupling ion
