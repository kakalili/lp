novel basic region helix  loop  helix transcription factor anbh  of aspergillus nidulans counteracts the ccaat binding complex ancf in the promoter of a penicillin biosynthesis gene
cis acting ccaat elements are found frequently in eukaryotic promoter regions many of the genes containing such elements in their promoters are regulated by a conserved multimeric ccaat binding complex in the fungus emericella aspergillus nidulans this complex was designated ancf a nidulans ccaat binding factor  ancf regulates several genes including the penicillin biosynthesis genes ipna and aata since it is estimated that the ccaat binding complex regulates more than   genes an important question concerns the regulation mechanism that allows so many genes to be regulated by a single complex in a gene specific manner one of the answers to this question appears to lie in the interaction of ancf with other transcription factors here a novel transcription factor designated anbh was isolated the corresponding anbh gene was cloned and found to be located on chromosome iv the deduced anbh protein belongs to the family of basic region helix  loop  helix bhlh transcription factors anbh binds in vitro as a homodimer to an not previously described asymmetric e box within the aata promoter that overlaps with the ancf binding site this is the first report demonstrating that the ccaat binding complex and a bhlh transcription factor bind to overlapping sites since deletion of anbh appears to be lethal the anbh gene was replaced by a regulatable alcap anbh gene fusion the analysis of aatap lacz expression in such a strain indicated that anbh acts as a repressor of aata gene expression and therefore counteracts the positive action of ancf
