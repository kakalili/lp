recent advances in deciphering the structure and molecular mechanism of the aaa atpase n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor nsf
n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor nsf  first discovered in    is a key factor for eukaryotic trafficking including protein and hormone secretion and neurotransmitter release it is a member of the aaa family atpases associated with diverse cellular activities  nsf disassembles soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare complexes in conjunction with soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein snap  structural studies of nsf and its complex with snares and snaps known as  s supercomplex started about  years ago crystal structures of individual n and d domains of nsf and low resolution electron microscopy structures of full length nsf and  s supercomplex have been reported over the years nevertheless the molecular architecture of the  s supercomplex and the molecular mechanism of nsf mediated snare complex disassembly remained unclear until recently here we review recent atomic resolution or near atomic resolution structures of nsf and of the  s supercomplex as well as recent insights into the molecular mechanism and energy requirements of nsf we also compare nsf with other known aaa family members
