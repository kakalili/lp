dna polymerase switching on homotrimeric pcna at the replication fork of the euryarchaea pyrococcus abyssi
dna replication in archaea as in other organisms involves large protein complexes called replisomes in the euryarchaeota subdomain only two putative replicases have been identified and their roles in leading and lagging strand dna synthesis are still poorly understood in this study we focused on the coupling of proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna loading mechanisms with dna polymerase function in the euryarchaea pyrococcus abyssi pcna spontaneously loaded onto primed dna and replication factor c dramatically increased this loading surprisingly the family b dna polymerase pol b also increased pcna loading probably by stabilizing the clamp on primed dna via an essential motif in contrast on an rna primed dna template the pcna pol b complex was destabilized in the presence of dntps allowing the family d dna polymerase pol d to perform rna primed dna synthesis then pol d is displaced by pol b to perform processive dna synthesis at least on the leading strand
