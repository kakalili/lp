dynamics of cholesterol exchange in the oxysterol binding protein family
the oxysterol binding protein related protein orp family is essential to sterol transfer and sterol dependent signal transduction in eukaryotes the crystal structure of one orp family member yeast osh  is known in apo and sterol bound states in the bound state a  residue n terminal lid region covers the opening of the cholesterol binding tunnel preventing cholesterol exchange equilibrium and steered molecular dynamics md simulations of osh were carried out to characterize the mechanism of cholesterol exchange while most of the structural core was stable during the simulations the lid was partly opened in the apo equilibrium md simulation helix   which undergoes the largest conformational change in the crystallized bound and apo states is conformationally coupled to the opening of the lid the movement of   helps create a docking site for donor or acceptor membranes in the open state in the steered md simulations of cholesterol dissociation we observed complete opening of the lid covering the cholesterol binding tunnel cholesterol was found to exit the binding pocket in a step wise process involving i the breaking of water mediated hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts within the binding pocket  ii opening of the lid covering the binding pocket and iii breakage of transient cholesterol contacts with the rim of the pocket and hydrophobic residues on the interior face of the lid
