hsp  targets multiple intermediates on the amyloid pathway and suppresses the seeding capacity of a  fibrils and protofibrils
the heat shock protein hsp  has been reported to possess the ability to modulate protein aggregation and toxicity and to  catalyze  the disaggregation and recovery of protein aggregates including amyloid fibrils in yeast escherichia coli mammalian cell cultures and animal models of huntington s disease and parkinson s disease to provide mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanisms by which hsp  modulates aggregation and fibrillogenesis the effect of hsp  on the fibrillogenesis of amyloid beta a  was investigated by characterizing its ability to interfere with oligomerization and fibrillogenesis of different species along the amyloid formation pathway of a  to probe the disaggregation activity of hsp   its ability to dissociate preformed protofibrillar and fibrillar aggregates of a  was assessed in the presence and in the absence of atp our results show that hsp  inhibits the fibrillization of monomeric and protofibrillar forms of a  in a concentration dependent but atp independent manner inhibition of a  fibrillization by hsp  is observable up to hsp  a  stoichiometric ratios of     suggesting a preferential interaction of hsp  with aggregation intermediates e g  oligomers protofibrils small fibrils on the pathway of a  amyloid formation this hypothesis is consistent with our observations that hsp   i interacts with a  protofibrils  ii inhibits conversion of protofibrils into amyloid fibrils  iii arrests fibril elongation and reassembly and iv abolishes the capacity of protofibrils and sonicated fibrils to seed the fibrillization of monomeric a  together these findings suggest that the strong inhibition of a  fibrillization by hsp  is mediated by its ability to act at different stages and target multiple intermediates on the pathway to amyloid formation
