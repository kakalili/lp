genetic dissection of the consensus sequence for the class  and class  flagellar promoters
computational searches for dna binding sites often utilize consensus sequences these search models make assumptions that the frequency of a base pair in an alignment relates to the base pair s importance in binding and presume that base pairs contribute independently to the overall interaction with the dna binding protein these two assumptions have generally been found to be accurate for dna binding sites however these assumptions are often not satisfied for promoters which are involved in additional steps in transcription initiation after rna polymerase has bound to the dna to test these assumptions for the flagellar regulatory hierarchy class  and class  flagellar promoters were randomly mutagenized in salmonella important positions were then saturated for mutagenesis and compared to scores calculated from the consensus sequence double mutants were constructed to determine how mutations combined for each promoter type mutations in the binding site for flhd c  the activator of class  promoters better satisfied the assumptions for the binding model than did mutations in the class  promoter which is recognized by the   transcription factor these in vivo results indicate that the activator sites within flagellar promoters can be modeled using simple assumptions but that the dna sequences recognized by the flagellar sigma factor require more complex models
