Previous peptide dissection and kinetic experiments have indicated that in vitro folding of ubiquitin may proceed via transient species in which native-like structure has been acquired in the first 45 residues. A peptide fragment, UQ(1-51), encompassing residues 1 to 51 of ubiquitin was produced in order to test whether this portion has propensity for independent self-assembly. Surprisingly, the construct formed a folded symmetrical dimer that was stabilised by 0.8 M sodium sulphate at 298 K (the S state). The solution structure of the UQ(1-51) dimer was determined by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. Each subunit of UQ(1-51) consists of an N-terminal β-hairpin followed by an α-helix and a final β-strand, with orientations similar to intact ubiquitin. The dimer is formed by the third β-strand of one subunit interleaving between the hairpin and third strand of the other to give a six-stranded β-sheet, with the two α-helices sitting on top. The helix-helix and strand portions of the dimer interface also mimic related features in the structure of ubiquitin. The structural specificity of the UQ(1-51) peptide is tuneable: as the concentration of sodium sulphate is decreased, near-native alternative conformations are populated in slow chemical exchange. Magnetization transfer experiments were performed to characterize the various species present in 0.35 M sodium sulphate, namely the S state and two minor forms. Chemical shift differences suggest that one minor form is very similar to the S state, while the other experiences a significant conformational change in the third strand. A segmental rearrangement of the third strand in one subunit of the S state would render the dimer asymmetric, accounting for most of our results. Similar small-scale transitions in proteins are often invoked to explain solvent exchange at backbone amide proton sites that have an intermediate level of protection.
