effects of hepatocyte nuclear factor   on the regulation of the hepatic acute phase response
following injury a large number of hepatic acute phase genes are rapidly modulated at the transcriptional level to restore metabolic homeostasis and limit tissue damage hepatocyte nuclear factor   hnf   is a liver enriched transcription factor that controls embryonic liver development and regulates tissue specific gene expression in adult liver cells many genes encoding acute phase proteins contain hnf   binding sites in their promoter regions and are transcriptionally regulated by hnf   utilizing a cytokine induced acute phase response in hepg cells we investigated the role of hnf   in regulating the transcription of three hnf   sensitive genes   antitrypsin   at  transthyretin ttr  and apolipoprotein b apob after injury the transcriptional behavior of all three genes depends in part on the intracellular concentrations of hnf   however the unique mrna expression patterns of   at ttr and apob in response to cytokine treatment were abrogated in hepg cells with dramatically reduced hnf   protein concentrations the mechanism by which hnf   mediates this injury response is through site specific alterations in hnf   binding abilities and transactivation potentials cytokine treatment phosphorylates hnf   which directly affects hnf   activity our results demonstrate that hnf   is a crucial mediator in the regulation of   at ttr and apob gene expression before and after injury providing evidence of a novel role for hnf   in the control of the liver s acute phase response
