systematic detection of internal symmetry in proteins using ce symm
symmetry is an important feature of protein tertiary and quaternary structures that has been associated with protein folding function evolution and stability its emergence and ensuing prevalence has been attributed to gene duplications fusion events and subsequent evolutionary drift in sequence this process maintains structural similarity and is further supported by this study to further investigate the question of how internal symmetry evolved how symmetry and function are related and the overall frequency of internal symmetry we developed an algorithm ce symm to detect pseudo symmetry within the tertiary structure of protein chains using a large manually curated benchmark of   protein domains we show that ce symm performs significantly better than previous approaches we use ce symm to build a census of symmetry among domain superfamilies in scop and note that   of all superfamilies are pseudo symmetric our results indicate that more domains are pseudo symmetric than previously estimated we establish a number of recurring types of symmetry  function relationships and describe several characteristic cases in detail with the use of the enzyme commission classification symmetry was found to be enriched in some enzyme classes but depleted in others ce symm thus provides a methodology for a more complete and detailed study of the role of symmetry in tertiary protein structure availability ce symm can be run from the web at http  source rcsb org jfatcatserver symmetry jsp source code and software binaries are also available under the gnu lesser general public license version   at https  github com rcsb symmetry an interactive census of domains identified as symmetric by ce symm is available from http  source rcsb org jfatcatserver scopresults jsp
