thermostabilisation of an agonist bound conformation of the human adenosine a a receptor
the adenosine a a receptor a ar is a g protein coupled receptor that plays a key role in transmembrane signalling mediated by the agonist adenosine the structure of a ar was determined recently in an antagonist bound conformation which was facilitated by the t lysozyme fusion in cytoplasmic loop  and the considerable stabilisation conferred on the receptor by the bound inverse agonist zm    unfortunately the natural agonist adenosine does not sufficiently stabilise the receptor for the formation of diffraction quality crystals as a first step towards determining the structure of a ar bound to an agonist the receptor was thermostabilised by systematic mutagenesis in the presence of the bound agonist  h  n ethylcarboxamidoadenosine neca  four thermostabilising mutations were identified that when combined to give mutant a ar gl  conferred a greater than   fold decrease in its rate of unfolding compared to the wild type receptor pharmacological analysis suggested that a ar gl  is stabilised in an agonist bound conformation because antagonists bind with up to   fold decreased affinity none of the thermostabilising mutations are in the zm    binding pocket suggesting that the mutations affect ligand binding by altering the conformation of the receptor rather than through direct interactions with ligands a ar gl  shows considerable stability in short chain detergents which has allowed its purification and crystallisation
