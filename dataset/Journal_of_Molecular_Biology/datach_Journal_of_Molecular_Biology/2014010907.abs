mechanism of assembly of the non covalent spectrin tetramerization domain from intrinsically disordered partners
interdomain interactions of spectrin are critical for maintenance of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton in particular   head to head  dimerization occurs when the intrinsically disordered c terminal tail of  spectrin binds the n terminal tail of  spectrin folding to form the  spectrin tetramer domain   this non covalent three helix bundle domain is homologous in structure and sequence to previously studied spectrin domains we find that this tetramer domain is surprisingly kinetically stable using a protein engineering  value analysis to probe the mechanism of formation of this tetramer domain we infer that the domain folds by the docking of the intrinsically disordered  spectrin tail onto the more structured  spectrin tail
