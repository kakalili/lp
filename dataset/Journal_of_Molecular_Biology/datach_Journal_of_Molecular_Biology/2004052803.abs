the n terminal prion domain of ure p converts from an unfolded to a thermally resistant conformation upon filament formation
according to the  amyloid backbone  model of ure p prionogenesis the n terminal domain of ure p polymerizes to form an amyloid filament backbone surrounded by the c terminal domains the latter domains retain their native glutathione s transferase gst like fold but are sterically inactivated from their regulatory role in nitrogen catabolism we have tested this model by differential scanning calorimetry of soluble and filamentous ure p and of soluble c terminal domains combined with electron microscopy as predicted the c terminal domains respond to thermal perturbation identically in all three states exhibiting a single endotherm at   c in contrast no thermal signal was associated with the n terminal domains in the soluble state of ure p because they are unfolded in the filamentous state because their robust amyloid conformation resists heating to    c
