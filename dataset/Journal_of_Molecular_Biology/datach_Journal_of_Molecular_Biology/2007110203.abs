exploring the capacity of minimalist protein interfaces interface energetics and affinity maturation to picomolar kd of a single domain antibody with a flat paratope
a major architectural class in engineered binding proteins   antibody mimics   involves the presentation of recognition loops off a single domain scaffold this class of binding proteins both natural and synthetic has a strong tendency to bind a preformed cleft using a convex binding interface paratope  to explore their capacity to produce high affinity interfaces with diverse shape and topography we examined the interface energetics and explored the affinity limit achievable with a flat paratope we chose a minimalist paratope limited to two loops found in a natural camelid heavy chain antibody vhh that binds to ribonuclease a ala scanning of the vhh revealed only three  hot spot  side chains and additional four residues important for supporting backbone mediated interactions the small number of critical residues suggested that this is not an optimized paratope using selection from synthetic combinatorial libraries we enhanced its affinity by gt   fold resulting in variants with kd as low as   pm with no detectable loss of binding specificity high resolution crystal structures revealed that the mutations induced only subtle structural changes but extended the network of interactions this resulted in an expanded hot spot region including four additional residues located at the periphery of the paratope with a concomitant loss of the so called  o ring  arrangement of energetically inert residues these results suggest that this class of simple single domain scaffolds is capable of generating high performance binding interfaces with diverse shape more generally they suggest that highly functional interfaces can be designed without closely mimicking natural interfaces
