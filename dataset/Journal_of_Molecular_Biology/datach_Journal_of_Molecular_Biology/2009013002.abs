severe myopathy mutations modify the nanomechanics of desmin intermediate filaments
mutations in the intermediate filament if protein desmin cause severe forms of myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of myofibrils in contrast to prior expectations we showed that some of the known disease causing mutations such as desa  p desq  p and desd  y are assembly competent and do allow formation of bona fide ifs in vitro and in vivo we also previously demonstrated that atomic force microscopy can be employed to measure the tensile properties of single desmin ifs using the same approach on filaments formed by the aforementioned mutant desmins we now observed two different nanomechanical behaviors desa  p exhibited tensile properties similar to that of wild type desmin ifs whereas desq  p and desd  y exhibited local variations in their tensile properties along the filament length based on these findings we hypothesize that desq  p and desd  y may cause muscle disease by altering the specific biophysical properties of the desmin filaments thereby compromising both its mechanosensing and mechanotransduction ability
