optimization of the g  domain by computational design and by in vitro evolution structural and energetic basis of stabilization
computational design and in vitro evolution are major strategies for stabilizing proteins for the four critical positions       and  of the b domain of the streptococcal protein g g   they identified the same optimal residues at positions  and   but not at  and   here we analyzed the energetic contributions of the residues from these two approaches by single and double mutant analyses and determined crystal structures for a variant from the calculation i  l  e  k  and from the selection i  i  e  f   the structural analysis explains the observed differences in stabilization residues     and  line an invagination which results from a packing defect between the helix and the  sheet of g   in all stabilized variants residues with larger side chains occur at these positions and packing is improved in the selected variant packing is better optimized than in the computed variant such differences in side chain packing strongly affect stability but are difficult to evaluate by computation
