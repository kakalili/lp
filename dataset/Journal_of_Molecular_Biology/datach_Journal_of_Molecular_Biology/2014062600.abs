elucidation of the specific function of the conserved threonine triad responsible for human l asparaginase autocleavage and substrate hydrolysis
our long term goal is the design of a human l asparaginase hasnase  variant suitable for use in cancer therapy without the immunogenicity problems associated with the currently used bacterial enzymes asparaginases catalyze the hydrolysis of the amino acid asparagine to aspartate and ammonia the key property allowing for the depletion of blood asparagine by bacterial asparaginases is their low micromolar km value in contrast human enzymes have a millimolar km for asparagine toward the goal of engineering an hasnase variant with micromolar km we conducted a structure function analysis of the conserved catalytic threonine triad of this human enzyme as a member of the n terminal nucleophile family to become enzymatically active hasnase must undergo autocleavage between residues gly  and thr   to determine the individual contribution of each of the three conserved active site threonines threonine triad thr   thr   thr   for the enzyme activating autocleavage and asparaginase reactions we prepared the t  s t  v and t  a v mutants these mutants were tested for their ability to cleave and to catalyze asparagine hydrolysis in addition to being examined structurally we also elucidated the first n terminal nucleophile plant type asparaginase structure in the covalent intermediate state our studies indicate that while not all triad threonines are required for the cleavage reaction all are essential for the asparaginase activity the increased understanding of hasnase function resulting from these studies reveals the key regions that govern cleavage and the asparaginase reaction which may inform the design of variants that attain a low km for asparagine
