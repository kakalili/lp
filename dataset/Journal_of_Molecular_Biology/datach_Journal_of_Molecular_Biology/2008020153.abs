refolding sds denatured proteins by the addition of amphipathic cosolvents
sodium dodecyl sulfate sds is a highly effective and widely used protein denaturant we show that certain amphipathic cosolvents such as  methyl   pentanediol mpd can protect proteins from sds denaturation and in several cases can refold proteins from the sds denatured state this cosolvent effect is observed with integral membrane proteins and soluble proteins from either the  helical or the  sheet structural classes the sds mpd system can be used to study processes involving native protein states and we demonstrate the reversible thermal denaturation of the outer membrane protein pagp in an sds mpd buffer mpd and related cosolvents can modulate the denaturing properties of sds and we describe a simple and effective method to recover refolded active protein from the sds denatured state
