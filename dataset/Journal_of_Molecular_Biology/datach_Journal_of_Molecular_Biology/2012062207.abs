molecular basis for the anchoring of proto oncoprotein nup  to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex
the cytoplasmic filament nucleoporins of the nuclear pore complex npc are critically involved in nuclear export and remodeling of mrna ribonucleoprotein particles and are associated with various human malignancies here we report the crystal structure of the nup  c terminal autoproteolytic domain frequently missing from leukemogenic forms of the protein in complex with the n terminal domain of nup  and the c terminal tail fragment of nup   the nup   propeller serves as a noncooperative binding platform for both binding partners interaction of nup  with nup  occurs through a reciprocal exchange of loop structures strikingly the same nup  groove promiscuously interacts with nup  and nup  in a mutually excusive fashion simultaneous disruption of both nup  interactions in yeast causes severe defects in mrna export while the severing of a single interaction is tolerated thus the cytoplasmic filament network of the npc is robust consistent with its essential function in nucleocytoplasmic transport
