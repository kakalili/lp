a cruciform structural transition provides a molecular switch for chromosome structure and dynamics edited by i tinoco
the interaction between specific sites along a dna molecule is often crucial for the regulation of genetic processes however mechanisms regulating the interaction of specific sites are unknown we have used atomic force microscopy to demonstrate that the structural transition between cruciform conformations can act as a molecular switch to facilitate or prevent communication between distant regions in dna cruciform structures exist in vivo and they are critically involved in the initiation of replication and the regulation of gene expression in different organisms therefore structural transitions of the cruciform may play a key role in these processes
