human immunodeficiency virus type  induces lytic cycle replication of kaposi s sarcoma associated herpesvirus role of ras c raf mek   pi k akt and nf  b signaling pathways
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  infection significantly increases the risk and development of kaposi s sarcoma ks in individuals infected with ks associated herpesvirus kshv  previously we reported that hiv  tat protein induced kshv replication by modulating the janus kinase signal transducers and activators of transcription signaling pathway here we further investigated the possible signaling pathways involved in hiv  induced reactivation of kshv we showed that hiv  infection of primary effusion lymphoma cell lines triggered the reactivation of kshv as demonstrated by the expression of kshv replication and transcription activator the early viral lytic protein vil  and orf  and the production of progeny virions by utilizing microarray gene expression analyses transfecting a series of dominant negative mutants and adding pharmacologic inhibitors we identified a group of diverse cellular signaling proteins and found that hiv  infection of bcbl  cells activated phosphatidylinositol  kinase akt also called protein kinase b pkb pathway and inactivated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten and glycogen synthase kinase   which partially modulated hiv  induced kshv reactivation furthermore activation of ras c raf mapk erk kinase  pathway contributed to hiv  induced kshv replication finally we discovered that hiv  infection activated nuclear factor  b signaling which exhibits an inhibitory effect on kshv reactivation in bcbl  cells collectively our data demonstrated that hiv  infection stimulated these cell signaling pathways that in turn contributed to kshv reactivation which may be of therapeutic value in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related ks patients
