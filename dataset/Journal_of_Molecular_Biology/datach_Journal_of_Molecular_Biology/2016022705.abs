the kink turn a key architectural element in rna structure
kink turns k turns are widespread structural elements that introduce an axial bend into duplex rna with an included angle of    these mediate key tertiary interactions and bind specific proteins including members of the l ae family the standard k turn comprises a three nucleotide bulge followed by g a and a g pairs the rna kinks by an association of the two minor grooves stabilized by the formation of a number of key cross strand hydrogen bonds mostly involving the adenine bases of the g a and a g pairs the k turns may be divided into two conformational classes depending on the receptor for one of these hydrogen bonds k turns become folded by one of three different processes some but not all k turns become folded in the presence of metal ions whether or not a given k turn is folded under these conditions is determined by its sequence we present a set of rules for the prediction of folding properties and the structure adopted on local sequence
