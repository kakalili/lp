thermodynamics of peptide binding to the transporter associated with antigen processing tap
the atp binding cassette abc transporter tap plays an essential role in antigen processing and immune response to infected or malignant cells tap translocates proteasomal degradation products from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum where mhc class i molecules are loaded with these peptides kinetically stable peptide  mhc complexes are transported to the cell surface for inspection by cytotoxic t lymphocytes the transport cycle of tap is initiated by peptide binding which is responsible for peptide selection and for stimulation of atp hydrolysis and subsequent translocation here we have analysed the driving forces for the formation of the peptide  tap complex by kinetic and thermodynamic methods first the apparent peptide association and dissociation rates were determined at various temperatures strikingly very high activation energies for apparent association eaass  kjmol   and dissociation eadiss  kjmol   of the peptide  tap complex were found next the temperature dependence of the peptide affinity constants was investigated by equilibrium binding assays along with calculations of free enthalpy  g enthalpy  h and entropy  s a large positive change in heat capacity was resolved  c   kjmol  k    indicating a fundamental structural reorganization of the tap complex upon peptide binding the inspection of the conformational entropy reveals that approximately one fourth of all tap residues is rearranged these thermodynamic studies indicate that at physiological temperature peptide binding is endothermic and driven by entropy
