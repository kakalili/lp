human platelet  lipoxygenase new findings about its activity membrane binding and low resolution structure
human platelet  lipoxygenase hp  lox   residues iron nonheme cofactor and its major metabolite  s hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid have been implicated in cardiovascular and renal diseases many types of cancer and inflammatory responses however drug development is slow due to a lack of structural information the major hurdle in obtaining a high resolution x ray structure is growing crystals a process that requires the preparation of highly homogenous reproducible and stable protein samples to understand the properties of hp  lox we have expressed and studied the behavior function and low resolution structure of the hp  lox his tagged recombinant enzyme and its mutants in solution we have found that it is a dimer easily converted into bigger aggregates which are soluble covalent  noncovalent reversible the heavier oligomers show a higher activity at ph  in contrast to dimers with lower activity showing two maxima at ph  and ph  indicating the existence of two different conformers in the seven point c  s mutant aggregation is diminished activity has one broad peak at ph  and there is no change in specificity truncation of the nt  barrel domain plat residues     reduces activity to    of that shown by the whole enzyme does not affect regio or stereospecificity and lowers membrane binding by a factor of     noplat  mutants show strong aggregation into oligomers containing six or more catalytic domains regardless of the status of the seven cysteine residues tested time of flight mass spectrometry suggests two arachidonic acid molecules bound to one molecule of enzyme small angle x ray scattering studies     resolution     suggest that two hp  lox monomers are joined by the catalytic domains with the plat domains floating on the flexible linkers away from the main body of the dimer
