direct observation of microscopic reversibility in single molecule protein folding
both folded and unfolded conformations should be observed for a protein at its melting temperature tm  where  g between these states is zero in an all atom molecular dynamics simulation of chymotrypsin inhibitor  ci  at its experimental tm the protein rapidly loses its low temperature native structure it then unfolds before refolding to a stable native like conformation the initial unfolding follows the unfolding pathway described previously for higher temperature simulations the hydrophobic core is disrupted the  sheet pulls apart and the  helix unravels the unfolded state reached under these conditions maintains a kernel of structure in the form of a non native hydrophobic cluster refolding simply reverses this path the side chain interactions shift the helix refolds and the native packing and hydrogen bonds are recovered the end result of this refolding is not the initial crystal structure it contains the proper topology and the majority of the native contacts but the structure is expanded and the contacts are long we believe this to be the native state at elevated temperature and the change in volume and contact lengths is consistent with experimental studies of other native proteins at elevated temperature and the chemical denaturant equivalent of tm
