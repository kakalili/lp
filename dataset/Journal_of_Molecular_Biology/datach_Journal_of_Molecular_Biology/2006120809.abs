a novel lysine rich domain and gtp binding motifs regulate the nucleolar retention of human guanine nucleotide binding protein gnl l
a variety of g proteins and gtpases are known to be involved in nucleolar function we describe here a new evolutionarily conserved putative human gtpase guanine nucleotide binding protein like  like gnl l  genes encoding proteins related to gnl l are present in bacteria and yeast to metazoa and suggests its critical role in development conserved domain search analysis revealed that the gnl l contains a circularly permuted g motif described by a g g g g g pattern similar to the hsr mmr gtp binding protein subfamily highly conserved and critical residues were identified from a three dimensional structural model obtained for gnl l using the crystal structure of an ylqf gtpase from bacillus subtilis we demonstrate here that gnl l is transported into the nucleolus by a novel lysine rich nucleolar localization signal nols residing within    amino acid residues nols identified here is necessary and sufficient to target the heterologous proteins to the nucleolus we show for the first time that the lysine rich targeting signal interacts with the nuclear transport receptor importin beta and transports gnl l into the nucleolus interestingly depletion of intracellular gtp blocks gnl l accumulation into the nucleolar compartment furthermore mutations within the g domains alter the gtp binding ability of gnl l and abrogate wild type nucleolar retention even in the presence of functional nols suggesting that the efficient nucleolar retention of gnl l involves activities of both basic nols and gtp binding domains collectively these data suggest that gnl l is composed of distinct modules each of which plays a specific role in molecular interactions for its nucleolar retention and subsequent function s within the nucleolus
