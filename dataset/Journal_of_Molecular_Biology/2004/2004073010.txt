Proteomics research has delivered many novel tumor targets. However, due to key limitations, it does not specifically identify targets that are most accessible for drug delivery, such as cell-surface antigens. A novel tumor antigen discovery platform based on screening a single domain antibody (sdAb) library against tumor cells and subsequently identifying the corresponding antigens of the isolated antibodies is described. An sdAb, AFAI, specific for non-small cell lung carcinoma (A549 cell line) was isolated from a phage library derived from the heavy chain antibody repertoire of a llama. The homopentamerization property of a non-toxic verotoxin B-subunit was exploited to make the ES1 pentabody, a pentameric form of AFAI. Pentamerization improved the binding of the AFAI to A549 cells dramatically and greatly facilitated antigen identification by a Western blotting/mass spectrometry approach. The antigen of ES1, which is present only in the hydrophobic, not in the hydrophilic, fraction of A549 cellular proteins, was identified as carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEA6). CEA6 was observed to be acidic and highly glycosylated, and to exist in multiple glycoforms. The results show that the platform described here should find wide application in antigen discovery, and demonstrated that the pentabodies are very useful immunological reagents for proteomics.
