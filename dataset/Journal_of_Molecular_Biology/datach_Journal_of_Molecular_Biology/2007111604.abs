on the benefit of bivalency in peptide ligand pin interactions
the human peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase ppiase pin has a key role in developmental processes and cell proliferation pin consists of an n terminal ww domain and a c terminal catalytic ppiase domain both targeted specifically to ser po h  thr po h  pro sequences here we report the enhanced affinity originating from bivalent binding of ligands toward pin compared to monovalent binding we developed composite peptides where an n terminal segment represents a catalytic site directed motif and a c terminal segment exhibits a predominant affinity to the ww domain of pin tethered by polyproline linkers of different chain length we used nmr shift perturbation experiments to obtain information on the specific interaction of a bivalent ligand to both targeted sites of pin  the bivalent ligands allowed a considerable range of thermodynamic investigations using isothermal titration calorimetry and ppiase activity assays they expressed up to   fold improved affinity toward pin in the nanomolar range in comparison to the monovalent peptides the distance between the two binding motifs was highly relevant for affinity the optimum in affinity manifested by a linker length of five prolyl residues between active site and ww domain directed peptide fragments suggests that the corresponding domains in pin are allowed to adopt preferred spatial arrangement upon ligand binding
