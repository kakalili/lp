the protein synthesis inhibitors oxazolidinones and chloramphenicol cause extensive translational inaccuracy in vivo
the oxazolidinone family is a new class of synthetic antibiotics that bind to the bacterial  s ribosomal subunit two members of the family linezolid and xa   were examined for their effects on translational fidelity using a lacz reporter gene in vivo both promoted highly significant frameshifting and nonsense suppression chloramphenicol a peptidyl transferase inhibitor affected translational fidelity in a similar fashion neither the oxazolidinones nor chloramphenicol stimulated misincorporation of amino acid residues at position   in the lacz gene in contrast the aminoglycosides gentamicin and paromomycin which interact with the decoding region of the  s subunit caused significant misincorporation but only modest increases in frameshifting or stop codon readthrough of the lacz gene we conclude that effects on translational fidelity may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of the oxazolidinones
