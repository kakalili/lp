coupling and dynamics of subunits in the hexameric aaa chaperone clpb
the bacterial aaa protein clpb and its eukaryotic homologue hsp  ensure thermotolerance of their respective organisms by reactivating aggregated proteins in cooperation with the hsp  hsp  chaperone system like many members of the aaa superfamily the clpb protomers form ringlike homohexameric complexes the mechanical energy necessary to disentangle protein aggregates is provided by atp hydrolysis at the two nucleotide binding domains of each monomer previous studies on clpb and hsp  show a complex interplay of domains and subunits resulting in homotypic and heterotypic cooperativity using mutations in the walker a and walker b nucleotide binding motifs in combination with mixing experiments we investigated the degree of inter subunit coupling with respect to different aspects of the clpb working cycle we find that subunits are tightly coupled with regard to atpase and chaperone activity but no coupling can be observed for adp binding comparison of the data with statistical calculations suggests that for double walker mutants approximately two in six subunits are sufficient to abolish chaperone and atpase activity completely in further experiments we determined the dynamics of subunit reshuffling our results show that clpb forms a very dynamic complex reshuffling subunits on a timescale comparable to steady state atp hydrolysis we propose that this could be a protection mechanism to prevent very stable aggregates from becoming suicide inhibitors for clpb
