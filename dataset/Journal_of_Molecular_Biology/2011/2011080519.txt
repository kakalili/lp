G-protein hetero-trimers play a fundamental role in cell function. Their dynamic behavior at the atomic level remains to be understood. We have studied the Gi hetero-trimer through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses. We showed that these big proteins could undergo large-amplitude conformational changes, without any energy penalty and with an intrinsic dynamics centered on their GDP binding pocket. Among the computed collective motions, one of the modes (mode 17) was particularly able to significantly open both the base and the phosphate sides of the GDP binding pocket. This mode describing mainly a motion between the Ras-like and the helical domains of Gα was in close agreement with some available X-ray data and with many other biochemical/biophysical observations including the kink of helix α5. The use of a new protocol, which allows extraction of the GDP ligand along the computed normal modes, supported that the exit of GDP was largely coupled to an opening motion along mode 17. We propose for the first time a “concerted mechanism” model in which the opening of the GDP pocket and the kink of the α5 helix occur concomitantly and favor GDP release from Gαβγ complexes. This model is discussed in the context of the G-protein-coupled receptor/G-protein interaction close to the cell membrane.
