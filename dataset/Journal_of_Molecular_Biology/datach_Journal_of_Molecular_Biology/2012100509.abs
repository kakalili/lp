electrostatically accelerated coupled binding and folding of intrinsically disordered proteins
intrinsically disordered proteins idps are now recognized to be prevalent in biology and many potential functional benefits have been discussed however the frequent requirement of peptide folding in specific interactions of idps could impose a kinetic bottleneck which could be overcome only by efficient folding upon encounter intriguingly existing kinetic data suggest that specific binding of idps is generally no slower than that of globular proteins here we exploited the cell cycle regulator p kip  p  as a model system to understand how idps might achieve efficient folding upon encounter for facile recognition combining experiments and coarse grained modeling we demonstrate that long range electrostatic interactions between enriched charges on p  and near its binding site on cyclin a not only enhance the encounter rate i e  electrostatic steering but also promote folding competent topologies in the encounter complexes allowing rapid subsequent formation of short range native interactions en route to the specific complex in contrast nonspecific hydrophobic interactions while hardly affecting the encounter rate can significantly reduce the efficiency of folding upon encounter and lead to slower binding kinetics further analysis of charge distributions in a set of known idp complexes reveals that although idp binding sites tend to be more hydrophobic compared to the rest of the target surface their vicinities are frequently enriched with charges to complement those on idps this observation suggests that electrostatically accelerated encounter and induced folding might represent a prevalent mechanism for promoting facile idp recognition
