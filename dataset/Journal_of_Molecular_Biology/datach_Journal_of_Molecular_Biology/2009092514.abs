camp prevents glucose mediated modifications of histone h and recruitment of the rna polymerase ii holoenzyme to the l pk gene promoter
glucose and camp reciprocally regulate expression of the l type pyruvate kinase l pk gene by controlling the formation of a complex containing the carbohydrate response element binding protein chrebp and the coactivator creb binding protein cbp on the l pk promoter however the role of posttranslational histone modifications on the opposing effects of glucose and camp on the l pk gene is unknown using the highly glucose sensitive    rat insulinoma cell line we demonstrated that glucose regulates acetylation and methylation of various histone residues at the l pk gene promoter these glucose dependent histone modifications correlated with an increase in the recruitment and phosphorylation of rna polymerase ii pol ii on the l pk gene promoter conversely the camp agonist forskolin prevented glucose mediated expression of the l pk gene by decreasing the acetylation of histones h and h on the promoter decreasing the methylation of h k on the coding region and increasing the methylation of h k on the coding region these changes induced by camp culminated with a decrease in the glucose dependent recruitment of phosphorylated pol ii to the l pk gene promoter furthermore maneuvers that interfere with the glucose dependent assembly of chrebp and cbp on the l pk promoter such as increasing intracellular camp levels overexpression of a dominant negative form of chrebp and small interfering rna mediated suppression of cbp abundance all altered the acetylation and methylation of histones on the l pk promoter which decreased pol ii recruitment and subsequently inhibited transcriptional activation of the l pk gene we conclude that the effects of glucose and camp are mediated in part by epigenetic modulation of histones
