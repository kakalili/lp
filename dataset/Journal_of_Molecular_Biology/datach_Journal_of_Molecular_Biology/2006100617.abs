computational studies of tryptophanyl trna synthetase activation of atp by induced fit
catalysis of amino acid activation by bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl trna synthetase involves three allosteric states   open   closed pre transition state prets  and   closed products product  the interconversions of these states entail significant domain motions driven by ligand binding we explore the application of molecular dynamics simulations to investigate ligand linked conformational stability changes associated with this catalytic cycle multiple molecular dynamics trajectories   ns for  distinct liganded and unliganded monomer configurations show that the prets conformation is unstable in the absence of atp reverting within     ps nearly to the open conformation in contrast open and product state trajectories were stable even without ligands confirming the previous suggestion that catalysis entails destabilization of the protein conformation driven by atp binding energies developed as the prets state assembles during induced fit the simulations suggest novel mechanistic details associated with both induced fit open prets and catalysis prets product  notably mg   atp interactions are coupled to interactions between atp and active site lysine side chains via mechanisms that cannot be captured under the molecular mechanics approximations and which therefore require restraining potentials for stable simulation simulations of mg  atp bound prets complexes with restraining potentials and with a virtual k  a mutant confirm that these coupling interactions are necessary to sustain the prets conformation and in turn provide a new model for how the prets conformation activates atp for catalysis these results emphasize the central role of the prets state as a high energy intermediate structure along the catalytic pathway and suggest that mg  and the kmsks loop function cooperatively during catalysis
