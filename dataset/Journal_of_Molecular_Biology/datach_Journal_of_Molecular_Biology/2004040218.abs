molecular flexibility and discontinuous translocation of a non templated polymerase
little is known regarding the translocation of non templated nucleic acid polymerases with respect to single stranded primers vp  the vaccinia virus poly a polymerase translocates as it processively adds a     adenylate tail to primers possessing only three ribouridylate residues as an ru   n   ru motif  and a      adenylate tail to primers that are more u rich here three models were addressed for the translocation of vp  with respect to its primer namely  a rigid protein rigid nucleic acid  b flexible protein rigid nucleic acid  c rigid protein flexible nucleic acid analysis of free and covalently vp  attached primers favored either b or a version of c incorporating a passive steric block and suggested two regions of relative motion between polymerase and primer inclusion of a nt uridylate rich patch at the primer   end switched the polymerase from     nt to      nt tail addition without affecting initial binding affinity by synthesizing this patch as a ru dc pool discontinuous polymerase movements could be detected
