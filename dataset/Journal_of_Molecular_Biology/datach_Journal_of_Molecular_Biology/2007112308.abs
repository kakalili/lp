a    structure of zinc bound n terminal domain of calmodulin elucidates potential early ion binding step
calmodulin cam is a   kda calcium binding protein involved in calcium signal transduction it is the canonical member of the ef hand family of proteins which are characterized by a helix  loop  helix calcium binding motif cam is composed of n and c terminal globular domains n cam and c cam  and within each domain there are two ef hand motifs upon binding calcium cam undergoes a significant global conformational change involving reorientation of the four helix bundles in each of its two domains this conformational change upon ion binding is a key component of the signal transduction and regulatory roles of cam yet the precise nature of this transition is still unclear here we present a    structure of zinc bound n terminal calmodulin n cam solved by single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing of a selenomethionyl n cam our zinc bound n cam structure differs from previously reported cam structures and resembles calcium free apo calmodulin apo cam  despite the zinc binding to both ef hand motifs structural comparison with calcium free apo cam calcium loaded cam and a cross linked calcium loaded cam suggests that our zinc bound n cam reveals an intermediate step in the initiation of metal ion binding at the first ef hand motif our data also suggest that metal ion coordination by two key residues in the first metal binding site represents an initial step in the conformational transition induced by metal binding this is followed by reordering of the n terminal region of the helix exiting from this first binding loop this conformational switch should be incorporated into models of either stepwise conformational transition or flexible dynamic energetic state sampling based transition
