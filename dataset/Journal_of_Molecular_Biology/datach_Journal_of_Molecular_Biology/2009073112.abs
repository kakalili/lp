structural rearrangement accompanying ligand binding in the gaf domain of cody from bacillus subtilis
the gaf domain is a simple module widespread in proteins of diverse function including cell signalling proteins and transcription factors its structure typically spanning   residues has three tiers a basal layer of two or more  helices a middle layer of  pleated sheet and a top layer formed by segments of the polypeptide that connect strands of the  sheet in structures of gaf domains in complex with their effectors these polypeptide segments envelop the ligand enclosing it in a cavity whose base is formed by the  sheet such that ligand binding and release must be accompanied by conformational rearrangements of the distal portion of the structure descriptions of binding are presently limited by the absence of a gaf domain for which both liganded and unliganded structures are known earlier we solved the crystal structure of the gaf domain of cody a branched chain amino acid and gtp responsive regulator of the transcription of stationary phase and virulence genes in bacillus in complexes with isoleucine and valine here we report the structure of this domain in its unliganded form allowing definition of the structural changes accompanying ligand binding the core of the protein and its dimerisation interface are essentially unchanged in agreement with circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments that show that the secondary structure composition is unperturbed by ligand binding there is however extensive refolding of the binding site loops with up to    movements of the coiled segment linking   and   such that the binding pocket is not formed in the absence of the ligand the implications of these structural rearrangements for ligand affinity and specificity are discussed finally saturation transfer difference nmr spectroscopy showed binding of isoleucine but not that of gtp to the gaf domain suggesting that the two cofactors do not have a common binding site
