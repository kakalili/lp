the asymmetric atpase cycle of the thermosome elucidation of the binding hydrolysis and product release steps
using a combination of intrinsic fluorescence to report atp induced rearrangements quenched flow to measure atp hydrolysis  on enzyme  and optical methods to probe the kinetics of product release we have begun to dissect the process of energy transduction in the thermosome a type ii chaperonin from thermoplasma acidophilum stoichiometric measurements of atp binding reveal the tight association of eight nucleotide molecules per hexa decamer implying the filling of only one ring owing to strong negative cooperativity after binding we show that these eight atp molecules are hydrolysed over the next   s after which hydrolysis slows down markedly during the establishment of the steady state in the atpase reaction demonstrating that the kinetic system is off rate limited looking in more detail this rapid first turnover can be dissected into two phases the first occurring with a half time of   s the second with a half time of   s possibly reflecting the differential behaviour of the four alpha and four beta subunits in a single thermosome ring to investigate the post hydrolytic events we used two heat stable enzyme linked optical assays to measure the rate of evolution of adp and of phosphate from the thermosome active site neither product showed a rapid dissociation phase prior to the establishment of the steady state showing that both are released slowly at a rate that limits the cycle these data highlight the importance of the highly populated thermosome adp pi complex in the molecular mechanism
