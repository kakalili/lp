insight into molecular interactions between two pb domains
specific protein  protein interactions play crucial roles in the regulation of any biological process recently a new protein  protein interaction domain termed pb  phox and bem  was identified which is conserved throughout evolution and present in diverse proteins functioning in signal transduction cell polarity and survival here we investigated the structure and molecular interactions of the pb heterodimer complex composed of the pb domains of the yeast proteins bem and cdc  a structural model of the cdc  pb was built by homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations and experimentally validated by  n nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy noesy  heteronuclear single quantum coherence hsqc analysis residues at the interface of the complex for both proteins were identified by nmr titration experiments a model of the heterodimer was obtained by docking of the two pb domains with haddock which applies ambiguous interaction restraints on residues at the interface to drive the docking procedure the refined model was validated by site directed mutagenesis on both bem and cdc  finally the docking was repeated from the newly published nmr structure of cdc  allowing us to assess the performance of homology based docking our results provide insight into the molecular structure of the bem  cdc  pb mediated heterodimer which allowed identification of critical residues at the binding interface
