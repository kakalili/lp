substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease mely from enterobacter cloacae
we have examined the substrate selectivity of the melibiose permease mely from enterobacter cloacae in comparison with that of the lactose permease lacy from escherichia coli both proteins catalyze active transport of lactose or melibiose with comparable affinity and capacity however mely does not transport the analogue methyl  thio  d galactopyranoside tmg  which is a very efficient substrate in lacy we show that mely binds tmg and conserves cys   helix v as a tmg binding residue but fails to transport this ligand based on homology modeling organization of the putative mely sugar binding site is the same as that in lacy and residues irreplaceable for the symport mechanism are conserved moreover only   of the residues where a single cys mutant is inactivated by site directed alkylation differ in mely using site directed mutagenesis at these positions and engineered cross homolog chimeras we show that val   at the periplasmic end of transmembrane helix xi contributes in defining the substrate selectivity profile replacement of val  with the mely residue ala leads to impairment of tmg uptake exchanging domains n and c between lacy and mely also leads to impairment of tmg uptake tmg uptake activity is restored by the re introduction of a val  in the background of chimera n lacy  c mely  much less prominent effects are found with the same mutants and chimeras for the transport of lactose or melibiose
