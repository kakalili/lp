trosy nmr studies of the  kda trap protein reveal allosteric control of a gene regulatory protein by ligand altered flexibility
the tryptophan biosynthesis genes of several bacilli are controlled through terminator anti terminator transcriptional attenuation this process is regulated by tryptophan dependent binding of the trp rna binding attenuation protein trap to the leader region of the trp operon mrna precluding formation of the antiterminator rna hairpin and allowing formation of the less stable terminator hairpin crystal structures are available of trap in complex with tryptophan and in ternary complex with tryptophan and rna however no structure of trap in the absence of tryptophan is available thus the mechanism of allostery remains unclear we have used transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy trosy based nmr experiments to study the mechanism of ligand mediated allosteric regulation in the   kda  mer trap by recording a series of two dimensional  n edited trosy nmr spectra of trap from the thermophile bacillus stearothermophilus over an extended range of temperatures we have found tryptophan binding to be temperature dependent in agreement with the previously observed temperature dependent rna binding triple resonance trosy based nmr spectra recorded at   c have allowed us to obtain backbone resonance assignments for uniformly h  c  n labeled trap in the inactive form and in the active form free and bound to tryptophan  on the basis of ligand dependent differential line broadening and chemical shift perturbations coupled with the results of proteolytic sensitivity measurements we infer that tryptophan modulated protein flexibility dynamics plays a central role in trap function by altering its rna binding affinity furthermore because the crystal structures show that the ligand is buried completely in the bound state we speculate that such dynamic behavior may be important to enable rapid response to changes in intracellular tryptophan levels thus we propose that allosteric control of trap is accomplished by ligand altered protein dynamics
