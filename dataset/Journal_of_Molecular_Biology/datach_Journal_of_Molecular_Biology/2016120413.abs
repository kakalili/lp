flavin dependent methylation of rnas complex chemistry for a simple modification
rna methylation is the most abundant and evolutionarily conserved chemical modification of bases or ribose in noncoding and coding rnas this rather simple modification has nevertheless major consequences on the function of maturated rna molecules and ultimately on their cellular fates the methyl group employed in the methylation is almost universally derived from s adenosyl l methionine via a simple sn displacement reaction however in some rare cases the carbon originates from n n  methylenetetrahydrofolate ch thf  here a methylene group is transferred first and requires a subsequent reduction step  e  h  via the flavin adenine dinucleotide hydroquinone fadh   to form the final methylated derivative this fad folate dependent mode of chemical reaction called reductive methylation is thus far more complex than the usual simple s adenosyl l methionine dependent one this reaction is catalyzed by flavoenzymes now named trmfo and rlmfo which respectively modify transfer and ribosomal rnas in this review we briefly recount how these new rna methyltransferases were discovered and describe a novel aspect of the chemistry of flavins wherein this versatile biological cofactor is not just a simple redox catalyst but is also a new methyl transfer agent acting via a critical ch  n fad iminium intermediate the enigmatic structural reorganization of these enzymes that needs to take place during catalysis in order to build their active center is also discussed finally recent findings demonstrated that this flavin dependent mechanism is also employed by enzymatic systems involved in dna synthesis suggesting that the use of this cofactor as a methylating agent of biomolecules could be far more usual than initially anticipated
