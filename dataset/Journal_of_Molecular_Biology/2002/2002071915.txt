Two different views have been proposed for origins of genes (or proteins). One is that primordial genes evolved from random sequences. This view underlies the concept of modern in vitro evolution experiments that functional molecules (even proteins) evolved from random sequence-libraries. On the contrary, the second view reminds that “random sequences” would be an unusual state in which to find RNA or DNA, because it is their inherent nature to yield periodic structures during the course of semi-conservative replication. In this second view, the periodicity of DNA (or RNA) is responsible for emergence of primordial genes. Although recent reports on the variety of periodicities present in proteins, genes and genomes are consistent with the second view, it has yet to be experimentally tested. We assessed the significance of periodicities of DNA in the origin of genes by constructing such periodic DNAs. The results showed that periodic DNA produced ordered proteins at very high rates, which is in contrast to the fact that proteins with random sequences lack secondary structures. We concluded that periodicity played a pivotal role in the origin of many genes. The observation should pave the way for new experimental evolution systems for proteins.
