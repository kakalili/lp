biochemical characterisation and genetic analysis of aureocin a  a new atypical bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus
aureocin a  is produced by staphylococcus aureus a  it is encoded on a   kb plasmid prj  and is active against listeria monocytogenes aureocin a  is a highly cationic  residue peptide containing ten lysine and five tryptophan residues aureocin a  was purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic interaction cation exchange and reverse phase chromatography maldi tof mass spectrometry yielded a molecular mass of    da which was  da higher than predicted from the structural gene sequence of the bacteriocin the mass increment resulted from an n formylmethionine residue indicating that the aureocin a  is synthesised and secreted without a typical bacteriocin leader sequence or sec dependent signal peptide the structural identity of aureocin a  was verified by edman sequencing after de blocking with cyanogen bromide and extensive mass spectrometry analysis of enzymatically and laser generated fragments the complete sequence of prj was determined and none of the open reading frames identified in the vicinity of the structural gene auca showed similarity to genes that are typically found in bacteriocin gene clusters thus neither a dedicated protease or transporter nor modifying enzymes and regulatory elements seemed to be involved in the production of aureocin a  further unique features that distinguish aureocin a  from other peptide bacteriocins include remarkable protease stability and a defined rigid structure in aqueous solution
