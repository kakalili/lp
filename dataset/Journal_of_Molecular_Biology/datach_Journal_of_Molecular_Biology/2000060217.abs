conformational analysis of long spacers in prosite patterns edited by j thornton
to determine if variable sequences spacers between conserved positions in a sequence motif or pattern share a consensus structure three dimensional structures containing prosite patterns with spacers of fixed length greater than three residues were analyzed structural similarities of a given pattern were evaluated by computing the backbone    and side chain   dihedral order parameters the exact bias information in analyzing the conformational variability of the patterns was taken into account by introducing a new parameter the bias coefficient which describes the number and distribution of residue types found at each position of a pattern in the structures the results of the analyses show that backbone conformational heterogeneity at a given position in a sequence motif does not necessarily correlate with the residue type variability at that position and the long spacer region can adopt a well defined backbone conformation in addition to the conserved residues furthermore a prosite pattern may be redefined to yield two or more  refined  regular expressions each corresponding to a distinct backbone conformation a way in which the observed structural consensus in a pattern may be employed to improve the accuracy of function prediction from sequence is suggested
