structure of the alkalohyperthermophilic archaeoglobus fulgidus lipase contains a unique c terminal domain essential for long chain substrate binding
several crystal structures of afl a novel lipase from the archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus complexed with various ligands have been determined at about     resolution this enzyme has optimal activity in the temperature range of      c and ph      afl consists of an n terminal    hydrolase fold domain a small lid domain and a c terminal  barrel domain the n terminal catalytic domain consists of a  stranded  sheet flanked by seven  helices four on one side and three on the other side the c terminal lipid binding domain consists of a  sheet of  strands and a substrate covering motif on top of the highly hydrophobic substrate binding site the catalytic triad residues ser   asp   and his   and the residues forming the oxyanion hole leu  and met   are in positions similar to those of other lipases long chain lipid is located across the two domains in the afl  substrate complex structural comparison of the catalytic domain of afl with a homologous lipase from bacillus subtilis reveals an opposite substrate binding orientation in the two enzymes afl has a higher preference toward long chain substrates whose binding site is provided by a hydrophobic tunnel in the c terminal domain the unusually large interacting surface area between the two domains may contribute to thermostability of the enzyme two amino acids asp  and lys   are identified as hinge residues regulating movement of the lid domain the hydrogen bonding pattern associated with these two residues is ph dependent which may account for the optimal enzyme activity at high ph further engineering of this novel lipase with high temperature and alkaline stability will find its use in industrial applications
