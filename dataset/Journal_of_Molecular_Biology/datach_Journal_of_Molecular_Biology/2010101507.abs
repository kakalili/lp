diversity of bisubstrate binding modes of adenosine analogue  oligoarginine conjugates in protein kinase a and implications for protein substrate interactions
crystal structures of the catalytic subunit  of camp dependent protein kinase pkac with three adenosine analogue  oligoarginine conjugates arcs are presented the rationally designed arcs include moieties that in combination target both the atp and the peptide substrate binding sites of pkac thereby taking advantage of high affinity binding interactions offered by the atp site while utilizing an additional mechanism for target specificity via binding to the peptide substrate site the crystal structuresdemonstrate that in accord with the previously reported bisubstrate character of arcs the inhibitors occupy both binding sites of pkac further they show new binding modes that may also apply to natural protein substrates of pkac which have not been revealed by previous crystallographic studies the crystal structures described here contribute to the understanding of the substrate binding patterns of pkac and should also facilitate the design of inhibitors targeting pkac and related protein kinases
