quinol oxidation by c type cytochromes structural characterization of the menaquinol binding site of nrfha
membrane bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases in this work the menaquinol oxidation site of nrfh was characterized by the determination of the x ray structure of desulfovibrio vulgaris nrfha nitrite reductase complex bound to  heptyl  hydroxyquinoline n oxide which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of nrfh quinol oxidation activity the structure at    resolution reveals that the inhibitor binds close to nrfh heme  where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues asp  the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position and lys  a strictly conserved residue the menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of nrfh and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm although nrfh is not a multi span membrane protein its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described the data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family
