nucleobases undergo dynamic rearrangements during rna tertiary folding
the tertiary structure of the gtpase center gac of  s ribosomal rna rrna as seen in cocrystals is extremely compact it is stabilized by long range hydrogen bonds and nucleobase stacking and by a triloop that forms within its three way junction its folding pathway from secondary structure to tertiary structure has not been previously observed but it was shown to require mg  ions in equilibrium experiments the fluorescent nucleotide  aminopurine was substituted at selected sites within the  nt gac fluorescence intensity changes upon addition of mgcl were monitored over a time course from ms to  s as the rna folds the folding pathway is revealed here to be hierarchical through several intermediates observation of the nucleobases during folding provides a new perspective on the process and the pathway revealing the dynamics of nucleobase conformational exchange during the folding transitions
