redox coupled conformational alternations in cytochrome c from d vulgaris miyazaki f on the basis of its reduced solution structure
heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy was performed to determine the solution structure of  n labeled ferrocytochrome c from desulfovibrio vulgaris miyazaki f dvmf  although the folding of the reduced cytochrome c in solution was similar to that of the oxidized one in the crystal structure the region involving hemes  and  was different the redox coupled conformational change is consistent with the reported solution structure of d vulgaris hildenborough ferrocytochrome c  but is different from those of other cytochromes c  the former is homologous with dvmf cytochrome c in amino acid sequence small displacements of hemes  and  relative to hemes  and  were observed this observation is consistent with the unusual behavior of the  ch signal of heme  reported previously as shown by the  n relaxation parameters of the backbone a region between hemes  and  has more flexibility than the other regions the results of this work strongly suggest that the cooperative reduction of hemes  and  is based on the conformational changes of the c  propionate of heme  and the aromatic ring of tyr  and the interaction between his  and his  through covalent and coordination bonds
