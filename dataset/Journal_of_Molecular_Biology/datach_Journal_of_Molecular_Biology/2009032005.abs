the socs box encodes a hierarchy of affinities for cullin  implications for ubiquitin ligase formation and cytokine signalling suppression
the socs suppressors of cytokine signalling family of proteins inhibits the cytokine induced signalling cascade in part by promoting the ubiquitination of signalling intermediates that are then targeted for proteasomal degradation this activity relies upon an interaction between the socs box domain the adapter complex elonginbc and a member of the cullin family the scaffold protein of an e ubiquitin ligase in this study we dissected this interaction in vitro using purified components we found that all eight socs proteins bound cullin but required prior recruitment of elonginbc neither socs nor elonginbc bound cullin when in isolation interestingly the affinity of each socs  elonginbc complex for cullin varied by  orders of magnitude across the socs family unexpectedly the most potent suppressors of signalling socs  and socs  bound most weakly to the e ligase scaffold with affinities   and  fold lower respectively than the rest of the family the remaining six socs proteins all bound cullin with high affinity kd of    nm due to a slower off rate and hence a longer half life of the complex this difference in affinity may reflect a difference in mode of action as only socs  and socs  have been shown to suppress signalling using both socs box dependent and socs box independent mechanisms this is not the case with the other six socs proteins and our data imply the existence of two distinct subclasses of socs proteins with a high affinity for cullin  the e ligase scaffold possibly reflecting complete dependence upon ubiquitination for suppression of cytokine signalling
