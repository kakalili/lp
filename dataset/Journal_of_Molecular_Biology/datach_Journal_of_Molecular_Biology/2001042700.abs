ca  induced switching of troponin and tropomyosin on actin filaments as revealed by electron cryo microscopy edited by a klug
muscle contraction is regulated by the intracellular ca  concentration in vertebrate striated muscle troponin and tropomyosin on actin filaments comprise a ca  sensitive switch that controls contraction ca  binds to troponin and triggers a series of changes in actin containing filaments that lead to cyclic interactions with myosin that generate contraction however the precise location of troponin relative to actin and tropomyosin and how its structure changes with ca  have been not determined to understand the regulatory mechanism we visualized the location of troponin by determining the three dimensional structure of thin filaments from electron cryo micrographs without imposing helical symmetry to     resolution with ca  the globular domain of troponin was gourd shaped and was located over the inner domain of actin without ca  the main body of troponin was shifted by     towards the outer domain and bifurcated with a horizontal branch troponin arm covering the n and c terminal regions of actin the c terminal one third of tropomyosin shifted towards the outer domain of actin by     supporting the steric blocking model however it is surprising that the n terminal half of tropomyosin shifted less than      therefore tropomyosin shifted differentially without ca  with ca  tropomyosin was located entirely over the inner domain thereby allowing greater access of myosin for force generation the interpretation of three dimensional maps was facilitated by determining the three dimensional positions of fluorophores labelled on specific sites of troponin or tropomyosin by applying probabilistic distance geometry to data from fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements
