functional attributes of the phosphate group binding cup of pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes edited by j thornton
twenty four structures of pyridoxal   phosphate plp dependent enzymes that represent five different folds are shown to share a common recognition pattern for the phosphate group of their plp ligands all atoms that interact with the phosphate group of plp in these proteins are organized within a two layer structure so that the first interacting layer contains from five to seven atoms and parallel with this is a second layer containing from three to seven interacting atoms in order to identify features of the phosphate binding site common to plp dependent enzymes a simple procedure is described that assigns relative positions to all interacting atoms unambiguously such that the networks of interactions for different proteins can be compared on the basis of these diagrams for  enzyme cofactor complexes a detailed comparison of the two layer structures of plp dependent enzymes with both similar and different folds was made a majority of the structurally defined plp dependent proteins use the same atom types in analogous  key  positions to bind their plp ligands in some instances proteins use water molecules when a key position is unoccupied a similar two layer recognition pattern extends to protein recognition of at least one other non plp ligand glucosamine  phosphate we refer to this three dimensional recognition pattern as the phosphate binding cup in general the phosphate binding cup provides a very stable anchoring point for plp when numerous water molecules occur within the cup however then the phosphate group of plp participates directly in the enzymatic reactions with inorganic phosphate replacing the water molecules of the cup with glucosamine  phosphate synthase the water molecules of the phosphate binding cup facilitate the entry of substrate and the exit of product
