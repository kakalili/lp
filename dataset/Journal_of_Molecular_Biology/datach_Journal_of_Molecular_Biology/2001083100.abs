molecular characterisation of aureocin a  a multi peptide bacteriocin isolated from staphylococcus aureus edited by m yaniv
staphylococcus aureus a  produces a heat stable bacteriocin designated aureocin a  aureocin a  is encoded within a mobilisable  kb plasmid prj  and is active against listeria monocytogenes experiments of transposition mutagenesis and gene cloning had shown that aureocin a  production and immunity were associated with the hindiii a and b fragments of prj  therefore a   bp region of the plasmid encompassing both these fragments was sequenced using a concatenation dna sequencing procedure dna sequence and genetic analyses revealed the presence of three transcriptional units that appear to be involved in bacteriocin activity the first transcriptional unit contains a single gene aurt which encodes a protein that resembles an atp dependent transporter similar to those involved in lantibiotic export aurt is required for aureocin a  production and it appears to be essential for mobilisation of prj  the second putative operon contains two open reading frames orfs  the first gene orfa is predicted to encode a protein similar to small repressor proteins found in some archaea whose function remains to be elucidated the second gene orfb codes for an   amino acid residue protein which shares a number of characteristics high pi and hydrophobicity profile with proteins associated with immunity needed for self protection against bacteriocin four other genes are present in the third operon aurabcd aurabcd encode four related peptides that are small     amino acid residues  strongly cationic pi of   to    and highly hydrophobic theses peptides also have a high content of small amino acid residues like glycine and alanine and no cysteine residue tn  lac insertional mutations which affected aureocin a  activity reside within operon aurabcd analysis of purified bacteriocin preparations by mass spectrometry demonstrated that all four peptides encoded by aurabcd operon are produced expressed and excreted without post translational modifications thus aureocin a  is a multi peptide non lantibiotic bacteriocin which is transported without processing
