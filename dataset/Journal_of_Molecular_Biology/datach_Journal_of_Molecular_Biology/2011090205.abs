crystal structure of serratia fonticola sfh i activation of the nucleophile in mono zinc metallo  lactamases
metallo  lactamases mbls or class b  lactamases are zinc dependent enzymes capable of inactivating almost all classes of  lactam antibiotics to date no mbl inhibitors are available for clinical use of the three mbl subclasses b enzymes unlike those from subclasses b and b  are fully active with one zinc ion bound and possess a narrow spectrum of activity hydrolyzing carbapenem substrates almost exclusively these remain the least studied mbls sfh i originally identified from the aquatic bacterium serratia fonticola utad  is a divergent member of this group previous b mbl structures available only for the cpha enzyme from aeromonas hydrophila all contain small molecules bound in their active sites in consequence the mechanism by which these enzymes activate the water nucleophile required for  lactam hydrolysis remains to be unambiguously established here we report crystal structures of sfh i as a complex with glycerol and in the unliganded form revealing for the first time the disposition of water molecules in the b mbl active site our data indicate that the hydrolytic water molecule is activated by his  rather than by asp  and or zinc consistent with this proposal we show that the environment of his  in b mbls is distinct from that of the b and b enzymes where this residue acts as a zinc ligand and offer a structure based mechanism for  lactam hydrolysis by these enzymes
