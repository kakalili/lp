a novel mechanism for azoreduction
azoreductases are important due to their ability to activate anti inflammatory azo pro drugs and to detoxify azo dyes three genes encoding azoreductases have been identified in pseudomonas aeruginosa we describe here a comparison of the three enzymes the pure recombinant proteins each have a distinct substrate specificity profile against a range of azo substrates using the structure of p aeruginosa azoreductase paazor  and the homology models of paazor and paazor  we have identified residues important for substrate specificity we have defined a novel flavin mononucleotide binding cradle which is a recurrent motif in many flavodoxin like proteins a novel structure of paazor with the azo pro drug balsalazide bound within the active site was determined by x ray crystallography and demonstrates that the substrate is present in a hydrazone tautomer conformation we propose that the structure with balsalazide bound represents an enzyme intermediate and together with the flavin mononucleotide binding cradle we propose a novel catalytic mechanism
