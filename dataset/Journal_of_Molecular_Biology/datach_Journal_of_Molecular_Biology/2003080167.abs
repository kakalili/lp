the nmr solution structure of bef   activated spo f reveals the conformational switch in a phosphorelay system
two component systems which are comprised of a single histidine aspartate phosphotransfer module are the dominant signaling pathways in bacteria and have recently been identified in several eukaryotic organisms as well a tandem connection of two or more histidine aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays while response regulators from simple two component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation we report the nmr solution structure of bef   activated spo f the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two component systems in addition a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix  located on the opposite side of the common activation surface was observed as a consequence of bef   activation conformational changes in helix  can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase spo b because helix  is known to interact directly with spo b and the phosphatase rapb the identification of structural rearrangements in spo f supports the hypothesis of a pre existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous nmr dynamics studies on spo f a shift of a pre existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators
