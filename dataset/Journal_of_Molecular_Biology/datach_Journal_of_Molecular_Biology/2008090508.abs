cofilin increases the bending flexibility of actin filaments implications for severing and cell mechanics
we determined the flexural bending rigidities of actin and cofilactin filaments from a cosine correlation function analysis of their thermally driven two dimensional fluctuations in shape the persistence length of actin filaments is    m corresponding to a flexural rigidity of    pn  m  cofilin binding lowers the persistence length   fold to a value of    m and the filament flexural rigidity to    pn  m  that cofilin decorated filaments are more flexible than native filaments despite an increased mass indicates that cofilin binding weakens and redistributes stabilizing subunit interactions of filaments we favor a mechanism in which the increased flexibility of cofilin decorated filaments results from the linked dissociation of filament stabilizing ions and reorganization of actin subdomain  and as a consequence promotes severing due to a mechanical asymmetry knowledge of the effects of cofilin on actin filament bending mechanics together with our previous analysis of torsional stiffness provide a quantitative measure of the mechanical changes in actin filaments associated with cofilin binding and suggest that the overall mechanical and force producing properties of cells can be modulated by cofilin activity
