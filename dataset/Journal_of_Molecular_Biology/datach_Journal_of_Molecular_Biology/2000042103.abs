mechanisms for auto inhibition and forced product release in glycine n methyltransferase crystal structures of wild type mutant r  k and s adenosylhomocysteine bound r  k enzymes edited by i a wilson
glycine n methyltransferase s adenosyl l methionine glycine methyltransferase ec      gnmt catalyzes the adomet dependent methylation of glycine to form sarcosine n methylglycine  unlike most methyltransferases gnmt is a tetrameric protein showing a positive cooperativity in adomet binding and weak inhibition by s adenosylhomocysteine adohcy  the first crystal structure of gnmt complexed with adomet showed a unique  closed  molecular basket structure in which the n terminal section penetrates and corks the entrance of the adjacent subunit thus the apparent entrance or exit of the active site is not recognizable in the subunit structure suggesting that the enzyme must possess a second enzymatically active   open  structural conformation a new crystalline form of the r  k enzyme has been grown in the presence of an excess of adohcy and its crystal structure has been determined at    resolution in this structure the n terminal domain   amino acid residues of each subunit has moved out of the active site of the adjacent subunit and the entrances of the active sites are now opened widely an adohcy molecule has entered the site occupied in the  closed  structure by glu  and gly  of the n terminal domain of the adjacent subunit an adohcy binds to the consensus adomet binding site observed in the other methyltransferase this adohcy binding site supports the glycine binding site arg   deduced from a chemical modification study and site directed mutagenesis r  k  the crystal structures of wt and r  k enzymes were also determined at    resolution these enzyme structures have a closed molecular basket structure and are isomorphous to the previously determined adomet gnmt structure by comparing the open structure to the closed structure mechanisms for auto inhibition and for the forced release of the product adohcy have been revealed in the gnmt structure the n terminal section of the adjacent subunit occupies the adomet binding site and thus inhibits the methyltransfer reaction whereas the same n terminal section forces the departure of the potentially potent inhibitor adohcy from the active site and thus facilitates the methyltransfer reaction consequently gnmt is less active at a low level of adomet concentration and is only weakly inhibited by adohcy these properties of gnmt are particularly suited for regulation of the cellular adomet adohcy ratio
