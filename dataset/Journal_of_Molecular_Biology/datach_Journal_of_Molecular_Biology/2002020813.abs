bicelle crystallization a new method for crystallizing membrane proteins yields a monomeric bacteriorhodopsin structure edited by d rees
obtaining crystals of membrane proteins that diffract to high resolution remains a major stumbling block in structure determination here we present a new method for crystallizing membrane proteins from a bicelle forming lipid detergent mixture the method is flexible and simple to use as a test case bacteriorhodopsin br from halobacterium salinarum was crystallized from a bicellar solution yielding a new br crystal form the crystals belong to space group p  with unit cell dimensions of a      b       c             and a dimeric asymmetric unit the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined at    resolution in all previous br structures the protein is organized as a parallel trimer but in the crystals grown from bicelles the individual br subunits are arranged in an antiparallel fashion
