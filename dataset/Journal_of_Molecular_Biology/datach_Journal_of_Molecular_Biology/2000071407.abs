solution structural studies and low resolution model of the schizosaccharomyces pombe sap protein edited by m f moody
sap is a dna binding protein involved in controlling the mating type switch in fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe in the absence of any significant sequence similarity with any structurally known protein a variety of biophysical techniques has been used to probe the solution low resolution structure of the sap protein first sap is demonstrated to be an unusually elongated dimer in solution by measuring the translational diffusion coefficient with two independent techniques dynamic light scattering and ultracentrifugation second sequence analysis revealed the existence of a long coiled coil region which is responsible for dimerization the length of the predicted coiled coil matches estimates drawn from the hydrodynamic experimental behaviour of the molecule in addition the same measurements done on a shorter construct with a coiled coil region shortened by roughly one half confirmed the localization of the long coiled coil region a crude t shape model incorporating all these information was built third small angle x ray scattering saxs of the free molecule provided additional evidence for the model in particular the p r curve strikingly demonstrates the existence of long intramolecular distances using a novel d reconstruction algorithm a low resolution d model of the protein has been independently constructed that matches the saxs experimental data it also fits the translation diffusion coefficients measurements and agrees with the first t shaped model this low resolution model has clearly biologically relevant new functional implications suggesting that sap is a bifunctional protein with the two active sites being separated by as much as     a tetrapeptide repeated four times at the c terminus of the molecule is postulated to be of utmost functional importance
