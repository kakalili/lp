stepwise unfolding of a  barrel protein by the aaa clpxp protease
in the aaa clpxp protease clpx uses the energy of atp binding and hydrolysis to unfold proteins before translocating them into clpp for degradation for proteins with c terminal ssra tags clpxp pulls on the tag to initiate unfolding and subsequent degradation here we demonstrate that an initial step in clpxp unfolding of the  stranded  barrel of superfolder gfp ssra involves extraction of the c terminal  strand the resulting  stranded intermediate is populated at low atp concentrations which stall clpxp unfolding and at high atp concentrations which support robust degradation to determine if stable unfolding intermediates cause low atp stalling we designed and characterized circularly permuted gfp variants notably stalling was observed for a variant that formed a stable  stranded intermediate but not for one in which this intermediate was unstable a stepwise degradation model in which the rates of terminal strand extraction strand refolding or recapture and unfolding of the  stranded intermediate all depend on the rate of atp hydrolysis by clpxp accounts for the observed changes in degradation kinetics over a broad range of atp concentrations our results suggest that the presence or absence of unfolding intermediates will play important roles in determining whether forced enzymatic unfolding requires a minimum rate of atp hydrolysis
