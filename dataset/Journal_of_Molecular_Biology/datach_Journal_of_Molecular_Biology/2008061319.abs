structural enzymological studies of  enoyl thioester reductase of the human mitochondrial fas ii pathway new insights into its substrate recognition properties
structural and kinetic properties of the human  enoyl thioester reductase mitochondrial enoyl  coenzyme a reductase mecr etr  of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis fas ii pathway have been determined the crystal structure of this dimeric enzyme at     resolution suggests that the binding site for the recognition helix of the acyl carrier protein is in a groove between the two adjacent monomers this groove is connected via the pantetheine binding cleft to the active site the modeled mode of nadph binding using molecular dynamics calculations suggests that tyr  and trp  are critical for catalysis which is supported by enzyme kinetic data a deep water filled pocket shaped by hydrophobic and polar residues and extending away from the catalytic site was recognized this pocket can accommodate a fatty acyl tail of up to  carbons mutagenesis of the residues near the end of this pocket confirms the importance of this region for the binding of substrate molecules with long fatty acyl tails furthermore the kinetic analysis of the wild type mecr etr shows a bimodal distribution of catalytic efficiencies in agreement with the notion that two major products are generated by the mitochondrial fas ii pathway
