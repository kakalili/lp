topology and sequence in the folding of a tim barrel protein global analysis highlights partitioning between transient off pathway and stable on pathway folding intermediates in the complex folding mechanism of a     barrel of unknown function from b subtilis
the relative contributions of chain topology and amino acid sequence in directing the folding of a     tim barrel protein of unknown function encoded by the bacillus subtilis ioli gene ioli were assessed by reversible urea denaturation and a combination of circular dichroism fluorescence and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopy the equilibrium reaction for ioli involves in addition to the native and unfolded species a stable intermediate with significant secondary structure and stability and self associated forms of both the native and intermediate states global kinetic analysis revealed that the unfolded state partitions between an off pathway refolding intermediate and the on pathway equilibrium intermediate early in folding comparisons with the folding mechanisms of two other tim barrel proteins indole  glycerol phosphate synthase from the thermophile sulfolobus solfataricus sigps and the alpha subunit of escherichia coli tryptophan synthase  ts  reveal striking similarities that argue for a dominant role of the topology in both early and late events in folding sequence specific effects are apparent in the magnitudes of the relaxation times and relative stabilities in the presence of additional monomeric folding intermediates for  ts and sigps and in rate limiting proline isomerization reactions for  ts
