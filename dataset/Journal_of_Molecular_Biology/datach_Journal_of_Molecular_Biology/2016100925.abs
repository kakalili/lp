pathogenic cysteine removal mutations in fgfr extracellular domains stabilize receptor dimers and perturb the tm dimer structure
missense mutations that introduce or remove cysteine residues in receptor tyrosine kinases are believed to cause pathologies by stabilizing the active receptor tyrosine kinase dimers however the magnitude of this stabilizing effect has not been measured for full length receptors here we characterize the dimer stabilities of three full length fibroblast growth factor receptor fgfr mutants harboring pathogenic cysteine substitutions the c  s fgfr mutant the c  r fgfr mutant and the c  r fgfr mutant we find that the three mutations stabilize the fgfr dimers we further see that the mutations alter the configuration of the fgfr transmembrane dimers thus both aberrant dimerization and perturbed dimer structure likely contribute to the pathological phenotypes arising due to these mutations
