splicing of a cap proximal human papillomavirus  e e intron promotes e expression but can be restrained by distance of the intron from its rna   cap
human papillomavirus   hpv  e e pre mrna is bicistronic and has an intron in the e coding region with one   splice site and two alternative   splice sites which produce e  i and e  ii respectively if this intron remains unspliced the resulting e e mrna expresses oncogenic e  we found for the first time that the e e pre mrna was efficiently spliced in vitro only when capped and that cellular cap binding factors were involved in the splicing the cap dependent splicing of the e e pre mrna was extremely efficient in cervical cancer derived cells producing mostly e  i but inefficient in cells transfected with a common retrovirus expression vector plxsn e e  due to the large size of this vector s exon  further studies showed that efficient splicing of the e e pre mrna depends on the distance of the cap proximal intron from the rna   cap with an optimal distance of less than  nt in order to facilitate better association of u small nuclear rna with the intron   splice site the same was true for splicing of human  globin rna splicing of the e e rna provided more e rna templates and promoted e translation whereas a lack of rna splicing produced a low level of e translation together our data indicate that the distance between the rna   cap and cap proximal intron is rate limiting for rna splicing hpv  e e pre mrna takes advantage of its small cap proximal exon to confer efficient splicing for better e expression
