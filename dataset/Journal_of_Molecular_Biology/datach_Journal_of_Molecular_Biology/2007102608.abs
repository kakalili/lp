insights from atomic resolution x ray structures of chemically synthesized hiv  protease in complex with inhibitors
the human immunodeficiency virus  hiv  protease pr is an aspartyl protease essential for hiv  viral infectivity hiv  pr has one catalytic site formed by the homodimeric enzyme we chemically synthesized fully active hiv  pr using modern ligation methods when complexed with the classic substrate derived inhibitors jg   and mvt   the synthetic hiv  pr formed crystals that diffracted to    and    resolution respectively these atomic resolution structures revealed additional structural details of the hiv  pr s interactions with its active site ligands heptapeptide inhibitor jg   which has a hydroxyethylamine moiety in place of the scissile bond binds in two equivalent antiparallel orientations within the catalytic groove whereas the reduced isostere hexapeptide mvt   binds in a single orientation when jg   was converted into the natural peptide substrate for molecular dynamic simulations we found putative catalytically competent reactant states for both lytic water and direct nucleophilic attack mechanisms moreover free energy perturbation calculations indicated that the insertion of catalytic water into the catalytic site is an energetically favorable process
