structure of the scan domain from the tumor suppressor protein mzf
the scan domain mediates interactions between members of a subfamily of zinc finger transcription factors and is found in more than  c h zinc finger genes in the human genome including the tumor suppressor gene myeloid zinc finger  mzf  glutathione s transferase pull down assays showed that the mzf scan domain self associates and a kd value of   nm was measured by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence polarization the mzf structure determined by nmr spectroscopy revealed a domain swapped dimer each monomer consists of five alpha helices in two subdomains connected by the      loop residues from helix  of each monomer compose the core of the dimer interface while the      loop and helix  pack against helices  and  from the opposing monomer comprehensive sequence analysis is coupled with the first high resolution structure of a scan dimer to provide an initial view of the recognition elements that govern dimerization for this large family of transcription factors
