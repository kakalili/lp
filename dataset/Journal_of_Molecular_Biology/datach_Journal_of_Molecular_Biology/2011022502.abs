crystal structures exploring the origins of the broader specificity of escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin compared to cholera toxin
cholera toxin ct and escherichia coli heat labile enterotoxin lt are structurally and functionally related and share the same primary receptor the gm ganglioside despite their extensive similarities these two toxins exhibit distinct ligand specificities with lt being more promiscuous than ct here we have attempted to rationalize the broader binding specificity of lt and the subtle differences between the binding characteristics of lts from human and porcine origins mediated by their b subunit pentamers hltb and pltb respectively  the analysis is based on two crystal structures of pltb in complexes with the pentasaccharide of its primary ligand gm  and with neolactotetraose the carbohydrate determinant of a typical secondary ligand of lts respectively important molecular determinants underlying the different binding specificities of ltb and ctb are found to be contributed by ser  tyr  and thr  or ser of hltb  which together prestabilize the binding site by positioning lys  glu  and the adjacent loop region      containing ile  for ligand binding glu and ala may also play an important role many of these residues are closely connected with a recently identified second binding site and there appears to be cross talk between the two sites binding to n acetyllactosamine terminated receptors is further augmented by arg  present in plt and some hlt variants  as previously predicted
