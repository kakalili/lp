structural basis of substrate binding specificity revealed by the crystal structures of polyamine receptors spud and spue from pseudomonas aeruginosa
the type iii secretion system t ss of pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key virulence determinant whose expression is induced by polyamine signals from mammalian host spud and spue were postulated to be spermidine preferential binding proteins which regulate the polyamine content in this bacterial pathogen in this study we found that spud is a putrescine preferential binding protein while spue binds to spermidine exclusively we have determined the crystal structures of spud in free form and in complex with putrescine and spue in free form and in complex with spermidine upon ligand binding spud and spue undergo an  open to closed  conformational switch with the resultant closed ligand bound forms spud putrescine and spue spermidine similar to their escherichia coli counterparts potf putrescine and potd spermidine respectively structural comparison suggested that two aromatic residues trp  of spue and phe  of spud in segment ii region are the key structural determinants for putrescine spermidine recognition specificity mutagenesis combined with isothermal titration calorimetry showed that substitution of trp  by phe enabled spue to gain substantial binding affinity for putrescine while replacement of phe  by trp reduced the binding affinity of spud toward putrescine by   fold altogether these results revealed the molecular mechanism governing polyamine recognition specificity by spud and spue and provide the basis for further structural and functional studies of polyamine signal importation system in p aeruginosa
