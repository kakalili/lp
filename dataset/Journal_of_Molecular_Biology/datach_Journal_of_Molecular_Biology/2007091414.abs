retinoid regulated association of transcriptional co regulators and the polycomb group protein suz  with the retinoic acid response elements of hoxa  rar   and cyp a in f embryonal carcinoma cells
hox gene expression is activated by all trans retinoic acid ra  through binding to retinoic acid receptor retinoid x receptor rar rxr heterodimers bound at ra response elements rares of target genes the rars and rxrs each have three isotypes     and   which are encoded by distinct genes hox genes are also repressed by polycomb group proteins pcg  though how these proteins are targeted is unclear we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to investigate the association of rxr  rar  cofactors and the pcg protein suz  with the hoxa  rar   and cyp a rares in f embryonal carcinoma cells teratocarcinoma stem cells during ra treatment we demonstrate that rar  and rxr  are associated with rares prior to and during ra treatment pcip p   and rna polymerase ii levels increased at target rares upon exposure to ra conversely suz  was found associated with all rares studied and these associations were attenuated by treatment with ra upon ra removal suz  re associated with rares h ac h k me  and h k me marks were simultaneously detected at target loci indicative of a bivalent domain chromatin structure during ra mediated differentiation h k me levels decreased at target rares whereas h ac and h k me levels remained constant these studies provide insight into the dynamics of association of co regulators with rares and demonstrate a novel link between ra signaling and pcg repression
