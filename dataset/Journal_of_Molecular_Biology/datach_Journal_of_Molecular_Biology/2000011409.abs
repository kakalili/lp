knowledge based scoring function to predict protein ligand interactions edited by r huber
the development and validation of a new knowledge based scoring function drugscore to describe the binding geometry of ligands in proteins is presented it discriminates efficiently between well docked ligand binding modes root mean square deviation lt    with respect to a crystallographically determined reference complex and those largely deviating from the native structure e g generated by computer docking programs structural information is extracted from crystallographically determined protein ligand complexes using relibase and converted into distance dependent pair preferences and solvent accessible surface sas dependent singlet preferences for protein and ligand atoms definition of an appropriate reference state and accounting for inaccuracies inherently present in experimental data is required to achieve good predictive power the sum of the pair preferences and the singlet preferences is calculated based on the d structure of protein ligand binding modes generated by docking tools for two test sets of  and  protein ligand complexes taken from the protein data bank pdb  the calculated score recognizes poses generated by flexx deviating lt   from the crystal structure on rank  in three quarters of all possible cases compared to flexx this is a substantial improvement for ligand geometries generated by dock drugscore is superior to the  chemical scoring  implemented into this tool while comparable results are obtained using the  energy scoring  in dock none of the presently known scoring functions achieves comparable power to extract binding modes in agreement with experiment it is fast to compute regards implicitly solvation and entropy contributions and produces correctly the geometry of directional interactions small deviations in the d structure are tolerated and since only contacts to non hydrogen atoms are regarded it is independent from assumptions of protonation states
