structure and function of steroid receptor rna activator protein the proposed partner of sra noncoding rna
in a widely accepted model the steroid receptor rna activator protein sra protein srap modulates the transcriptional regulatory activity of sra rna by binding a specific stem  loop of sra we first confirmed that srap is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of mcf  breast cancer cells where it is expressed at the level of about   molecules per cell however our srap  rna binding experiments both in vitro with recombinant protein and in cultured cells with plasmid expressed protein and rna did not reveal a specific interaction between srap and sra we determined the crystal structure of the carboxy terminal domain of human srap and found that it does not have the postulated rrm rna recognition motif  the structure is a five helix bundle that is distinct from known rna binding motifs and instead is similar to the carboxy terminal domain of the yeast spliceosome protein prp  which stabilizes specific protein  protein interactions within a multisubunit mrna splicing complex sra binding experiments with this domain gave negative results transcriptional regulation by sra srap was examined with sirna knockdown effects on both specific estrogen responsive genes and genes identified by rna seq as candidates for regulation were examined in mcf  cells only a small effect    change on one gene resulting from depletion of sra srap could be confirmed we conclude that the current model for srap function must be reevaluated we suggest that srap may function in a different context to stabilize specific intermolecular interactions in the nucleus
