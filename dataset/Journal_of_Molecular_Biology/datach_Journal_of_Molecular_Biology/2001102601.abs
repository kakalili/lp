reconstitution of hybrid proteasomes from purified pa     s complexes and pa    activator ultrastructure and peptidase activities edited by r huber
the activity of the proteasome the major non lysosomal proteinase in eukaryotes is stimulated by two activator complexes pa  and pa  pa     s pa  proteasome complexes generally designated as  s proteasomes degrade proteins whereas complexes of the type pa    s pa  degrade only peptides we report for the first time the in vitro reconstitution of previously identified hybrid proteasomes pa     s pa  from purified pa     s proteasome complexes and pa  activator in electron micrographs the hybrid appears as a corkscrew shaped particle with a pa  and a pa  activator each bound to a terminal  disk of the  s core proteasome the multiple peptidase activities of hybrid proteasomes are not different from those of pa    s pa  or pa     s pa  complexes
