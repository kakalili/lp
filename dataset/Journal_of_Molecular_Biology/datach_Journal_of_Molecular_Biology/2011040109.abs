structural mechanism of ribonucleotide discrimination by a y family dna polymerase
the ability of dna polymerases to differentiate between ribonucleotides and deoxribonucleotides is fundamental to the accurate replication and maintenance of an organism s genome the active sites of y family dna polymerases are highly solvent accessible yet these enzymes still maintain a high selectivity towards deoxyribonucleotides here we biochemically demonstrate that a single active site mutation y a in dpo  a model y family dna polymerase causes both a dramatic loss of ribonucleotide discrimination and a decrease in nucleotide incorporation efficiency we also determined two ternary crystal structures of the dpo y a mutant incorporating either datp or atp nucleotides opposite a template dt base interestingly both datp and atp were hydrolyzed to dadp and adp respectively in addition the dadp and adp molecules adopt a similar conformation and position at the polymerase active site to a ddadp molecule in the ternary crystal structure of wild type dpo  the y a mutant loses stacking interactions with the deoxyribose of dntp which destabilizes the binding of incoming nucleotides the mutation also opens a space to accommodate the   oh group of the ribose of ntp in the polymerase active site the structural change leads to the reduction in deoxynucleotide incorporation efficiency and allows ribonucleotide incorporation
