variable sequences outside the sam binding core critically influence the conformational dynamics of the sam iii smk box riboswitch
the smk box sam iii translational riboswitches were identified in s adenosyl l methionine sam synthetase metk genes in members of lactobacillales this riboswitch switches between two alternative conformations in response to intracellular sam concentration and controls metk expression at the level of translation initiation we previously reported the crystal structure of the sam bound smk box riboswitch in this study we combined selective   hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension chemical probing with mutagenesis to probe the ligand induced conformational switching mechanism we revealed that while the majority of the apo smk box rna molecules exist in an alternatively base paired on conformation a subset of them pre organize into a sam bound like ready conformation which upon sam exposure is selectively stabilized into the sam bound off conformation through an induced fit mechanism mutagenesis showed that the on state is only slightly more stable than the ready state as several single nucleotide substitutions in a hypervariable region outside the sam binding core can alter the folding landscape to favor the ready state such smk variants display a  constitutively off  behavior both in vitro and in vivo time resolved and temperature dependent selective   hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analyses revealed adaptation of the smk box rna to its mesothermal working environment the latter analysis revealed that the sam bound smk box rna follows a two step folding unfolding process
