fibrillization propensity for short designed hexapeptides predicted by computer simulation
assembly of normally soluble proteins into ordered aggregates known as amyloid fibrils is a cause or associated symptom of numerous human disorders including alzheimer s and the prion diseases here we test the ability of discontinuous molecular dynamics dmd simulations based on prime  a new intermediate resolution protein force field to predict which designed hexapeptide sequences will form fibrils which will not and how this depends on temperature and concentration simulations were performed on  peptide systems containing stviie stvife stvive staiie stviae stvige and stviee starting from random coil configurations by the end of the simulations stviie and stvife which form fibrils in vitro form fibrils over a range of temperatures stviee which does not form fibrils in vitro does not form fibrils and stvive staiie stviae and stvige which do not form fibrils in vitro form fibrils at lower temperatures but stop forming fibrils at higher temperatures at the highest temperatures simulated the results on the fibrillization propensity of the seven short de novo designed peptides all agree with the experiments of l pez de la paz and serrano our results suggest that the fibrillization temperature temperature above which fibrils cease to form is a measure of fibril stability and that by rank ordering the fibrillization temperatures of various sequences prime  dmd simulations could be used to ascertain their relative fibrillization propensities a phase diagram showing regions in the temperature  concentration plane where fibrils are formed in our simulations is presented
