nucleotide binding states of subunit a of the a atp synthase and the implication of p loop switch in evolution
the crystal structures of the nucleotide empty ae    adenylyl    imidodiphosphate apnp bound and adp adp bound forms of the catalytic a subunit of the energy producer a ao atp synthase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot have been solved at     and     resolutions the structures provide novel features of nucleotide binding and depict the residues involved in the catalysis of the a subunit in the ae form the phosphate analog so   binds via a water molecule to the phosphate binding loop p loop residue ser   which is also involved in the phosphate binding of adp and   adenylyl    imidodiphosphate together with amino acids gly  and phe   the serine residue stabilizes the arched p loop conformation of subunit a as shown by the    structure of the mutant protein s  a in which the p loop flips into a relaxed state comparable to the one in catalytic  subunits of f fo atp synthases superposition of the existing p loop structures of atpases emphasizes the unique p loop in subunit a which is also discussed in the light of an evolutionary p loop switch in related a ao atp synthases f fo atp synthases and vacuolar atpases and implicates diverse catalytic mechanisms inside these biological motors
