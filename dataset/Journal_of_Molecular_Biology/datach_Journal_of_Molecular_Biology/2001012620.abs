specific recognition of four way dna junctions by the c terminal zinc binding domain of hpv oncoprotein e  edited by m yaniv
e is an oncoprotein implicated in cervical cancers produced by   high risk   human papillomaviruses e binds specifically to several cellular proteins including the tumour suppressor p  and the ubiquitin ligase e ap however e is also a dna binding protein which recognizes a structural motive present in four way junctions here we demonstrate that the c terminal zinc binding domain of e  expressed separately from the rest of the protein fully retains the selective four way junction recognition activity the domain can bind to two identical and independent sites on a single junction whereas full length e can only bind to one site the junction bound to either one or two domains adopts an extended square conformation these results allow us to assign the structure dependent dna recognition activity of e to its c terminal domain which therefore represents a new class of zinc stabilized dna binding module comparison with the binding characteristics of other junction specific proteins enlightens the rules which govern protein induced deformation of four way dna junctions
