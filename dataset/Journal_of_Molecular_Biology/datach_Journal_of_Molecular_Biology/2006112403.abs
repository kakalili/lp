substrate recognition protein dynamics and iron sulfur cluster in pseudomonas aeruginosa adenosine   phosphosulfate reductase
aps reductase catalyzes the first committed step of reductive sulfate assimilation in pathogenic bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a promising target for drug development we report the     resolution crystal structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa aps reductase in the thiosulfonate intermediate form of the catalytic cycle and with substrate bound the structure high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance ft icr mass spectrometry and quantitative kinetic analysis establish that the two chemically discrete steps of the overall reaction take place at distinct sites on the enzyme mediated via conformational flexibility of the c terminal  residues the results address the mechanism by which sulfonucleotide reductases protect the covalent but labile enzyme intermediate before release of sulfite by the protein cofactor thioredoxin p aeruginosa aps reductase contains an  fe s cluster that is essential for catalysis the structure reveals an unusual mode of cluster coordination by tandem cysteine residues and suggests how this arrangement might facilitate conformational change and cluster interaction with the substrate assimilatory   phosphoadenosine   phosphosulfate paps reductases are evolutionarily related homologous enzymes that catalyze the same overall reaction but do so in the absence of an fe s cluster the aps reductase structure reveals adaptive use of a phosphate binding loop for recognition of the aps o   hydroxyl group or the paps   phosphate group
