crystal structures of human nudt reveal insights into the structural basis of the substrate specificity
human nudt  hnudt  is an adp ribose pyrophosphatase adprase belonging to the nudix hydrolase superfamily it presumably plays important roles in controlling the intracellular level of adp ribose adpr to prevent non enzymatic adp ribosylation by hydrolyzing adpr to amp and ribose   phosphate we report here the crystal structures of hnudt in apo form in complex with adpr and in complex with amp with bound mg  hnudt forms a homodimer with substantial domain swapping and assumes a structure more similar to escherichia coli adprase orf  than human adprase nudt  the adenine moiety of the substrates is specifically recognized by the enzyme via hydrogen bonding interactions between n and n of the base and glu  of one subunit and between n of the base and arg  of the other subunit providing the molecular basis for the high selectivity of hnudt for adp sugars over other sugar nucleotides structural comparisons with e coli adprase orf  and adpxase orf  indicate that the existence of an aromatic residue on loop l in orf  seems to be positively correlated with its enzymatic activity on apna whereas hnudt and orf  contain no such residue and thus have low or no activities on apna
