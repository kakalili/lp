a conserved dimer and global conformational changes in the structure of apo pkne ser thr protein kinase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
the  eukaryotic like  receptor ser thr protein kinases stpks are candidates for the sensors that mediate environmental adaptations of mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb  to define the mechanisms of regulation and substrate recognition we determined the crystal structure of the ligand free activated kinase domain kd of the mtb stpk pkne remarkably the pkne kd formed a dimer similar to that first observed in the structure of the atp s complex of the mtb paralog pknb this structural similarity which occurs despite little sequence conservation between the pknb and pkne dimer interfaces supports the idea that dimerization regulates the mtb receptor stpks insertion of the dfg motif into the atp binding site and other conformational differences compared the atp s pknb complex suggest that apo pkne is not pre organized to bind nucleotides this structure may represent an inactive conformation stabilized by dimerization or alternatively an active conformation that reveals shifts that mediate nucleotide exchange and order substrate binding
