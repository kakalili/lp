regulation of usp  a high incidence of e complexes
ubiquitin ub conjugation is a critical signalling process in eukaryotic cells the precise regulation of deubiquitination is an important component of this signalling cascade here we discuss how usp  or herpes associated ubiquitin specific protease hausp  one of the most abundant deubiquitinating enzymes is regulated by complex formation with regulatory proteins and targets full activity of usp requires that its c terminal ub like domains fold back onto the catalytic domain to allow the remodelling of the active site to a catalytically competent state by the very c terminal peptide this regulatory mode can be modulated by complex formation with other proteins usp is found in a large number of relatively stable complexes with different possible functions complex formation can provide recruitment of a target bring in an e ub ligase or modulate the activation of the deubiquitinating enzyme activity these complexes make up potential cellular  switches   using their de ubiquitination ability to switch pathways on or off upon cellular signals here we summarize what is known for usp complexes focussing on the prevalence of e ub ligases and how complex formation can affect ub switches
