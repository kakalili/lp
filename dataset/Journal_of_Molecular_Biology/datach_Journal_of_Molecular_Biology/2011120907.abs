the scope of phage display for membrane proteins
numerous examples of phage display applied to soluble proteins demonstrate the power of the technique for protein engineering affinity reagent discovery and structure  function studies recent reports have expanded phage display to include membrane proteins mps  the scope and limitations of mp display remain undefined therefore we report data from the phage display of representative types of membrane associated proteins including plasma nuclear peripheral single and multipass the peripheral mp neuromodulin displays robustly with packaging by conventional m  ko helper phage the monotopic mp nogo  can also display on the phage surface if packaged by the modified m  ko  helper phage the modified phage coat of ko  can better mimic the zwitterionic character of the plasma membrane four examples of putatively  helical integral mps failed to express as fusions to an anchoring phage coat protein and therefore did not display on the phage surface however the  barrel mps shua shigella heme uptake a and momp major outer membrane protein  which pass through the membrane  and  times respectively can display surprisingly well on the surfaces of both conventional and ko  phages the results provide a guide for protein engineering and large scale mutagenesis enabled by the phage display of mps
