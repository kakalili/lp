the baseplate wedges of bacteriophage t spontaneously assemble into hubless baseplate like structure in vitro
the baseplate of phage t is an important model system in viral supramolecular assembly the baseplate consists of six wedges surrounding the central hub we report the first successful attempt at complete wedge assembly using an in vitro approach based on recombinant proteins the cells expressing the individual wedge proteins were mixed in a combinatorial manner and then lysed using this approach we could both reliably isolate the complete wedge along with a series of intermediate complexes as well as determine the exact sequence of assembly the individual proteins and intermediate complexes at each step of the wedge assembly were successfully purified and characterized by sedimentation velocity and electron microscopy although our results mostly confirmed the hypothesized sequential wedge assembly pathway as established using phage mutants interestingly we also detected some protein interactions not following the specified order it was found that association of gene product  to the immediate precursor complex induces spontaneous association of the wedges to form a six fold star shaped baseplate like structure in the absence of the hub the formation of the baseplate like structure was facilitated by the addition of gene product   the complete wedge in the star shaped supramolecular complex has a structure similar to the baseplate in the expanded  star  conformation found after infection based on the results of the present and previous studies we assume that the strict order of wedge assembly is due to the induced conformational change caused by every new binding event the significance of a  s star shaped baseplate structure which was previously reported and was also found in this study is discussed in the light of a new paradigm for t baseplate assembly involving the star shaped wedge ring and the central hub importantly the methods described in this article suggest a novel methodology for future structural characterization of supramolecular protein assemblies
