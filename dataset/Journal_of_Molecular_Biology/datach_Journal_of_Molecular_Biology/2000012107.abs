the kinetic mechanism of the hairpin ribozyme in vivo influence of rna helix stability on intracellular cleavage kinetics edited by d e draper
the relationship between hairpin ribozyme structure and cleavage and ligation kinetics and equilibria has been characterized extensively under a variety of reaction conditions in vitro we developed a quantitative assay of hairpin ribozyme cleavage activity in yeast to learn how structure function relationships defined for rna enzymes in vitro relate to rna mediated reactions in cells here we report the effects of variation in the stability of an essential secondary structure element h  on intracellular cleavage kinetics h is the base paired helix formed between ribozyme and   cleavage product rnas h sequences with fewer than three base pairs fail to support full activity in vitro or in vivo arguing against any significant difference in the stability of short rna helices under in vitro and intracellular conditions under standard conditions in vitro that include  mm mgcl  the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of ribozyme bound products favors ligation consequently ribozymes with stable h sequences display sharply reduced self cleavage rates because cleavage is reversed by rapid re ligation of bound products in contrast ribozymes with as many as  base pairs in h continue to self cleave at maximum rates in vivo the failure of large products to inhibit cleavage could be explained if intracellular conditions promote rapid product dissociation or shift the internal equilibrium to favor cleavage model experiments in vitro suggest that the internal equilibrium between cleavage and ligation of bound products is likely to favor cleavage under intracellular ionic conditions
