crystallography with online optical and x ray absorption spectroscopies demonstrates an ordered mechanism in copper nitrite reductase
nitrite reductases are key enzymes that perform the first committed step in the denitrification process and reduce nitrite to nitric oxide in copper nitrite reductases an electron is delivered from the type  copper t cu centre to the type  copper t cu centre where catalysis occurs despite significant structural and mechanistic studies it remains controversial whether the substrates nitrite electron and proton are utilised in an ordered or random manner we have used crystallography together with online x ray absorption spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy to show that x rays rapidly and selectively photoreduce the t cu centre but that the t cu centre does not photoreduce directly over a typical crystallographic data collection time furthermore internal electron transfer between the t cu and t cu centres does not occur and the t cu centre remains oxidised these data unambiguously demonstrate an  ordered  mechanism in which electron transfer is gated by binding of nitrite to the t cu furthermore the use of online multiple spectroscopic techniques shows their value in assessing radiation induced redox changes at different metal sites and demonstrates the importance of ensuring the correct status of redox centres in a crystal structure determination here optical spectroscopy has shown a very high sensitivity for detecting the change in t cu redox state while x ray absorption spectroscopy has reported on the redox status of the t cu site as this centre has no detectable optical absorption
