effects of temperature on the dynamic behaviour of the hiv  nucleocapsid ncp and its dna complex edited by m f summers
the nucleocapsid protein ncp of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  contains two highly conserved cchc zinc fingers and is involved in many crucial steps of the virus life cycle a large number of physiological r les of ncp involve its binding to single stranded nucleic acid chains several solution structures of ncp and its complex with single stranded rna or dna have been reported we have investigated the changes in the dynamic behaviour experienced by the     ncp peptide upon dna binding using  n heteronuclear relaxation measurements at   k and   k and fluorescence spectroscopy the relaxation data were interpreted using the reduced spectral density approach which allowed the high frequency motion overall tumbling rates and the conformational exchange contributions to be characterized for various states of the peptide without using a specific motional model analysis of the temperature dependent correlation times derived from both nmr and fluorescence data indicated a co operative change of the molecular shape of apo     ncp around   k leading to an increased hydrodynamic radius at higher temperatures the binding of     ncp to a single stranded d acgcc pentanucleotide dna led to a reduction of the conformational flexibility that characterized the apo peptide translational diffusion experiments as well as rotational correlation times indicated that the     ncp d acgcc complex tumbles as a rigid object the amplitudes of high frequency motions were restrained in the complex and the occurrence of conformational exchange was displaced from the second zinc finger to the linker residue ala
