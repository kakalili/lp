crystal structure of escherichia coli thioesterase i protease i lysophospholipase l  consensus sequence blocks constitute the catalytic center of sgnh hydrolases through a conserved hydrogen bond network
escherichia coli thioesterase i tap is a multifunctional enzyme possessing activities of thioesterase esterase arylesterase protease and lysophospholipase in particular tap has stereoselectivity for amino acid derivative substrates hence it is useful for the kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of industrial chemicals in the present work the crystal structure of native tap was determined at    revealing a minimal sgnh hydrolase fold the structure of tap in complex with a diethyl phosphono moiety dep identified its catalytic triad ser  asp  his   and oxyanion hole ser  gly  asn  the oxyanion hole of tap consists of three residues each separated from the other by more than    implying that all of them are highly polarized when substrate bound the catalytic his c   h  o  c hydrogen bond usually plays a role in the catalytic mechanisms of most serine hydrolases however there were none present in sgnh hydrolases we propose that the existence of the highly polarized tri residue constituted oxyanion hole compensates for the lack of a his c   h  o  c hydrogen bond this suggests that members of the sgnh hydrolase family may employ a unique catalytic mechanism in addition most sgnh hydrolases have low sequence identities and presently there is no clear criterion to define consensus sequence blocks through comparison of tap and the three sgnh hydrolase structures currently known we have identified a unique hydrogen bond network which stabilizes the catalytic center a newly discovered structural feature of sgnh hydrolases we have defined these consensus sequence blocks providing a basis for the sub classification of sgnh hydrolases
