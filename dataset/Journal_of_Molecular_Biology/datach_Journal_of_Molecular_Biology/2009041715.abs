structure and activity of human mitochondrial peptide deformylase a novel cancer target
peptide deformylase proteins pdfs participate in the n terminal methionine excision pathway of newly synthesized peptides we show that the human pdf hspdf can deformylate its putative substrates derived from mitochondrial dna encoded proteins the first structural model of a mammalian pdf      hspdf shows a dimer with conserved topology of the catalytic residues and fold as non mammalian pdfs the hspdf c terminus topology and the presence of a helical loop h and h  however shape a characteristic active site entrance the structure of hspdf bound to the peptidomimetic inhibitor actinonin      identified the substrate binding site a defined s   pocket but no s   or s   substrate binding pockets exists a conservation of pdf  actinonin interaction across pdfs was observed despite the lack of true s   and s   binding pockets confirmed through peptide binding modeling enzyme kinetics suggest a combined contribution from p  and p   positions of a formylated peptide substrate to turnover
