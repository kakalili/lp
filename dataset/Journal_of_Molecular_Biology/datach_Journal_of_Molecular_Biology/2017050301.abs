comprehensive identification of nuclear and cytoplasmic tnrc a associating proteins
trinucleotide repeat containing gene a protein tnrc a is an essential protein for microrna mediated gene silencing tnrc a functions in the cytoplasm as a platform protein interacting with argonaute protein on which microrna is loaded for rna silencing and decapping enzymes or deadenylation protein complexes to induce mrna degradation we previously revealed that tnrc a shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus however the function of tnrc a in the nucleus is unclear here we performed a comprehensive identification of the nuclear and cytoplasmic interacting proteins of tnrc a protein by mass spectrometry and identified multiple proteins involved in the nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes we found that many rna degradation pathway proteins were involved in both nuclear and cytoplasmic tnrc a complexes suggesting that rna silencing may occur via tnrc a in both nucleus and cytoplasm or that they were involved in other important function in the nucleus furthermore proteins identified in the nuclear tnrc a complex were categorized into the spliceosomal pathway this may mean that tnrc a regulates splicing in the nucleus in contrast pathogen infection and rna transport associated proteins were identified in the cytoplasmic tnrc a complex thus tnrc a may be also involved in these pathways in the cytoplasm
