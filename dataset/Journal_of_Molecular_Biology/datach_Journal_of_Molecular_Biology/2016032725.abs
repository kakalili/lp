interactions between the microtubule binding protein eb and f actin
many cellular processes including cell division and cell migration require coordination between the actin and microtubule mt cytoskeletons this coordination is as yet poorly understood but proteins such as formins and iqgap are known to be involved we show that the mt binding protein eb  end binding protein   a key regulator of mt dynamics can bind directly to filamentous actin f actin f actin we determined that the eb f actin interaction is salt sensitive and weak under physiological salt concentrations but might be relevant in contexts where the local concentration of actin is high using bioinformatics and mutagenesis we found that the eb f actin binding site partially overlaps the well characterized eb mt binding interface congruently competition experiments indicate that eb can bind to f actin or mts but not both simultaneously these observations suggest that eb f actin interactions may negatively regulate eb mt interactions and we speculate that this interaction may assist cells in differentially regulating mt stability in the actin rich cortex as opposed to the cell interior
