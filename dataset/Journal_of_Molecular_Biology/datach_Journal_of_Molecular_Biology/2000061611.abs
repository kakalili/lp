length of ctg cag repeats determines the influence of mismatch repair on genetic instability edited by m yaniv
we showed previously that mutations in methyl directed mismatch repair of escherichia coli reduced the occurrence of large deletions in ctg cag   repeats contained on plasmids by contrast other workers reported that mutations in mismatch repair increase the frequency of small length changes in the shorter ctg cag   using plasmids with a variety of lengths and purity of ctg cag repeats we have resolved these apparently conflicting observations we show that all lengths of ctg cag repeats are subject to small length changes  lt eight repeats upon inactivation of the mismatch repair pathway however large deletions  gt eight repeats in ctg cag n occur more readily in cells with active mismatch repair the frequency of large deletions is proportional to the tract length in our assays they become prominent in tracts greater than   repeats interruptions in repeat purity enhance the occurrence of large deletions in addition we observed a high level of incidence of deletions in ctg cag repeats for cultures passing repeatedly through stationary phase during long term growth experiments of all strains i e with active or inactive mismatch repair  these results agree with current theories on mismatch repair acting on dna slippage events that occur in dna triplet repeats
