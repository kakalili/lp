noncoding rnas regulators of the mammalian transcription machinery
transcription by rna polymerase ii pol ii is required to produce mrnas and some noncoding rnas ncrnas within mammalian cells this coordinated process is precisely regulated by multiple factors including many recently discovered ncrnas in this perspective we will discuss newly identified ncrnas that facilitate dna looping regulate transcription factor binding mediate promoter proximal pausing of pol ii and or interact with pol ii to modulate transcription moreover we will discuss new roles for ncrnas as well as a novel pol ii rna dependent rna polymerase activity that regulates an ncrna inhibitor of transcription as the multifaceted nature of ncrnas continues to be revealed we believe that many more ncrna species and functions will be discovered
