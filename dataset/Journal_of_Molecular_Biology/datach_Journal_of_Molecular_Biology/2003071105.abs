unique features in the c terminal domain provide caltractin with target specificity
caltractin centrin is a member of the calmodulin cam superfamily of ef hand calcium binding proteins it is an essential component of the centrosomal structures in a wide range of organisms caltractin and calmodulin apparently function in distinct calcium signaling pathways despite substantial sequence similarity in an effort to understand the structural basis for such differences the high resolution three dimensional solution structure of the complex between the ca  activated c terminal domain of chlamydomonas reinhardtii caltractin crc c and a  residue peptide fragment comprising the putative cdc p binding region of kar p k  has been determined by multi dimensional heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy formation of the complex is calcium dependent and is stabilized by extensive interactions between crc c and three key hydrophobic anchors trp  leu  and leu  in the peptide as well as favorable electrostatic interactions at the protein  peptide interface in depth comparisons have been made to the structure of the complex of ca  activated calmodulin and r  the cam binding domain of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase although the overall structures of crc and cam domains in their respective complexes are very similar differences in critical regions in the sequences of these proteins and their targets lead to clear differences in the complementarity of their respective binding surfaces these subtle differences reveal the structural basis for the ca  dependent regulation of distinct cellular signaling events by crc and cam
