long range energetic changes triggered by a proline switch in the signal adapter protein c crkii
the signal adapter protein c crkii from chicken but not from human uses isomerization at pro  in the sh c domain to regulate the activity of the sh n domain the different behavior of human and chicken c crkii originates from only two differences in sequence at positions   after pro  and   in the n src loop of sh c we analyzed the kinetics of substrate binding to sh n and an assay for its coupling with pro  isomerization in sh c to identify the molecular path from pro  to the substrate binding site of sh n the trans  cis isomerization at pro  and a relocation of phe  re organize the energetics of a hydrophobic cluster in the n src loop of sh c and re shape this region to optimize its interactions with sh n concomitantly the backbone becomes strained at met   we suggest that in human c crkii movement at position   and strain at position   are not tolerated because the  branched residues ile  and val  restrain the backbone mobility and thus destabilize the cis pro  form
