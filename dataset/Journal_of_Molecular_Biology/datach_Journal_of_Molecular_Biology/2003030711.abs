the scpex p sh domain exposes two distinct binding sites for pex p and pex p
pex p is an essential component of the peroxisomal protein import machinery and interacts via its c terminal sh domain with the type ii sh ligand pex p and the non pxxp protein pex p we report the solution structure of the sh domain of pex p from saccharomyces cerevisiae and the identification of a novel binding pocket which binds a non pxxp peptide representing the binding site of pex p chemical shift assays revealed the binding sites for pex p and pex p ligand peptides to be distinct and spatially separated competition assays demonstrated that the two ligand peptides can bind simultaneously to the sh domain
