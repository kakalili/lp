target induced conformational adaptation of calmodulin revealed by the crystal structure of a complex with nematode ca  calmodulin dependent kinase kinase peptide edited by k morikawa
calmodulin cam is a ubiquitous calcium ca  sensor which binds and regulates protein serine threonine kinases along with many other proteins in a ca  dependent manner for this multi functionality conformational plasticity is essential however the nature and magnitude of cam  s plasticity still remains largely undetermined here we present the    resolution crystal structure of ca  cam complexed with the  residue synthetic peptide corresponding to the cam binding domain of the nematode caenorhabditis elegans ca  cam dependent kinase kinase camkk  the peptide bound in this crystal structure is a homologue of the previously nmr derived complex with rat camkk but benefits from improved structural resolution careful comparison of the present structure to previous crystal structures of cam complexed with unrelated peptides derived from myosin light chain kinase and cam kinase ii allow a quantitative analysis of the differences in the relative orientation of the n and c terminal domains of cam defined as a screw axis rotation angle ranging from    to    the principal differences in cam interaction with various peptides are associated with the n terminal domain of cam unlike the c terminal domain which remains unchanged internally the n terminal domain of cam displays significant differences in the ef hand helix orientation between this and other cam structures three hydrogen bonds between cam and the peptide e  r   e  t  and k  t   along with two salt bridges e  r  and e  k   are the most probable determinants for the binding direction of the camkk peptide to cam
