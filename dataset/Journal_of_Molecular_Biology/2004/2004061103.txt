Caenorhabditis elegans PEB-1 is a novel protein containing a DNA-binding domain in its N terminus, which includes a Cys/His-rich FLYWCH motif also found in Drosophila Mod(mdg4) proteins, and a large C-terminal domain of unknown function. PEB-1 is expressed in most pharyngeal cell types, but its molecular function remains unclear. Here we describe comparative and functional analyses of PEB-1. Characterization of the PEB-1 sequence from C.briggsae indicates highest conservation in the DNA-binding domain (including the FLYWCH motif) and the C terminus, suggesting two functional domains. The PEB-1 FLYWCH motif is essential for DNA-binding and in vivo function; however, it does not bind detectable metal. Likewise, the PEB-1 C terminus is necessary for full activity in vivo, although the DNA-binding domain alone is sufficient for partial function. Both the FLYWCH motif and the C-terminal domain are required for efficient nuclear localization, suggesting PEB-1 must bind DNA and other components to remain in the nucleus. Analysis of binding sites revealed a YDTGCCRW PEB-1 consensus-binding site, and matches to this consensus are widespread in the C.elegans genome.
