classification and evolution of p loop gtpases and related atpases edited by j thornton
sequences and available structures were compared for all the widely distributed representatives of the p loop gtpases and gtpase related proteins with the aim of constructing an evolutionary classification for this superclass of proteins and reconstructing the principal events in their evolution the gtpase superclass can be divided into two large classes each of which has a unique set of sequence and structural signatures synapomorphies  the first class designated trafac after translation factors includes enzymes involved in translation initiation elongation and release factors  signal transduction in particular the extended ras like family  cell motility and intracellular transport the second class designated simibi after signal recognition particle mind and biod  consists of signal recognition particle srp gtpases the assemblage of mind like atpases which are involved in protein localization chromosome partitioning and membrane transport and a group of metabolic enzymes with kinase or related phosphate transferase activity these two classes together contain over  distinct families that are further subdivided into  subfamilies ancient lineages on the basis of conserved sequence motifs shared structural features and domain architectures ten subfamilies show a universal phyletic distribution compatible with presence in the last universal common ancestor of the extant life forms luca  these include four translation factors two obg like gtpases the yawg ylqf like gtpases these two subfamilies also consist of predicted translation factors  the two signal recognition associated gtpases and the mrp subfamily of mind like atpases the distribution of nucleotide specificity among the proteins of the gtpase superclass indicates that the common ancestor of the entire superclass was a gtpase and that a secondary switch to atpase activity has occurred on several independent occasions during evolution the functions of most gtpases that are traceable to luca are associated with translation however in contrast to other superclasses of p loop ntpases reca f f  aaa  helicases abc  gtpases do not participate in ntp dependent nucleic acid unwinding and reorganizing activities hence we hypothesize that the ancestral gtpase was an enzyme with a generic regulatory role in translation with subsequent diversification resulting in acquisition of diverse functions in transport protein trafficking and signaling in addition to the classification of previously known families of gtpases and related atpases we introduce several previously undetected families and describe new functional predictions
