crystal structures of mutant monomeric hexokinase i reveal multiple adp binding sites and conformational changes relevant to allosteric regulation edited by p e wright
hexokinase i the pacemaker of glycolysis in brain tissue is composed of two structurally similar halves connected by an  helix the enzyme dimerizes at elevated protein concentrations in solution and in crystal structures however almost all published data reflect the properties of a hexokinase i monomer in solution crystal structures of mutant forms of recombinant human hexokinase i presented here reveal the enzyme monomer for the first time the mutant hexokinases bind both glucose  phosphate and glucose with high affinity to their n and c terminal halves and adp also with high affinity to a site near the n terminus of the polypeptide chain exposure of the monomer crystals to adp in the complete absence of glucose  phosphate reveals a second binding site for adenine nucleotides at the putative active site c half  with conformational changes extending    to the contact interface between the n and c halves the structures reveal distinct conformational states for the c half and a rigid body rotation of the n half as possible elements of a structure based mechanism for allosteric regulation of catalysis
