chemoenzymatic synthesis inhibition studies and x ray crystallographic analysis of the phosphono analog of udp galp as an inhibitor and mechanistic probe for udp galactopyranose mutase
udp uridine diphosphate galactopyranose mutase ugm is involved in the cell wall biosynthesis of many pathogenic microorganisms ugm catalyzes the reversible conversion of udp  d galactopyranose into udp  d galactofuranose with the latter being the precursor of galactofuranose galf residues in cell walls glycoconjugates of galf are essential components in the cell wall of various pathogenic bacteria including mycobacterium tuberculosis the causative agent of tuberculosis the absence of galf in humans and its bacterial requirement make ugm a potential target for developing novel antibacterial agents in this article we report the synthesis inhibitory activity and x ray crystallographic studies of udp phosphono galactopyranose a nonhydrolyzable c glycosidic phosphonate this is the first report on the synthesis of a phosphonate analog of udp  d galactopyranose by a chemoenzymatic phosphoryl coupling method the phosphonate was evaluated against three bacterial ugms and showed only moderate inhibition we determined the crystal structure of the phosphonate analog bound to deinococcus radiodurans ugm at     resolution the phosphonate analog is bound in a novel conformation not observed in ugm  substrate complex structures or in other enzyme  sugar nucleotide phosphonate complexes this complex structure provides a structural basis for the observed micromolar inhibition towards ugm steric clashes loss of electrostatic stabilization between an active site arginine arg   and the phosphonate analog and a    flip of the hexose moiety account for the differences in the binding orientations of the isosteric phosphonate analog and the physiological substrate this provides new insight into the ability of a sugar nucleotide binding enzyme to orient a substrate analog in an unexpected geometry and should be taken into consideration in designing such enzyme inhibitors
