crystal structure of a bacterial signal peptide peptidase
signal peptide peptidase spp is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the remnant signal peptides left behind in the membrane following sec dependent protein secretion spp activity appears to be present in all cell types eukaryotic prokaryotic and archaeal here we report the first structure of a signal peptide peptidase that of the escherichia coli sppa sppaec  sppaec forms a tetrameric assembly with a novel bowl shaped architecture the bowl has a dramatically hydrophobic interior and contains four separate active sites that utilize a ser lys catalytic dyad mechanism our structural analysis of sppa reveals that while in many gram negative bacteria as well as characterized plant variants a tandem duplication in the protein fold creates an intact active site at the interface between the repeated domains other species particularly gram positive and archaeal organisms encode half size unduplicated sppa variants that could form similar oligomers to their duplicated counterparts but using an octamer arrangement and with the catalytic residues provided by neighboring monomers the structure reveals a similarity in the protein fold between the domains in the periplasmic ser lys protease sppa and the monomers seen in the cytoplasmic ser his asp protease clpp we propose that sppa may in addition to its role in signal peptide hydrolysis have a role in the quality assurance of periplasmic and membrane bound proteins similar to the role that clpp plays for cytoplasmic proteins
