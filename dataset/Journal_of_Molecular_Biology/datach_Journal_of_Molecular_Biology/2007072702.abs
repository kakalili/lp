the rate of trap binding to rna is crucial for transcription attenuation control of the b subtilis trp operon
the trp rna binding attenuation protein trap regulates expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic and transport genes in bacillus subtilis in response to changes in the levels of intracellular tryptophan transcription of the trpedcfba operon is controlled by an attenuation mechanism involving two overlapping rna secondary structures in the   leader region of the trp transcript trap binding promotes formation of a transcription terminator structure that halts transcription prior to the structural genes trap consists of  identical subunits and is activated to bind rna by binding up to  molecules of l tryptophan the trap binding site in the leader region of the trp operon mrna consists of   g u ag repeats we examined the importance of the rate of trap binding to rna for the transcription attenuation mechanism we compared the properties of two types of trap  mers homo  mers composed of  wild type subunits and hetero  mers with only one wild type subunit and ten mutant subunits defective in binding either rna or tryptophan the hetero  mers bound rna with only slightly diminished equilibrium binding affinity but with slower on rates as compared to wt trap the hetero  mers showed significantly decreased ability to induce transcription termination in the trp leader region when examined using an in vitro attenuation system together these results indicate that the rate of trap binding to rna is a crucial factor in trap s ability to control attenuation
