crystal structures of a t lysozyme duplication extension mutant demonstrate that the highly conserved  sheet region has low intrinsic folding propensity
residues  to  of t lysozyme correspond to the second and third strands of a region of  sheet that is highly conserved in all known lysozyme and chitinase structures to evaluate the intrinsic propensity of these amino acid residues to form a defined structure they were added at the c terminus of the native protein together with a dipeptide linker two crystal structures of this active mutant protein were obtained to    and    resolution respectively even though the crystal conditions are similar the appended sequence adopts very different secondary structures in one case it is weakly structured and appears to extend through the active site cleft perhaps in part adding an extra strand to the original  sheet in the other crystal form the extension is largely  helical the formation of these alternative structures shows that the sequence does not have a strong intrinsic propensity to form a unique fold either  sheet or otherwise  the results also suggest that structural conservation during evolution does not necessarily depend on sequence conservation or the conservation of folding propensity
