substrate induced conformational changes occur in all cleaved forms of caspase
caspase  is an apoptotic cysteine protease that also governs disease progression in huntington s and alzheimer s diseases caspase  is of great interest as a target for treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases however the molecular basis of caspase  function and regulation remains poorly understood in the recently reported structure of caspase  the  s and   s helices at the base of the substrate binding groove extend upward in a conformation entirely different from that of any other caspase presently the central question about caspase  structure and function is whether the extended conformation is the catalytically competent conformation or whether the extended helices must undergo a large conformational rearrangement in order to bind substrate we have generated a series of caspase  cleavage variants including a novel constitutively two chain form and determined crystal structures of caspase  with and without the intersubunit linker this series allows evaluation of the role of the prodomain and intersubunit linker on caspase  structure and function before and after substrate binding caspase  is inherently more stable than closely related caspases cleaved caspase  with both the prodomain and the linker present is the most stable indicating that these two regions act in concert to increase stability but maintain the extended conformation in the unliganded state moreover these data suggest that caspase  undergoes a significant conformational change upon substrate binding adopting a structure that is more like canonical caspases
