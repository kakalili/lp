electron cryo microscopy of vat the archaeal p  cdc  homologue from thermoplasma acidophilum edited by d rees
vat valosine containing protein like atpase from thermoplasma acidophilum  an archaeal member of the aaa family atpases associated with a variety of cellular activities that possesses foldase as well as unfoldase activity forms homo hexameric rings like its eukaryotic homologues p  and cdc  the vat monomer exhibits the tripartite domain architecture typical for type ii aaa atpases n d d  whereby n is the substrate binding n terminal domain preceding domains d and d  both containing aaa modules recent  d reconstructions of vat and p  as obtained by electron microscopy suffer from weakly represented n domains probably a consequence of their flexible linkage to the hexameric core here we used electron cryo microscopy and  d reconstruction of single particles in order to generate a  d model of vat at   nm resolution the hexameric core of the vat complex diameter   nm height   nm encloses a central cavity and the substrate binding n domains are clearly arranged in the upper periphery comparison with the p   d reconstruction and the recently determined crystal structure of p  n d suggests a tail to tail arrangement of d and d in vat
