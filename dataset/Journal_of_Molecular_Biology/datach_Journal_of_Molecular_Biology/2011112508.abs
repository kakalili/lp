mapping the deltex binding surface on the notch ankyrin domain using analytical ultracentrifugation
the notch signal transduction pathway controls cell fate determination during metazoan development the notch gene encodes a transmembrane receptor that is cleaved upon activation liberating the notch intracellular domain which enters the nucleus and assembles transcriptional activation complexes that drive expression of notch responsive genes the most conserved region of the notch intracellular domain is an ankyrin domain nank  which binds directly to the cytosolic effector protein deltex dx  controlling intracellular notch activity however the structural and energetic basis for this interaction remains unknown here we analyze the thermodynamics and hydrodynamics of the nank dx heteroassociation as well as a weaker nank self association using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation by comparing g s   and c s distributions and by direct fitting of sedimentation boundaries with thermodynamic association models we were able to characterize the nank dx heterodimer measure its affinity and map the interaction on the surface on nank n and c terminal deletions of whole ankyrin units implicate repeats  and  as key for mediating heteroassociation an alanine scan across the interaction loops of nank identifies a conserved hot spot in repeats  and  centered at r   as critical for dx binding in addition we were able to detect weak but reproducible nank homodimerization kd in the millimolar range  this association is disrupted by substitution of a conserved arginine r   with alanine a residue previously implicated in a functionally relevant mode of interaction within dimeric transcription complexes the distinct binding surfaces on nank for homotypic versus dx interaction appear to be compatible with teterameric notch dx assembly
