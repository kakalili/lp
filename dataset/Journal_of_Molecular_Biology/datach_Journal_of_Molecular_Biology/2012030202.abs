alternative relay and converter domains tune native muscle myosin isoform function in drosophila
myosin isoforms help define muscle specific contractile and structural properties alternative splicing of myosin heavy chain gene transcripts in drosophila melanogaster yields muscle specific isoforms and highlights alternative domains that fine tune myosin function to gain insight into how native myosin is tuned we expressed three embryonic myosin isoforms in indirect flight muscles lacking endogenous myosin these isoforms differ in their relay and or converter domains we analyzed isoform specific atpase activities in vitro actin motility and myofibril structure stability we find that dorsal acute body wall muscle myosin emb c d shows a significant increase in mgatpase vmax and actin sliding velocity as well as abnormal myofibril assembly compared to cardioblast myosin emb  d  these properties differ as a result of alternative exon  encoded relay domains that are hypothesized to communicate signals among the atp binding pocket actin binding site and the converter domain further emb  d shows significantly reduced levels of basal ca and mgatpase as well as mgatpase vmax compared to embryonic body wall muscle isoform emb  expressed in a multitude of body wall muscles  emb  d also induces increased actin sliding velocity and stabilizes myofibril structure compared to emb these differences arise from exon  encoded alternative converter domains that are proposed to reposition the lever arm during the power and recovery strokes we conclude that relay and converter domains of native myosin isoforms fine tune atpase activity actin motility and muscle ultrastructure this verifies and extends previous studies with chimeric molecules and indicates that interactions of the relay and converter during the contractile cycle are key to myosin isoform specific kinetic and mechanical functions
