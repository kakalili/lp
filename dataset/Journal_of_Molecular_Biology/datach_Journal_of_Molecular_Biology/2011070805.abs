electron microscopy and d reconstruction of f actin decorated with cardiac myosin binding protein c cmybp c
myosin binding protein c mybp c is an    kda rod shaped protein of the thick myosin containing filaments of vertebrate striated muscle it is composed of  or  globular  kda domains from the immunoglobulin and fibronectin type iii families and an additional mybp c specific motif the cardiac isoform cmybp c plays a key role in the phosphorylation dependent enhancement of cardiac function that occurs upon  adrenergic stimulation and mutations in mybp c cause skeletal muscle and heart diseases in addition to binding to myosin mybp c can also bind to actin via its n terminal end potentially modulating contraction in a novel way via this thick  thin filament bridge to understand the structural basis of actin binding we have used negative stain electron microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction to study the structure of f actin decorated with bacterially expressed n terminal cmybp c fragments clear decoration was obtained under a variety of salt conditions varying from  to   mm kcl concentration three dimensional helical reconstructions carried out at the   mm kcl level to minimize nonspecific binding showed mybp c density over a broad portion of the periphery of subdomain  of actin and extending tangentially from its surface in the direction of actin s pointed end molecular fitting with an atomic structure of a mybp c ig domain suggested that most of the n terminal domains may be well ordered on actin the location of binding was such that it could modulate tropomyosin position and would interfere with myosin head binding to actin
