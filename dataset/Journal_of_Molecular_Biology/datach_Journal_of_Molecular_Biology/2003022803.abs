solution structure of the chick tgf  type ii receptor ligand binding domain
the transforming growth factor   tgf  signaling pathway influences cell proliferation immune responses and extracellular matrix reorganization throughout the vertebrate life cycle the signaling cascade is initiated by ligand binding to its cognate type ii receptor here we present the structure of the chick type ii tgf  receptor determined by solution nmr methods distance and angular constraints were derived from  n and  c edited nmr experiments torsion angle dynamics was used throughout the structure calculations and refinement the  final structures were energy minimized using the generalized born solvent model for these  structures the average backbone root mean square distance from the average structure is below    the overall fold of this   residue domain is conserved within the superfamily of these receptors chick receptors fully recognize and respond to human tgf  ligands despite only   identity at the sequence level comparison with the human tgf  receptor determined by x ray crystallography reveals different conformations in several regions sequence divergence and crystal packing interactions under low ph conditions are likely causes this solution structure identifies regions were structural changes however subtle may occur upon ligand binding we also identified two very well conserved molecular surfaces one was found to bind ligand in the crystallized human tgf  tgf  type ii receptor complex the other newly identified area can be the interaction site with type i and or type iii receptors of the tgf  signaling complex
