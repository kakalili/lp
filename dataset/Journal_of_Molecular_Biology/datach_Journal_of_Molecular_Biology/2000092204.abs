the crystal structure of staphylococcal enterotoxin h implications for binding properties to mhc class ii and tcr molecules edited by i wilson
the x ray structure of the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin h seh has been determined at     resolution in this paper we present two structures of zinc free seh aposeh and one zinc loaded form of seh znseh  seh exhibits the conventional superantigen sag fold with two characteristic domains in znseh one zinc ion per seh molecule is bound to the c terminal  sheet in the region implicated for major histocompatibility complex class ii mhc class ii binding in sea sed and see surprisingly the zinc ion has only two ligating amino acid residues his  and asp   the other ligands to the zinc ion are two water molecules an extensive packing interaction between two symmetry related molecules in the crystal     molecule forms a cavity that buries the zinc ions of the molecules this dimer like interaction is found in two crystal forms nevertheless zinc dependent dimerisation is not observed in solution as seen in the case of sed a unique feature of seh as compared to other staphylococcal enterotoxins is a large negatively charged surface close to the zn  site the interaction of seh with mhc class ii is the strongest known among the staphylococcal enterotoxins however seh seems to lack a seb like mhc class ii binding site since the side chain properties of structurally equivalent amino acid residues in seh and those in seb binding mhc class ii differ dramatically there is also a structural flexibility between the domains of seh the domains of two aposeh structures are related by a   rotation leading to at most   difference in c  positions since the t cell receptor probably interacts with both domains seh by this rotation may modulate its binding to different tcr v  chains
