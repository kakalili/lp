rna interference as a tool for exploring hiv  robustness
short interfering rnas sirnas that target viral genes can efficiently inhibit human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  replication nevertheless there is the potential for viral escape particularly with a highly mutable target such as hiv  we present a novel strategy for anticipating and preventing viral escape using second generation sirnas the evolutionary capacity of hiv  was tested by exerting strong selective pressure on a highly conserved sequence in the hiv  genome we assayed the antiviral efficacy of five overlapping sirnas directed against an essential region of the hiv  protease serial viral transfers in u  cd cxcr cells were performed using four of the sirnas this procedure was repeated until virus breakthrough was detected after several serial culture passages resistant virus with a single point mutation in the targeted region was detected in the culture supernatants the emergence of resistant virus was confirmed by molecular cloning and dna sequencing of viral rna the most common escape route was the d n mutation importantly the addition of a second generation sirna that matched the d n mutation restored viral inhibition and delayed development of escape variants passages performed with both sirnas prevented the emergence of the d n escape mutant and forced the virus to develop new escape routes thus second generation sirnas can be used to block escape from rna interference rnai and to search for new rnai escape routes the protocol described here may be useful for exploring the sequence space available for hiv  evolution and for producing attenuated or deleterious viruses
