a kinetic intermediate that regulates proper folding of a group ii intron rna
the d  group ii intron ribozyme follows a unique folding pathway that is direct and appears to be devoid of kinetic traps during the earliest stages of folding d  collapses slowly to a compact intermediate and all subsequent assembly events are rapid collapse of intron domain  d  has been shown to limit the rate constant for d  folding although the specific substructure of the d kinetic intermediate has not yet been identified employing time resolved nucleotide analog interference mapping we have identified a cluster of atoms within the d main stem that control the rate constant for d  collapse functional groups within the     element are particularly important for this earliest stage of folding which is intriguing given that this same motif also serves later as the docking site for catalytic domain  more important the     element is shown to be a divalent ion binding pocket indicating that this region is a mg  dependent switch that initiates the cascade of d  folding events by measuring the mg  dependence of the compaction rate constant we conclude that the actual rate limiting step in d compaction involves the formation of an unstable folding intermediate that is captured by the binding of mg  this carefully orchestrated folding pathway in which formation of an active site docking region is early and rate limiting ensures proper folding of the intron core and faithful splicing it may represent an important paradigm for the folding of large multidomain rna molecules
