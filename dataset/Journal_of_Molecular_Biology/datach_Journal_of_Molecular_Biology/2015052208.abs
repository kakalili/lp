thermodynamic analysis of the disorder to  helical transition of   kda myelin basic protein reveals an equilibrium intermediate representing the most compact conformation
the intrinsically disordered    kda isoform of myelin basic protein mbp is a peripheral membrane protein that is essential to proper myelin formation in the central nervous system mbp acts in oligodendrocytes both to adjoin membrane leaflets to each other in forming myelin and as a hub in numerous protein  protein and protein  membrane interaction networks like many intrinsically disordered proteins idps  mbp multifunctionality arises from its high conformational plasticity and its ability to undergo reversible disorder to order transitions one such transition is the disorder to  helical conformational change that is induced upon mbp  membrane binding here we have investigated the disorder to  helical transition of mbp derived  peptides and the full length   kda protein this transition was induced through titration of the membrane mimetic solvent trifluoroethanol into both protein and peptide solutions and conformational change was monitored using circular dichroism spectroscopy  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonic acid binding tryptophan fluorescence quenching and f rster fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements the data suggest that the disorder to  helical transition of mbp follows a  state model disordered  intermediate   helical with each of the identified equilibrium states likely representing a conformational ensemble the disordered state is characterized by slight compaction with little regular secondary structure whereas the intermediate is also disordered but globally more compact surprisingly the  helical conformation is less compact than the intermediate this study suggests that multifunctionality in mbp could arise from differences in the population of energetically distinct ensembles under different conditions and also provides an example of an idp that undergoes cooperative global conformation change
