dramatic stabilization of an sh domain by a single substitution roles of the folded and unfolded states edited by c r matthews
the n terminal sh domain of the drosophila drk protein drkn sh  exists in equilibrium between folded and unfolded states under non denaturing buffer conditions in order to examine the origins of this instability we have made mutations in the domain and characterized the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding results of substitutions of negatively charged residues to neutral amino acid residues suggest that the large electrostatic potential of the domain does not play a dominant role in the instability of the domain sequence alignment of a large number of sh domains reveals that the drkn sh domain has a threonine t  at a position corresponding to an otherwise highly conserved glycine residue in the diverging  turn connecting the   and   strands mutation of t  to glycine results in significant stabilization of the drkn sh domain by   kcal mole to further characterize the basis for the stabilization of the t  mutant relative to wild type we made additional mutant proteins with substitutions of residue t  a strong correlation is seen between protein stability or folding rate and propensity for native  turn structure at this position correlation of folding rates with agadir predictions of non native helical structure in the diverging turn region along with our previous nmr evidence for non native structure in this region of the unfolded state of the drkn sh domain suggests that the free energy of the unfolded state also plays a role in stability this result highlights the importance of both folded and unfolded states for understanding protein stability
