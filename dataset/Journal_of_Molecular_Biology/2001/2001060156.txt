P-type ATPases convert chemical energy into electrochemical gradients that are used to energize secondary active transport. Analysis of the structure and function of P-type ATPases has been limited by the lack of active recombinant ATPases in quantities suitable for crystallographic studies aiming at solving their three-dimensional structure. We have expressed Arabidopsis thaliana plasma membrane H+-ATPase isoform AHA2, equipped with a His6-tag, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The H+-ATPase could be purified both in the presence and in the absence of regulatory 14-3-3 protein depending on the presence of the diterpene fusicoccin which specifically induces formation of the H+-ATPase/14-3-3 protein complex. Amino acid analysis of the purified complex suggested a stoichiometry of two 14-3-3 proteins per H+-ATPase polypeptide. The purified H+-ATPase readily formed two-dimensional crystals following reconstitution into lipid vesicles. Electron cryo-microscopy of the crystals yielded a projection map at ∼8 Å resolution, the p22121 symmetry of which suggests a dimeric protein complex. Three distinct regions of density of approximately equal size are apparent and may reflect different domains in individual molecules of AHA2.
