hairpin mediated nucleation of polyglutamine amyloid formation
the conformational preferences of polyglutamine polyq sequences are of major interest because of their central importance in the expanded cag repeat diseases that include huntington s disease here we explore the response of various biophysical parameters to the introduction of  hairpin motifs within polyq sequences these motifs tryptophan zipper disulfide d pro gly coulombic attraction l pro gly enhance formation rates and stabilities of amyloid fibrils with degrees of effectiveness well correlated with their known abilities to enhance  hairpin formation in other peptides these changes led to decreases in the critical nucleus for amyloid formation from a value of n  for a simple unbroken q  sequence to approximate unitary n values for similar length polyqs containing  hairpin motifs at the same time the morphologies secondary structures and bioactivities of the resulting fibrils were essentially unchanged from simple polyq aggregates in particular the signature pattern of solid state nmr  c gln resonances that appears to be unique to polyq amyloid is replicated exactly in fibrils from a  hairpin polyq importantly while  hairpin motifs do produce enhancements in the equilibrium constant for nucleation in aggregation reactions these kn values remain quite low      and there is no evidence for significant enhancement of  structure within the monomer ensemble the results indicate an important role for  turns in the nucleation mechanism and structure of polyq amyloid and have implications for the nature of the toxic species in expanded cag repeat diseases
