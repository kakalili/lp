two modular forms of the mitochondrial sorting and assembly machinery are involved in biogenesis of  helical outer membrane proteins
the mitochondrial outer membrane contains two translocase machineries for precursor proteins  the translocase of the outer membrane tom complex and the sorting and assembly machinery sam complex  the tom complex functions as the main mitochondrial entry gate for nuclear encoded proteins whereas the sam complex was identified according to its function in the biogenesis of  barrel proteins of the outer membrane the sam complex is required for the assembly of precursors of the tom complex including not only the  barrel protein tom  but also a subset of  helical subunits while the interaction of  barrel proteins with the sam complex has been studied in detail little is known about the interaction between the sam complex and  helical precursor proteins we report that the sam is not static but that the sam core complex can associate with different partner proteins to form two large sam complexes with different functions in the biogenesis of  helical tom proteins we found that a subcomplex of tom tom  tom  associates with the sam core complex to form a new large sam complex this sam  tom tom  complex binds the  helical precursor of tom after the precursor has been inserted into the outer membrane in an mim  mitochondrial import protein  dependent manner the second large sam complex sam  mdm  mitochondrial distribution and morphology protein  binds the  helical precursor of tom  and promotes its membrane integration we suggest that the modular composition of the sam complex provides a flexible platform to integrate the sorting pathways of different precursor proteins and to promote their assembly into oligomeric complexes
