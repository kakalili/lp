complexes of porcine odorant binding protein with odorant molecules belonging to different chemical classes edited by r huber
porcine odorant binding protein pobp is a monomer of   amino acid residues purified in abundance from pig nasal mucosa in contrast to the observation on lipocalins as retinol binding protein rbp  major urinary protein mup or bovine odorant binding protein bobp  no naturally occurring ligand was found in the  barrel cavity of pobp porcine obp was therefore chosen as a simple model for structure function studies with odorant molecules in competition experiments with tritiated pyrazine the affinity of pobp towards several odorant molecules belonging to different chemical classes has been found to be of the micromolar order with a   stoichiometry the x ray structures of pobp complexed to these molecules were determined at resolution between   and     as expected the electron density of the odorant molecules was observed into the hydrophobic  barrel of the lipocalin inside this cavity very few specific interactions were established between the odorant molecule and the amino acid side chains which did not undergo significant conformational change the high b factors observed for the odorant molecules as well as the existence of alternative conformations reveal a non specific mode of binding of the odorant molecules in the cavity
