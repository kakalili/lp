refolding and polymerization pathways of neuroserpin
neuroserpin is a member of the serpin superfamily and its mutants are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons as ordered polymers in association with dementia it has been proposed that neuroserpin polymers are formed by a conformational change in the folded protein however an alternative model whereby polymers are formed during protein folding rather than from the folded protein has recently been proposed we investigated the refolding and polymerization pathways of wild type neuroserpin wt and of the pathogenic mutants s p and h  r upon refolding denatured wt immediately formed an initial refolding intermediate iin and then underwent further refolding to the native form through a late refolding intermediate ir the late onset mutant s p was also able to refold to the native form through iin and ir but the final refolding step proceeded at a slower rate and with a lower refolding yield as compared with wt the early onset mutant h  r formed ir through the same pathway as s p but the protein could not attain the native state and remained as ir the irs of the mutants had a long lifespan at   c and thus were purified and characterized strikingly when incubated under physiological conditions ir formed ordered polymers with essentially the same properties as the polymers formed from the native protein the results show that the mutants have a greater tendency to form polymers during protein folding than to form polymers from the folded protein our finding provides insights into biochemical approaches to treating serpinopathies by targeting a polymerogenic folding intermediate
