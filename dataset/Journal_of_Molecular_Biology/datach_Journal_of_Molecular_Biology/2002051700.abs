evidence that the kh rna binding domains influence the action of the e coli nusa protein
the nusa transcription elongation protein which binds rna contains sequences corresponding to the s and kh classes of identified rna binding domains an essential function in e coli nusa is also one of the host factors required for action of the n transcription antitermination protein of   tandem kh domains have been identified downstream of the s domain we changed the first gly to asp of the gxxg motif a tetrapeptide diagnostic of kh domains of both nusa kh domains the change in the first g  d has a large effect while the change in the second g  d has a small effect on nusa action the changes in both kh domains interfere with nusa binding to rna a change of a highly conserved arg in the s domain r  a has previously been reported to interfere with rna binding while exerting a small effect on nusa action however a nusa allele with both the r  a and g  d changes encodes a functionally inactive nusa protein these studies provide direct evidence that the both kh as well as the s rna binding domains are important for nusa action in support of bacterial viability as well as transcription antitermination mediated by the  n protein
