key residues of s flexneri ompa mediate infection by bacteriophage sf
many viruses including bacteriophage have the inherent ability to utilize several types of proteinaceous receptors as an attachment mechanism to infect cells yet the molecular mechanisms that drive receptor binding have not been elucidated using bacteriophage sf and its host shigella flexneri we investigated how sf utilizes outer membrane protein a ompa for infection specifically we identified that surface loops of ompa mediate shigella infection we further characterized which residues in the surface loops are responsible for sf binding and productive infection using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches including site directed mutagenesis phage plaque assays circular dichroism spectroscopy and in vitro genome ejection assays our data indicate that sf can productively interact with other bacterial ompas as long as they share homology in loops  and  suggesting that these loops may determine host specificity our data provide a model in which sf interacts with ompa using the surface of the protein and new insights into viral attachment through binding to membrane protein receptors
