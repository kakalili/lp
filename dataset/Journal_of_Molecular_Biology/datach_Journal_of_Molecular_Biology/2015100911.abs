the first crystal structure of the up domain of hnrnp a bound to rna reveals a new look for an old rna binding protein
the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp a protein is a multifunctional rna binding protein implicated in a wide range of biological functions mechanisms and putative hnrnp a  rna interactions have been inferred primarily from the crystal structure of its up domain bound to ssdna rna stem loops represent an important class of known hnrnp a targets yet little is known about the structural basis of hnrnp a  rna recognition here we report the first high resolution structure     of up bound to a   agu   trinucleotide that resembles sequence elements of several native hnrnp a  rna stem loop targets up interacts specifically with the ag dinucleotide sequence via a  nucleobase pocket  formed by the  sheet surface of rrm and the inter rrm linker rrm does not contact the rna the inter rrm linker forms the lid of the nucleobase pocket and we show using structure guided mutagenesis that the conserved salt bridge interactions r  d  and r  d   on the  helical side of the rna binding surface stabilize the linker in a geometry poised to bind rna we further investigated the structural basis of up binding hivisl ess by determining a structural model of the complex scored by small angle x ray scattering up docks on the apical loop of sl ess using its rrm domain and inter rrm linker only the biophysical implications of the structural model were tested by measuring kinetic binding parameters where mutations introduced within the apical loop reduce binding affinities by slowing down the rate of complex formation collectively the data presented here provide the first insights into hnrnp a  rna interactions
