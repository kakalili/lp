Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) is the major protein component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Elevated levels of HDL in the bloodstream have been shown to correlate strongly with a reduced risk factor for atherosclerosis. Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on three separate model discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles (HDL) containing two monomers of apo A-I and 160 molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), to a time-scale of 1ns. The starting structures were on the basis of previously published molecular belt models of HDL consisting of the lipid-binding C-terminal domain (residues 44â€“243) wrapped around the circumference of a discoidal HDL particle. Subtle changes between two of the starting structures resulted in significantly different behavior during the course of the simulation. The results provide support for the hypothesis of Segrest et al. that helical registration in the molecular belt model of apo A-I is modulated by intermolecular salt bridges. In addition, we propose an explanation for the presence of proline punctuation in the molecular belt model, and for the presence of two 11-mer helical repeats interrupting the otherwise regular pattern of 22-mer helical repeats in the lipid-binding domain of apo A-I.
