remote control by inter enzyme allostery a novel paradigm for regulation of the shikimate pathway
dahp synthase and chorismate mutase catalyze key steps in the shikimate biosynthetic pathway en route to aromatic amino acids in mycobacterium tuberculosis chorismate mutase mtcm rv  c  located at the branch point toward phenylalanine and tyrosine has poor activity on its own however it is efficiently activated by the first enzyme of the pathway dahp synthase mtds rv  c  through formation of a non covalent mtcm  mtds complex here we show how mtds serves as an allosteric platform for feedback regulation of both enzymes using x ray crystallography small angle x ray scattering size exclusion chromatography and multi angle light scattering crystal structures of the fully inhibited mtds and the allosterically down regulated mtcm  mtds complex solved at   and    respectively reveal how effector binding at the internal mtds subunit interfaces regulates the activity of mtds and mtcm while binding of all three metabolic end products to mtds shuts down the entire pathway the binding of phenylalanine jointly with tyrosine releases mtcm from the mtcm  mtds complex hence suppressing mtcm activation by inter enzyme allostery  this elegant regulatory principle invoking a transient allosteric enzyme interaction seems to be driven by dynamics and is likely a general strategy used by nature
