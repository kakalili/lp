first experimental evidence for the presence of a crispr toxin in sulfolobus
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr and crispr associated cas genes constitute the adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea although the crispr cas systems have been hypothesized to encode potential toxins no experimental data supporting the hypothesis are available in the literature in this work we provide the first experimental evidence for the presence of a toxin gene in the type i a crispr system of hyperthermophilic archaeon sulfolobus csa  under the control of its native promoter in a shuttle vector could not be transformed into crispr deficient mutant sulfolobus solfataricus sens  demonstrating a strong toxicity in the cells a single amino acid mutation destroying the intersubunit bridge of csa attenuated the toxicity indicative of the importance of csa oligomerization for its toxicity in line with the absence of csa toxicity in s solfataricus inf containing functional crispr systems the expression of csa is repressed in inf cells induced from the arabinose promoter in sens cells csa oligomers resistant to  sds co occur with chromosome degradation and cell death reinforcing the connection between csa oligomerization and its toxicity importantly a rudivirus was shown to induce csa expression and the formation of sds resistant csa oligomers in sulfolobus cells this demonstrates that the derepression of csa and the subsequent csa oligomerization take place in native virus host systems thus csa is likely to act as a suicide gene under certain circumstances to inhibit virus spreading
