ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of the microtubule end binding protein  eb  is controlled by the cop signalosome possible consequences for microtubule filament stability
the cop signalosome csn is a regulatory particle of the ubiquitin ub proteasome system ups consisting of eight subunits csn  csn  we show that the csn stabilizes the microtubule end binding protein  eb  towards degradation by the ups eb  the master regulator of microtubule plus ends controls microtubule growth and dynamics therefore regulation of eb stability by the csn has consequences for microtubule function eb binds the csn via subunit csn  the c terminus of eb is sufficient for interaction with the csn dimerization of eb is a prerequisite for complex association and subsequent csn mediated phosphorylation as revealed by studies with the eb i  a mutant which is unable to dimerize in cells eb and csn co localize to the centrosome as demonstrated by confocal fluorescence microscopy eb is ubiquitinated and its proteolysis can be inhibited by mg   demonstrating that it is a substrate of the ups its degradation is accelerated by inhibition of csn associated kinases hela cells permanently expressing sirnas against csn  sicsn  or csn  sicsn  exhibit reduced levels of the csn complex accompanied by lower steady state concentrations of eb  in sicsn cells eb is less phosphorylated as compared with control cells demonstrating that the protein is most likely protected towards the ups by csn mediated phosphorylation the csn dependent eb stabilization is not due to the csn associated deubiquitinating enzyme usp  treatment with nocodazole revealed a significantly increased sensitivity of sicsn and sicsn cells towards the microtubule depolymerizing drug accompanied by a collapse of microtubule filaments a nocodazole induced cell cycle arrest was partially rescued by csn or eb  these data demonstrate that the csn dependent protection of eb is important for microtubule function
