key elements in maintenance of the trna l shape
based on in vivo selection of effective suppressor trnas from two different combinatorial gene libraries in which several nucleotides in the d and t loops were randomized we show that the position of the reverse hoogsteen base pair in the t loop normally formed between nucleotides     co varies with the length of the d domain when the d domain has the normal length the position of the reverse hoogsteen base pair in the t loop is always such that it allocates two unpaired nucleotides     for the bulge that fills the space between the d and t domains however when the d domain becomes shorter the position of the reverse hoogsteen base pair changes in the way that more nucleotides are now allocated to the t loop bulge so that the total length of the d domain and of the bulge remains the same such compensation guarantees that in all trnas the d and t domains are always juxtaposed in the standard way it also demonstrates the major role of the two t loop elements the bulge and the reverse hoogsteen base pair in the formation of the canonical trna l shape
