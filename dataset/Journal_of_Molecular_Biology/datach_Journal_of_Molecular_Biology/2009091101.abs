crystal structure of miner  the redox active fe s protein causative in wolfram syndrome
the endoplasmic reticulum protein miner is essential for health and longevity mis splicing of cisd  which codes for miner  is causative in wolfram syndrome  wfs  resulting in early onset optic atrophy diabetes mellitus deafness and decreased lifespan in knock out studies disruption of cisd leads to accelerated aging blindness and muscle atrophy in this work we characterized the soluble region of human miner and solved its crystal structure to a resolution of     r factor    although originally annotated as a zinc finger we show that miner is a homodimer harboring two redox active fe s clusters indicating for the first time an association of a redox active fes protein with wfs  each fe s cluster is bound by a rare cys his motif within a  amino acid segment miner is the first functionally different protein that shares the neet fold with its recently identified paralog mitoneet an outer mitochondrial membrane protein we report the first measurement of the redox potentials em of miner and mitoneet showing that they are proton coupled with em    mv at ph   changes in the ph sensitivity of their cluster stabilities are attributed to significant differences in the electrostatic distribution and surfaces between the two proteins the structural and biophysical results are discussed in relation to possible roles of miner in cellular fe s management and redox reactions
