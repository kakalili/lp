increased backbone mobility in  barrel enhances entropy gain driving binding of n timp  to mmp
the high affinity inhibition of stromelysin  mmp  by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  timp  helps control tissue remodeling and tumor development the interaction of n timp  with the catalytic domain of mmp  has been investigated by titration calorimetry and  n nmr their unfavorable enthalpy of binding of   kcalmol   is unusual among protein  protein associations deviates from structure based prediction and is compensated by a net entropy increase providing at least  kcalmol   of favorable free energy of binding at a m reference state the small heat capacity of binding agrees well with the heat capacity predicted from   of the surface buried on binding being polar and suggests that the hydrophobic effect can account for only part of the entropy of binding using nmr binding induced changes in the backbone of n timp  were checked as one possible source of conformational entropy changes mmp binding slightly increases rigidity in some contact sites in timp  but increases mobility remotely in the otherwise rigid  barrel core of n timp  increasing  n relaxation evidence of pico to nanosecond and micro to millisecond fluctuations of  strands a  f residual dipolar couplings suggest dynamic deviations from x ray coordinates of the complex these suggest that the  barrel has small backbone conformational fluctuations while segments of strands  b  e and  f might experience fluctuations only in their backbone environment this is a distinctive example of affinity between two well structured proteins being enhanced by increased conformational entropy in the reservoir of a folding core
