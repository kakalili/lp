engineering an ultra thermostable   adrenoceptor
conformational thermostabilisation of g protein coupled receptors is a successful strategy for their structure determination the thermostable mutants tolerate short chain detergents such as octylglucoside and nonylglucoside which are ideal for crystallography and in addition the receptors are preferentially in a single conformational state the first thermostabilised receptor to have its structure determined was the   adrenoceptor mutant  ar m  bound to the antagonist cyanopindolol and recently additional structures have been determined with agonist bound here we describe further stabilisation of  ar m  by the addition of three thermostabilising mutations i  v d  k and y  l to make a mutant receptor that is    c more thermostable than the wild type receptor in dodecylmaltoside and is    c more thermostable than  ar m  in nonylglucoside although a number of thermostabilisation methods were tried including rational design of disulfide bonds and engineered zinc bridges the two most successful strategies to improve the thermostability of  ar m  were an engineered salt bridge and leucine scanning mutagenesis the three additional thermostabilising mutations did not significantly affect the pharmacological properties of  ar m  but the new mutant receptor was significantly more stable in short chain detergents such as heptylthioglucoside and denaturing detergents such as sds
