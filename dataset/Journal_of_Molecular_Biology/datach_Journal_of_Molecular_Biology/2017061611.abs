drug binding poses relate structure with efficacy in the  opioid receptor
the  opioid receptor mopr is a clinically important g protein coupled receptor that couples to gi o proteins and arrestins at present the receptor conformational changes that occur following agonist binding and activation are poorly understood this study has employed molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding mode and receptor conformational changes induced by structurally similar opioid ligands of widely differing intrinsic agonist efficacy norbuprenorphine buprenorphine and diprenorphine bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays for gi activation and arrestin  recruitment in human embryonic kidney   cells confirmed that norbuprenorphine is a high efficacy agonist buprenorphine a low efficacy agonist and diprenorphine an antagonist at the mopr molecular dynamics simulations revealed that these ligands adopt distinct binding poses and engage different subsets of residues despite sharing a common morphinan scaffold notably norbuprenorphine interacted with sodium ion coordinating residues w    and n     whilst buprenorphine and diprenorphine did not principal component analysis of the movements of the receptor transmembrane domains showed that the buprenorphine bound receptor occupied a distinct set of conformations to the norbuprenorphine bound receptor addition of an allosteric sodium ion caused the receptor and ligand to adopt an inactive conformation the differences in ligand  residue interactions and receptor conformations observed here may underlie the differing efficacies for cellular signalling outputs for these ligands
