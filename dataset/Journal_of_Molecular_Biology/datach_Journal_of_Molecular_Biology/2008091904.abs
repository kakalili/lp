recent avian h n viruses exhibit increased propensity for acquiring human receptor specificity
adaptation of avian influenza viruses for replication and transmission in the human host is believed to require mutations in the hemagglutinin glycoprotein ha which enable binding to human    sialosides and concomitant reduction in affinity for avian    linked sialosides here we show by glycan microarray analyses that the two mutations responsible for such specificity changes in   h n and   h n pandemic viruses when inserted into recombinant has or intact viruses of some recent avian h n isolates clade    impart such attributes this propensity to adapt to human receptors is primarily dependent on arginine at position   within the receptor binding site as well as loss of a vicinal glycosylation site widespread occurrence of these susceptible h n clade   influenza strains has already occurred in europe the middle east and africa thus these avian strains should be considered high risk because of their significantly lower threshold for acquiring human receptor specificity and therefore warrant increased surveillance and further study
