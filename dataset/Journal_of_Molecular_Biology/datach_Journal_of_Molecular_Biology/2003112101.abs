the crystal structure of the n terminal region of the alpha subunit of translation initiation factor  eif   from saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a view of the loop containing serine   the target of the eif  specific kinases
the  subunit of translation initiation factor  eif   is the target of specific kinases that can phosphorylate a conserved serine residue as part of a mechanism for regulating protein expression at the translational level in eukaryotes the structure of the  kda n terminal region of eif  from saccharomyces cerevisiae was determined by x ray crystallography at    resolution in most respects the structure is similar to that of the recently solved human eif   the rather elongated protein contains a five stranded antiparallel  barrel in its n terminal region followed by an almost entirely helical domain the s cerevisiae eif  lacks a disulfide bridge that is present in the homologous protein in humans and some of the other higher eukaryotes interestingly a conserved loop consisting of residues     and containing serine   the putative phosphorylation site is visible in the electron density maps of the s cerevisiae eif   most of this functionally important loop was not observed in the crystal structure of the human protein this loop is relatively exposed to solvent and contains two short   helices in addition to some extended structure serine  is located at the c terminal end of one of the   helices and near several conserved positively charged residues the side chain of serine  is sufficiently exposed so that its phosphorylation would not necessitate a substantial change in the protein structure the structures and relative positions of residues that have been implicated in kinase binding and in the interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factor eif b are described
