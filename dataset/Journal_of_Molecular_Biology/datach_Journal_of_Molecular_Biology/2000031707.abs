thermal unfolding of an intermediate is associated with non arrhenius kinetics in the folding of hen lysozyme edited by c r matthews
a variety of techniques including quenched flow hydrogen exchange labelling monitored by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and stopped flow absorbance fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy has been used to investigate the refolding kinetics of hen lysozyme over a temperature range from   c to   c simple arrhenius behaviour is not observed and although the overall rate of folding increases from  to   c it decreases above   c in addition the transient intermediate on the major folding pathway at   c in which the  domain is persistently structured in the absence of a stable  domain is thermally unfolded in a sigmoidal transition tm    c indicative of a cooperatively folded state at all temperatures however there is evidence for fast      and slow      populations of refolding molecules by using transition state theory the kinetic data from various experiments were jointly fitted to a sequential three state model for the slow folding pathway together with previous findings these results indicate that the  domain intermediate is a productive species on the folding route between the denatured and native states and which accumulates as a consequence of its intrinsic stability our analysis suggests that the temperature dependence of the rate constant for lysozyme folding depends on both the total change in the heat capacity between the ground and transition states the dominant factor at low temperatures and the heat induced destabilization of the  domain intermediate the dominant factor at high temperatures  destablization of such kinetically competent intermediate species is likely to be a determining factor in the non arrhenius temperature dependence of the folding rate of those proteins for which one or more intermediates are populated
