phosphorylation and prolyl isomerization independently regulate the signal adapter function of crkii
the signaling protein crkii switches between forms with high or low binding affinity both phosphorylation and native state prolyl isomerization were suggested to regulate the transition between these forms here we analyzed how phosphorylation at tyr  and tyr  and the pro  ala substitution affect signal transfer of human and chicken crkii to a downstream target human crkii is regulated by phosphorylation only but chicken crkii is regulated by pro  trans  cis isomerization and by tyr  phosphorylation surprisingly they act in an independent fashion apparently the allosteric transition to a low activity form can be induced by phosphorylation or prolyl isomerization located at distant sites in crkii
