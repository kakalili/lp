a structural hinge in eukaryotic muty homologues mediates catalytic activity and rad  rad  hus checkpoint complex interactions
the dna glycosylase muty homologue myh or mutyh removes adenines misincorporated opposite  oxoguanine as part of the base excision repair pathway importantly defects in human myh hmyh activity cause the inherited colorectal cancer syndrome myh associated polyposis a key feature of myh activity is its coordination with cell cycle checkpoint via interaction with the rad  rad  hus     complex the    complex facilitates cell cycle checkpoint activity and coordinates this activity with ongoing dna repair the interdomain connector idc residues      between the catalytic domain and the  oxoguanine recognition domain of hmyh is a critical element that maintains interactions with the    complex we report the first crystal structure of a eukaryotic muty protein a fragment of hmyh residues      that consists of the catalytic domain and the idc our structure reveals that the idc adopts a stabilized conformation projecting away from the catalytic domain to form a docking scaffold for    we further examined the role of the idc using schizosaccharomyces pombe myh as model system in vitro studies of s pombe myh identified residues i  and e  of the idc equivalent to v  and e  of the hmyh idc as critical for maintaining the myh    interaction we determined that the eukaryotic idc is also required for dna damage selection and robust enzymatic activity our studies also provide the first evidence that disruption of the myh    interaction diminishes the repair of oxidative dna damage in vivo thus preserving the myh    interaction contributes significantly to minimizing the mutagenic potential of oxidative dna damage
