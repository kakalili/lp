the structural basis of the kinetic mechanism of a gap filling x family dna polymerase that binds mg  dntp before binding to dna
dna with single nucleotide  nt gaps can arise during various dna processing events these lesions are repaired by x family dna polymerases polxs with high gap filling activity some polxs can bind productively to dntps in the absence of dna and fill these  nt gaps although polxs have a crucial role in efficient gap filling currently little is known of the kinetic and structural details of their productive dntp binding here we show that thermus thermophilus hb polx ttpolx had strong binding affinity for mg  dntps in the absence of dna and that it follows a theorell  chance hit and run mechanism with nucleotide binding first comparison of the intermediate crystal structures of ttpolx in a binary complex with dgtp and in a ternary complex with  nt gapped dna and mg  ddgtp revealed that the conformation of the incoming nucleotide depended on whether or not dna was present furthermore the lys  residue located between two guanosine conformations was essential to the strong binding affinity of the enzyme the ability to bind to either syn dntp or anti dntp and the involvement of a theorell  chance mechanism are key aspects of the strong nucleotide binding and efficient gap filling activities of ttpolx
