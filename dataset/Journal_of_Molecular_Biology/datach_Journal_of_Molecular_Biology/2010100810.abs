multifactorial determinants of protein expression in prokaryotic open reading frames
a quantitative description of the relationship between protein expression levels and open reading frame orf nucleotide sequences is important for understanding natural systems designing synthetic systems and optimizing heterologous expression codon identity mrna secondary structure and nucleotide composition within orfs markedly influence expression levels bioinformatic analysis of orf sequences in   bacterial genomes revealed that these features show distinct regional trends to investigate their effects on protein expression we designed   synthetic genes and determined corresponding expression levels in vitro using escherichia coli extracts we developed a mathematical function parameterized using this synthetic gene data set which enables computation of protein expression levels from orf nucleotide sequences in addition to its practical application in the design of heterologous expression systems this equation provides mechanistic insight into the factors that control translation efficiency we found that expression is strongly dependent on the presence of high au content and low secondary structure in the orf   region choice of high frequency codons contributes to a lesser extent the   terminal au content makes modest but detectable contributions we present a model for the effect of these factors on the three phases of ribosomal function initiation elongation and termination
