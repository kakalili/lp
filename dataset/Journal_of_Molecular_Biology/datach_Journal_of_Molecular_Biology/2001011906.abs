similarities in sunlight induced mutational spectra of cpg methylated transgenes and the p  gene in skin cancer point to an important role of  methylcytosine residues in solar uv mutagenesis edited by j miller
in the p  gene of human sunlight associated skin cancers    of the mutations involve trinucleotide sequences with the rare base  methylcytosine   pymcg  in order to determine the involvement of  methylcytosine in sunlight induced mutations we have analyzed the cii transgene in mouse cells a mutational target gene that we found is methylated at most cpg sequences we report that the mutational spectra produced by irradiation with   nm uvc radiation and simulated sunlight respectively differ most dramatically by the much higher involvement of dipyrimidine structures containing  methylcytosine in the solar uv mutation spectrum    versus   of all mutations  a distinct mutational hotpsot induced by simulated sunlight occurs at a sequence   tmcg and is associated with high levels of cis syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer formation a comparison of sunlight induced mutational spectra of the cii and laci transgenes as well as the p  gene in skin tumors shows that  methylcytosine is involved in  to   of all mutations in all three systems the combined data make a strong case that cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers forming preferentially at dipyrimidine sequences with  methylcytosine are responsible for a considerable fraction of the mutations induced by sunlight in mammalian cells
