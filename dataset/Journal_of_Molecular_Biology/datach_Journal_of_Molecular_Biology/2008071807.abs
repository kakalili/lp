crystal structures and mutagenesis of sucrose hydrolase from xanthomonas axonopodis pv glycines insight into the exclusively hydrolytic amylosucrase fold
neisseria polysaccharea amylosucrase npas  a transglucosidase of glycoside hydrolase family   is a hydrolase and glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of amylose like polymer from a sucrose substrate recently an npas homolog from xanthomonas axonopodis pv glycines was identified as a member of the newly defined carbohydrate utilization locus that regulates the utilization of plant sucrose in phytopathogenic bacteria interestingly this enzyme is exclusively a hydrolase and not a glucosyltransferase it is thus known as sucrose hydrolase suh  here we elucidated the novel functional features of suh using x ray crystallography and site directed mutagenesis four different crystal structures of suh including the suh  tris and the suh  sucrose and suh  glucose complexes represent structural snapshots along the catalytic reaction coordinate these structures show that suh is distinctly different from npas in that ligand induced conformational changes in suh cause the formation of a pocket shaped active site and in that suh lacks the three arginine residues found in the npas active site that appear to be crucial for npas glucosyltransferase activity mutation of suh to insert these arginines failed to confer glucosyltransferase activity providing evidence that its enzymatic activity is limited to sucrose hydrolysis by its pocket shaped active site and the identity of residues in the vicinity of the active site
