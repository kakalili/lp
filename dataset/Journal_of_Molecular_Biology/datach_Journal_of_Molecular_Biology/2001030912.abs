dynamic interaction of camp with the rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor epac  edited by a r fersht
epac is a rap specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor gef which is activated by the binding of camp to a cyclic nucleotide monophosphate cnmp binding domain we investigated the equilibrium and dynamics of the interaction of camp and epac using a newly designed fluorescence analogue of camp  maba camp we observed that the interaction of camp measured by competition with  maba camp with an isolated cnmp binding domain of epac has an overall equilibrium constant kd of   m and that the kinetics of the interaction are highly dynamic the binding properties of camp are apparently not affected when the catalytic domain is present despite the fact that binding of camp results in activation of epac  this indicates that for the activation process no appreciable binding energy is required however when bound to rap b the apparent kd of epac to camp was about fivefold lower suggesting that substrate interaction stabilizes camp binding since the fluorescent analogues used here were either less able or unable to induce activation of epac  we concluded that the binding of nucleotide to epac and the activation of gef activity are uncoupled processes and that thus appropriate camp analogues can be used as inhibitors of the epac mediated signal transduction pathway of rap
