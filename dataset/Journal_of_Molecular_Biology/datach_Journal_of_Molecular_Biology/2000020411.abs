evidence for dna bending at the t rna polymerase promoter edited by r ebright
phage t rna polymerase is the only dna dependent rna polymerase for which we have a high resolution structure of the promoter bound complex recent studies with the more complex rna polymerases have suggested a role for dna wrapping in the initiation of transcription here circular permutation gel retardation assays provide evidence that the polymerase does indeed bend its promoter dna a complementary set of experiments employing differential phasing from an array of phased a tracts provides further evidence for both intrinsic and polymerase induced bends in the t rna polymerase promoter dna the bend in the complex is predicted to be about     and to be centered around positions   to   at the start site for transcription while the intrinsic bend is much smaller about    these results viewed in the light of a recent crystal structure for the complex suggest a mechanism by which binding leads directly to bending bending at the start site would then facilitate the melting necessary to initiate transcription
