structure and function of p  a high affinity iron transporter of the human pathogen campylobacter jejuni
campylobacter jejuni a major cause of acute bacterial diarrhea in humans expresses numerous proteins to import diverse forms of essential iron the expression of p  and an adjacent iron transporter homologue ftr  is strongly induced upon iron limitation suggesting a function in iron acquisition here we show that the loss of p  alone is detrimental to growth on iron restricted media furthermore metal binding analysis demonstrates that recombinant p  has distinct copper and iron binding sites crystal structures of p  have been solved to     resolution revealing an immunoglobulin like fold a p  homodimer in which both monomers contribute ligands to two equivalent copper sites located adjacent to methionine rich patches is observed copper coordination occurs via three histidine residues his  his  and his   and met  a solvent channel lined with conserved acidic residues leads to the copper site soaking crystals with a solution of manganese as iron analog reveals a second metal binding site in this solvent channel metal  metal distance      glu  lies between the metal sites and displays multiple conformations in the crystal structures suggesting a role in regulating metal  metal interaction dimerization is shown to be metal dependent in vitro and is detected in vivo by cross linking
