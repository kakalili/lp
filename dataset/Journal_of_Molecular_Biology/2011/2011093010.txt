The development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) is associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) into a misfolded, pathogenic isoform (PrPSc). Spontaneous generation of PrPSc in inherited forms of disease is caused by mutations in gene coding for PrP (PRNP). In this work, we describe the NMR solution-state structure of the truncated recombinant human PrP (HuPrP) carrying the pathological V210I mutation linked to genetic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. The three-dimensional structure of V210I mutant consists of an unstructured N-terminal part (residues 90–124) and a well-defined C-terminal domain (residues 125–228). The C-terminal domain contains three α-helices (residues 144–156, 170–194 and 200–228) and a short antiparallel β-sheet (residues 129–130 and 162–163). Comparison with the structure of the wild-type HuPrP revealed that although two structures share similar global architecture, mutation introduces some local structural differences. The observed variations are mostly clustered in the α2–α3 inter-helical interface and in the β2–α2 loop region. Introduction of bulkier Ile at position 210 induces reorientations of several residues that are part of hydrophobic core, thus influencing α2–α3 inter-helical interactions. Another important structural feature involves the alteration of conformation of the β2–α2 loop region and the subsequent exposure of hydrophobic cluster to solvent, which facilitates intermolecular interactions involved in spontaneous generation of PrPSc. The NMR structure of V210I mutant offers new clues about the earliest events of the pathogenic conversion process that could be used for the development of antiprion drugs.
