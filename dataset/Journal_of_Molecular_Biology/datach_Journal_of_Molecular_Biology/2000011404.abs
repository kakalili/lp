solution structure and backbone dynamics of the second pdz domain of postsynaptic density   edited by p e wright
the second pdz domain of postsynaptic density   psd  pdz  plays a critical role in coupling n methyl d aspartate receptors to neuronal nitric oxide synthase nnos  in this work the solution structure of psd  pdz was determined to high resolution by nmr spectroscopy the structure of psd  pdz was compared in detail with that of   syntrophin pdz domain as the pdz domains share similar target interaction properties the interaction of the psd  pdz with a carboxyl terminal peptide derived from a cytoplasmic protein capon was studied by nmr titration experiments complex formation between psd  pdz and the nnos pdz was modelled on the basis of the crystal structure of the   syntrophin pdz nnos pdz dimer we found that the prolonged loop connecting the  b and  c strands of psd  pdz is likely to play a role in both the binding of the carboxyl terminal peptide and the nnos  finger finally the backbone dynamics of the psd  pdz in the absence of bound peptide were studied using a model free approach the  glgf  loop and the loop connecting  b and  f of the protein display some degree of flexibility in solution the rest of the protein is rigid and lacks detectable slow time scale microseconds to milliseconds motions in particular the loop connecting  b and  c loop adopts a well defined rigid structure in solution it appears that the loop adopts a pre aligned conformation for the pdz domain to interact with its targets
