a thermodynamic basis of dna sequence selectivity by the ets domain of murine pu
the ets domain of the transcription factor pu  tolerates a large number of dna cognate variants that differ exclusively in the sequences flanking a critical central consensus    ggaa    we investigated the thermodynamics of site selection by the dna binding domain by following the pu  ets dna equilibrium with a large set of cognate variants under various temperature and salt conditions by filter binding our results indicate that the stability of the ets dna complex is quantitatively tied to variations in the change in heat capacity thermodynamic effects induced by changing na concentrations from   mm to   mm are complex and not readily interpreted by polyelectrolyte theory we also extended our understanding of data from our previous investigation on energetic base neighbour coupling by dissecting the thermodynamic contributions underlying the observed free energy coupling in conjunction with available structural and biochemical data we propose that site selectivity by the pu  ets domain arises from differential protein dna contacts in the flanking sequences that modulate the orientation of the ets recognition helix and trigger a coupled reduction in the flexibility observed in the unbound ets domain
