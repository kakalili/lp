structural and functional studies of the phage sf terminase small subunit reveal a dna spooling device facilitated by structural plasticity
in many dna viruses genome packaging is initiated by the small subunit of the packaging terminase which specifically binds to the packaging signal on viral dna and directs assembly of the terminase holoenzyme we have experimentally mapped the dna interacting region on shigella virus sf terminase small subunit gp  which occupies extended surface areas encircling the gp octamer indicating that dna wraps around gp through extensive contacts high  resolution structures reveal large scale motions of the gp dna binding domain mediated by the curved helix formed by residues     and an intermolecular salt bridge formed by residues arg  and glu  indicating remarkable structural plasticity underlying multivalent pleomorphic gp dna interactions these results provide spatial restraints for protein dna interactions which enable construction of a three dimensional pseudo atomic model for a dna packaging initiation complex assembled from the terminase small subunit and the packaging region on viral dna our results suggest that gp functions as a dna spooling device which may transform dna into a specific architecture appropriate for interaction with and cleavage by the terminase large subunit prior to dna translocation into viral procapsid this may represent a common mechanism for the initiation step of dna packaging in tailed double  stranded dna bacterial viruses
