The regulatory protein system in the skeletal muscle thin filaments is known to exhibit three discrete states, called “off” or “blocked” (no Ca2+), “on” or “closed” (with Ca2+ alone) and “potentiated” or “open” (with strongly bound myosin head) states. Biochemical studies have shown that only weak interactions with myosin are allowed in the second state. Characterization of each state is often difficult, because the equilibria among these states are readily shifted by experimental conditions. To overcome this problem, we chemically cross-linked the skeletal muscle thin filament in the three states with the zero-length cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC), in overstretched muscle fibers. The state of the regulatory proteins was monitored by measuring the intensity of the second actin layer-line (2nd LL) reflection in X-ray diffraction patterns. Structurally, the thin filaments cross-linked in the three states exhibited three corresponding discrete levels of 2nd LL intensities, which were not Ca2+-sensitive any more. Functionally, the thin filament cross-linked in the “off-blocked” state inhibited strong interaction with myosin head (subgfragment-1 or S1). The thin filament cross-linked in the “potentiated-open” state allowed strong interaction and full ATPase activity of S1 as described previously. The thin filament cross-linked in the “on-closed” state allowed strong interactions with S1 and actin-activated ATPase without enhancing the 2nd LL to the level of “potentiated-open” state, contrary to the expectations from the biochemical studies. The results demonstrate the potential of EDC as a tool for studying the states of calcium regulation, and the apparent uncoupling between the 2nd LL intensity and the function provides a new insight into the mechanism of thin filament regulation.
