coupling photoisomerization of retinal to directional transport in bacteriorhodopsin edited by d c rees
in order to understand how isomerization of the retinal drives unidirectional transmembrane ion transport in bacteriorhodopsin we determined the atomic structures of the br state and m photointermediate of the e  q mutant to   and    resolution respectively comparison of this m in which proton release to the extracellular surface is blocked with the previously determined m in the d n mutant indicates that the changes in the extracellular region are initiated by changes in the electrostatic interactions of the retinal schiff base with asp  and asp   but those on the cytoplasmic side originate from steric conflict of the  methyl retinal group with trp  and distortion of the  bulge of helix g the structural changes suggest that protonation of asp  initiates a cascade of atomic displacements in the extracellular region that cause release of a proton to the surface the progressive relaxation of the strained  cis retinal chain with deprotonated schiff base in turn initiates atomic displacements in the cytoplasmic region that cause the intercalation of a hydrogen bonded water molecule between thr  and asp  this accounts for the lowering of the pka of asp  which then reprotonates the schiff base via a newly formed chain of water molecules that is extending toward the schiff base
