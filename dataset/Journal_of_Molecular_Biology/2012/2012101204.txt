We analyzed sequences of newly inserted repeats in an Escherichia coli CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) array in vivo and showed that a base previously thought to belong to the repeat is actually derived from a protospacer. Based on further experimental results, we propose to use the term “duplicon” for a repeated sequence in a CRISPR array that serves as a template for a new duplicon. Our findings suggest the possibility of redrawing the borders between repeats, spacers, and protospacer adjacent motifs.
