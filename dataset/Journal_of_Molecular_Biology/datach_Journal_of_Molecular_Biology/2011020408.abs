time resolved small angle x ray scattering study of the folding dynamics of barnase
structural changes of barnase during folding were investigated using time resolved small angle x ray scattering saxs  the folding of barnase involves a burst phase intermediate sometimes designated as the denatured state under physiological conditions dphys and a second hidden intermediate equilibrium saxs measurements showed that the radius of gyration rg of the guanidine unfolded state u is        which remains largely constant over a wide denaturant concentration range time resolved saxs measurements showed that the rg value extrapolated from kinetic rg data to time zero rg  is        which is smaller than that of u but which is expanded from that of folding intermediates of other proteins with similar chain lengths      after the burst phase change a single exponential reduction in rg was observed which corresponds to the formation of the native state for the major component containing the native trans proline isomer we estimated rg of the minor component of dphys containing the non native cis proline isomer dphys cis to be        moreover rg of the major component of dphys containing the native proline isomer dphys tra was estimated as        based on rg  consequently both components of the burst phase intermediate of barnase dphys tra and dphys cis are still largely expanded it was inferred that dphys possesses the n terminal helix and the center of the  sheet formed independently and that the formation of the remainder of the protein occurs in the slower phase
