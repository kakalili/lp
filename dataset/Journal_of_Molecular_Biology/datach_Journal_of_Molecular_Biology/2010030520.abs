crystal structure of the atp dependent maturation factor of ni fe containing carbon monoxide dehydrogenases
cooc proteins are atpases involved in the incorporation of nickel into the complex active site  ni  fe  s  cluster of ni fe dependent carbon monoxide dehydrogenases the genome of the carboxydotrophic bacterium carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans encodes five carbon monoxide dehydrogenases and three cooc type proteins of which cooc was shown to be a nickel binding atpase we determined the crystal structure of cooc in four different states empty adp bound zn  adp bound and zn  bound the structure of cooc consists of two spatially separated functional modules an atpase module containing the deviant walker a motif and a metal binding module that confers the specific function of cooc  the atpase module is homologous to other members of the mind family and in analogy to the dimeric structure of atp bound soj is likely responsible for the atp dependent dimerization of cooc  its core topology classifies cooc as a member of the mind family of simibi signal recognition particle mind and biod class ntpases the crystal structure of zn  bound cooc reveals a conserved c x c motif as the metal binding site responsible for metal induced dimerization the competitive binding of ni  and zn  to cooc in solution confirms that the conserved c x c motif is also responsible for the interaction with ni  a comparison of the different cooc structures determined suggests a mutual dependence of metal binding site and nucleotide binding site
