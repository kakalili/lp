ab initio folding simulation of the trp cage mini protein approaches nmr resolution
here we report a  ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding process of a recently designed autonomous folding mini protein designated as tc b with a new amber force field parameter set developed based on condensed phase quantum mechanical calculations and a generalized born continuum solvent model starting from its fully extended conformation our simulation has produced a final structure resembling that of nmr native structure to within   main chain root mean square deviation remarkably the simulated structure stayed in the native state for most part of the simulation after it reached the state of greater significance is that our simulation has not only reached the correct main chain conformation but also a very high degree of accuracy in side chain packing conformation this feat has traditionally been a challenge for ab initio simulation studies in addition to characterization of the trajectory comparison of our results to experimental data is also presented analysis of the trajectory suggests that the rate limiting step of folding of this mini protein is the packing of the trp side chain
