alternate aggregation pathways of the alzheimer  amyloid peptide a  association kinetics at endosomal ph
the deposition of  amyloid peptide a  fibrils around neurons is an invariable feature of alzheimer s disease and there is increasing evidence that fibrillar deposits and or prefibrillar intermediates play a central role in the observed neurodegeneration one site of a  generation is the endosomes and we have investigated the kinetics of a  association at endosomal ph over physiologically relevant time frames we have identified three distinct a  association phases that occur at rates comparable to endosomal transit times rapid formation of burst phase aggregates larger than  nm was observed within  seconds two slower association phases were detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and termed phase  and phase  aggregation reactions at   m a  ph  the half lives of the phase  and phase  aggregation phases were   minutes and    minutes respectively atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering studies indicate that the burst phase aggregate is large and amorphous while phase  and  aggregates are spherical with hydrodynamic radii around  nm there is an apparent equilibrium potentially mediated through a soluble a  intermediate between the large burst phase aggregates and phase  and  spherical particles the large burst phase aggregates form quickly however they disappear as the equilibrium shifts toward the spherical aggregates these aggregated species do not contain  helical or  structure as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy however after two weeks  structure is observed and is attributable to the insoluble portion of the sample after two months mature amyloid fibrils appear and the spherical aggregates are significantly diminished
