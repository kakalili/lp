evaluating and learning from rna pseudotorsional space quantitative validation of a reduced representation for rna structure
quantitatively describing rna structure and conformational elements remains a formidable problem seven standard torsion angles and the sugar pucker are necessary to characterize the conformation of an rna nucleotide completely progress has been made toward understanding the discrete nature of rna structure but classifying simple and ubiquitous structural elements such as helices and motifs remains a difficult task one approach for describing rna structure in a simple mathematically consistent and computationally accessible manner involves the invocation of two pseudotorsions   c  n  pn c  n pn  and   pn c  n pn  c  n   which can be used to describe rna conformation in much the same way that  and  are used to describe backbone configuration of proteins here we conduct an exploration and statistical evaluation of pseudotorsional space and of the ramachandran like     plot we show that through the rigorous quantitative analysis of the     plot the pseudotorsional descriptors  and   together with sugar pucker are sufficient to describe rna backbone conformation fully in most cases these descriptors are also shown to contain considerable information about nucleotide base conformation revealing a previously uncharacterized interplay between backbone and base orientation a window function analysis is used to discern statistically relevant regions of density in the     scatter plot and then nucleotides in colocalized clusters in the     plane are shown to have similar  d structures through rmsd analysis of the rna structural constituents we find that major clusters in the     plot are few underscoring the discrete nature of rna backbone conformation like the ramachandran plot the     plot is a valuable system for conceptualizing biomolecular conformation it is a useful tool for analyzing rna tertiary structures and it is a vital component of new approaches for solving the  d structures of large rna molecules and rna assemblies
