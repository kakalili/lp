Thiocyanate hydrolase (SCNase) of Thiobacillus thioparus THI115 is a cobalt(III)-containing enzyme catalyzing the degradation of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide and ammonia. We determined the crystal structures of the apo- and native SCNases at a resolution of 2.0 Å. SCNases in both forms had a conserved hetero-dodecameric structure, (αβγ)4. Four αβγ hetero-trimers were structurally equivalent. One αβγ hetero-trimer was composed of the core domain and the βN domain, which was located at the center of the molecule and linked the hetero-trimers with novel quaternary interfaces. In both the apo- and native SCNases, the core domain was structurally conserved between those of iron and cobalt-types of nitrile hydratase (NHase). Native SCNase possessed the post-translationally modified cysteine ligands, γCys131-SO2H and γCys133-SOH like NHases. However, the low-spin cobalt(III) was found to be in the distorted square-pyramidal geometry, which had not been reported before in any protein. The size as well as the electrostatic properties of the substrate-binding pocket was totally different from NHases with respect to the charge distribution and the substrate accessibility, which rationally explains the differences in the substrate preference between SCNase and NHase.
