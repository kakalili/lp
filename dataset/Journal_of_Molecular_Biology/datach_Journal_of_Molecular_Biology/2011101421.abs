light induced conformational changes in full length arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome
cryptochromes crys are widespread flavoproteins with homology to photolyases phrs  a class of blue light activated dna repair enzymes unlike phrs both plant and animal crys have a c terminal domain this cryptochrome c terminal cct domain mediates interactions with other proteins while the phr like domain converts light energy into a signal via reduction and radical formation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor however the mechanism by which the phr like domain regulates the cct domain is not known here we applied the pulsed laser induced transient grating method to detect conformational changes induced by blue light excitation of full length arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome  atcry  a significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient of atcry was observed upon photoexcitation indicating that a large conformational change occurs in this monomeric protein atcry containing a single mutation w  f that abolishes an intra protein electron transfer cascade did not exhibit this conformational change moreover the conformational change was much reduced in protein lacking the cct domain thus we conclude that the observed large conformational changes triggered by light excitation of the phr like domain result from c terminal domain rearrangement this inter domain modulation would be critical for crys ability to transduce a blue light signal into altered protein  protein interactions for biological activity lastly we demonstrate that the transient grating technique provides a powerful method for the direct observation and understanding of photoreceptor dynamics
