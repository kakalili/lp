novel features of dag activated pkc isozymes reveal a conserved  d architecture
diacylglycerol dag activates the eight conventional and novel isozymes of protein kinase c pkc by binding to their c domains the crystal structure of pkc ii in a partially activated conformation showed how the c b domain regulates activity by clamping a helix in the c terminal agc extension of the kinase domain here we show that the global three dimensional shape of the conventional and novel pkcs is conserved despite differences in the order of the domains in their primary sequences the membrane translocation phenotypes of mutants in the c b clamp are consistent across all dag activated pkcs demonstrating conservation of this regulatory interface we now identify a novel interface that sequesters the c a domain in pkc ii in a membrane inaccessible state and we generalize this to all dag activated pkcs in the conventional pkcs we identify a novel element of their c domains that additionally contributes to the stability of the inactive conformation we demonstrate that the interdomain linkers play important roles in permitting and stabilizing this state we propose a multi step activation mechanism in which the sequential and cooperative binding of the regulatory domains to the membrane is coupled to allosteric activation of the kinase domain by dag and that acquisition of full catalytic activity requires dag binding to the c b domain in light of the conservation of shape and intramolecular architecture we propose that this mechanism is common to all dag activated pkcs
