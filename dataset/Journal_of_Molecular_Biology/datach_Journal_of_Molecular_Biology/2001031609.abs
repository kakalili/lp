the hydh g genes from escherichia coli code for a zinc and lead responsive two component regulatory system edited by g von heijne
the hydh g genes from escherichia coli code for a two component regulatory system that has been implicated in the regulation of hydrogenase  formation in a detailed study of the function of hydh g employing hyca    lacz reporter gene fusions it was shown that hydh g indeed led to a stimulation of activation of the hyca promoter responsible for hydrogenase  synthesis but only when hydg is overexpressed from a plasmid in a strain lacking fhla since the stimulation was not observed with an fdhf    lacz fusion and since it was independent from a functional hydh gene product it must be considered as unspecific cross talk an extensive search for the actual physiological signal of hydh g showed that the system responds to high concentrations of zinc or lead in the medium expression of zrap a gene inversely oriented to hydh g whose product seems to be involved in acquisition of tolerance to high zn  concentrations is stimulated by high zn  and pb  concentrations and this stimulation requires both hydh and hydg purified hydg in the presence of phosphoryl donors binds to a region within the zrap hydhg intergenic region that is characterised by two inverted repeats separated by a  bp spacer putative         dependent promoter motifs are present upstream of both the zrap and the hydhg transcriptional units in accordance transcription of zrap is strictly dependent on the presence of a functional rpon gene the expression of hydh g is autoregulated high zn  and pb  concentrations lead to a significant increase of the hydg protein content which took place only in a hydh genetic background since hydh binds to membranes tightly it is assumed that the hydh g system senses high periplasmic zn  and pb  concentrations and contributes to metal tolerance by activating the expression of zrap the redesignation of hydh g as zras r is suggested
