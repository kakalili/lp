structure and interactions of the first three rna recognition motifs of splicing factor prp
the essential saccharomyces cerevisiae pre messenger rna splicing protein   prp  has four rna recognition motifs rrms and facilitates u rna base pairing with u rna during spliceosome assembly prp  is a component of the free u small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle snrnp but not the u u bi snrnp and so is thought to be displaced from u by u u base pairing the interaction partners of each of the four rrms of prp  and how these interactions direct u u pairing are not known here we report the crystal structure of the first three rrms and the solution structure of the first two rrms of prp  strikingly rrm  forms extensive inter domain contacts with rrms  and  these contacts occupy much of the canonical rna binding faces   sheets of rrms  and  but leave the  sheet of rrm  exposed previously identified substitutions in prp  that suppress mutations in u and u spliceosomal rnas cluster primarily in the  sheet of rrm  but also in a conserved loop of rrm  rna binding assays and chemical shift mapping indicate that a large basic patch evident on the surface of rrms  and  is part of a high affinity u rna binding site our results suggest that prp  binds free u rna primarily with rrms  and  which may remodel the u secondary structure the  sheet of rrm  then influences u u pairing through interaction with an unidentified ligand
