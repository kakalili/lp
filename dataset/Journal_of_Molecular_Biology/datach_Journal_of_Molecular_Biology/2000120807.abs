crystal structure of a truncated mutant of glucose fructose oxidoreductase shows that an n terminal arm controls tetramer formation
n terminal or c terminal arms that extend from folded protein domains can play a critical role in quaternary structure and other intermolecular associations and or in controlling biological activity we have tested the role of an extended n terminal arm in the structure and function of a periplasmic enzyme glucose fructose oxidoreductase gfor from zymomonas mobilis we have determined the crystal structure of the nad complex of a truncated form of the enzyme gfor  in which the first  residues of the n terminal arm of the mature protein have been deleted the structure refined at    resolution rcryst    rfree     shows that the truncated form of the enzyme forms a dimer and implies that the n terminal arm is essential for tetramer formation by wild type gfor truncation of the n terminal arm also greatly increases the solvent exposure of the cofactor since gfor activity is dependent on retention of the cofactor during the catalytic cycle we conclude that the absence of gfor activity in this mutant results from dissociation of the cofactor the n terminal arm thus determines the quaternary structure and the retention of the cofactor for gfor activity and during translocation into the periplasm the structure of gfor  also shows how an additional mutation ser asp converts the strict nadp specificity of wild type gfor to a dual nadp nad specificity
