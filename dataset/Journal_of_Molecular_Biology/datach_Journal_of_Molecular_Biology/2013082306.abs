solid state  c nmr reveals annealing of raft like membranes containing cholesterol by the intrinsically disordered protein  synuclein
misfolding and aggregation of the intrinsically disordered protein  synuclein  s in lewy body plaques are characteristic markers of late stage parkinson s disease it is well established that membrane binding is initiated at the n terminus of the protein and affects biasing of conformational ensembles of  s however little is understood about the effect of  s on the membrane lipid bilayer one hypothesis is that intrinsically disordered  s alters the structural properties of the membrane thereby stabilizing the bilayer against fusion here we used two dimensional  c separated local field nmr to study interaction of the wild type  synuclein wt  s or its n terminal     amino acid sequence n  s with a cholesterol enriched ternary membrane system this lipid bilayer mimics cellular raft like domains in the brain that are proposed to be involved in neuronal membrane fusion the two dimensional dipolar recoupling pulse sequence dross dipolar recoupling on axis with scaling and shape preservation was implemented to measure isotropic  c chemical shifts and  c  h residual dipolar couplings under magic angle spinning site specific changes in nmr chemical shifts and segmental order parameters indicate that both wt  s and n  s bind to the membrane interface and change lipid packing within raft like membranes mean torque modeling of  c  h nmr order parameters shows that  s induces a remarkable thinning of the bilayer      accompanied by an increase in phospholipid cross sectional area       this perturbation is characterized as membrane annealing and entails structural remodeling of the raft like liquid ordered phase we propose this process is implicated in regulation of synaptic membrane fusion that may be altered by aggregation of  s in parkinson s disease
