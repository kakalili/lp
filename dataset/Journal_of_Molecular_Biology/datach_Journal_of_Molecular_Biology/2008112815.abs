packaging of a unit length viral genome the role of nucleotides and the gpd decoration protein in stable nucleocapsid assembly in bacteriophage
the developmental pathways for a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic double stranded dna viruses include packaging of viral dna into a preformed procapsid structure catalyzed by terminase enzymes and fueled by atp hydrolysis in most instances a capsid expansion process accompanies dna packaging which significantly increases the volume of the capsid to accommodate the full length viral genome   decoration  proteins add to the surface of the expanded capsid lattice and the terminase motors tightly package dna generating up to    atm of internal capsid pressure herein we describe biochemical studies on genome packaging using bacteriophage  as a model system kinetic analysis suggests that the packaging motor possesses at least four atpase catalytic sites that act cooperatively to effect dna translocation and that the motor is highly processive while not required for dna translocation into the capsid the phage  capsid decoration protein gpd is essential for the packaging of the penultimate     kb      of the viral genome virtually no dna is packaged in the absence of gpd when large dna substrates are used most likely due to a loss of capsid structural integrity finally we show that atp hydrolysis is required to retain the genome in a packaged state subsequent to condensation within the capsid presumably the packaging motor continues to  idle  at the genome end and to maintain a positive pressure towards the packaged state surprisingly adp guanosine triphosphate and the nonhydrolyzable atp analog  adenylyl beta gamma imidodiphosphate amp  pnp similarly stabilize the packaged viral genome despite the fact that they fail to support genome packaging in contrast the poorly hydrolyzed atp analog atp  s only partially stabilizes the nucleocapsid and a dna is released in  quantized  steps we interpret the ensemble of data to indicate that i the viral procapsid possesses a degree of plasticity that is required to accommodate the packaging of large dna substrates  ii the gpd decoration protein is required to stabilize the fully expanded capsid and iii nucleotides regulate high affinity dna binding interactions that are required to maintain dna in the packaged state
