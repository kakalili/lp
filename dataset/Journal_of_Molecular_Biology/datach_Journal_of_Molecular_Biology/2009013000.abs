molecular mechanism of thioflavin t binding to the surface of  rich peptide self assemblies
a number of small organic molecules have been developed that bind to amyloid fibrils a subset of which also inhibit fibrillization among these the benzothiol dye thioflavin t tht has been used for decades in the diagnosis of protein misfolding diseases and in kinetic studies of self assembly fibrillization  despite its importance efforts to characterize the tht binding mechanism at the atomic level have been hampered by the inherent insolubility and heterogeneity of peptide self assemblies to overcome these challenges we have developed a minimalist approach to designing a tht binding site in a peptide self assembly mimic   psam scaffold psams are engineered water soluble proteins that mimic a segment of  rich peptide self assembly and they are amenable to standard biophysical techniques and systematic mutagenesis the psam  sheet contains rows of repetitive amino acid patterns running perpendicular to the strands cross strand ladders that represent a ubiquitous structural feature of fibril like surfaces we successfully designed a tht binding site that recapitulates the hallmarks of tht  fibril interactions by constructing a cross strand ladder consisting of contiguous tyrosines the x ray crystal structures suggest that tht interacts with the  sheet by docking onto surfaces formed by a single tyrosine ladder rather than in the space between adjacent ladders systematic mutagenesis further demonstrated that tyrosine surfaces across four or more  strands formed the minimal binding site for tht our work thus provides structural insights into how this widely used dye recognizes a prominent subset of peptide self assemblies and proposes a strategy to elucidate the mechanisms of fibril  ligand interactions
