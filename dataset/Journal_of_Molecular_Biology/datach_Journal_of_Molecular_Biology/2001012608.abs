contribution of peptide bonds to inhibitor protease binding crystal structures of the turkey ovomucoid third domain backbone variants omtky pro i and omtky   coo leu i in complex with streptomyces griseus proteinase b sgpb and the structure of the free inhibitor omtky   ch nh  asp i edited by d rees
x ray crystallography has been used to determine the d structures of two complexes between streptomyces griseus proteinase b sgpb  a bacterial serine proteinase and backbone variants of turkey ovomucoid third domain omtky  the natural p residue leu i has been substituted by a proline residue omtky pro i and in the second variant the peptide bond between thr i and leu i was replaced by an ester bond omtky   coo leu i  both variants lack the p nh group that donates a bifurcated hydrogen bond to the carbonyl o of ser  and o  of the catalytic ser   one of the common interactions between serine proteinases and their canonical inhibitors the sgpb omtky pro i complex has many structural differences in the vicinity of the s pocket when compared with the previously determined structure of sgpb omtky leu i the result is a huge difference in the  g  of binding   kcal mol  only part of which can be attributed to the missing hydrogen bond in contrast very little structural difference exists between the complexes of sgpb omtky   coo leu i and sgpb omtky leu i aside from an ester o replacing the p nh group therefore the difference in  g    kcal mol as calculated from the measured equilibrium association constants can be attributed to the contribution of the p nh hydrogen bond toward binding a crystal structure of omtky having a reduced peptide bond between p leu i and p   asp i  omtky   ch nh  asp i has also been determined by x ray crystallography this variant has very weak association equilibrium constants with sgpb and with chymotrypsin the structure of the free inhibitor suggests that the reduced peptide bond has not introduced any major structural changes in the inhibitor therefore its poor ability to inhibit serine proteinases is likely due to the disruptions of the canonical interactions at the oxyanion hole
