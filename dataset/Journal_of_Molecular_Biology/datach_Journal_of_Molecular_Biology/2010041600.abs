structural and biochemical bases for the redox sensitivity of mycobacterium tuberculosis rsla
an effective transcriptional response to redox stimuli is of particular importance for mycobacterium tuberculosis as it adapts to the environment of host alveoli and macrophages the m tuberculosis  factor  l regulates the expression of genes involved in cell wall and polyketide syntheses  l interacts with the cytosolic anti  domain of a membrane associated protein rsla here we demonstrate that rsla binds zn  and can sequester  l in a reducing environment in response to an oxidative stimulus proximal cysteines in the cxxc motif of rsla form a disulfide bond releasing bound zn  this results in a substantial rearrangement of the  l rsla complex leading to an  fold decrease in the affinity of rsla for  l the crystal structure of the    element recognition domain of  l   l bound to rsla reveals that rsla inactivates  l by sterically occluding promoter dna and rna polymerase binding sites the crystal structure further reveals that the cysteine residues that coordinate zn  in rsla are solvent exposed in the complex thus providing a structural basis for the redox sensitivity of rsla the biophysical parameters of  l rsla interactions provide a template for understanding how variations in the rate of zn  release and associated conformational changes could regulate the activity of a zn  associated anti  factor
