structure of the chloroplast signal recognition particle srp receptor domain arrangement modulates srp  receptor interaction
the signal recognition particle srp pathway mediates co translational targeting of nascent proteins to membranes chloroplast srp is unique in that it does not contain the otherwise universally conserved srp rna which accelerates the association between the srp guanosine   triphosphate gtp binding protein and its receptor ftsy in classical srp pathways recently we showed that the srp and srp receptor sr gtpases from chloroplast cpsrp  and cpftsy respectively can interact with one another   fold more efficiently than their bacterial homologues thus providing an explanation as to why this novel chloroplast srp pathway bypasses the requirement for the srp rna here we report the crystal structure of cpftsy from arabidopsis thaliana at     resolution in this chloroplast sr the n terminal  n  domain is more tightly packed and a more extensive interaction surface is formed between the gtpase  g  domain and the n domain than was previously observed in many of its bacterial homologues as a result the overall conformation of apo cpftsy is closer to that found in the bacterial srp  ftsy complex than in free bacterial ftsy especially with regard to the relative orientation of the n and g domains in contrast active site residues in the g domain are mispositioned explaining the low basal gtp binding and hydrolysis activity of free cpftsy this structure emphasizes proper n  g domain arrangement as a key factor in modulating the efficiency of srp  receptor interaction and helps account in part for the faster kinetics at which the chloroplast sr interacts with its binding partner in the absence of an srp rna
