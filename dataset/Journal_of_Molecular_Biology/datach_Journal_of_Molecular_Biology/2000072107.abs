predicting u turns in ribosomal rna with comparative sequence analysis
the u turn is a well known rna motif characterized by a sharp reversal of the rna backbone following a single stranded uridine base in experimentally determined u turn motifs the nucleotides   to the turn are frequently involved in tertiary interactions rendering this motif particularly attractive in rna modeling and functional studies the u turn signature is composed of an unr sequence pattern flanked by a y y y a y pyrimidine or g a base juxtaposition we have identified  potential unr type u turns and  related gnra type u turns in a large set of aligned  s and  s rrna sequences u turn candidates occur in hairpin loops   times as well as in internal and multi stem loops   times  these are classified into ten families based on loop type sequence pattern unr or gnra and the nature of the closing base juxtaposition in  cases the bases on the   side of the turn or on the immediate   side are involved in tertiary covariations making these sites strong candidates for tertiary interactions
