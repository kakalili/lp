catalytic versatility and backups in enzyme active sites the case of serum paraoxonase
the origins of enzyme specificity are well established however the molecular details underlying the ability of a single active site to promiscuously bind different substrates and catalyze different reactions remain largely unknown to better understand the molecular basis of enzyme promiscuity we studied the mammalian serum paraoxonase  pon  whose native substrates are lipophilic lactones we describe the crystal structures of pon at a catalytically relevant ph and of its complex with a lactone analogue the various pon structures and the analysis of active site mutants guided the generation of docking models of the various substrates and their reaction intermediates the models suggest that promiscuity is driven by coincidental overlaps between the reactive intermediate for the native lactonase reaction and the ground and or intermediate states of the promiscuous reactions this overlap is also enabled by different active site conformations the lactonase activity utilizes one active site conformation whereas the promiscuous phosphotriesterase activity utilizes another the hydrolysis of phosphotriesters and of the aromatic lactone dihydrocoumarin is also driven by an alternative catalytic mode that uses only a subset of the active site residues utilized for lactone hydrolysis indeed pon s active site shows a remarkable level of networking and versatility whereby multiple residues share the same task and individual active site residues perform multiple tasks e g  binding the catalytic calcium and activating the hydrolytic water  overall the coexistence of multiple conformations and alternative catalytic modes within the same active site underlines pon s promiscuity and evolutionary potential
