the dimeric structure and the bivalent recognition of h k me by the tumor suppressor ing suggests a mechanism for enhanced targeting of the hbo complex to chromatin
the inhibitor of growth ing family of tumor suppressors regulates the transcriptional state of chromatin by recruiting remodeling complexes to sites with histone h trimethylated at position k  h k me  this modification is recognized by the plant homeodomain phd present at the c terminus in the five members of the ing family ing facilitates histone h acetylation by the hbo complex here we show that ing forms homodimers through its n terminal domain which folds independently into an elongated coiled coil structure the central region of ing  which contains the nuclear localization sequence is disordered and flexible and does not directly interact with p  or does it with very low affinity in contrast to previous findings the nmr analysis of the full length protein reveals that the two phd fingers of the dimer are chemically equivalent and independent of the rest of the molecule the detailed nmr analysis of the full length dimeric protein binding to histone h k me shows essentially the same binding site and affinity as the isolated phd finger therefore the ing dimer has two identical and independent binding sites for h k me tails which in the context of the chromatin could belong to the same or to different nucleosomes these results show that ing is a bivalent reader of the chromatin h k me modification and suggest a mechanism for enhanced targeting of the hbo complex to specific chromatin sites this mechanism could be common to other ing containing remodeling complexes
