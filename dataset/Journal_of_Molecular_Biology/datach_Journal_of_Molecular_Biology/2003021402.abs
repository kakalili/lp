the crystal structure of an anti cea scfv diabody assembled from t   scfvs in vl to vh orientation implications for diabody flexibility
diabodies scfv dimers are small bivalent antibody mimetics of approximately  kda in size that possess rapid in vivo targeting pharmacokinetics compared to the intact parent antibody and may prove highly suitable for imaging and therapeutic applications here we describe t   di the first diabody crystal structure in which the scfvs comprise v domains linked in the vl to vh orientation the structure was determined by x ray diffraction analysis to    resolution the t   di scfv was constructed from the anti carcinoembryonic antigen anti cea antibody t   variable domains connected by an eight residue peptide linker to provide flexibility between fv modules and promote dimer formation with bivalent affinity to the cell surface target cea therefore it was surprising to observe a close association of some fv module complementarity determining regions in the t   diabody crystal especially compared to other diabody structures all of which are linked in the opposite vh to vl orientation the differences between the arrangement of fv modules in the t   di vl to vh linked diabody structure compared to the crystal structure of l mk  and other proposed vh to vl linked diabodies has been investigated and their potential for flexibility discussed the comparison between vh to vl and vl to vh linked diabodies revealed in this study represents a limited repertoire of possible diabody fv orientations but one that reveals the potential flexibility of these molecules this analysis therefore provides some signposts that may impact on future molecular designs for these therapeutic molecules with respect to diabody flexibility and avidity
