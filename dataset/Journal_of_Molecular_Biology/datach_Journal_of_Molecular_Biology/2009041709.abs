x ray radiation induced cooperative atomic movements in protein
x rays interact with biological matter and cause damage proteins and other macromolecules are damaged primarily by ionizing x ray photons and secondarily by reactive radiolytic chemical species in particular protein molecules are damaged during x ray diffraction experiments with protein crystals which is in many cases a serious hindrance to structure solution the local x ray induced structural changes of the protein molecule have been studied using a number of model systems however it is still not well understood whether these local chemical changes lead to global structural changes in protein and what the mechanism is we present experimental evidence at atomic resolution indicating the movement of large parts of the protein globule together with bound water molecules in the early stages of radiation damage to the protein crystal the data were obtained from a crystal cryocooled to    k and diffracting to    the movement of the protein structural elements occurs simultaneously with the decarboxylation of several glutamate and aspartate residues that mediate contacts between moving protein structural elements and with the rearrangement of the water network the analysis of the anisotropy of atomic displacement parameters reveals that the observed atomic movements occur at different rates in different unit cells of the crystal thus the examination of the cooperative atomic movement enables us to better understand how radiation induced local chemical and structural changes of the protein molecule eventually lead to disorder in protein crystals
