structural basis of the transcriptional regulation of the proline utilization regulon by multifunctional puta
the multifunctional escherichia coli proline utilization a puta flavoprotein functions both as a membrane associated proline catabolic enzyme and as a transcriptional repressor of the proline utilization genes puta and putp to better understand the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by puta we have mapped the put regulatory region determined a crystal structure of the puta ribbon  helix  helix domain puta  a polypeptide corresponding to residues    of e coli puta complexed with dna and examined the thermodynamics of dna binding to puta  five operator sites each containing the sequence motif   gttgca    were identified using gel shift analysis three of the sites are shown to be critical for repression of puta whereas the two other sites are important for repression of putp the     resolution crystal structure of puta  bound to one of the operators operator    bp shows that the protein contacts a  bp fragment corresponding to the gttgca consensus motif plus three flanking base pairs since the operator sequences differ in flanking bases the structure implies that puta may have different affinities for the five operators this hypothesis was explored using isothermal titration calorimetry the binding of puta  to operator  is exothermic with an enthalpy of     kcal mol and a dissociation constant of   nm substitution of the flanking bases of operator  into operator  results in an unfavorable enthalpy of   kcal mol and a  fold lower affinity showing that base pairs outside of the consensus motif impact binding structural and thermodynamic data suggest that hydrogen bonds between lys and bases adjacent to the gttgca motif contribute to transcriptional regulation by fine tuning the affinity of puta for put control operators
