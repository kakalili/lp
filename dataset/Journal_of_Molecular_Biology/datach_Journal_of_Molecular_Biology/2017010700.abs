rna exosome and non coding rna coupled mechanisms in aid mediated genomic alterations
the eukaryotic rna exosome is a well conserved protein complex with ribonuclease activity implicated in rna metabolism various families of non coding rnas have been identified as substrates of the complex underscoring its role as a non coding rna processing degradation unit however the role of rna exosome and its rna processing activity on dna mutagenesis alteration events have not been investigated until recently b lymphocytes use two dna alteration mechanisms class switch recombination csr and somatic hypermutation shm  to re engineer their antibody gene expressing loci until a tailored antibody gene for a specific antigen is satisfactorily generated csr and shm require the essential activity of the dna activation induced cytidine deaminase aid  causing collateral damage to the b cell genome during csr and shm aid induces unwanted and sometimes oncogenic mutations at numerous non immunoglobulin gene sequences recent studies have revealed that aid s dna mutator activity is regulated by the rna exosome complex thus providing an example of a mechanism that relates dna mutagenesis to rna processing here we review the emergent functions of rna exosome during csr shm and other chromosomal alterations in b cells and discuss implications relevant to mechanisms that maintain b cell genomic integrity
