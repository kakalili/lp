epstein barr virus and its glycoprotein   upregulate il  in human b lymphocytes via cd  involving activation of nf  b and different signaling pathways edited by j karn
epstein barr virus ebv is a ubiquitous and highly immunotropic gamma herpesvirus that infects more than   of humans worldwide its pathogenicity leads to a number of diseases including tumors that result from ebv  s ability to readily transform b lymphocytes and to a lesser extent epithelial cells ebv utilizes cd  cr as its receptor on b cells to initiate the infection process ebv binds to cr through its major envelope glycoprotein   gp   and is also a remarkable immunomodulating agent we had previously shown that ebv is capable of modulating the synthesis of a number of cytokines we now show that while both purified recombinant gp   rgp   and ebv upregulate il  mrna synthesis in b cells ebv induced il  gene activation occurs for a significantly longer period of time i e   hours for ebv as compared to  hours for rgp   moreover the half life of ebv induced il  mrna was also significantly longer   hours than that of mrna induced by rgp   about  hours  both ebv and gp  enhance the binding of the nf  b transcription factor as determined by band shift and augment nf  b mediated activation of a cat reporter plasmid furthermore we demonstrate that while the activation of il  gene expression by gp  is mediated primarily by the protein kinase c pathway ebv can mediate its effects through multiple signaling pathways to our knowledge this is the first report showing that the binding of a herpesvirus envelope glycoprotein to cr on human b cells results in the activation of the nf  b transcription factor leading to the upregulation of il  gene expression in these lymphocytes
