structure of a g quadruplex  ligand complex
stabilisation of g quadruplex structures formed from telomeric dna by means of quadruplex selective ligands is a means of inhibiting the telomerase enzyme from catalysing the synthesis of telomeric dna repeats in order to understand the molecular basis of ligand  quadruplex recognition the crystal structure has been determined of such a complex at    resolution this complex is between a dimeric antiparallel g quadruplex formed from the oxytricha nova telomeric dna sequence d ggggttttgggg  and a di substituted aminoalkylamido acridine compound the structure shows that the acridine moiety is bound at one end of the stack of g quartets within one of the thymine loops it is held in place by a combination of stacking interactions and specific hydrogen bonds with thymine bases the stability of the ligand in this binding site has been confirmed by a ns molecular dynamics simulation
