structural redesign of lipase b from candida antarctica by circular permutation and incremental truncation
circular permutation of candida antarctica lipase b yields several enzyme variants with substantially increased catalytic activity to better understand the structural and functional consequences of protein termini reorganization we have applied protein engineering and x ray crystallography to cp   one of the most active hydrolase variants our initial investigation has focused on the role of an extended surface loop created by linking the native n and c termini on protein integrity incremental truncation of the loop partially compensates for observed losses in secondary structure and the permutants temperature of unfolding unexpectedly the improvements are accompanied by quaternary structure changes from monomer to dimer the crystal structures of one truncated variant cp    in the apo form determined at     resolution and with a bound phosphonate inhibitor at     resolution confirmed the formation of a homodimer by swapping of the enzyme s  residue n terminal region separately the new protein termini at amino acid positions     convert the narrow access tunnel to the catalytic triad into a broad crevice for accelerated substrate entry and product exit while preserving the native active site topology for optimal catalytic turnover
