dna binding and telomere length regulation of yeast rap homologues
the repressor activator protein  rap  has many important functions in saccharomyces cerevisiae at the chromosome ends it is a negative regulator of telomere length here we show that saccharomyces castellii saccharomyces dairensis telomeric sequences inserted into a s cerevisiae telomere are counted as part of the telomere consistent with the presence of high affinity rap p binding sites within these sequences we show that s castellii rap p scasrap p can regulate telomere length in a s cerevisiae strain albeit less stringently cloning of the s dairensis rap homologue sdairap  revealed that it encodes the largest rap protein identified to date despite its large size binding analyses of the recombinant sdairap p revealed that the protein binds with the same spacing and with similar affinity to yeast telomeric sequences as the scer and scasrap proteins according to the rap p counting model for telomere length regulation a low density of rap p binding sites in a telomere would result in a longer telomere in s cerevisiae we have compared the lengths of two individual s dairensis telomeres and find that their lengths are not regulated to give the same number of high affinity binding sites this may be due to other factors than rap p having influence on the telomere length regulation
