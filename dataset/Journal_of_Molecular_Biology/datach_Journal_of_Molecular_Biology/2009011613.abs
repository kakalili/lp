ribosomal intersubunit bridge b a is involved in factor dependent translation initiation and translational processivity
intersubunit bridges are important for holding together subunits in the  s ribosome moreover a number of intersubunit bridges have a role in modulating the activity of the ribosome during translation ribosomal intersubunit bridge b a is formed by the interaction between the conserved  s rrna helix  loop   h  and the top of the  s rrna helix   within the  s ribosome bridge b a contacts translation factors and the a site trna in addition to bridging the subunits bridge b a has been invoked in a number of other ribosomal functions from initiation to termination in the present work single nucleotide substitutions were inserted at positions   and   of escherichia coli  s rrna helix   which are involved in important intrahelical and intersubunit tertiary interactions in bridge b a the resulting ribosomes had a severely reduced activity in a cell free translation elongation assay but displayed a nearly wild type level peptidyl transferase activity in vitro reassociation efficiency decreased with all of the h  variant  s subunits but was severest with the a  c and  h  variants the mutations strongly affected initiation factor dependent  s initiation complex formation but exhibited a minor effect on the nonenzymatic initiation process the mutations decreased ribosomal processivity in vitro and caused a progressive depletion of  s subunits in polysomal fractions in vivo mutations at position   decreased the stability of a dipeptidyl trna in the a site whereas the binding of the dipeptidyl trna was rendered more stable with   and  h  mutations our results suggest that the h  of  s rrna functions as a control element during enzymatic steps of translation
