nmr investigation of the dynamics of tryptophan side chains in hemoglobins
nmr relaxation measurements of  n spin  lattice relaxation rate r  spin  spin relaxation rate r  and heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effect noe have been carried out at   t and   t as a function of temperature for the side chains of the tryptophan residues of  n labeled and or  h  n labeled recombinant human normal adult hemoglobin hb a and three recombinant mutant hemoglobins rhb kempsey  d n  rhb  y d  d n  and rhb  v w  in the carbonmonoxy and the deoxy forms as well as in the presence and in the absence of an allosteric effector inositol hexaphosphate ihp  there are three trp residues       and    in hb a for each   dimer these trp residues are located in important regions of the hb molecule i e   trp and   trp are located in the    subunit interface and   trp is located in the    subunit interface the relaxation experiments show that amino acid substitutions in the    subunit interface can alter the dynamics of   trp the transverse relaxation rate r  for   trp can serve as a marker for the dynamics of the    subunit interface the relaxation parameters of deoxy rhb kemspey  d n  which is a naturally occurring abnormal human hemoglobin with high oxygen affinity and very low cooperativity are quite different from those of deoxy hb a even in the presence of ihp the relaxation parameters for rhb  y d  d n  which is a compensatory mutant of rhb kempsey are more similar to those of hb a in addition trosy  cpmg experiments have been used to investigate conformational exchange in the trp residues of hb a and the three mutant rhbs experimental results indicate that the side chain of   trp is involved in a relatively slow conformational exchange on the micro to millisecond time scale under certain experimental conditions the present results provide new dynamic insights into the structure  function relationship in hemoglobin
