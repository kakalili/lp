redox dependent changes in rsra an anti sigma factor in streptomyces coelicolor zinc release and disulfide bond formation
r is a sigma factor for transcribing genes to defend cells against oxidative stresses in the antibiotic producing bacterium streptomyces coelicolor the availability of  r is regulated by rsra an anti sigma factor whose  r binding activity is regulated by redox changes in the environment via thiol  disulfide exchange we found that reduced rsra contains zinc in a stoichiometric amount whereas oxidized form has very little  mol of zinc per mol of rsra was released upon oxidation as monitored by a chromogenic zn chelator    pyridylazo resorcinol par  measurement of zinc bound in several rsra mutants of various cysteine and histidine substitutions suggested that c  h  c  and c  serve as zinc binding sites the zinc binding and  r binding activities of mutant proteins did not coincide suggesting that zinc might not be absolutely required for the anti sigma activity of rsra zn free apo rsra bound  r and inhibited  r dependent transcription in vitro compared with zn rsra the anti transcription activity of apo rsra was about threefold lower and its  r binding affinity decreased by about ninefold when measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis apo rsra was more sensitive to protease suggesting that zinc allows rsra to maintain a more compact structure optimized for binding  r the cysteine pairs that form disulfide bonds were determined by maldi tof mass spectrometry revealing formation of the critical disulfide bond between c  and one of the essential cysteine residues c  or   most likely c  an improved model for the mechanism of redox modulation of rsra was presented
