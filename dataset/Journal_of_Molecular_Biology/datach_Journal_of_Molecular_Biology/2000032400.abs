high resolution crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial ef tu in complex with gdp edited by k nagai
the crystal structure of bovine mitochondrial elongation factor tu ef tu in complex with gdp has been determined at a resolution of     the structure is similar to that of ef tu gdp from escherichia coli and thermus aquaticus but the orientation of the gdp binding domain  is changed relative to domains  and  sixteen conserved water molecules common to ef tu and other g proteins in the gdp binding site are described these water molecules create a network linking separated parts of the binding pocket mitochondrial ef tu binds nucleotides less tightly than prokaryotic ef tu possibly due to an increased mobility in regions close to the gdp binding site the c terminal extension of mitochondrial ef tu has structural similarities with dna recognising zinc fingers suggesting that the extension may be involved in recognition of rna
