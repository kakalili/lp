target recognition by ecoki the recognition domain is robust and restriction deficiency commonly results from the proteolytic control of enzyme activity edited by j karn
we report a genetic and biochemical analysis of a target recognition domain trd of ecoki a type i restriction and modification enzyme the trds of type i r m systems are within the specificity subunit hsds and hsds confers sequence specificity to a complex endowed with both restriction and modification activities random mutagenesis has revealed that most substitutions within the amino trd of ecoki a region comprising   amino acid residues have no detectable effect on the phenotype of the bacterium even when the substitutions are non conservative the structure of the trd appears to be robust all but one of the six substitutions that confer a restriction deficient modification deficient r  m   phenotype were found to be in the interval between residues  and   a region predicted by sequence comparisons to form part of the protein dna interface additional site directed mutations affecting this interval commonly impair both restriction and modification however we show that an r  phenotype cannot be taken as evidence that the ecoki complex lacks endonuclease activity in response to even a slightly impaired modification efficiency the endonuclease activity of ecoki is destroyed by a process dependent upon the clpxp protease enzymes from mutants with an r  m  phenotype commonly retain some sequence specific activity methylase activity can be detected on hemimethylated dna substrates and residual endonuclease activity is implied whenever the viability of the r  m  bacterium is dependent on clpxp conversely the viability of clpx  r  m  bacteria can be used as evidence for little or no endonuclease activity of  mutants with an r  m  phenotype only six are viable in the absence of clpxp the significance of four of the six residues g  g   f  and g   is enhanced by the finding that even conservative substitutions for these residues impair modification thereby conferring an r  m  phenotype
