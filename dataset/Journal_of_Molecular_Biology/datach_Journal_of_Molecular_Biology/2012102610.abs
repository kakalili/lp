crystal structures of penicillin binding protein  pbp  from methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus in the apo and cefotaxime  bound forms
staphylococcus aureus is a widespread gram  positive opportunistic pathogen and a methicillin  resistant form mrsa is particularly difficult to treat clinically we have solved two crystal structures of penicillin  binding protein pbp   pbp  from mrsa the apo form and a complex with the  lactam antibiotic cefotaxime and used electrospray mass spectrometry to measure its sensitivity to a variety of penicillin derivatives pbp is a class b pbp possessing an n terminal non penicillin  binding domain sometimes called a dimerization domain and a c terminal transpeptidase domain the model shows a different orientation of its two domains compared to earlier models of other class b pbps and a novel larger n domain consistent with the nomenclature of  dimerization domain   the n terminal region forms an apparently tight interaction with a neighboring molecule related by a  fold symmetry axis in the crystal structure this dimer form is predicted to be highly stable in solution by the pisa server but mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation provide unequivocal evidence that the protein is a monomer in solution
