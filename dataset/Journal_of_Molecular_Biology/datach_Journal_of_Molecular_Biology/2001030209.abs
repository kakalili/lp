the chaperone function of clpb from thermus thermophilus depends on allosteric interactions of its two atp binding sites edited by a r fersht
clpb belongs to the hsp  family and assists de aggregation of protein aggregates by dnak chaperone systems it contains two walker consensus sequences or p loops that indicate potential nucleotide binding domains nbd  both domains appear to be essential for chaperoning function since mutation of the conserved lysine residue of the gx gkt consensus sequences to glutamine k  q and k  q abolishes its properties to accelerate renaturation of aggregated firefly luciferase the underlying biochemical reason for this malfunction appears not to be a dramatically reduced atpase activity of either p loop per se but rather changed properties of co operativity of atpase activity connected to oligomerization properties to form productive oligomers this view is corroborated by data that show that structural stability as judged by cd spectroscopy or atpase activity at single turnover conditions at low atp concentrations are not significantly affected by these mutations in addition nucleotide binding properties of wild type protein and mutants as judged by binding studies with fluorescent nucleotide analogues and competitive displacement titrations do not differ dramatically however the general pattern of formation of stable defined oligomers formed as a function of salt concentration and nucleotides and more importantly cooperativity of atpase activity at high atp concentrations is dramatically changed with the two p loop mutants described
