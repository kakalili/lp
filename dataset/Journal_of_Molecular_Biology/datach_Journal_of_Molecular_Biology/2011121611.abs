crosstalk between raf mek erk and pi k akt in suppression of bax conformational change by grp  under glucose deprivation conditions
during glucose deprivation gd induced cellular stress the molecular chaperone glucose regulated protein   grp  mortalin pbp  mthsp  hereafter termed  grp    plays an important role in the suppression of apoptosis by inhibiting the bax conformational change that delays the release of cytochrome c the molecular pathways by which it carries out these functions are still unclear we hypothesize that the anti apoptotic effect by the overexpression of grp  was through the signal of akt activated by classic phosphoinositide  kinase pi k and also involved pi k independent pathways using the pc  cell gd model we demonstrated a novel mechanism of grp  activating akt which may be pi k independent and associated with raf mek mitogen activated protein kinase erk kinase erk signaling the pi k inhibitor ly    did not influence the activation of akt by the grp  overexpression under gd however the mek inhibitor u   dramatically inhibited akt phosphorylation in the same assay in addition to the pi k akt signal pathway grp  overexpression also inhibited the bax conformational change through the raf mek erk signal pathway in conclusion grp  overexpression in activating akt can be pi k independent and associated with raf mek erk signaling under gd at the same time pi k may also crosstalk with raf  in which the prosurvival signal of pi k maintains the expression of raf  the activated akt and extracellular signal regulated protein kinases  and  by grp  inhibited the bax conformational change and subsequent apoptosis
