structural insight into ppar  activation through covalent modification with endogenous fatty acids
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ppar   is a nuclear receptor that regulates lipid homeostasis and several fatty acid metabolites have been identified as ppar  ligands here we present four crystal structures of the ppar  ligand binding domain lbd covalently bound to endogenous fatty acids via a unique cysteine which is reportedly critical for receptor activation the structure analyses of the lbd complexed with  deoxy     prostaglandin j   d pgj  revealed that the covalent binding of  d pgj induced conformational changes in the loop region following helix h   and rearrangements of the side chain network around the created covalent bond in the lbd point mutations of these repositioned residues on the loop and helix h almost completely abolished ppar  activation by  d pgj  indicating that the observed structural alteration may be crucial for ppar  activation by the endogenous fatty acid to address the issue of partial agonism of endogenous ppar  ligands we took advantage of a series of oxidized eicosatetraenoic acids oxoetes as covalently bound ligands to ppar  despite similar structural and chemical properties these fatty acids exhibited distinct degrees of transcriptional activity crystallographic studies using two of the oxoete ppar  lbd complexes revealed that transcriptional strength of each oxoete is associated with the difference in the loop conformation rather than the interaction between each ligand and helix h  these results suggest that the loop conformation may be responsible for the modulation of ppar  activity based on these results we identified novel agonists covalently bound to ppar  by in silico screening and a cell based assay our crystallographic study of lbd complexed with nitro   demonstrated that the expected covalent bond is indeed formed between this newly identified agonist and the cysteine this study presents the structural basis for the activation and modulation mechanism of ppar  through covalent modification with endogenous fatty acids
