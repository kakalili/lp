h k methyltransferase activity is required for mll protein stability
transcriptional enhancers play a key role in cell type specific gene expression and cell fate transition enhancers are marked by histone h k mono and di methylation h k me   the tumor suppressor mll  kmt d is a major enhancer h k mono and di methyltransferase with a partial functional redundancy with mll  kmt c  however the functional role of mll enzymatic activity remains elusive to address this issue we have generated mll enzyme dead knock in ki embryonic stem es cells and mice which carry y  a y  a y  a mutations in the enzymatic set domain of the mll protein homozygous mll enzyme dead ki mll ki ki mice are embryonic lethal and die around e   which phenocopies mll knockout mice interestingly enzyme dead mll protein in es cells is highly unstable like mll knockout es cells mll ki ki es cells show reduced levels of h k me   furthermore we show that ectopic expression of histone h  lysine  to methionine k m mutant which reduces endogenous h k methylation levels in es cells decreases the protein stability of mll and mll but not that of h k methyltransferases set a kmt f and set b kmt g  taken together our findings indicate that mll protein stability is tightly regulated by its h k methyltransferase activity
