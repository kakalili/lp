the folding pathway of t lysozyme an on pathway hidden folding intermediate
t lysozyme has two easily distinguishable but energetically coupled domains the n and c terminal domains in earlier studies an amide hydrogen deuterium exchange pulse labeling experiment detected a stable submillisecond intermediate that accumulates before the rate limiting transition state it involves the formation of structures in both the n and c terminal regions however a native state hydrogen exchange experiment subsequently detected an equilibrium intermediate that only involves the formation of the c terminal domain here using stopped flow circular dichroism and fluorescence amide hydrogen exchange folding competition and protein engineering methods we re examined the folding pathway of t lysozyme we found no evidence for the existence of a stable folding intermediate before the rate limiting transition state at neutral ph in addition using native state hydrogen exchange directed protein engineering we created a mimic of the equilibrium intermediate we found that the intermediate mimic folds with the same rate as the wild type protein suggesting that the equilibrium intermediate is an on pathway intermediate that exists after the rate limiting transition state
