common interruptions in the repeating tripeptide sequence of non fibrillar collagens sequence analysis and structural studies on triple helix peptide models
interruptions in the repeating gly x x n amino acid sequence pattern are found in the triple helix domains of all non fibrillar collagens and perturbations to the triple helix at such sites are likely to play a role in collagen higher order structure and function this study defines the sequence features and structural consequences of the most common interruption where one residue is missing from the tripeptide pattern gly x x gly aa gly x x  designated g g interruptions residues found within g g interruptions are predominantly hydrophobic    followed by a significant amount of charged residues    and the gly x x triplets flanking the interruption are atypical studies on peptide models indicate the degree of destabilization is much greater when pro is in the interruption gp than when hydrophobic residues gf gy are present and a rigid gly pro hyp tripeptide adjacent to the interruption leads to greater destabilization than a flexible gly ala ala sequence modeling based on nmr data indicates the phe residue within a gf interruption is located on the outside of the triple helix the g g interruptions resemble a previously studied collagen interruption gpogaavmgpo designated g g type in that both are destabilizing but allow continuation of rod like triple helices and maintenance of the single residue stagger throughout the imperfection with a loss of axial register of the superhelix on both sides both kinds of interruptions result in a highly localized perturbation in hydrogen bonding and dihedral angles but the hydrophobic residue of a g g interruption packs near the central axis of the superhelix while the hydrophobic residue of a g g interruption is located on the triple helix surface the different structural consequences of g g and g g interruptions in the repeating tripeptide sequence pattern suggest a physical basis for their differential susceptibility to matrix metalloproteinases in type x collagen
