structural stability and domain organization of colicin e  edited by b holland
thermodynamic properties stability and structure of the toxin like molecule colicin e were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism to determine the number of structurally independent domains and the interdomain interactions necessary for colicin import into the escherichia coli cell analysis of denaturation profiles of the   residue colicin e  together with fragments of   and   residues that contain subsets of the domains showed three stable cooperative blocks that differ in thermal stability and correspond to three major functional domains of the colicin  i the cooh terminal channel forming c domain with the highest thermal stability  ii the btub receptor binding r domain and iii the n terminal translocation t domain that has the smallest stabilization enthalpy and thermal stability interdomain interactions were described in which t r interactions stabilize r and t c and r c interactions stabilize r and t but destabilize c the r and t domains behaved in a similar way as a function of ph and ionic strength interacting extended helices of the r domain possibly a coiled coil were implied by  i the very high  gt     helical content of the r domain  ii cooperative decreases in  helical content near the ttr of thermal denaturation of the r domain  iii a large denaturation enthalpy implying extensive h bond and van der waals interactions the r domain was inferred from the extended network of interacting helices large  h and steep temperature dependence of its stabilization energy to have a dominant role in determining the conformation of other domains it is proposed that cellular import starts with the r domain binding to the btub receptor followed by unfolding of the r domain coiled coil and thereby of the t domain which then interacts with the tolc receptor translocator
