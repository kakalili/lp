transcriptional regulation of the human prostacyclin receptor gene is dependent on sp  pu  and oct  in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells
prostacyclin plays a central role in hemostasis inflammation and nociception however the factors regulating expression of the prostacyclin receptor ip gene in humans and in other species have not been identified in this study we sought to identify the key trans acting factors and cis acting elements regulating ip expression in the megakaryoblastic human erythroleukemia hel     and vascular endothelial ea hy   cell lines with the use of deletion and genetic reporter analyses the essential core promoter termed prmip was localized to the     to    region proximal to the transcription initiation site while an upstream repressor region localized to     to     was also identified bioinformatic analysis revealed evolutionarily conserved sp  pu  and oct  sites within the core prmip and disruption of these elements each led to substantial reductions in prmip directed gene expression in both hel and ea hy   cells electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays established that sp  pu  and oct  can bind to elements within the core promoter in vitro while chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed their specific binding to chromatin in vivo furthermore combination mutations of the sp  pu  and oct  elements revealed that they act independently to co regulate basal transcription of the ip gene while ectopic expression of each of the trans acting factors led to substantial increases in prmip directed gene expression and ip mrna expression in both hel and ea hy   cells while electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody supershift assays established that the ets family member fli  but not ets  is capable of binding to the pu  element within prmip in vitro chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis established that neither fli nor ets  binds to that element in vivo collectively these data provide critical insights into the transcriptional regulation of the ip gene in human megakaryocytic and endothelial cells identifying sp  pu  and oct  as the critical factors involved in its basal regulation in humans
