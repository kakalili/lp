the structure of truncated recombinant human bile salt stimulated lipase reveals bile salt independent conformational flexibility at the active site loop and provides insights into heparin binding
human bile salt stimulated lipase bssl  which is secreted from the pancreas into the digestive tract and from the lactating mammary gland into human milk is important for the effective absorption of dietary lipids the dependence of bssl on bile acids for activity with water insoluble substrates differentiates it from other lipases we have determined the crystal structure of a truncated variant of human bssl residues    and refined it at    resolution to an r factor of    and rfree of    this variant lacks the c terminal  helix and tandem c terminal repeat region of native bssl but retains full catalytic activity a short loop residues     capable of occluding the active site the active site loop is highly mobile and exists in two conformations the most predominant of which leaves the active site open for interactions with substrate the bile salt analogue    cholamidopropyl dimethylammonio  propane sulfonic acid chaps was present in the crystallisation medium but was not observed bound to the enzyme however the structure reveals a sulfonate group from the buffer piperizine ethane sulfonic acid pipes  making interactions with arg  and his   his  is part of the active site loop indicating that the loop could participate in the binding of a sulphate group from either the glycosaminoglycan heparin known to bind bssl or a bile acid such as deoxycholate opening of the     active site loop may be cooperatively linked to a sulphate anion binding at this site the helix bundle domain of bssl residues     exhibits weak electron density and high temperature factors indicating considerable structural mobility this domain contains an unusual asp glu pair buried in a hydrophobic pocket between helices  h and  k that may be functionally important we have also solved the structure of full length glycosylated human bssl at    resolution using the refined coordinates of the truncated molecule as a search model this structure reveals the position of the c terminal helix missing in the truncated variant and also shows the active site loop to be in a closed conformation
