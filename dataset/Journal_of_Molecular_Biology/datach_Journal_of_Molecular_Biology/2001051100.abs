specific secondary structures in the capsid coding region of giardiavirus transcript are required for its translation in giardia lamblia edited by d e draper
enhanced translation of giardiavirus glv luciferase chimeric mrna in giardia lambliarequires the presence of the initial   nucleotides of the viral capsid coding region a  nt downstream box db sequence within this region complementary to a  nt sequence near the   end of g lamblia  s like ribosomal rna rrna  was found to be essential for the enhanced translation however db is located    nt downstream of the initiation codon whereas an exponential increase of translation efficiency depends on a further increment of the coding region from nucleotides   to   thus there could be additional structural requirements for translation enhancement in the region downstream from db four major stem loop structures designated i to iv were identified in the mfold predicted secondary structure of the  nt capsid coding region with an estimated minimum free energy   g  of     kcal mol   our chemical probing analysis of the free  nt rna molecule in solution supports the predicted presence of stem loops i ii and iii but casts doubts on stem loop iv it suggests instead the presence of a stem loop iva at a nearby location in the molecule site directed mutagenesis designed to disrupt stem loop structures i ii iii or iva resulted in drastic reduction of translation efficiency which was restored by compensatory sequence changes to regenerate individual stem loop structures mutations disrupting the originally designated stem loop iv did not exert any detectable effect on translation however alterations of the sequence ucucc between nucleotides   and   in the flexible loop region of the revised secondary structure led to a precipitous drop in translation another stem loop predicted by mfold that consists of a major portion of the db sequence was examined by chemical probing but found little experimental support changes of the db sequence without affecting the postulated stem structure led to drastic losses of translation efficiency thus a simple structural basis for the enhanced translation could be that stem loops i ii iii and iva and the ucucc sequence may facilitate the interaction between db and the anti db in  s like rrna in initiating translation of glv mrna in g lamblia
