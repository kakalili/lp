the hill model for binding myosin s to regulated actin is not equivalent to the mckillop  geeves model
the hill two state cooperativity model and the mckillop  geeves mck  g three state model predict very similar binding traces of myosin subfragment  s  binding to regulated actin filaments in the presence and absence of calcium and both fit the experimental data reasonably well chen et al  biophys j           here we compared the hill model and the mck  g model for binding myosin s to regulated actin against three sets of experimental data the titration of regulated actin with s and the kinetics of s binding of regulated actin with either excess s to actin or excess actin to s  each data set was collected for a wide range of specified calcium concentrations both models were able to generate reasonable fits to the time course data and to titration data the mck  g model can fit all three data sets with the same calcium concentration sensitive parameters only kb and kt show significant calcium dependence and the parameters have a classic pca curve a unique set of the hill model parameters was extremely difficult to estimate from the best fits of multiple sets of data in summary the mck  g cooperativity model more uniquely resolves parameters estimated from kinetic and titration data than the hill model predicts a sigmoidal dependence of key parameters with calcium concentration and is simpler and more suitable for practical use
