crystal structure of the l intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin evidence for vertical translocation of a water molecule during the proton pumping cycle
for structural investigation of the l intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin a d crystal belonging to the space group p  was illuminated with green light at   k and subsequently with red light at   k this yielded a    mixture of the l intermediate and the ground state diffraction data from such crystals were collected using a low flux of x rays      photons mm per crystal  and their merged data were compared with those from unphotolyzed crystals these structural data together with our previous data indicate that the retinal chromophore which is largely twisted in the k intermediate takes a more planar  cis   anti configuration in the l intermediate this configurational change which is accompanied by re orientation of the schiff base n  h bond towards the intracellular side is coupled with a large rotation of the side chain of an amino acid residue leu  making contact with the c  methyl group of retinal following these motions a water molecule at first hydrogen bonded to the schiff base and asp  is dragged to a space that is originally occupied by leu  diffraction data from a crystal containing the m intermediate showed that this water molecule moves further towards the intracellular side in the l to m transition it is very likely that detachment of this water molecule from the protonated schiff base causes a significant decrease in the pka of the schiff base thereby facilitating the proton transfer to asp  on the basis of these observations we argue that the vertical movement of a water molecule in the k to l transition is a key event determining the directionality of proton translocation in the protein
