bacteriophage t encodes a homolog of the eukaryotic transcription coactivator pc implicated in recombination dependent dna replication
the rna polymerase ii cofactor pc globally regulates transcription of protein encoding genes through interactions with unwinding dna the basal transcription machinery and transcription activators here we report the surprising identification of pc homologs in all sequenced representatives of the t family of bacteriophages as well as in an archaeon and seven phyla of eubacteria we have solved the crystal structure of the full length t protein at    revealing a striking resemblance to the characteristic single stranded dna ssdna binding core domain of pc  intriguing novel structural features include a potential regulatory region at the n terminus and a c terminal extension of the homodimerisation interface the genome organisation of t related bacteriophages points at involvement of the pc homolog in recombination dependent dna replication strongly suggesting that the protein corresponds to the hitherto elusive replicative ssdna binding protein of the t family our findings imply that pc like factors intervene in multiple unwinding related processes by acting as versatile modifiers of nucleic acid conformation and raise the possibility that the eukaryotic transcription coactivator derives from ancestral dna replication recombination and repair factors
