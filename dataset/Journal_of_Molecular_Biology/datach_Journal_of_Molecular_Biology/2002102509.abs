characterization of three regulatory states of the striated muscle thin filament
the troponin  tropomyosin linked regulation of striated muscle contraction occurs through allosteric control by both ca  and myosin the thin filament fluctuates between two extreme states the inactive  off  state and the active  on  state intermediate states have been proposed from structural studies and transient kinetic measurements however in contrast to the well characterised on and off states the mechanochemical properties of the intermediate states are much less well understood because of the instability of those states in the present study we have characterized a myosin induced intermediate that is stabilized by cross linking myosin motor domains s  to actin filaments with a maximum of one s molecule for  actin monomers  a single s molecule is known to interact with two adjacent actin monomers a detailed analysis revealed that thin filaments containing s molecules cross linked to just one actin monomer actin  s complexes are regulated with a   inhibition of the atpase in the absence of ca  in contrast filaments containing s molecules cross linked at two positions to two adjacent actin monomers actin  s complexes totally lose their regulation in a highly cooperative manner this loss of regulation was due both to an enhancement of the atpase activity without calcium and an inhibition of the atpase with calcium filaments containing actin  s complexes with significant atpase activity in the absence of calcium about    did not move on a myosin coated surface unless calcium was present this partial uncoupling between the atpase activity and in vitro motility in the absence of calcium demonstrates that the mechanical steps require actin  myosin contacts which take place only in the on state and not in the off or intermediate states these data provide new insights concerning the difference in cooperativity of ca  regulation that exists between the biochemical and mechanical cycles of the actin  myosin motor
