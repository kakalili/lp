rolling adhesion of  l i domain mutants decorrelated from binding affinity
activated lymphocyte function associated antigen  lfa   l  integrin found on leukocytes facilitates firm adhesion to endothelial cell layers by binding to intercellular adhesion molecule  icam   which is up regulated on endothelial cells at sites of inflammation recent work has shown that lfa  in a pre activation low affinity state may also be involved in the initial tethering and rolling phase of the adhesion cascade the inserted i domain of lfa  contains the ligand binding epitope of the molecule and a conformational change in this region during activation increases ligand affinity we have displayed wild type i domain on the surface of yeast and validated expression using i domain specific antibodies and flow cytometry surface display of i domain supports yeast rolling on icam  coated surfaces under shear flow expression of a locked open high affinity i domain mutant supports firm adhesion of yeast while yeast displaying intermediate affinity i domain mutants exhibit a range of rolling phenotypes we find that rolling behavior for these mutants fails to correlate with ligand binding affinity these results indicate that unstressed binding affinity is not the only molecular property that determines adhesive behavior under shear flow
