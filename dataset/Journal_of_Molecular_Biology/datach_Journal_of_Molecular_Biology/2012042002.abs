single stranded dna translocation of e coli uvrd monomer is tightly coupled to atp hydrolysis
escherichia coli uvrd is an sf a superfamily  type a helicase translocase that functions in several dna repair pathways a uvrd monomer is a rapid and processive single stranded dna ssdna translocase but is unable to unwind dna processively in vitro based on data at saturating atp     m  we proposed a nonuniform stepping mechanism in which a uvrd monomer translocates with biased    to    directionality while hydrolyzing  atp per dna base translocated but with a kinetic step size of    nt step suggesting that a pause occurs every    nt translocated to further test this mechanism we examined uvrd translocation over a range of lower atp concentrations       m atp  using transient kinetic approaches we find a constant atp coupling stoichiometry of   atp dna base translocated even at the lowest atp concentration examined    m  indicating that atp hydrolysis is tightly coupled to forward translocation of a uvrd monomer along ssdna with little slippage or futile atp hydrolysis during translocation the translocation kinetic step size remains constant at    nt step down to    m atp but increases to    nt step at    m atp these results suggest that uvrd pauses more frequently during translocation at low atp but with little futile atp hydrolysis
