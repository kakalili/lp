autoregulation enables different pathways to control ccaat enhancer binding protein   c ebp  transcription edited by m yaniv
ccaat enhancer binding protein   c ebp  also named liver enriched transcriptional activating protein lap is a member of the c ebp family of transcription factors and is involved in hepatocyte specific gene expression and in the process of tissue differentiation the activity of lap c ebp  can be regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational level or by protein protein interaction with other transcription factors in this study we show that lap c ebp  can stimulate its own transcription deletion analysis of the rat lap c ebp  promoter in luciferase reporter gene experiments demonstrated that the region located between nucleotide    to    comprising two recently characterized camp responsive element cre like elements is important for autoregulation gel shift experiments using oligonucleotides with overlapping point mutations identified the sequence gcaatga   site adjacent to and partially overlapping the first cre like site as core motif for lap c ebp  binding analysis of a mutated  site in reporter gene experiments showed the functional relevance of this site for autoregulation the composite c ebp  cre element in the promoter enables synergistic activation of transcription by lap c ebp  and the proteinkinase a pka camp responsive element binding protein creb pathway in a cell type specific manner in hepatoma cells nuclear factor kappa b nf  b increased autoregulation and therefore could mediate enhanced activation during inflammatory responses in summary our results demonstrated that the assembly of the three binding sites in the promoter and thus the interaction between lap c ebp  and members of the creb or nf  b family allows the control of lap c ebp  gene transcription as a response to different stimuli in a tissue specific manner
