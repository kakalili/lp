crystallographic analysis of human serum albumin complexed with z  e bilirubin ix
bilirubin an insoluble yellow orange pigment derived from heme catabolism accumulates to toxic levels in individuals with impaired or immature liver function the resulting jaundice may be managed with phototherapy to isomerize the biosynthetic z  z bilirubin ix  to more soluble and excretable isomers such as z  e bilirubin bilirubin and its configurational isomers are transported to the liver by human serum albumin hsa but their precise binding location s on the protein have yet to be determined to investigate the molecular details of their interaction we co crystallised bilirubin with hsa strikingly the crystal structure  determined to     resolution  revealed the z  e bilirubin ix  isomer bound to an l shaped pocket in sub domain ib we also determined the co crystal structure of hsa complexed with fusidic acid an antibiotic that competitively displaces bilirubin from the protein and showed that it binds to the same pocket these results provide the first crystal structure of a natural bilirubin pigment bound to serum albumin challenge some of the present conceptions about hsa  bilirubin interactions and provide a sound structural framework for finally resolving the long standing question of where z  z bilirubin ix  binds to the protein
