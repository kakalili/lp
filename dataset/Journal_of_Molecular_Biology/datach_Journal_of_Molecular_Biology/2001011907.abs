hydrogen bonds with  acceptors in proteins frequencies and role in stabilizing local d structures edited by r huber
a comprehensive structural analysis of x  h   hydrogen bonding in proteins is performed based on   published high resolution crystal structures       all potential donors and acceptors are considerered including acidic c  h groups the sample contains   putative x  h   hydrogen bonds with n  h o  h or s  h donors that is about one per   aromatic residues by far the most efficient  acceptor is the side chain of trp which accepts one x  h   hydrogen bond per   residues the focus of the analysis is on recurrent structural patterns involving regular secondary structure elements numerous examples are found where peptide x  h   interactions are functional in stabilization of helix termini strand ends strand edges   bulges and regular turns side chain x  h   hydrogen bonds are formed in considerable numbers in  helices and  sheets geometrical data on various types of x  h   hydrogen bonds are given
