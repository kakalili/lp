characterization of the grp  os  chaperone  lectin complex
grp  is a macromolecular chaperone belonging to the hsp  family and is the most abundant glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum er of mammals in addition to its essential role in protein folding grp  was proposed to participate in the er associated degradation quality control pathway by interacting with the lectin os  a sensor for terminally misfolded proteins to understand how os  interacts with er chaperone proteins we mapped its interaction with grp  glycosylation of the full length grp  protein was essential for os  binding although deletion of the grp  n terminal domain relieved this requirement suggesting that the effect was allosteric rather than direct although yeast os  is composed of a well established n terminal mannose recognition homology lectin domain and a c terminal dimerization domain we find that the c terminal domain of os  in higher eukaryotes contains  mammalian specific insets  that are specifically recognized by the middle and c terminal domains of grp  additionally the grp  binding domain in os  was found to be intrinsically disordered the biochemical analysis of the interacting regions provides insight into the manner by which the two associate and it additionally hints at a plausible biological role for the grp  os  complex
