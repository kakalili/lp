crystal structure of the first plant urease from jack bean   years of journey from its first crystal to molecular structure
urease a nickel dependent metalloenzyme is synthesized by plants some bacteria and fungi it catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide although the amino acid sequences of plant and bacterial ureases are closely related some biological activities differ significantly plant ureases but not bacterial ureases possess insecticidal properties independent of its ureolytic activity to date the structural information is available only for bacterial ureases although the jack bean urease canavalia ensiformis jbu  the best studied plant urease was the first enzyme to be crystallized in    to better understand the biological properties of plant ureases including the mechanism of insecticidal activity we initiated the structural studies on some of them here we report the crystal structure of jbu the first plant urease structure at     resolution the active site architecture of jbu is similar to that of bacterial ureases containing a bi nickel center jbu has a bound phosphate and covalently modified residue cys   by  mercaptoethanol at its active site and the concomitant binding of multiple inhibitors phosphate and  mercaptoethanol is not observed so far in bacterial ureases by correlating the structural information of jbu with the available biophysical and biochemical data on insecticidal properties of plant ureases we hypothesize that the amphipathic  hairpin located in the entomotoxic peptide region of plant ureases might form a membrane insertion  barrel as found in  pore forming toxins
