sequence determinants for amyloid fibrillogenesis of human  synuclein
parkinson s disease pd and dementia with lewy bodies dlb are characterized by the presence of filamentous inclusions in nerve cells these filaments are amyloid fibrils that are made of the protein  synuclein which is genetically linked to rare cases of pd and dlb   synuclein which shares   identity with  synuclein is not found in the inclusions furthermore while recombinant  synuclein readily assembles into amyloid fibrils   synuclein fails to do so it has been suggested that this may be due to the lack in  synuclein of a hydrophobic region that spans residues     of  synuclein here fibril assembly of recombinant human  synuclein   synuclein deletion mutants   synuclein and    synuclein chimeras was assayed quantitatively by thioflavin t fluorescence and semi quantitatively by transmission electron microscopy deletion of residues     from  synuclein did not abolish filament formation furthermore a chimera of  synuclein with  synuclein     inserted was significantly less fibrillogenic than wild type  synuclein these findings together with results obtained using a number of recombinant synucleins showed a correlation between fibrillogenesis and mean  strand propensity hydrophilicity and charge of the amino acid sequences the combination of these simple physicochemical properties with a previously described calculation of  strand contiguity allowed us to design mutations that changed the fibrillogenic propensity of  synuclein in predictable ways
