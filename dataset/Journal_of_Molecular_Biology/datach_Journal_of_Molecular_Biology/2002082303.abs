crystal structures of the reaction intermediate and its homologue of an extradiol cleaving catecholic dioxygenase
bphc derived from pseudomonas sp strain kks  is an extradiol cleaving catecholic dioxygenase this enzyme contains a non heme iron atom and plays an important role in degrading biphenyl polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs in the microbe to elucidate detailed structures of bphc reaction intermediates crystal structures of the substrate free form the bphc  substrate complex and the bphc  substrate  no nitric oxide complex were determined these crystal structures revealed   the binding site of the o molecule in the coordination sphere and   conformational changes of his  during the catalytic reaction on the basis of these findings we propose a catalytic mechanism for the extradiol cleaving catecholic dioxygenase in which his  seems to play three distinct roles at the early stage of the catalytic reaction his  appears to act as a catalytic base which likely deprotonates the hydroxyl group of the substrate at the next stage the protonated his  seems to stabilize a negative charge on the o molecule located in the hydrophobic o binding cavity finally protonated his  seems to function as a proton donor whose existence has been proposed
