crystal structure and mutational analysis of ca  independent type ii antifreeze protein from longsnout poacher brachyopsis rostratus
we recently found that longsnout poacher brachyosis rostratus produces a ca  independent type ii antifreeze protein lpafp and succeeded in expressing recombinant lpafp using phichia pastoris here we report for the first time the x ray crystal structure of lpafp at     resolution the lpafp structure displayed a relatively planar surface which encompasses two loop regions cys   lys  and asn   cys  and a short  strand trp   leu   with three unstructured segments gly   ile  ala   ala   and pro   his   electrostatic calculation of the protein surface showed that the relatively planar surface was divided roughly into a hydrophobic area composed of the three unstructured segments lacking secondary structure and a hydrophilic area composed of the loops and  strand  site directed mutation of ile  with phe at the center of the hydrophobic area decreased activity significantly whereas mutation of leu  with phe at an intermediate area between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas retained complete activity in the hydrophilic area a peptide swap mutant in the loops retained   activity despite simultaneous mutations of eight residues we conclude that the epicenter of the ice binding site of lpafp is the hydrophobic region which is centered by ile  in the relatively planar surface we built an ice binding model for lpafp on the basis of a lattice match of ice and constrained water oxygen atoms surrounding the hydrophobic area in the lpafp structure the model in which lpafp has been docked to a secondary prism     plane which is different from the one determined for ca  independent type ii afp from sea raven     appears to explain the results of the mutagenesis analysis
