the nonlinear structure of the desmoplakin plakin domain and the effects of cardiomyopathy linked mutations
desmoplakin is a cytoplasmic desmosomal protein that plays a vital role in normal intercellular adhesion mutations in desmoplakin can result in devastating skin blistering diseases and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy a heart muscle disorder associated with ventricular arrhythmias heart failure and sudden death the desmoplakin n terminal region is a   amino acid sequence of unknown structure it mediates interactions with other desmosomal proteins is found in a variety of plakin proteins and spans what has been termed the  plakin domain   which includes residues      and consists of six spectrin repeats srs and an src homology  domain herein we elucidate the architecture of desmoplakin s plakin domain as well as its constituent tandem srs small angle x ray scattering analysis shows that the entire plakin domain has an  l  shape with a long arm and a short arm held at a perpendicular angle the long arm is    nm long and accommodates four stably folded srs arranged in tandem in contrast the short arm is    nm in length and accommodates two independently folded repeats and an extended c terminus we show that mutations linked to arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy k  e and r  c cause local conformational alterations while the overall folded structure is maintained this provides the first structural and mechanistic insights into an entire plakin domain and provides a basis for understanding the critical role of desmoplakin in desmosome function
