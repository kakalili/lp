evidence that a local refolding event triggers maturation of hk  bacteriophage capsid
bacteriophage capsids are a striking example of a robust yet dynamic genome delivery vehicle like most phages hk  undergoes a conformational maturation that converts a metastable prohead into the mature head state in the case of hk  maturation involves a significant expansion of the capsid and concomitant cross linking of capsid subunits the final state termed head ii is a    diameter icosahedral structure with catenated subunit rings cryo em small angle x ray scattering saxs  and biochemical assays were used previously to characterize the initial prohead ii and final states head ii as well as four maturation intermediates here we extend the characterization of the acid induced expansion of hk  in vitro by monitoring changes in intrinsic fluorescence circular dichroism cd  and saxs we find that the greatest changes in all observables occur at an early stage of maturation upon acidification fluorescence emissions from hk  exhibit a blueshift and decrease in intensity these spectral changes reveal two kinetic phases of the expansion reaction the early phase exhibits sensitivity to ph increasing in rate nearly   fold when acidification ph is lowered from   to   the second slower phase reported by fluorescence is relatively insensitive to ph time resolved saxs experiments report an increase in overall particle dimension that parallels the fluorescence changes for the early phase native agarose gel assays corroborated this finding by contrast probes of cd at far uv indicate that secondary structural changes precede the early expansion phase reported by saxs and fluorescence based on the crystallographic structure of head ii and the pseudo atomic model of prohead ii we interpret these changes as reflecting the conversion of subunit n terminal arms n arm from unstructured polypeptide to the mixture of  strand and  turn observed in the head ii crystal structure refolding of the n arm may thus represent the conformational trigger that initiates the irreversible expansion of the phage capsid
