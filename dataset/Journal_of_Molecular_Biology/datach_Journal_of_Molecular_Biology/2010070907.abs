control of catalytic cycle by a pair of analogous trna modification enzymes
enzymes that use distinct active site structures to perform identical reactions are known as analogous enzymes the isolation of analogous enzymes suggests the existence of multiple enzyme structural pathways that can catalyze the same chemical reaction a fundamental question concerning analogous enzymes is whether their distinct active site structures would confer the same or different kinetic constraints to the chemical reaction particularly with respect to the control of enzyme turnover here we address this question with the analogous enzymes of bacterial trmd and its eukaryotic and archaeal counterpart trm  trmd and trm catalyze methyl transfer to synthesize the m g  base at the   position adjacent to the trna anticodon using s adenosyl methionine adomet as the methyl donor trmd features a trefoil knot active site structure whereas trm features the rossmann fold pre steady state analysis revealed that product synthesis by trmd proceeds linearly with time whereas that by trm exhibits a rapid burst followed by a slower and linear increase with time the burst kinetics of trm suggests that product release is the rate limiting step of the catalytic cycle consistent with the observation of higher enzyme affinity to the products of trna and adomet in contrast the lack of burst kinetics of trmd suggests that its turnover is controlled by a step required for product synthesis although trmd exists as a homodimer it showed half of the sites reactivity for trna binding and product synthesis the kinetic differences between trmd and trm are parallel with those between the two classes of aminoacyl trna synthetases which use distinct active site structures to catalyze trna aminoacylation this parallel suggests that the findings have a fundamental importance for enzymes that catalyze both methyl and aminoacyl transfer to trna in the decoding process
