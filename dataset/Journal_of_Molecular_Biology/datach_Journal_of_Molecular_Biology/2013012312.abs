se enrichment of proteins expands the biological nmr toolbox
sulfur a key contributor to biological reactivity is not amendable to investigations by biological nmr spectroscopy to utilize selenium as a surrogate we have developed a generally applicable  se isotopic enrichment method for heterologous proteins expressed in escherichia coli we demonstrate  se nmr spectroscopy of multiple selenocysteine and selenomethionine residues in the sulfhydryl oxidase augmenter of liver regeneration alr  the resonances of the active site residues were assigned by comparing the nmr spectra of alr bound to oxidized and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide an additional resonance appears only in the presence of the reducing agent and disappears readily upon exposure to air and subsequent reoxidation of the flavin hence  se nmr spectroscopy can be used to report the local electronic environment of reactive and structural sulfur sites as well as changes taking place in those locations during catalysis
