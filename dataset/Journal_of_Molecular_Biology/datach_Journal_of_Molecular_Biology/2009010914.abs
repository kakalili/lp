differential nucleotide excision repair susceptibility of bulky dna adducts in different sequence contexts hierarchies of recognition signals
the structural origin underlying differential nucleotide excision repair ner susceptibilities of bulky dna lesions remains a challenging problem we investigated the  s   trans anti bp n    deoxyguanosine g   adduct in double stranded dna this adduct arises from the reaction in vitro and in vivo of a major genotoxic metabolite of benzo a pyrene bp     r s s  r   dihydroxy   epoxy     tetrahydrobenzo a pyrene with the exocyclic amino group of guanine removal of this lesion by the ner apparatus in cell free extracts has been found to depend on the base sequence context in which the lesion is embedded providing an excellent opportunity for elucidating the properties of the damaged dna duplexes that favor ner while the bp ring system is in the b dna minor groove    directed along the modified strand there are orientational distinctions that are sequence dependent and are governed by flanking amino groups nucleic acids res              to elucidate sequence governed ner susceptibility we conducted molecular dynamics simulations for the     cg  gc       cgg  c   and     tcg  ct  adduct containing duplexes we also investigated the     cg  ic  and     cig  c  sequences which contain  i     deoxyinosine  with hydrogen replacing the amino group in   deoxyguanosine to further characterize the structural and dynamic roles of the flanking amino groups in the damaged duplexes our results pinpoint explicit roles for the amino groups in tandem gg sequences on the efficiency of ner and suggest a hierarchy of destabilizing structural features that differentially facilitate ner of the bp lesion in the sequence contexts investigated furthermore combinations of several locally destabilizing features in the hierarchy consistent with a multipartite model may provide a relatively strong recognition signal
