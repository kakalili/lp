simultaneous formation of right and left handed anti parallel coiled coil interfaces by a coil fragment of human lamin a
the elementary building block of all intermediate filaments ifs is a dimer featuring a central  helical rod domain flanked by the n and c terminal end domains in nuclear if proteins lamins  the rod domain consists of two coiled coil segments coil and coil  that are connected by a short non helical linker coil and the c terminal part of coil contain the two highly conserved if consensus motifs involved in the longitudinal assembly of dimers the previously solved crystal structure of a lamin a fragment residues      corresponding to the second half of coil has yielded a parallel left handed coiled coil here we present the crystal structure and solution properties of another human lamin a fragment residues       which is largely overlapping with fragment      but harbors a short segment of the tail domain unexpectedly no parallel coiled coil forms within the crystal instead the  helices are arranged such that two anti parallel coiled coil interfaces are formed the most significant interface has a right handed geometry which is accounted for by a characteristic  residue repeat pattern that overlays with the canonical heptad repeat pattern the second interface is a left handed anti parallel coiled coil based on the predicted heptad repeat pattern in solution the fragment reveals only a weak dimerization propensity we speculate that the c terminus of coil might unzip thereby allowing for a right handed coiled coil interface to form between two laterally aligned dimers such an interface might co exist with a heterotetrameric left handed coiled coil assembly which is expected to be responsible for the longitudinal acn contact
