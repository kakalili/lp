a threefold rna  protein interface in the signal recognition particle gates native complex assembly
intermediate states play well established roles in the folding and misfolding reactions of individual rna and protein molecules in contrast the roles of transient structural intermediates in multi component ribonucleoprotein rnp assembly processes and their potential for misassembly are largely unexplored the srp  protein is unstructured but forms a compact core domain and two extended rna binding loops upon binding the signal recognition particle srp rna the srp  protein subsequently binds to the fully assembled srp   rna complex to form an intimate threefold interface with both srp  and the rna and without significantly altering the structure of srp  we show however that the presence of srp  during srp   rna assembly dramatically alters the folding energy landscape to create a non native folding pathway that leads to an aberrant srp   rna conformation the misassembled complex arises from the surprising ability of srp  to bind rapidly to an srp   rna assembly intermediate and to interfere with subsequent folding of one of the rna binding loops at the three way protein  rna interface an incorrect temporal order of assembly thus readily yields a non native three component ribonucleoprotein particle we propose there may exist a general requirement to regulate the order of interaction in multi component rnp assembly reactions by spatial or temporal compartmentalization of individual constituents in the cell
