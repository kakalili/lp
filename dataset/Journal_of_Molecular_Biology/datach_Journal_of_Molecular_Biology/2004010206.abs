improved breadth and potency of an hiv  neutralizing human single chain antibody by random mutagenesis and sequential antigen panning
several human monoclonal antibodies can neutralize a range of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  primary isolates but their potency and related ability to suppress generation of hiv  escape mutants is significantly lower than the activity of antiretroviral drugs currently in clinical use recently a human fab x  was identified and found to neutralize primary isolates from different clades further improvement of the potency and breadth of hiv  neutralization by this antibody could be critical for its potential use in the treatment of hiv  infected patients however increasing potency of an antibody by selection from libraries may lead to a decrease in the breadth of neutralization in an attempt to solve this problem we subjected a random mutagenesis library of the scfv x to sequential rounds of selection on non homologous hiv  envelope glycoproteins envs dubbed sequential antigen panning sap  by using sap we identified two scfv antibodies m and m  that were tested with a panel of  diverse primary hiv  infectious isolates in an assay based on a reporter cell line expressing high levels of cd  ccr and cxcr  the ic  was less than   g ml for   m  and   m  out of  isolates from group m subtypes a  c f g and crf  ae and one isolate from group n three isolates from group o were not significantly inhibited at   g ml the average ic  values for the two antibodies were significantly p lt    n   lower compared to scfv x  their inhibitory activity does not appear to be related to the hiv  subtype coreceptor usage or the disease stage m inhibited infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the primary isolates jrcsf    and br  with ic  of   and   g ml respectively for a single round infection by pseudovirus the ic  for jrscf    yu and hxbc was      and   g ml respectively in these two assays the ic  for m was on average two to threefold lower than for scfv x  these results demonstrate that both the potency and the breadth of hiv  neutralization of one of the few known potent broadly cross reactive human monoclonal antibodies scfv x  could be improved significantly however only experiments in animal models and clinical trials in humans will show whether these new scfvs and the approach for their identification have potential in the development of prophylactics and therapeutics for hiv  infections
