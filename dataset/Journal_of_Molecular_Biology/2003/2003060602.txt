Bacteriophage lambda integrase (λ-Int) is the prototypical member of a large family of enzymes that catalyze site-specific DNA recombination via the formation of a Holliday junction intermediate. DNA strand cleavage by λ-Int is mediated by nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate by a conserved tyrosine residue, forming an intermediate with the enzyme covalently attached to the 3′-end of the cleaved strand via a phosphotyrosine linkage. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of λ-Int (C170) obtained in the absence of DNA revealed the tyrosine nucleophile at the protein's C terminus to be located on a β-hairpin far from the other conserved catalytic residues and adjacent to a disordered loop. This observation suggested that a conformational change in the C terminus of the protein was required to generate the active site in cis, or alternatively, that the active site could be completed in trans by donation of the tyrosine nucleophile from a neighboring molecule in the recombining synapse. We used NMR spectroscopy together with limited proteolysis to examine the dynamics of the λ-Int catalytic domain in the presence and absence of DNA half-site substrates with the goal of characterizing the expected conformational change. Although the C terminus is indeed flexible in the absence of DNA, we find that conformational changes in the tyrosine-containing β-hairpin are not coupled to DNA binding. To gain structural insights into C170/DNA complexes, we took advantage of mechanistic conservation with Cre and Flp recombinases to model C170 in half-site and tetrameric Holliday junction complexes. Although the models do not reveal the nature of the conformational change required for cis cleavage, they are consistent with much of the available experimental data and provide new insights into the how trans complementation could be accommodated.
