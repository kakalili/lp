activation of the ghrelin receptor is described by a privileged collective motion a model for constitutive and agonist induced activation of a sub class a g protein coupled receptor gpcr
three homology models of the human ghrelin receptor ghs r a have been generated from the available x ray structures of rhodopsin rho model  opsin ops model and beta  adrenergic receptor b model  the latter was used as a starting point for combined molecular dynamics simulation mds and full atom normal modes analysis nma  a low frequency normal mode mode   perfectly reproduced the intracellular motions observed between b and rho models in the opposite direction along the same mode the generated structures are closer to the ops model suggesting a direct link with ghs r a activation this was in agreement with motions of the seven transmembranous segments increase of the solvent accessibility of the   ery   sequence and flip of the trp   cwlp residue some features related to gpcrs activation according to our model his  was proposed to stabilize trp  in the active state this was verified by site directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization of the resulting h  a and h  s mutants which were fully functional but sharing an important decrease of their basal activities docking performed with short ghrelin derivatives gly ser ser allowed the identification of a robust position of these peptides in the active site of the receptor this model was refined by mds and validated by docking experiments performed on a set of  ghrelin receptor ligands based on the    triazole scaffold finally nma performed on the obtained peptide  receptor complex suggested stabilization of the trp  residue and of the whole receptor in the active state preventing the motion observed along mode  computed for the unbound receptor our results show that nma offers a powerful approach to study the conformational diversity and the activation mechanism of gpcrs
