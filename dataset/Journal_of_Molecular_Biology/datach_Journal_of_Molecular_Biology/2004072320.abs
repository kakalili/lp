the schizosaccharomyces pombe open promoter bubble mammalian like arrangement and properties
the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe is often used as a genetic system to model processes that apply to higher cells here s pombe was used to study promoter dna opening and transcription initiation by rna polymerase ii the melted region within the adh promoter is about  bp in size and has the start site near its center this arrangement is similar to that at the adml promoter but different from that in saccharomyces cerevisiae although expression of human tfiib shifts the start site to the nearby human position it does not change the location of the bubble the start site shift is directed by the c terminus of human tfiib in contrast to expectations from s cerevisiae the creation of the bubble requires the atpase motifs of xpb overall the data show that promoter melting and initiation in fission yeast is much more similar to humans than to budding yeast
