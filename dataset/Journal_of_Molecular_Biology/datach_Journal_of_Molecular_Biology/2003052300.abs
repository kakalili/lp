asymmetry in the triple helix of collagen like heterotrimers confirms that external bonds stabilize collagen structure
heating and subsequent cooling mixtures of pro pro gly  and pro hyp gly  peptides leads to formation of model heterotrimeric collagen helices that can be isolated by hplc these heterotrimeric collagen peptide helices are shown to be fundamentally unstable as denaturing then renaturing experiments result in heterotrimeric homotrimeric mixtures as the proportion of hydroxyproline containing chains in the trimers increases differential scanning calorimetry shows that the helix melting temperatures and denaturation enthalpies increasing non linearly three types of rich  crick hydrogen bonds observed by nmr allow modelling of heterotrimeric structures based on published homotrimeric x ray data this revealed a small axial movement of pro hyp gly  chains towards the c terminal of the helix demonstrating heterotrimeric asymmetry
