tuning     towards downhill folding at its melting temperature
the five helix bundle      is a fast two state folder several stabilized mutants have been reported to fold kinetically near downhill or downhill these mutants undergo a transition to two state folding kinetics when heated it has been suggested that this transition is caused by increased hydrophobicity at higher temperature here we investigate two histidine containing mutants of      to see if a weaker hydrophobic core can extend the temperature range of downhill folding the very stable  ha is the fastest folding lambda repressor to date kf    kobs      s at    c  it folds downhill at low temperature but transits back to two state folding at its unfolding midpoint  hg has a weakened hydrophobic core it is less stable than some slower folding mutants of      and it has more exposed hydrophobic surface area in the folded state this mutant nonetheless folds very rapidly and has the non exponential folding kinetics of an incipient downhill folder even at the unfolding midpoint km      s ka      s at    c  we also compare the thermodynamic melting transition of  hg with the nominal two state folding mutant  qg which has a similar melting temperature unlike  qg  hg yields fluorescence wavelength dependent cooperativities and probe dependent melting temperatures this result combined with previous work shows that the energy landscapes of lambda repressor mutants support all standard folding mechanisms
