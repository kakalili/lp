Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is used to treat a wide range of autoimmune conditions and consists of pooled immunoglobulin G (IgG) from healthy donors. The immunosuppressive effects of IVIg are, in part, attributed to terminal α2,6-linked sialic acid residues on the N-linked glycans of the IgG Fc (fragment crystallizable) domain. This α2,6-sialylated Fc (sFc) has been reported to bind to the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of the cell-surface lectin DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) and its murine orthologue SIGN-R1 (specific intracellular adhesion molecule-grabbing non-integrin R1) and, via this interaction, to signal the downstream expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and receptors. Consistent with this model, the antiinflammatory effect of IVIg treatment is abolished in a murine knock-out of SIGN-R1 and can be restored by a knock-in with human DC-SIGN. In contrast, however, existing glycan array and X-ray crystallographic studies indicate that the CRDs of both SIGN-R1 and DC-SIGN bind to a restricted set of primarily oligomannose-type glycans that does not include the glycans found on sFc. We attempted to reconcile these immunological and biophysical observations. We first generated hypersialylated, desialylated, deglycosylated and untreated serum IgG and found that the affinity for the complete extracellular region of the DC-SIGN tetramer was similar for all antibody glycoforms. Moreover, the binding could be attributed to cross-reactive, polyclonal Fab (fragment antigen-binding) specificities in serum as neither recombinant Fc nor sFc bound to DC-SIGN. In addition, serum IgG exhibited no competition against known ligands of the DC-SIGN CRD. These findings lead us to suggest that IVIg therapy does not involve binding of IgG Fc to DC-SIGN and that alternative cell-surface lectins are required for the antiinflammatory activity of sFc.
