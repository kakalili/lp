protein conformational change delayed by steric hindrance from an n linked glycan
very few studies have attributed a direct active functional role to n linked glycans we describe here an n linked glycan with a unique role for maintaining the active conformation of a protein of the serpin family the distinguishing feature of serpins is the  stressed to relaxed  transition in which the reactive center loop inserts as a  strand into the central  sheet a this transition forms the basis for the conversion of serpins to the inactive latent state we demonstrate that plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai  from zebrafish converts to the latent state about  fold slower than human pai  in contrast to human pai  fish pai  carries a single n linked glycan at asn  in the gate region through which the reactive center loop passes during latency transition while the latency transition of human pai  is unaffected by deglycosylation deglycosylated zebrafish pai  zfpai  goes latent about  fold faster than the glycosylated zfpai  and about  fold faster than non glycosylated human pai  x ray crystal structure analysis of glycosylated fish pai  confirmed the presence of an n linked glycan in the gate region and a lack of glycan induced structural changes thus latency transition of zfpai  is delayed by steric hindrance from the glycan in the gate region our findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism for inhibition of protein conformational changes by steric hindrance from n linked glycans
