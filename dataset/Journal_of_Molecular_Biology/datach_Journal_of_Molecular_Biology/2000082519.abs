two state expansion and collapse of a polypeptide edited by a r fersht
the initial phase of folding for many proteins is presumed to be the collapse of the polypeptide chain from expanded to compact but still denatured conformations theory and simulations suggest that this collapse may be a two state transition characterized by barrier crossing kinetics while the collapse of homopolymers is continuous and multi phasic we have used a laser temperature jump with fluorescence spectroscopy to measure the complete time course of the collapse of denatured cytochrome c with nanosecond time resolution we find the process to be exponential in time and thermally activated with an apparent activation energy   kbt after correction for solvent viscosity  these results indicate that polypeptide collapse is kinetically a two state transition because of the observed free energy barrier the time scale of polypeptide collapse is dramatically slower than is predicted by langevin models for homopolymer collapse
