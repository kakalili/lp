complementation of yeast arc p by the p  component of the human multisynthetase complex does not require its association with yeast metrs and glurs
yeast arc p human p  and plant methionyl trna synthetase metrs possess an emapii like domain capable of non specific interactions with trna arc p interacts with metrs mes  and glurs and operates as a trna interacting factor tif in trans of these two synthetases in plant metrs the emapii like domain is fused to the catalytic core of the synthetase and acts as a cis acting tif for aminoacylation we observed that the catalytic core of plant metrs expressed from a centromeric plasmid cannot complement a yeast arc   mes   strain overexpression of the mutant enzyme from a high copy number plasmid restored cell growth suggesting that deletion of its c terminal tif domain was responsible for the poor aminoacylation efficiency of that enzyme in vivo accordingly expression of full size plant metrs from a centromeric plasmid but also of fusion proteins between its catalytic core and the emapii like domains of yeast arc p or of human p  restored cell viability these data showed that homologous tif domains from different origins are interchangeable and may act indifferently in trans or in cis of the catalytic domain of a synthetase unexpectedly co expression of arc p with the catalytic core of plant metrs restored cell viability as well even though arc p did not associate with plant metrs because arc p also interacts with yeast glurs restoration of cell growth could be due at least in part to its role of cofactor for that enzyme however co expression of human p  a tif that did not associate with plant metrs or with yeast glurs and metrs also restored cell viability of a yeast strain that expressed the catalytic core of plant metrs these results show that p  and arc p are able to facilitate trna aminoacylation in vivo even if they do not interact physically with the synthetases we propose that p  arc p may be involved in sequestering trnas in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells thereby increasing their availability for protein synthesis
