molybdoproteomes and evolution of molybdenum utilization
the trace element molybdenum mo is utilized in many life forms and it is a key component of several enzymes involved in nitrogen sulfur and carbon metabolism with the exception of nitrogenase mo is bound in proteins to a pterin thus forming the molybdenum cofactor moco at the catalytic sites of molybdoenzymes although a number of molybdoenzymes are well characterized structurally and functionally evolutionary analyses of mo utilization are limited here we carried out comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses to examine the occurrence and evolution of mo utilization in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes at the level of i mo transport and moco utilization trait and ii mo dependent enzymes our results revealed that most prokaryotes and all higher eukaryotes utilize mo whereas many unicellular eukaryotes including parasites and most yeasts lost the ability to use this metal in addition eukaryotes have fewer molybdoenzyme families than prokaryotes dimethylsulfoxide reductase dmsor and sulfite oxidase so families were the most widespread molybdoenzymes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively a distant group of the modabc transport system was predicted in the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrobaculum mode type regulation of mo uptake occurred in less than   of moco utilizing organisms a link between mo and selenocysteine utilization in prokaryotes was also identified wherein the selenocysteine trait was largely a subset of the mo trait presumably due to formate dehydrogenase a mo and selenium containing protein finally analysis of environmental conditions and organisms that do or do not depend on mo revealed that host associated organisms and organisms with low g c content tend to reduce their mo utilization overall our data provide new insights into mo utilization and show its wide occurrence yet limited use of this metal in individual organisms in all three domains of life
