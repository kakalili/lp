virtual interaction profiles of proteins edited by f e cohen
we have developed a new method for the prediction of peptide sequences that bind to a protein given a three dimensional structure of the protein in complex with a peptide by applying a recently developed sequence prediction algorithm and a novel ensemble averaging calculation we generate a diverse collection of peptide sequences that are predicted to have significant affinity for the protein using output from the simulations we create position specific scoring matrices or virtual interaction profiles vips  comparison of vips for a collection of binding motifs to sequences determined experimentally indicates that the prediction algorithm is accurate and applicable to a diverse range of structures with these vips one can scan protein sequence databases rapidly to seek binding partners of potential biological significance overall this method can significantly enhance the information contained within a protein peptide crystal structure and enrich the data obtained by experimental selection methods such as phage display
