kinetic intermediates of   microglobulin fibril elongation probed by pulse labeling h d exchange combined with nmr analysis
amyloid fibril elongation in denatured proteins involves cycles of coupled binding and misfolding to gain insights into possible kinetic intermediates we performed hydrogen deuterium exchange of amide protons during fibril elongation with   microglobulin   m at pd   under which conditions   m is acid denatured to study the conformational change in monomeric   m monitored by nmr spectroscopy we used  n labeled monomers and nonlabeled seeds pulse labeling hydrogen deuterium exchange with a quenched flow apparatus indicated that the rate limiting intermediate at pd   is not protected from the exchange even disrupting a hydrophobic cluster present in the acid denatured   m significant protection was acquired upon transition to the fibrils in view of the suggestion that the rate limiting intermediates are bound to the lateral surface of seed fibrils weak interactions with a largely unfolded conformation might be useful for their dynamic sliding to the growing ends the results support a new model of fibril elongation with intermediates bound to the lateral surface of seeds
