from strand exchange to branch migration bypassing of non homologous sequences by human rad  and rad
rad  and rad  play crucial roles during homologous recombination the biochemical activities of human rad  hrad  and human rad  hrad  and their interactions with each other are well documented however it is not known how these two proteins work together to bypass heterologous sequences i e mismatched base pairs during homologous recombination in this study we used a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to monitor homologous recombination processes in real time so that the interactions between hrad  and hrad  during dna strand exchange and branch migration which are two core steps of homologous recombination could be characterized our results indicate that hrad  can facilitate hrad  promoted strand exchange through various degrees of mismatching we propose that the main roles of hrad  in homologous recombination is to initiate the homology recognition and strand exchange steps and those of hrad  are to promote efficient branch migration bypass potential mismatches and facilitate long range strand exchanges through branch migration of holliday junctions
