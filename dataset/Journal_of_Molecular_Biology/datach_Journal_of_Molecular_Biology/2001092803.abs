sf asf binds to a splicing enhancer in the third hiv  tat exon and stimulates u af binding independently of the rs domain edited by j karn
splicing of a single hiv  primary transcript into more than  different mrnas is regulated by a combination of suboptimal splice sites cis acting rna splicing enhancers and silencers and trans acting factors we have studied the splicing of the second tat intron sd to sa  and find that activation of splicing by sf asf is mediated by a degenerate exon splicing enhancer ese  consisting of at least three functionally independent sub elements one of these sub elements appears to have both enhancing and silencing properties depending on the context sf asf stimulates u af  binding to the suboptimal tat polypyrimidine tract in an ese dependent manner whereas the exon splicing silencer ess  that is located downstream of the ese inhibits this step truncated sf asf protein without the rs domain binds specifically to the ese and retains almost full capacity to stimulate u af  binding and activate splicing this suggests that sf asf can stimulate the recruitment of u af  by an rs domain independent mechanism
