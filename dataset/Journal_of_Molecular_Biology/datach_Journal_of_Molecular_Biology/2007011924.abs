involvement of dead box proteins in group i and group ii intron splicing biochemical characterization of mss  p atp hydrolysis dependent and independent mechanisms and general rna chaperone activity
the rna catalyzed splicing of group i and group ii introns is facilitated by proteins that stabilize the active rna structure or act as rna chaperones to disrupt stable inactive structures that are kinetic traps in rna folding in neurospora crassa and saccharomyces cerevisiae the latter function is fulfilled by specific dead box proteins denoted cyt  and mss  p respectively previous studies showed that purified cyt  stimulates the in vitro splicing of structurally diverse group i and group ii introns and uses the energy of atp binding or hydrolysis to resolve kinetic traps here we purified mss  p and show that it has rna dependent atpase activity unwinds rna duplexes in a non polar fashion and promotes atp independent strand annealing further we show that mss  p binds rna non specifically and promotes in vitro splicing of both group i and group ii intron rnas as well as rna cleavage by the ai  derived d  ribozyme however mss  p also has atp hydrolysis independent effects on some of these reactions which are not shared by cyt  and may reflect differences in its rna binding properties we also show that a non mitochondrial dead box protein yeast ded p can function almost as efficiently as cyt  and mss  p in splicing the yeast ai  group ii intron and less efficiently in splicing the bi group ii intron together our results show that mss  p like cyt   can act broadly as an rna chaperone to stimulate the splicing of diverse group i and group ii introns and that ded p also has an rna chaperone activity that can be assayed by its effect on splicing mitochondrial introns nevertheless these dead box protein rna chaperones are not completely interchangeable and appear to function in somewhat different ways using biochemical activities that have likely been tuned by coevolution to function optimally on specific rna substrates
