structural evaluation of potent nkt cell agonists implications for design of novel stimulatory ligands
natural killer t nkt cells are a subset of t cells that are activated by cd d  glycolipid complexes through a semi invariant   t cell receptor nkt tcr  upon activation nkt cells secrete regulatory cytokines that are implicated in t helper cell responses   galactosylceramide   galcer is a potent nkt cell agonist when presented by cd d phenyl ring substitutions of the  galcer fatty acid moiety were recently found to be superior in eliciting regulatory cytokines crystal structures of four new mouse cd d  lipid complexes five structures  a new pbs  complex and cd d with an endogenous ligand at        resolution reveal that the  galcer phenyl analogues impart minor structural differences to the a  pocket while the sphingosine and galactose moieties important for nkt tcr recognition remain virtually unchanged the observed differences in cytokine release profiles appear to be associated with increased stability of the cd d  glycolipid complexes rather than increased affinity for the nkt tcr furthermore comparison of mouse cd d  glycolipid complexes in different crystallographic space groups reveals considerable conformational variation particularly above the f  pocket the primary site of interaction with the nkt tcr we propose that modifications of the sphingosine moiety or other substitutions that decrease  galcer flexibility would stabilize the f  pocket such compounds might then increase cd d affinity for the nkt tcr and further enhance the stimulatory and regulatory properties of  galcer derivatives
