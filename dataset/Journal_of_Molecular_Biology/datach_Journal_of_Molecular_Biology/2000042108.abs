aminoglycoside binding in the major groove of duplex rna the thermodynamic and electrostatic forces that govern recognition edited by i tinoco
we use a combination of spectroscopic calorimetric viscometric and computer modeling techniques to characterize the binding of the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin to the polymeric rna duplex poly ri  poly rc  which exhibits the characteristic a type conformation that is conserved among natural and synthetic double helical rna sequences our results reveal the following significant features  i cd detected binding of tobramycin to poly ri  poly rc reveals an apparent site size of four base pairs per bound drug molecule  ii tobramycin binding enhances the thermal stability of the host poly ri  poly rc duplex the extent of which decreases upon increasing in na concentration and or ph conditions  iii the enthalpy of tobramycin poly ri  poly rc complexation increases with increasing ph conditions an observation consistent with binding induced protonation of one or more drug amino groups  iv the affinity of tobramycin for poly ri  poly rc is sensitive to both ph and na concentration with increases in ph and or na concentration resulting in a concomitant reduction in binding affinity the salt dependence of the tobramycin binding affinity reveals that the drug binds to the host rna duplex as trication  v the thermodynamic driving force for tobramycin poly ri  poly rc complexation depends on ph conditions specifically at ph    tobramycin binding is entropy driven but is enthalpy driven at ph gt    vi viscometric data reveal non intercalative binding properties when tobramycin complexes with poly ri  poly rc  consistent with a major groove directed mode of binding these data also are consistent with a binding induced reduction in the apparent molecular length of the host rna duplex  vii computer modeling studies reveal a tobramycin poly ri  poly rc complex in which the drug fits snugly at the base of the rna major groove and is stabilized at least in part by an array of hydrogen bonding interactions with both base and backbone atoms of the host rna these studies also demonstrate an inability of tobramycin to form a stable low energy complex with the minor groove of the poly ri  poly rc duplex in the aggregate our results suggest that tobramycin rna recognition is dictated and controlled by a broad range of factors that include electrostatic interactions hydrogen bonding interactions drug protonation reactions and binding induced alterations in the structure of the host rna these modulatory effects on tobramycin rna complexation are discussed in terms of their potential importance for the selective recognition of specific rna structural motifs such as asymmetric internal loops or hairpin loop stem junctions by aminoglycoside antibiotics and their derivatives
