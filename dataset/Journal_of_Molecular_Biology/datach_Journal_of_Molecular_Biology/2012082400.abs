dnaja antagonizes constitutive hsp  mediated stabilization of tau
tau aggregation and amyloidogenesis are common hallmarks for neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies the molecular chaperone network constitutes the cellular defense against insults such as tau aggregation however chaperone effects on tau are dichotomous loss of tau s microtubule binding activity facilitates an inappropriate chaperone interaction that promotes an amyloidogenic tau conformation conversely other chaperones are capable of promoting tau clearance here we demonstrate that a critical contributor to tau triage is the dnaj binding domain of hsp  proteins in particular over expression of the constitutive dnaj dnaja  mediated tau clearance while knockdown facilitated tau accumulation this clearance was not specific to distinct pathogenic tau species the activity of dnaja was attenuated by concomitant increases in hsp  tau reductions facilitated by dnaja were dependent on the integrity of lysines known to be poly ubiquitinated in human alzheimer s brain in vivo dnaja and tau levels were inversely correlated the effects of dnaja were partially specific dnaja reduced the levels of a polyq protein but had no significant effect on  synuclein levels these data suggest that dnaja triages all tau species for ubiquitin dependent clearance mechanisms moreover the levels of dnaja and hsp  seem to play against each other with regard to tau as dnaja levels increase tau levels are reduced but this can be prevented if hsp  levels are simultaneously induced thus the dnaj repertoire possibly represents a powerful set of genetic modifiers for tau pathogenesis further investigations could provide new insights about triage decisions that facilitate or prevent amyloidogenesis of tau and other proteins associated with neurodegenerative disease
