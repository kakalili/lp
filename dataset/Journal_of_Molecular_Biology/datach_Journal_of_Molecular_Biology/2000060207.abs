identification and characterisation of the selenocysteine specific translation factor selb from the archaeon methanococcus jannaschii edited by j karn
selenocysteine insertion into archaeal selenopolypeptides is directed through an mrna structure the secis element situated in the   non translated region like in eukaryotes to elucidate the mechanism how this element affects decoding of an in frame uga with selenocysteine the open reading frames of the genome of methanococcus jannaschii were searched for the existence of a homolog to the bacterial specialized translation factor selb the product of the open reading frame mj   was identified as the archaeal selb homolog on the basis of the following characteristics   mj   possesses sequence features characteristic of bacterial selb   purified mj   displays guanine nucleotide binding properties like selb and   it preferentially binds selenocysteyl trnasec in contrast to bacterial selb however no binding of mj   protein to the secis element of the mrna was found under the experimental conditions employed which correlates with the fact that mj   lacks the c terminal domain of the bacterial selb protein known to bind the secis element it is speculated that in archaea the functions of bacterial selb are distributed over at least two proteins one serving as the specific translation factor like mj   and another one binding to the secis which interacts with the ribosome and primes it to decode uga
