nmr structures of two variants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti reveal unexpected influence of mutations on protein structure and stability
here we determined nmr solution structures of two mutants of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti to reveal structural reasons of their decreased thermodynamic stability a point mutation a v in the solvent exposed loop destabilizes the protein by   c in contrast to marginal destabilization observed for g s r l or w mutants in the second mutant introduction of eight alanine residues at proteinase contacting sites residues              and   provides a protein that denatures at a temperature about   c higher than expected from additive behavior of individual mutations in order to efficiently determine structures of these variants we applied a procedure that allows us to share data between regions unaffected by mutation s  noah dyana and cns programs were used for a rapid assignment of noesy cross peaks structure calculations and refinement the solution structure of the a v mutant reveals no conformational change within the molecule but shows close contacts between v  i  and g  g  thus the observed  kcal mol decrease of stability results from a strained local conformation of these residues caused by introduction of a  branched val side chain contrary to the a v mutation introduction of eight alanine residues produces significant conformational changes manifested in over a   shift of the y  side chain this structural rearrangement provides about kcal mol non additive stabilization energy compared to the mutant in which g  and r  are not mutated to alanine residues
