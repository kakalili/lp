tyr   gln  and trp  contribute to the   epoxy  p nitrophenoxy propane conjugating activity of glutathione s transferase cgstm   edited by r huber
we investigated the epoxidase activity of a class mu glutathione s transferase cgstm   using   epoxy  p nitrophenoxy propane epnp as substrate trp  on the c terminal tail arg  on the   helix asp  and gln  on the   helix of cgstm  were selected for mutagenesis and kinetic studies a hydrophobic side chain at residue   is needed for the epoxidase activity of cgstm   replacing trp  with histidine isoleucine or proline resulted in a fivefold to  fold decrease in the kcatapp of the enzyme while a modest   decrease in the kcatapp was observed for the w  f mutant the rgstm  enzyme has serine at the correponding position the kcatapp of the s  w mutant is   fold higher than that of the wild type rgstm   a charged residue is needed at position   of cgstm   the kmgshapp of the r  l mutant is  fold lower than that of the wild type enzyme on the contrary the r  e mutant has a kmgshapp and a kcatapp that are  fold and   lower than those of the wild type cgstm   the substitutions of gln  with glu or leu have minimal effect on the affinity of the mutants towards gsh or epnp however a discernible reduction in kcatapp was observed asp  is involved in maintaining the structural integrity of the enzyme the kmgshapp of the d  l mutant is   fold higher than that of the wild type enzyme in the hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments this mutant has the highest level of deuteration among all the proteins tested we also elucidated the structure of cgstm  co crystallized with the glutathionyl conjugated   epoxy  p nitrophenoxy propane epnp at    resolution the product found in the active site was  hydroxy  s glutathionyl   p nitrophenoxy propane instead of the conventional  hydroxy isomer the epnp moiety orients towards arg  and gln  in dimer ab and protrudes into a hydrophobic region formed by the loop connecting   and   and part of the c terminal tail in dimer cd the phenoxyl ring forms strong ring stacking with the trp  side chain in dimer cd we hypothesize that these two conformations represent the epnp moiety close to the initial and final stages of the reaction mechanism respectively
