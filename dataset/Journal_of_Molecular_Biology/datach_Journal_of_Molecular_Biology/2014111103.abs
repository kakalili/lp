a cutinase from trichoderma reesei with a lid covered active site and kinetic properties of true lipases
cutinases belong to the    hydrolase fold family of enzymes and degrade cutin and various esters including triglycerides phospholipids and galactolipids cutinases are able to degrade aggregated and soluble substrates because in contrast with true lipases they do not have a lid covering their catalytic machinery we report here the structure of a cutinase from the fungus trichoderma reesei tr in native and inhibitor bound conformations along with its enzymatic characterization a rare characteristic of tr cutinase is its optimal activity at acidic ph furthermore tr cutinase in contrast with classical cutinases possesses a lid covering its active site and requires the presence of detergents for activity in addition to the presence of the lid the core of the tr enzyme is very similar to other cutinase cores with a central five stranded  sheet covered by helices on either side the catalytic residues form a catalytic triad involving ser   his  and asp  that is covered by the two n terminal helices which form the lid this lid opens in the presence of surfactants such as  octylglucoside and uncovers the catalytic crevice allowing a c y phosphonate inhibitor to bind to the catalytic serine taken together these results reveal tr cutinase to be a member of a new group of lipolytic enzymes resembling cutinases but with kinetic and structural features of true lipases and a heightened specificity for long chain triglycerides
