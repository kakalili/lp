a proximal arginine r  participates in switching of the bradyrhizobium japonicum fixl oxygen sensor
in oxygen sensing pas domains a conserved polar residue on the proximal side of the heme cofactor usually arginine or histidine interacts alternately with the protein in the  on state  or the heme edge in the  off state  but does not contact the bound ligand directly we assessed the contributions of this residue in bradyrhizobium japonicum fixl by determining the effects of an r  a substitution on the heme pas structure ligand affinity and regulatory capacity the crystal structures of the unliganded forms of the r  a and wild type bjfixl heme pas domains were similar except for a more ruffled porphyrin ring in r  a bjfixl and a relaxation of the h  residue and heme propionate  due to their lost interactions the oxygen affinity of r  a bjfixl kd     m was   times lower than that of bjfixl and this was due to a higher off rate constant for the r  a variant the enzymatic activities of the unliganded  on state  forms either deoxy or met r  a bjfixl were comparable to each other and slightly lower twofold less than those of the corresponding bjfixl species the most striking difference between the two proteins was in the enzymatic activities of the liganded  off state  forms in particular saturation with a regulatory ligand the feiii form with cyanide caused a gt   fold inhibition of the bjfixl phosphorylation of bjfixj but a   fold inhibition of this catalytic activity in r  a bjfixl thus in oxygen sensing pas domains the interactions of polar residues with the heme edge couple the heme binding domain to a transmitter during signal transduction
