the von willebrand factor a  collagen iii interaction is independent of conformation and type  von willebrand disease phenotype
the blood von willebrand factor vwf mediates platelet adhesion to injured vessels by sequestering platelets from blood flow and depositing them to collagen and other exposed subendothelial matrix proteins this process of capturing platelets to facilitate formation of platelet plugs occurs through transient interactions with platelet glycoprotein ib  via the vwf a domain which also binds collagen using a conformationally diverse collection of natively folded and mutation induced misfolded von willebrand disease vwd variants we test a recently proposed affinity up regulation hypothesis which states that collagen binding changes the conformation of the a domain to a high affinity gpib  binding competent state with surface plasmon resonance spr  we present this diversified collection to collagen and quantify the kinetics of association and dissociation to ascertain the conformational selectivity of collagen with analytical rheology we quantify real time platelet pause times and translocation velocities across a cu  histag chelated and collagen bound a single domain and a a a tridomain fragment of vwf under shear stress in an ex vivo shear flow microfluidic chamber in contrast to expected hypothetical outcomes collagen has limited conformational selectivity for binding a  a collagen binding is independent of gain or loss of function phenotype and under shear stress platelet translocation pause times on collagen bound a a a are either normal or shorter depending on whether a is concertedly bound with the a domain to collagen with respect to a  collagen has an inhibitory role that provides an explanation for the lack of thrombosis in patients with gain of function vwd
