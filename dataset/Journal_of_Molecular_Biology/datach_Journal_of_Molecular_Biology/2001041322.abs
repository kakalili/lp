selective recognition of pyrimidine motif triplexes by a protein encoded by the bacterial transposon tn  edited by m belfort
the bacterial transposon tn is distinguished among mobile genetic elements by its targeting abilities recently we reported that tn is able to selectively insert adjacent to triple helical dna the binding of tnsc a tn encoded protein to the triplex dna target leads to the specific transposition of tn adjacent to both inter and intramolecular pyrimidine motif triplexes here we further probe how tn targets triplex dna we report that tnsc discriminates between different types of triplexes showing binding preference for pyrimidine but not for purine motif intermolecular triplex dna the binding preferences of tnsc and the tn insertion profiles were obtained using psoralenated triplex forming oligonucleotides annealed to plasmid dnas although the presence of psoralen is not required for targeting nor is it alone able to attract tnsc we show that the location of psoralen within the pyrimidine motif triplex does alter the position of tn insertion relative to the triplex comparison between the triplex targeting pathway and the highly site specific targeting pathway mediated by the binding of the tn encoded protein tnsd to the unique site atttn  suggests that similar structural features within each target dna are recognized by tnsc leading to site specific transposition this work demonstrates that a prokaryotic protein involved in the targeting and regulation of tn translocation tnsc can selectively recognize pyrimidine motif triplexes
