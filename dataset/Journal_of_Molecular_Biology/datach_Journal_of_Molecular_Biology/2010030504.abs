structural and functional characterization of plant aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase from pisum sativum with a broad specificity for natural and synthetic aminoaldehydes
aminoaldehyde dehydrogenases amadhs ec      belong to the large aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh superfamily namely the aldh family they oxidize polyamine derived  aminoaldehydes to the corresponding  amino acids here we report the first x ray structures of plant amadhs two isoenzymes psamadh and psamadh  from pisum sativum in complex with  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad  at   and     resolution respectively both recombinant proteins are dimeric and similarly to other aldhs each monomer is composed of an oligomerization domain a coenzyme binding domain and a catalytic domain each subunit binds nad as a coenzyme contains a solvent accessible c terminal peroxisomal targeting signal type  and a cation bound in the cavity close to the nad binding site while the nad binding mode is classical for psamadh  that for psamadh is unusual among aldhs a glycerol molecule occupies the substrate binding site and mimics a bound substrate structural analysis and substrate specificity study of both isoenzymes in combination with data published previously on other aldh family members show that the established categorization of such enzymes into distinct groups based on substrate specificity is no more appropriate because many of them seem capable of oxidizing a large spectrum of aminoaldehyde substrates psamadh and psamadh can oxidize n n n trimethyl  aminobutyraldehyde into  butyrobetaine which is the carnitine precursor in animal cells this activity highly suggests that in addition to their contribution to the formation of compatible osmolytes such as glycine betaine   alanine betaine and  aminobutyric acid amadhs might participate in carnitine biosynthesis in plants
