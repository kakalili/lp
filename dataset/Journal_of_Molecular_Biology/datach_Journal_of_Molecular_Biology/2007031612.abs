crystal structure of the geobacillus stearothermophilus carboxylesterase est  and its activation of prodrug cpt
several mammalian carboxylesterases were shown to activate the prodrug irinotecan cpt   to produce  ethyl  hydroxycamptothecin sn   a topoisomerase inhibitor used in cancer therapy however the potential use of bacterial carboxylesterases which have the advantage of high stability has not been explored we present the crystal structure of the carboxyesterase est  from geobacillus stearothermophilus and evaluation of its enzyme activity on cpt   crystal structures were determined at ph   and ph   and resolution of     and      respectively est  folds into three domains a catalytic domain an    domain and a regulatory domain the structure is in an inactive form the side chain of his   one of the catalytic triad residues is directed away from the other catalytic residues ser  and glu   moreover the adjacent cys  is triply oxidized and lies in the oxyanion hole which would block the binding of substrate suggesting a regulatory role however cys  is not essential for enzyme activity mutation of cys  showed that hydrophobic side chains were favorable while polar serine was unfavorable for enzyme activity est  was shown to hydrolyze cpt  into the active form sn   the mutant c  v provided a more stable enzyme for activation of cpt   therefore engineered thermostable est  is a candidate for use with irinotecan in enzyme  prodrug cancer therapy
