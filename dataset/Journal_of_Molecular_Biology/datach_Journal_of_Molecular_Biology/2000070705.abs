acetyl phosphate dependent activation of a mutant phop response regulator that functions independently of its cognate sensor kinase edited by m gottesman
the two component system is a signal communication network generally consisting of a sensor kinase that receives inputs from the environment and modifies the phosphorylated state of a response regulator that executes an adaptive behavior phop is a response regulator that controls virulence gene expression in salmonella enterica transcription of phop regulated genes is modulated by the mg  levels detected by the sensor phoq here we describe a phop mutant protein phop   that functions in the absence of its cognate sensor thereby allowing transcription of phop activated genes independently of the mg  concentration in the environment the phop  protein harbors a s n substitution in the response regulator receiver domain phop  mediated transcription is abolished by either mutation of the aspartate residue that is conserved among response regulators as the site of phosphorylation or inactivation of the pta encoded phosphotransacetylase this enzyme mediates the production of acetyl phosphate which has been shown to serve as a low molecular mass phosphate donor for certain response regulators the purified phop  protein autophosphorylated from acetyl phosphate more efficiently than the wild type phop protein in vitro the phop  protein retained the capacity to interact with the phoq protein which promoted phosphorylation of the phop  protein in vitro and abolished phop  mediated transcription under high mg  concentrations in vivo cumulatively our results uncover a role of phoq in transcriptional repression during growth in millimolar mg  and define a mutant response regulator form with an increased capacity to be phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate
