peptides composed of alternating l and d amino acids inhibit amyloidogenesis in three distinct amyloid systems independent of sequence
there is now substantial evidence that soluble oligomers are primary toxic agents in amyloid diseases the development of an antibody recognizing the toxic soluble oligomeric forms of different and unrelated amyloid species suggests a common conformational intermediate during amyloidogenesis we previously observed a common occurrence of a novel secondary structure element which we call  sheet in molecular dynamics md simulations of various amyloidogenic proteins and we hypothesized that the toxic conformer is composed of  sheet structure as such   sheet may represent a conformational signature of the misfolded intermediates of amyloidogenesis and a potential unique binding target for peptide inhibitors recently we reported the design and characterization of a novel hairpin peptide   or ap  that adopts stable  sheet structure and inhibits the aggregation of the  amyloid peptide a   and transthyretin ap  is a  residue hairpin peptide featuring alternating d and l amino acids with favorable conformational propensities for  sheet formation and a designed turn for this study we reverse engineered ap  to identify which of its design features is most responsible for conferring  sheet stability and inhibitory activity we present experimental characterization cd and ftir of seven peptides designed to accomplish this in addition we measured their ability to inhibit aggregation in three unrelated amyloid species a   transthyretin and human islet amylin polypeptide we found that a hairpin peptide featuring alternating l and d amino acids independent of sequence is sufficient for conferring  sheet structure and inhibition of aggregation additionally we show a correlation between  sheet structural stability and inhibitory activity
