While the molecular-mechanics field has standardized on a few potential energy functions, computational protein design efforts are based on potentials that are unique to individual laboratories. Here we show that a standard molecular-mechanics potential energy function without any modifications can be used to engineer protein–ligand binding. A molecular-mechanics potential is used to reconstruct the coordinates of various binding sites with an average root-mean-square error of 0.61 Å and to reproduce known ligand-induced side-chain conformational shifts. Within a series of 34 mutants, the calculation can always distinguish between weak (Kd&gt;1 mM) and tight (Kd&lt;10 μM) binding sequences. Starting from partial coordinates of the ribose-binding protein lacking the ligand and the 10 primary contact residues, the molecular-mechanics potential is used to redesign a ribose-binding site. Out of a search space of 2×1012 sequences, the calculation selects a point mutant of the native protein as the top solution (experimental Kd=17 μM) and the native protein as the second best solution (experimental Kd=210 nM). The quality of the predictions depends on the accuracy of the generalized Born electrostatics model, treatment of protonation equilibria, high-resolution rotamer sampling, a final local energy minimization step, and explicit modeling of the bound, unbound, and unfolded states. The application of unmodified molecular-mechanics potentials to protein design links two fields in a mutually beneficial way. Design provides a new avenue for testing molecular-mechanics energy functions, and future improvements in these energy functions will presumably lead to more accurate design results.
