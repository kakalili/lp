The regulation of crystal morphology by proteins is often observed in biology. It is a central feature in the formation of hard tissues such as bones, teeth and mollusc shells. We have developed a genetic system in the bacterium Escherichia coli to study the protein-mediated control of crystal growth. We have used the crystallization of gold as a model system and found polypeptides that control the morphology of the resulting gold crystals. Analysis of the crystallization process influenced by these polypeptides indicates they act catalytically by an acid mechanism. Our results suggest that the concepts and methods of microbial genetics are general and can be applied to substances not commonly found in biological systems.
