the structural role of the copper coordinating and surface exposed histidine residue in the blue copper protein azurin edited by r huber
copper k edge extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs spectroscopy and  n nmr relaxation studies were performed on samples of a variant azurin in which the surface exposed histidine ligand of the copper atom his   has been replaced by glycine the experiments were performed to probe the structure of the active site and the protein dynamics the cavity in the protein structure created by the his   gly replacement could be filled by external ligands which can either restore the spectroscopic properties of the original type  copper site or create a new type  copper site the binding of external ligands occurs only when the copper atom is in its oxidised state in the reduced form the binding is abolished from the exafs experiments it is concluded that for the oxidised type  copper sites the protein plus external ligand l provide an nss  l donor set deriving from his  cys   met  and the external ligand the type  copper site features an s n o  donor set in which the s donor derives from cys   one n donor from his  and the remaining two n or o donors from one or more external ligands upon reduction of the type  as well as the type  site the external ligand drops out of the copper site and the coordination reduces to  fold with an ss  n donor set deriving from his  cys  and met   the cu s  met distance is reduced from about   to     analysis of the nmr data shows that the hydrophobic patch around his  has gained fluxionality when compared to wild type azurin which may explain why the his  gly variant is able to accommodate a variety of external ligands of different sizes and with different chelating properties on the other hand the structure and dynamics of the  sandwich which comprises the main body of the protein is only slightly affected by the mutation the unusually high reduction potential of the his  gly azurin is discussed in light of the present results
