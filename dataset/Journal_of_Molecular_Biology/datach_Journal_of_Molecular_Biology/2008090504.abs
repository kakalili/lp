architectures and functional coverage of protein  protein interfaces
the diverse range of cellular functions is performed by a limited number of protein folds existing in nature one may similarly expect that cellular functional diversity would be covered by a limited number of protein  protein interface architectures here we present   interface clusters each representing a unique interface architecture this data set of protein  protein interfaces is analyzed and compared with older data sets we observe that the number of both biological and crystal interfaces increases significantly compared to the number of protein data bank entries furthermore we find that the number of distinct interface architectures grows at a much faster rate than the number of folds and is yet to level off we further analyze the growth trend of the functional coverage by constructing functional interaction networks from interfaces the functional coverage is also found to steadily increase interestingly we also observe that despite the diversity of interface architectures some are more favorable and frequently used and of particular interest are the ones that are also preferred in single chains
