fibrillin microfibrils are stiff reinforcing fibres in compliant tissues
fibrillin rich microfibrils have endowed tissues with elasticity throughout multicellular evolution we have used molecular combing techniques to determine young s modulus for individual microfibrils and x ray diffraction of zonular filaments of the eye to establish the linearity of microfibril periodic extension microfibril periodicity is not altered at physiological zonular tissue extensions and young s modulus is between  mpa and  mpa which is two orders of magnitude stiffer than elastin we conclude that elasticity in microfibril containing tissues arises primarily from reversible alterations in supra microfibrillar arrangements rather than from intrinsic elastic properties of individual microfibrils which instead act as reinforcing fibres in fibrous composite tissues
