crystal structures of an o like blue form and an anion free yellow form of pharaonis halorhodopsin
halorhodopsin from natronomonas pharaonis phr was previously crystallized into a monoclinic space group c  and the structure of the chloride bound purple form was determined here we report the crystal structures of two chloride free forms of phr that is an o like blue form and an m like yellow form when the c crystal was soaked in a chloride free alkaline solution the protein packing was largely altered and the yellow form containing all trans retinal was generated upon neutralization this yellow form was converted into the blue form from structural comparison of the different forms of phr it was shown that the removal of a chloride ion from the primary binding site site i  which is located between the retinal schiff base and thr   is accompanied by such a deformation of helix c that the side chain of thr  moves toward helix g leading to a significant shrinkage of site i a large structural change is also induced in the chloride uptake pathway where a flip motion of the side chain of glu  is accompanied by large movements of the surrounding aromatic residues irrespective of different charge distributions at the active site there was no large difference in the structures of the yellow form and the blue form it is shown that the yellow to purple transition is initiated by the entrance of one water and one hcl to the active site where the proton and the chloride ion in hcl are transferred to the schiff base and site i respectively
