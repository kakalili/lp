surface decoration of microtubules by human tau
tau is a neuronal microtubule associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and promotes neurite outgrowth tau is largely unfolded in solution and presumably forms mostly random coil because of its hydrophilic nature and flexible structure tau complexed to microtubules is largely invisible by standard electron microscopy methods we applied a combination of high resolution metal shadowing and cryo electron microscopy to study the interactions between tau and microtubules we used recombinant tau variants with different domain compositions   full length tau   the repeat domain that mediates microtubule binding k   and   two gfp tau fusion proteins that contain a globular marker gfp attached to full length tau at either end all of these constructs bind exclusively to the outside of microtubules most of the tau related mass appears randomly distributed creating a  halo  of low density mass spread across the microtubule surface only a small fraction of tau creates a periodic signal at an  nm interval centered on  tubulin subunits our data suggest that tau retains most of its disordered structure even when bound to the microtubule surface hence it binds along as well as across protofilaments nevertheless even minute concentrations of tau have a strong stabilizing effect and effectively scavenge unpolymerized tubulin
