vp protein from human rhinovirus  is released by pressure and locked in the capsid by the antiviral compound win
rhinoviruses are the major causative agents of the common cold in humans here we studied the stability of human rhinovirus type   hrv  under conditions of high hydrostatic pressure low temperature and urea in the absence and presence of an antiviral drug capsid dissociation and changes in the protein conformation were monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy light scattering circular dichroism gel filtration chromatography mass spectrometry and infectivity assays the data show that high pressure induces the dissociation of hrv  and that this process is inhibited by win    maldi tof mass spectrometry experiments demonstrate that vp  the most internal viral protein is released from the capsid by pressure treatment this release of vp is concomitant with loss of infectivity our studies also show that at least one antiviral effect of the win drugs involves the locking of vp inside the capsid by blocking the dynamics associated with cell attachment
