design and isolation of temperature sensitive mutants of gal in yeast and drosophila
little is known about mechanisms responsible for the temperature sensitive ts phenotype or of the transferability of ts mutants of a specific gene between organisms using a structure based approach nine ts mutants of gal were generated in yeast by mutating four dna binding residues two of these nine yeast ts mutants were cloned into p element vectors under control of the elav and gmr promoters and transgenic drosophila lines were generated these were crossed to uas reporter lines and progeny were characterized for reporter gene expression as a function of temperature both of these yeast ts mutants show a ts phenotype in drosophila and result in rapid induction of reporter gene expression upon shifting to the permissive temperature exposed functional residues involved in protein  ligand or protein  protein interactions appear to be attractive candidate sites for generating ts mutants that are transferable between organisms
