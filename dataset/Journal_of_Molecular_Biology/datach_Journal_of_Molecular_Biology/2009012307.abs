binding hot spot in the weak protein complex of physiological redox partners yeast cytochrome c and cytochrome c peroxidase
transient protein interactions mediate many vital cellular processes such as signal transduction or intermolecular electron transfer however due to difficulties associated with their structural characterization little is known about the principles governing recognition and binding in weak transient protein complexes in particular it has not been well established whether binding hot spots which are frequently found in strong static complexes also govern transient protein interactions to address this issue we have investigated an electron transfer complex of physiological partners from yeast yeast iso  cytochrome c cc and yeast cytochrome c peroxidase ccp  using isothermal titration calorimetry and nmr spectroscopy we show that cc r  is a hot spot residue as r a mutation has a strong destabilizing effect on binding furthermore we employ a double mutant cycle to illustrate that cc r  interacts with ccp y  the present results in combination with those of earlier mutational studies have enabled us to outline the extent of the energetically important cc  ccp binding region based on our analysis we propose that binding energy hot spots which are prevalent in static protein complexes could also govern transient protein interactions
