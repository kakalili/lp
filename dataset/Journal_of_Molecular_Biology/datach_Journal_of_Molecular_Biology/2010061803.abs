homology modelling protein  ligand interactions allowing for ligand induced conformational change
current homology modelling methods do not consider small molecules in their automated processes therefore the development of a reliable tool for protein  ligand homology modelling is an important next step in generating plausible models for molecular interactions two automated protein  ligand homology modelling strategies requiring no expert knowledge from the user are investigated here both employ the  induced fit  concept with flexibility in side chains and ligand the most successful strategy superimposes the new ligand over the original ligand before homology modelling allowing the new ligand to be taken into consideration during protein modelling rather than after  facilitating conformational change in the local backbone if necessary we show that this approach results in successful modelling of the ligand and key binding site residues of angiotensin converting enzyme  ace  from its homologue ace which is not possible via conventional homology modelling or by homology modelling followed by docking several other difficult target complexes are also successfully modelled reproducing native protein  ligand contacts with significantly different biological substrates and different binding site conformations these include the modelling of cdk  cyclin dependent kinase  from cdk  thymidine phosphorylase from a bacterial homologue and dihydrofolate reductase from a recombinant variant with a markedly different inhibitor in terms of average modelling quality across  targets the ligand rmsd with respect to the experimental structure is     and     for the protein binding site for  easy  cases and     for the ligand and     for the protein binding site in  hard  cases this demonstrates the importance of selecting an optimal template ligand modelling accuracy is strongly dependent on target  template ligand structural similarity rather than target  template sequence identity however protein modelling accuracy is dependent on both our automated protein  ligand homology modelling strategy generates a higher degree of accuracy than homology modelling followed by docking generating an average ligand rmsd that is      better than docking with homology models
