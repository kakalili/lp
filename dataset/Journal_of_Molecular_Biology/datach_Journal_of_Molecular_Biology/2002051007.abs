mass determination of native smooth muscle myosin filaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy
the thick filaments of vertebrate smooth muscle have a fundamentally different arrangement of myosin molecules from the bipolar helical organization present in striated muscle filaments this side polar non helical structure is probably critical to the ability of smooth muscles to shorten by large amounts however details of myosin organization beyond this general description are unknown the non helical arrangement of myosin precludes the use of helical reconstruction methods for structural determination and a tomographic approach is required as a first step towards this goal we have determined the number of myosin molecules present at each   nm repeat in native smooth muscle myosin filaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy the mass per length of myosin filaments was  kda nm corresponding to        mean s e m  myosin molecules at each   nm level the mass of thin filaments in the preparation intrinsic control was  kda nm consistent with current models of smooth muscle thin filament structure and the mass of tobacco mosaic virus mass standard was within  of the known value we conclude that native smooth muscle myosin filaments contain four myosin molecules at each   nm level two on each side of the side polar structure
