sigma  promoters in escherichia coli specific transcription in dense regions of overlapping promoter like signals
we present here a computational analysis showing that sigma  house keeping promoters are located within zones with high densities of promoter like signals in escherichia coli and we introduce strategies that allow for the correct computer prediction of sigma  promoters based on   experimentally verified promoters of e coli k   we generated and evaluated more than   weight matrices optimizing different criteria to obtain the best recognition matrices the alignments generating the best statistical models did not fully correspond with the canonical sigma  model however matrices that correspond to such a canonical model performed better as tools for prediction we tested the predictive capacity of these matrices on   bp long regions upstream of gene starts where   of the known promoters occur the computational matrix models generated an average of  promoter like signals within each   bp region in more than   of the cases the true promoter does not have the best score within the region we observed in fact that real promoters occur mostly within regions with high densities of overlapping putative promoters we evaluated several strategies to identify promoters the best one uses an intrinsic score of the    and    hexamers that form the promoter as well as an extrinsic score that uses the distribution of promoters from the start of the gene we were able to identify   true promoters correctly generating an average of   putative promoters per region as output of which   on average exist in clusters as a series of overlapping potentially competing rna polymerase binding sites as far as we know this is the highest predictive capability reported so far this high signal density is found mainly within regions upstream of genes contrasting with coding regions and regions located between convergently transcribed genes these results are consistent with experimental evidence that show the existence of multiple overlapping promoter sites that become functional under particular conditions this density is probably the consequence of a rich number of vestiges of promoters in evolution we suggest that transcriptional regulators as well as other functional promoters play an important role in keeping these latent signals suppressed
