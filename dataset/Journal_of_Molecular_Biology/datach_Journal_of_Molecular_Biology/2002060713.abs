kinetic studies and structural models of the association of e coli   rna polymerase with the  pr promoter large scale conformational changes in forming the kinetically significant intermediates
the kinetics of interaction of e   rna polymerase r with the  pr promoter p were investigated by filter binding over a broad range of temperatures      c and concentrations of rna polymerase     nm in large excess over promoter dna under all conditions examined the kinetics of formation of competitor resistant complexes i  rpo are single exponential with first order rate constant  cr interpretation of the polymerase concentration dependence of  cr in terms of the three step mechanism of open complex formation yields the equilibrium constant k for formation of the first kinetically significant intermediate i  and the forward rate constant k  for the conformational change converting i to the second kinetically significant intermediate i r p  k i  k i use of rapid quench mixing allows k and k to be individually determined over the entire temperature range investigated previously not possible at this promoter using manual mixing given the large  gt  bp interface formed in i  its relatively small binding constant k at   c at this salt      m   strongly argues that binding free energy is used to drive large scale structural changes in polymerase and or promoter dna or other coupled processes evidence for coupling of protein folding is provided by the large and negative activation heat capacity of ka  cao         kcalk    now shown directly to originate largely from formation of i   c o       kcalk    rather than from the formation of i as previously proposed the isomerization i  i exhibits relatively slow kinetics and has a very large temperature independent arrhenius activation energy e act    kcal  this kinetic signature suggests that formation of the transition state i  i   involves large conformational changes dominated by changes in the exposure of polar and or charged surface to water structural and biochemical data lead to the following hypotheses to interpret these results we propose that formation of i involves coupled folding of unstructured regions of polymerase      and    and bending of promoter dna in the    region  we propose that interactions with region  of   and possibly domain  of  induce a kink at the       base pairs of the  pr promoter which places the downstream dna    to   in the jaws of the  and    subunits of polymerase in i  these early interactions of  and    with the dna downstream of position   trigger jaw closing with coupled folding and subsequent steps of dna opening
