selectional and mutational scope of peptides sequestering the jun  fos coiled coil domain
the activator protein  ap  complex plays a crucial role in numerous pathways and its ability to induce tumorigenesis is well documented thus ap  represents an interesting therapeutic target we selected peptides from phage display and compared their ability to disrupt the cfos cjun interaction to a previously described in vivo protein fragment complementation assay pca  a cjun based library was screened to enrich for peptides that disrupt the ap  complex by binding to the cfos coiled coil domain interestingly phage display identified one helix junwph  phage selected winning peptide clone  targeting cfos  which differs in only  out of  randomized positions to junw pca selected winning peptide targeting cfos  phage selected peptides revealed higher affinity to cfos than wild type cjun harboring a tm of    c compared to    c for cfos cjun or    c for cfos junw in pca growth assays in the presence of cjun as competitor phage selected junwph conferred shorter generation times than junw bacterial growth was barely detectable using junwph as a competitor for the wild type cjun cfos interaction indicating efficient cfos removal from the dimeric wild type complex importantly all inhibitory peptides were able to interfere with dna binding as demonstrated in gel shift assays the selected sequences have consequently improved our  bzip coiled coil interaction prediction algorithm  in distinguishing interacting from noninteracting coiled coil sequences predicting and manipulating protein interaction will accelerate the systems biology field and generated peptides will be valuable tools for analytical and biomedical applications
