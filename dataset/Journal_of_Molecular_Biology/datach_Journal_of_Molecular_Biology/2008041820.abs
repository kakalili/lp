the crystal structure of dehi reveals a new  haloacid dehalogenase fold and active site mechanism
haloacid dehalogenases catalyse the removal of halides from organic haloacids and are of interest for bioremediation and for their potential use in the synthesis of industrial chemicals we present the crystal structure of the homodimer dehi from pseudomonas putida strain pp  the first structure of a group i  haloacid dehalogenase that can process both l and d substrates the structure shows that the dehi monomer consists of two domains of    amino acids that have    sequence identity yet adopt virtually identical and unique folds that form a pseudo dimer analysis of the active site reveals the likely binding mode of both l and d substrates with respect to key catalytic residues asp  is predicted to activate a water molecule for nucleophilic attack of the substrate chiral centre resulting in an inversion of configuration of either l or d substrates in contrast to d only enzymes these details will assist with future bioengineering of dehalogenases
