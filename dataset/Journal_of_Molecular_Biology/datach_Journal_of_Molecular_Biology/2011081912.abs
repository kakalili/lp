the structure of ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase from chlamydia trachomatis implications for its broad substrate specificity
we have previously reported the structures of the native holo and substrate bound forms of ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase from arabidopsis thaliana atdap at  here we report the crystal and molecular structures of the ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase from chlamydia trachomatis ctdap at in the apo form and the pyridoxal   phosphate bound form the molecular structure of ctdap at shows that its overall fold is essentially identical with that of atdap at except that ctdap at adopts an  open  conformation as opposed to the  closed  conformation of atdap at although atdap at and ctdap at are approximately   identical in their primary sequence they have major differences in their substrate specificities atdap at is highly specific for ll dap whereas ctdap at accepts a wider range of substrates since all of the residues involved in substrate recognition are highly conserved between atdap at and ctdap at we propose that differences in flexibility of the loops lining the active site region between the two enzymes likely account for the differences in substrate specificity
