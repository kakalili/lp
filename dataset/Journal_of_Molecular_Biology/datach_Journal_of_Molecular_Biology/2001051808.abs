identification of thermodynamically relevant interactions between ef tu and backbone elements of trna edited by d e draper
a set of  different trnas each containing a single deoxynucleotide substitution covering the upper half of the molecule was used in conjunction with a high throughput ribonuclease protection assay to investigate the thermodynamic role of   hydroxyl groups in stabilizing a complex with elongation factor tu ef tu from thermus thermophilus five distinct   hydroxyl groups were identified where substitution with a proton resulted in an approximately tenfold decrease in the binding affinity the same five   hydroxyl groups reduced the affinity of the interaction with the nearly identical thermus aquaticus ef tu four of these   hydroxyl groups were observed to form hydrogen bonds in a co crystal structure of trnaphe and t aquaticus ef tu while the fifth   hydroxyl group can be associated with an intramolecular hydrogen bond in the trna however four additional hydrogen bonds to   hydroxyl groups observed in the crystal structure show no thermodynamic effect upon disruption some of these discrepancies may be reconciled based on the unbound structures of the protein and rna
