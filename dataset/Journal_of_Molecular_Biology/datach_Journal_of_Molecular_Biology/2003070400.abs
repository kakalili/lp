functional restoration of the ca  myristoyl switch in a recoverin mutant
recoverin is a neuronal calcium sensor protein that plays a crucial role in vertebrate phototransduction it undergoes a ca  myristoyl switch when ca  binds to its two functional ef hand motifs ef hands  and   each present in one of recoverin s two domains impairment of ca  binding in recoverin leads to a disturbance of the ca  myristoyl switch and loss of its regulatory properties i e inhibiton of rhodopsin kinase we have engineered recoverin mutants with either of the two functional ef hands disabled but with a functional ca  binding site in ef hand  while a defect in ef hand  could not be rescued by the additional ef hand  the impairment of ef hand  was powerfully compensated by ca  binding to ef hand  for example the myristoylated form of the latter mutant bound to membranes in a ca  dependent way and was able to inhibit rhodopsin kinase in a way similar to that of the wild type protein thus for recoverin to undergo a ca  myristoyl switch it is necessary and sufficient to have either of the two ef hands in the second domain in a functional state on the basis of these results and inspection of published three dimensional structures of recoverin we propose a model highlighting the mutual interdependence of sterical configurations in ef hands  and  of recoverin
