the mammalian rab family of small gtpases definition of family and subfamily sequence motifs suggests a mechanism for functional specificity in the ras superfamily edited by m yaniv
the rab ypt sec family forms the largest branch of the ras superfamily of gtpases acting as essential regulators of vesicular transport pathways we used the large amount of information in the databases to analyse the mammalian rab family we defined rab conserved sequences that we designate rab family rabf motifs using the conserved pm and g motifs as  landmarks   the rab specific regions were used to identify new rab proteins in the databases and suggest rules for nomenclature surprisingly we find that rabf regions cluster in and around switch i and switch ii regions i e the regions that change conformation upon gdp or gtp binding this finding suggests that specificity of rab effector interaction cannot be conferred solely through the switch regions as is usually inferred instead we propose a model whereby an effector binds to rabf switch regions to discriminate between nucleotide bound states and simultaneously to other regions that confer specificity to the interaction possibly rab subfamily rabsf specific regions that we also define here we discuss structural and functional data that support this model and its general applicability to the ras superfamily of proteins
