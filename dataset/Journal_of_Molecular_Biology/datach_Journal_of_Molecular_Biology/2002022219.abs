troponin i interacts with the met  region of skeletal muscle actin implications for the mechanism of thin filament regulation by calcium edited by m f moody
striated muscles are regulated by ca via the thin filament proteins troponin tn and tropomyosin tm  in the absence of ca  contraction is inhibited whereas myosin actin interaction and contraction can take place in its presence although it is well established that the interaction of troponin i tni  the inhibitory subunit of tn with actin is required for the inhibition process and that there are two separate actin binding regions in tni that interact with actin the molecular mechanism of this inhibition process is still not clear using tni mutants with photocrosslinking probes attached to genetically engineered cysteine residues in each of the two actin binding regions we show that both regions are close to met  of actin in its outer domain it has been proposed that the ca  induced activation of contraction involves the movement of tm from the outer to the inner domain of the actin filament on the basis of our results presented here we propose that the position of tm at the outer domain of actin in the ca  free state is stabilized by the presence of tni over actin  s outer domain via mutual interactions of all three components in the presence of ca  tni  s actin binding regions dissociate from actin allowing tm to move toward actin  s inner domain
