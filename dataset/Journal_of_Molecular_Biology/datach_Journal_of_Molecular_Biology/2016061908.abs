zooming in on transcription preinitiation
class ii gene transcription commences with the assembly of the preinitiation complex pic from a plethora of proteins and protein assemblies in the nucleus including the general transcription factors gtfs  rna polymerase ii rna pol ii  co activators co repressors and more tfiid a megadalton sized multiprotein complex comprising  subunits is among the first gtfs to bind the core promoter tfiid assists in nucleating pic formation completed by binding of further factors in a highly regulated stepwise fashion recent results indicate that tfiid itself is built from distinct preformed submodules which reside in the nucleus but also in the cytosol of cells here we highlight recent insights in transcription factor assembly and the regulation of transcription preinitiation
