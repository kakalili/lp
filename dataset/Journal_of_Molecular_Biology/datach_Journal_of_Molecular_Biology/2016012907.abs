structural stability and local dynamics in disease causing mutants of human apolipoprotein a i what makes the protein amyloidogenic
apoa i the major protein of plasma high density lipoprotein removes cellular cholesterol and protects against atherosclerosis apoa i mutations can cause familial amyloidosis a life threatening disease wherein n terminal protein fragments form fibrils in vital organs to unveil the protein misfolding mechanism and to understand why some mutations cause amyloidosis while others do not we analyzed the structure stability and lipid binding properties of naturally occurring mutants of full length human apoa i causing either amyloidosis g r w r f y and l  p or aberrant lipid metabolism l  r  global and local protein conformation and dynamics in solution were assessed by circular dichroism fluorescence and hydrogen  deuterium exchange mass spectrometry all mutants showed increased deuteration in residues     supporting our hypothesis that decreased protection of this major amyloid  hot spot  can trigger protein misfolding in addition l  r showed local helical unfolding near the mutation site consistent with cleavage of this mutant in plasma to generate the labile    fragment together the results suggest that reduced protection of the major amyloid  hot spot   combined with the structural integrity of the native helix bundle conformation shifts the balance from protein clearance to  aggregation a delicate balance between the overall structural integrity of a globular protein and the local destabilization of its amyloidogenic segments may be a fundamental determinant of this and other amyloid diseases furthermore mutation induced conformational changes observed in the helix bundle which comprises the n terminal   of apoa i and its flexible c terminal tail suggest the propagation of structural perturbations to distant sites via an unexpected template induced ensemble based mechanism challenging the classical structure based view
