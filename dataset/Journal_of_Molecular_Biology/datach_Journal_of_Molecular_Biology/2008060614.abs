physical basis of structural and catalytic zn binding sites in proteins
zn  an element that is essential to all life forms can play a catalytic or a solely structural role previous works have shown that zn  binds preferentially to water molecules and his in catalytic sites but to cys  instructural sites but the molecular basis for the observed ligand preference is unclear here we show that the different zn  roles are also reflected in the different bond distances to zn  in structural and catalytic sites we reveal the physical basis for the observed differences between structural and catalytic zn sites in most catalytic sites water is found bound to zn  as it transfers the least charge to zn  and is less bulky compared to the protein ligands enabling zn  to serve as a lewis acid in catalysis in most structural sites however    cys  are found bound to zn  as cys  transfers the most charge to zn  and reduces the zn charge to such an extent that zn  can no longer act as a lewis acid furthermore steric repulsion among the bulky cys s   prevents zn  from accommodating another ligand based on the observed ligand preference and zn  ligand distance differences between structural and catalytic zn sites we present a simple method for distinguishing the two types of sites and for verifying the catalytic role of zn  finally we discuss how the physical bases revealed aid in designing potential drug molecules that target zn proteins
