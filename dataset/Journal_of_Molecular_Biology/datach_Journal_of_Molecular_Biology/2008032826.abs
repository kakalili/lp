insect juvenile hormone binding protein shows ancestral fold present in human lipid binding proteins
low molecular weight juvenile hormone binding proteins jhbps are specific carriers of juvenile hormone jh in the hemolymph of butterflies and moths as hormonal signal transmitters these proteins exert a profound effect on insect development the crystal structure of jhbp from galleria mellonella shows an unusual fold consisting of a long  helix wrapped in a highly curved antiparallel  sheet jhbp structurally resembles the folding pattern found in tandem repeats in some mammalian lipid binding proteins with similar organization of one cavity and a disulfide bond between the long helix and the  sheet jhbp reveals therefore an archetypal fold used by nature for hydrophobic ligand binding the jhbp molecule possesses two hydrophobic cavities several lines of experimental evidence conclusively indicate that jhbp binds jh in only one cavity close to the n and c termini and that this binding induces a structural change the second cavity located at the opposite end of the molecule could bind another ligand
