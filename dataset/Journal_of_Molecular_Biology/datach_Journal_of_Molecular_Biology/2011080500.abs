evolutionary connections between coding and splicing regulatory regions in the fibronectin eda exon
research on exonic coding sequences has demonstrated that many substitutions at the amino acid level may also reflect profound changes at the level of splicing regulatory regions these results have revealed that for many alternatively spliced exons there is considerable pressure to strike a balance between two different and sometimes conflicting forces the drive to improve the quality and production efficiency of proteins and the maintenance of proper exon recognition by the splicing machinery up to now the systems used to investigate these connections have mostly focused on short alternatively spliced exons that contain a high density of splicing regulatory elements although this is obviously a desirable feature in order to maximize the chances of spotting connections it also complicates the process of drawing straightforward evolutionary pathways between different species because of the numerous alternative pathways through which the same end point can be achieved  the alternatively spliced fibronectin extra domain a exon also referred to as edi or eiiia does not have these limitations as its inclusion is already known to depend on a single exonic splicing enhancer element within its sequence in this study we have compared the rat and human fibronectin eda exons with regard to rna structure exonic splicing enhancer strengths and sr protein occupancy the results gained from these analyses have then been used to perform an accurate evaluation of eda sequences observed in a wide range of animal species this comparison strongly suggests the existence of an evolutionary connection between changes at the nucleotide levels and the need to maintain efficient eda recognition in different species
