microsecond hydrophobic collapse in the folding of escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase an    type protein
using small angle x ray scattering combined with a continuous flow mixing device we monitored the microsecond compaction dynamics in the folding of escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase an    type protein a significant collapse of the radius of gyration from    to     occurs within    s after the initiation of refolding by a urea dilution jump the subsequent folding after the major chain collapse occurs on a considerably longer time scale the protein folding trajectories constructed by comparing the development of the compactness and the secondary structure suggest that the specific hydrophobic collapse model rather than the framework model better explains the experimental observations the folding trajectory of this    type protein is located between those of  helical and  sheet proteins suggesting that native structure determines the folding landscape
