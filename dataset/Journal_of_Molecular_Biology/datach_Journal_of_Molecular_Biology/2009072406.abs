structure of the human rev  dna  dntp ternary complex
y family dna polymerases have proven to be remarkably diverse in their functions and in strategies for replicating through dna lesions the structure of yeast rev ternary complex has revealed the most radical replication strategy where the polymerase itself dictates the identity of the incoming nucleotide as well as the identity of the templating base we show here that many of the key elements of this highly unusual strategy are conserved between yeast and human rev  including the eviction of template g from the dna helix and the pairing of incoming deoxycytidine  triphosphate with a surrogate arginine residue we also show that the catalytic core of human rev is uniquely augmented by two large inserts i and i  wherein i extends gt    away from the active site and may serve as a platform for protein  protein interactions specific for rev s role in translesion dna synthesis in human cells and i acts as a  flap  on the hydrophobic pocket accommodating template g we suggest that these novel structural features are important for providing human rev greater latitude in promoting efficient and error free translesion dna synthesis through the diverse array of bulky and potentially carcinogenic n  deoxyguanosine dna adducts in human cells
