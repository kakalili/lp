co evolutionary analysis of domains in interacting proteins reveals insights into domain  domain interactions mediating protein  protein interactions
recent advances in functional genomics have helped generate large scale high throughput protein interaction data such networks though extremely valuable towards molecular level understanding of cells do not provide any direct information about the regions domains in the proteins that mediate the interaction here we performed co evolutionary analysis of domains in interacting proteins in order to understand the degree of co evolution of interacting and non interacting domains using a combination of sequence and structural analysis we analyzed protein  protein interactions in f atpase sec p sec p dna directed rna polymerase and nuclear pore complexes and found that interacting domain pair s for a given interaction exhibits higher level of co evolution than the non interacting domain pairs motivated by this finding we developed a computational method to test the generality of the observed trend and to predict large scale domain  domain interactions given a protein  protein interaction the proposed method predicts the domain pair s that is most likely to mediate the protein interaction we applied this method on the yeast interactome to predict domain  domain interactions and used known domain  domain interactions found in pdb crystal structures to validate our predictions our results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is statistically significant comparison of our prediction results with those from two other methods reveals that only a fraction of predictions are shared by all the three methods indicating that the proposed method can detect known interactions missed by other methods we believe that the proposed method can be used with other methods to help identify previously unrecognized domain  domain interactions on a genome scale and could potentially help reduce the search space for identifying interaction sites
