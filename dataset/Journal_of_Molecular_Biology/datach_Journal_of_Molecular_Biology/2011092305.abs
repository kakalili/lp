slow formation of stable complexes during coincubation of minimal rrna and ribosomal protein s
ribosomal protein s binds and stabilizes a five helix junction or five way junction  wj in the   domain of  s ribosomal rna rrna and is one of two proteins responsible for nucleating  s ribosome assembly upon binding both protein s and wj reorganize their structures we show that labile s complexes rearrange into stable complexes within a few minutes at    c with longer coincubation leading to an increased population of stable complexes in contrast prefolding the rrna has a smaller effect on stable s binding experiments with minimal rrna fragments show that this structural change depends only on  s residues within the s binding site shape selective   hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension chemical probing experiments showed that s strongly stabilizes wj and the helix h   pseudoknot which become tightly folded within the first minute of s binding however a kink in h  that makes specific contacts with the s n terminal extension as well as a right angle motif between h  h  and h  requires a minute or more to become fully structured surprisingly s structurally reorganizes the   loop and increases the flexibility of h  which is proposed to undergo a conformational switch during  s assembly these elements of the s binding site may require other  s proteins to reach a stable conformation
