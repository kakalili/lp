recognition and cooperation between the atp dependent rna helicase rhlb and ribonuclease rnase e
the escherichia coli protein rhlb is an atp dependent motor that unfolds structured rna for destruction by partner ribonucleases in e coli and probably many other related  proteobacteria rhlb associates with the essential endoribonuclease rnase e as part of the multi enzyme rna degradosome assembly the interaction with rnase e boosts rhlb s atpase activity by an order of magnitude here we examine the origins and implications of this effect the location of the interaction sites on both rnase e and rhlb are refined and analysed using limited protease digestion domain cross linking and homology modelling these data indicate that rhlb s carboxy terminal reca like domain engages a segment of rnase e that is no greater than  residues the interaction between rhlb and rnase e has two important consequences first the interaction itself stimulates the unwinding and atpase activities of rhlb second rhlb gains proximity to two rna binding sites on rnase e with which it cooperates to unwind rna our homology model identifies a pattern of residues in rhlb that may be key for recognition of rnase e and which may communicate the activating effects our data also suggest that the association with rnase e may partially repress the rna binding activity of rhlb this repression may in fact permit the interplay of the helicase and adjacent rna binding segments as part of a process that steers substrates to either processing or destruction depending on context within the rna degradosome assembly
