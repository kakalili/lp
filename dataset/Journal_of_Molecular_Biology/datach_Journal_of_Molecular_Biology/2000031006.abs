the high resolution crystal structure of green abalone sperm lysin implications for species specific binding of the egg receptor edited by r huber
abalone sperm lysin is a  kda acrosomal protein used by sperm to create a hole in the egg vitelline envelope lysins from seven california abalone exhibit species specificity in binding to their egg receptor and range in sequence identity from   to    the crystal structure of the sperm lysin dimer from haliotis fulgens green abalone has been determined to     by multiple isomorphous replacement comparisons with the structure of the lysin dimer from haliotis rufescens red abalone reveal a similar overall fold and conservation of features contributing to lysin  s amphipathic character the two structures do however exhibit differences in surface residues and electrostatics a large clustering of non conserved surface residues around the waist and clefts of the dimer and differences in charged residues around these regions indicate areas of the molecule which may be involved in species specific egg recognition
