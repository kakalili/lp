crystal structure and functional characterization of a d stereospecific amino acid amidase from ochrobactrum anthropi sv  a new member of the penicillin recognizing proteins
d amino acid amidase daa from ochrobactrum anthropi sv  which catalyzes the stereospecific hydrolysis of d amino acid amides to yield the d amino acid and ammonia has attracted increasing attention as a catalyst for the stereospecific production of d amino acids in order to clarify the structure function relationships of daa the crystal structures of native daa and of the d phenylalanine daa complex were determined at   and at     resolution respectively both crystals contain six subunits a  f in the asymmetric unit the fold of daa is similar to that of the penicillin recognizing proteins especially d alanyl d alanine carboxypeptidase from streptomyces r  and class c  lactamase from entereobacter cloacae strain gc  the catalytic residues of daa and the nucleophilic water molecule for deacylation were assigned based on these structures daa has a flexible  loop similar to class c  lactamase daa forms a pseudo acyl enzyme intermediate between ser  o  and the carbonyl moiety of d phenylalanine in subunits a b c d and e but not in subunit f the difference between subunit f and the other subunits a b c d and e might be attributed to the order disorder structure of the  loop the structure of this loop cannot assigned in subunit f deacylation of subunit f may be facilitated by the relative movement of deprotonated his  toward tyr   his  n  extracts the proton from tyr  o  then tyr  o  attacks a nucleophilic water molecule as a general base gln  on the  loop is essential for forming a network of water molecules that contains the nucleophilic water needed for deacylation although peptidase activity is found in almost all penicillin recognizing proteins daa lacks peptidase activity the lack of transpeptidase and carboxypeptidase activities may be attributed to steric hindrance of the substrate binding pocket by a loop comprised of residues      and the  loop
