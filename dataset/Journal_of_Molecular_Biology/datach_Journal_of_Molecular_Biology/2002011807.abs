duration and fitness dependence of quasispecies memory edited by j karn
the duration and fitness dependence of memory in viral quasispecies evolving in cell culture have been investigated using two genetic markers of foot and mouth disease virus fmdv  in lineages of antigenic variant fmdv red which reverted to fmdv rgd memory fmdv red genomes were detected after  infectious cycles and memory level was fitness dependent in growth competition experiments between a reference fmdv rgd and two different fmdv red populations a   fold higher fitness of the initial fmdv red population resulted in  to   fold higher memory level in lineages of low fitness clones containing an elongated internal polyadenylate tract revertants lacking excess adenylate residues became dominant by passage   however genomes including a larger number of adenylate residues were detected as memory genomes after at least   infectious cycles thus quasispecies memory can be durable and is fitness dependent as predicted from the growth competition of two mutant forms of a genome an understanding of factors influencing quasispecies memory levels and duration may have implications for the extended diagnosis of viruses based on the quantification of minority genomes
