septin  exhibits polymorphic binding to f actin and inhibits myosin and cofilin activity
septins are a highly conserved family of proteins in eukaryotes that is recognized as a novel component of the cytoskeleton septin  sept  interacts directly with actin filaments and functions as an actin stress fiber cross linking protein that promotes the maturation of nascent focal adhesions and cell migration however the molecular details of how sept interacts with f actin remain unknown here we use electron microscopy and image analysis to show that sept binds to f actin in a highly polymorphic fashion we demonstrate that the basic domain b domain of the n terminal tail of sept is responsible for actin cross linking while the gtp binding domain g domain does not bundle f actin we show that the b domain of sept binds to three sites on f actin and the two of these sites overlap with the binding regions of myosin and cofilin sept inhibits actin dependent atpase activity of myosin and competes with the weakly bound state of myosin for binding to f actin at the same time sept significantly reduces the extent of f actin depolymerization by cofilin taken together these data suggest that sept protects actin filaments from depolymerization by cofilin and myosin and indicate a mechanism by which sept could maintain the integrity of growing and contracting actin filaments
