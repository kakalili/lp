the reactive center loop of active pai  is folded close to the protein core and can be partially inserted
plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai  is the main inhibitor of plasminogen activators and plays an important role in many pathophysiological processes like other members of the serpin family pai  has a reactive center consisting of a mobile loop rcl with p and p   residues acting as a  bait  for cognate protease in contrast to the other serpins pai  loses activity by spontaneous conversion to an inactive latent form this involves full insertion of the rcl into  sheet a to search for molecular determinants that could be responsible for conversion of pai  to the latent form we studied the conformation of the rcl in active pai  in solution intramolecular distance measurements by donor  donor energy migration and probe quenching methods reveal that the rcl is located much closer to the core of pai  than has been suggested by the recently resolved x ray structures of stable pai  mutants disulfide bonds can be formed in double cysteine mutants with substitutions at positions p  or p  of the rcl and neighboring residues in  sheet a this suggests that the rcl may be preinserted up to residue p  in active pai  and possibly even to residue p  we propose that the close proximity of the rcl to the protein core and the ability of the loop to preinsert into  sheet a is a possible reason for pai  being able to convert spontaneously to its latent form
