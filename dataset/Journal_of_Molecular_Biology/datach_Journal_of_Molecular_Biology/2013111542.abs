crystallographic analysis of the reaction cycle of      cyclic nucleotide   phosphodiesterase a unique member of the h phosphoesterase family
h phosphoesterases catalyze reactions on nucleotide substrates and contain two conserved histidine residues in the active site very limited information is currently available on the details of the active site and substrate product binding during the catalytic cycle of these enzymes we performed a comprehensive x ray crystallographic study of mouse      cyclic nucleotide   phosphodiesterase cnpase  a membrane associated enzyme present at high levels in the tetrapod myelin sheath we determined crystal structures of the cnpase phosphodiesterase domain complexed with substrate product and phosphorothioate analogues the data provide detailed information on the cnpase reaction mechanism including substrate binding mode and coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule linked to the reaction an open close motion of the      loop is observed the role of the n terminus of helix    unique for cnpase in the h family  during the reaction indicates that h phosphoesterases differ in their respective reaction mechanisms despite the conserved catalytic residues furthermore based on small angle x ray scattering we present a model for the full length enzyme indicating that the two domains of cnpase form an elongated molecule finally based on our structural data and a comprehensive bioinformatics study we discuss the conservation of cnpase in various organisms
