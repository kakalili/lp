crystal structures of the ul mutant ribosome illustration of the importance of ribosomal proteins for translation efficiency
the ribosome has been described as a ribozyme in which ribosomal rna is responsible for peptidyl transferase reaction catalysis the w  c mutation of the universally conserved ribosomal protein ul has diverse effects on ribosome function e g  increased affinities for transfer rnas decreased rates of peptidyl transfer  and cells harboring this mutation are resistant to peptidyl transferase inhibitors e g  anisomycin  these observations beg the question of how a single amino acid mutation may have such wide ranging consequences here we report the structure of the vacant yeast ul w  c mutant ribosome by x ray crystallography showing a disruption of the a site side of the peptidyl transferase center ptc  an additional x ray crystallographic structure of the anisomycin containing mutant ribosome shows that high concentrations of this inhibitor restore a  wt like  configuration to this region of the ptc providing insight into the resistance mechanism of the mutant globally our data demonstrate that ribosomal protein ul is structurally essential to ensure an optimal and catalytically efficient organization of the ptc highlighting the importance of proteins in the rna centered ribosome
