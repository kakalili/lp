resolution of holliday junction substrates by human topoisomerase i
prompted by the close relationship between tyrosine recombinases and type ib topoisomerases we have investigated the ability of human topoisomerase i to resolve the typical intermediate of recombinase catalysis the holliday junction we demonstrate that human topoisomerase i catalyzes unidirectional resolution of a synthetic holliday junction substrate containing two preferred cleavage sites surrounded by dna sequences supporting branch migration deleting part of the n terminal domain amino acid residues     did not affect topoisomerase i resolution activity whereas a topoisomerase i variant lacking both the n terminal domain and amino acid residues      of the linker domain was unable to resolve the holliday junction substrate the inability of the double deleted variant to mediate resolution correlated with the inability of this enzyme to introduce concomitant cleavage at the two preferred cleavage sites in a single holliday junction substrate which is a prerequisite for resolution as determined by the gel electrophoretic mobility of native enzyme or enzyme crosslinked by disulfide bridging the double deleted mutant existed almost entirely in a dimeric form the impairment of this enzyme in performing double cleavages on the holliday junction substrate may be explained by only one cleavage competent active site being formed at a time within the dimer the assembly of only one active site within dimers is a well known characteristic of the tyrosine recombinases hence the obtained results may suggest a recombinase like active site assembly of the double deleted topoisomerase i variant taken together the presented results consolidate the relationship between type ib topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases
