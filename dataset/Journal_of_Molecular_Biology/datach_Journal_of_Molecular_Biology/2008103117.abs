aromatic cross strand ladders control the structure and stability of  rich peptide self assembly mimics
though  rich self assemblies comprise a major structural class of polypeptides a detailed understanding of the determinants of their structure and stability is lacking in particular the roles of repetitive stretches of side chains running the long axis of these  sheets termed  cross strand ladders   remain poorly characterized due to the inherently insoluble and heterogeneous nature of self assemblies to overcome these experimental challenges we have established a complementary experimental system termed  peptide self assembly mimics   psams  the psams capture a defined number of self assembly like peptide repeats within a soluble  rich protein making structural and energetic studies possible in this work we investigated the role of cross strand ladders containing aromatic residues which are prominent in self assembling peptides a combination of solution data and high resolution crystal structures revealed that a single cross strand ladder consisting solely of tyr significantly stabilized rigidified and flattened the psam  sheet these characteristics would stabilize each  sheet layer of a self assembly and direct sheet conformations compatible with lamination our results therefore provide a rationale for the abundance of aromatic amino acids in fibril forming peptides and establish important roles of cross strand tyr ladders in the structure and stability of  rich peptide self assemblies
