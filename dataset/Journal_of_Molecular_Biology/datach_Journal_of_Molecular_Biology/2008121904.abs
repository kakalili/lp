fidelity of dna sequence recognition by the sfii restriction endonuclease is determined by communications between its two dna binding sites
the sfii restriction endonuclease is a tetramer in which two subunits form a dimeric unit that contains one dna binding cleft and the other two subunits contain a second cleft on the opposite side of the protein full activity requires both clefts to be filled with its recognition sequence sfii has low activity when bound to one site the ability of sfii to cleave non cognate sites one base pair different from the true site was initially tested on substrates that lacked specific sites but which contained either one or multiple non cognate sites no cleavage of the dna with one non cognate site was detected while a small fraction of the dna with multiple sites was nicked the alternative sequences were however cleaved in both strands albeit at low levels when the dna also carried either a recognition site for sfii or the termini generated by sfii further tests employed a mutant of sfii altered at the dimer interface which was known to be more active than wild type sfii when bound to a single site this mutant similarly failed to cleave dna with one non cognate site but cleaved the substrates with multiple non cognate sites more readily than did the native enzyme to cleave additional sites sfii thus needs to interact concurrently with either two non cognate sites or one non cognate and one cognate site or the termini thereof  yet this arrangement is still restrained from cleaving the alternative site unless the communication pathway between the two dna binding clefts is disrupted
