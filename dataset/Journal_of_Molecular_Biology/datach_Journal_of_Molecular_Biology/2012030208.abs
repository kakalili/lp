human trnalys uuu is pre structured by natural modifications for cognate and wobble codon binding through keto  enol tautomerism
human trnalys uuu htrnalys uuu decodes the lysine codons aaa and aag during translation and also plays a crucial role as the primer for hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcription the posttranscriptional modifications  methoxycarbonylmethyl  thiouridine mcm s u    methylthio n threonylcarbamoyladenosine ms t a   and pseudouridine    in the trna s anticodon domain are critical for ribosomal binding and hiv  reverse transcription to understand the importance of modified nucleoside contributions we determined the structure and function of this trna s anticodon stem and loop asl domain with these modifications at positions     and   respectively hasllys uuu mcm s u  ms t a     ribosome binding assays in vitro revealed that the hasllys uuu mcm s u  ms t a    bound aaa and aag codons whereas binding of the unmodified asllys uuu was barely detectable the uv hyperchromicity the circular dichroism and the structural analyses indicated that   enhanced the thermodynamic stability of the asl through base stacking while ms t a  restrained the anticodon to adopt an open loop conformation that is required for ribosomal binding the nmr restrained molecular dynamics derived solution structure revealed that the modifications provided an open ordered loop for codon binding the crystal structures of the hasllys uuu mcm s u  ms t a    bound to the  s ribosomal subunit with each codon in the a site showed that the modified nucleotides mcm s u  and ms t a  participate in the stability of the anticodon  codon interaction importantly the mcm s u  g wobble base pair is in the watson  crick geometry requiring unusual hydrogen bonding to g in which mcm s u  must shift from the keto to the enol form the results unambiguously demonstrate that modifications pre structure the anticodon as a key prerequisite for efficient and accurate recognition of cognate and wobble codons
