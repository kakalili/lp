proton translocation by bacteriorhodopsin in the absence of substantial conformational changes
unlike wild type bacteriorhodopsin br  the br triple mutant d g f  c f  l has been shown to undergo only minor structural rearrangements during its photocycle nonetheless the mutant is capable of transporting protons at a rate of      h br per minute under light saturating conditions light adaptation of the triple mutant s retinal proceeds in a ph dependent manner up to a maximum of   all trans these two findings imply that the transport activity of the triple mutant comprises   of the wild type activity time resolved spectroscopy reveals that the identity and sequence of intermediates in the photocycle of the triple mutant in the all trans configuration correspond to that of wild type br the only differences relate to a slower rise and decay of the m and o intermediates and a significant spectral contribution from a  cis component no indication for accumulation of the n intermediate is found under a variety of conditions that normally favor the formation of this species in wild type br the fourer transform infrared ftir spectrum of the m intermediate in the triple mutant resembles that of wild type minor changes in the amide i region during the photocycle suggest that only small movements of the protein backbone occur electron microscopy reveals large differences in conformation between the unilluminated state of the mutant protein and wild type but no light induced changes in time resolved measurements evidently proton transport by the triple mutant does not require the major conformational rearrangements that occur on the same time scale with wild type thus we conclude that large conformational changes observed in the photocycle of the wild type and many br mutants are not a prerequisite for the change in accessibility of the schiff base nitrogen atom that must occur during vectorial catalysis to allow proton transport
