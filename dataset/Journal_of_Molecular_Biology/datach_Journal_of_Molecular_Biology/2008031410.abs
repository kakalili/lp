thermodynamic fidelity of the mammalian cytochrome p   b active site in binding substrates and inhibitors
structural plasticity of mammalian cytochromes p   cyp has recently been explored in our laboratory and elsewhere to understand the ligand binding promiscuity cyp b exhibits very different conformations and thermodynamic signatures in binding the small inhibitor   chlorophenyl imidazole  cpi versus the large bifonazole using four key active site mutants f  a t  a i  a and v  l that are involved in binding one or both inhibitors we dissected the thermodynamic basis for the ability of cyp b to bind substrates and inhibitors of different sizes and chemistry in all cases   binding stoichiometry was observed the inhibitors  cpi    chlorophenyl imidazole and    benzyloxy ethyl imidazole bind to the mutants with a free energy difference   g of    to  kcal mol compared with the wild type but with a large entropy  enthalpy compensation of up to   kcal mol the substrate testosterone binds to all four mutants with a   g of     kcal mol but with as much as   kcal mol of entropy  enthalpy compensation in contrast benzphetamine binding to v  l and f  a is accompanied by a   g of    and  kcal mol respectively f  a i  a and v  l exhibit very different benzphetamine metabolite profiles indicating the different substrate binding orientations in the active site of each mutant overall the findings indicate that malleability of the active site allows mammalian p  s to exhibit a high degree of thermodynamic fidelity in ligand binding
