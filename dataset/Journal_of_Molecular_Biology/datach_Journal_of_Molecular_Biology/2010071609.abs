the mechanism of hiv  tat directed nucleic acid annealing supports its role in reverse transcription
the main function of the hiv  trans activator of transcription tat protein is to promote the transcription of the proviral dna by the host rna polymerase which leads to the synthesis of large quantities of the full length viral rna tat is also thought to be involved in the reverse transcription rtion reaction by a still unknown mechanism the recently reported nucleic acid annealing activity of tat might explain at least in part its role in rtion to further investigate this possibility we carried out a fluorescence study on the mechanism by which the full length tat protein tat    and the basic peptide     direct the annealing of complementary viral dna sequences representing the hiv  transactivation response element tar named dtar and ctar essential for the early steps of rtion though both tat    and the tat    peptide were unable to melt the lower half of the ctar stem they strongly promoted ctar dtar annealing through non specific attraction between the peptide bound oligonucleotides using ctar and dtar mutants this tat promoted annealing was found to be nucleated through the thermally frayed      termini resulting in an intermediate with  intermolecular base pairs which then converts into the final extended duplex moreover we found that tat    was as efficient as the nucleocapsid protein ncp  a major nucleic acid chaperone of hiv  in promoting ctar dtar annealing and could act cooperatively with ncp during the annealing reaction taken together our data are consistent with a role of tat in the stimulation of the obligatory strand transfers during viral dna synthesis by reverse transcriptase
