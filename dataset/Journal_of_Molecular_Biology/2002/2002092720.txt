The serendipitous observation of a C–H⋯O hydrogen bond mediated polypeptide chain reversal in synthetic peptide helices has led to a search for the occurrence of a similar motif in protein structures. From a dataset of 634 proteins, 1304 helices terminating in a Schellman motif have been examined. The C–H⋯O interaction between the T−4 CαH and T+1 CO group (C⋯O≤3.5Å) becomes possible only when the T+1 residue adopts an extended β conformation (T is defined as the helix terminating residue adopting an αL conformation). In all, 111 examples of this chain reversal motif have been identified and the compositional and conformational preferences at positions T−4, T, and T+1 determined. A marked preference for residues like Ser, Glu and Gln is observed at T−4 position with the motif being further stabilized by the formation of a side-chain–backbone O⋯H–N hydrogen bond involving the side-chain of residue T−4 and the N–H group of residue T+3. In as many as 57 examples, the segment following the helix was extended with three to four successive residues in β conformation. In a majority of these cases, the succeeding β strand lies approximately antiparallel with the helix, suggesting that the backbone C–H⋯O interactions may provide a means of registering helices and strands in an antiparallel orientation. Two examples were identified in which extended registry was detected with two sets of C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds between (T−4) CαH⋯CO (T+1) and (T−8) CαH⋯CO (T+3).
