muf leucine rich repeat containing   lrrc   a substrate of rhobtb dependent cullin  ubiquitin ligase complexes is a predominantly nuclear dimeric protein
rhobtb btb stands for broad  complex tramtrack bric  brac proteins are tumor suppressors involved in the formation of cullin  cul  dependent ubiquitin ligase complexes however no substrates of rhobtb  cul ubiquitin ligase complexes have been identified we identified muf  lrrc  leucine  rich repeat containing   as a potential interaction partner of rhobtb in a two  hybrid screening on a mouse brain cdna library muf is a largely uncharacterized protein containing a leucine rich repeat and interestingly a bc box that serves as a linker in multicomponent cullin  cul  based ubiquitin ligases we confirmed the interaction of muf with all three mammalian rhobtb proteins using immunoprecipitation we characterized muf in terms of expression profile and subcellular localization the latter also with respect to rhobtb proteins we found out that muf is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that upon coexpression with rhobtb partially retains in the cytoplasm where both proteins colocalize we also show that muf is able to dimerize similarly to other leucine  rich repeat  containing proteins to explore the significance of muf rhobtb interaction within cul  ligase complexes and the mechanism of muf degradation we performed a protein stability assay and found that muf is degraded in the proteasome in a cul  independent manner by rhobtb  cul ubiquitin ligase complex finally we explored a possible heterodimerization of cul and cul and indeed discovered that these two cullins are capable of forming heterodimers thus we have identified muf as the first substrate for rhobtb  cul ubiquitin ligase complexes identification of substrates of these complexes will result in better understanding of the tumor suppressor function of rhobtb
