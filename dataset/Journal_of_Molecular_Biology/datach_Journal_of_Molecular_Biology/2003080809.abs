crystal structures of methionine adenosyltransferase complexed with substrates and products reveal the methionine atp recognition and give insights into the catalytic mechanism
methionine adenosyltransferases mats are a family of enzymes in charge of synthesising s adenosylmethionine sam  the most important methyl donor present in living organisms these enzymes use methionine and atp as reaction substrates which react in a sn fashion where the sulphur atom from methionine attacks c   from atp while triphosphate chain is cleaved a mat liver specific isoenzyme has been detected which exists in two distinct oligomeric forms a dimer mat iii and a tetramer mat i  our previously reported crystal structure of mat i complexed with an inhibitor led to the identification of the methionine binding site we present here the results obtained from the complex of mat i with a competitive inhibitor of methionine  s s amino   epoxypentanoic acid aep  which presents the same features at the methionine binding site reported before we have also analysed several complexes of this enzyme with methionine and atp and analogues of them in order to characterise the interaction that is produced between both substrates the crystal structures of the complexes reveal how the substrates recognise each other at the active site of the enzyme and suggest a putative binding site for the product sam the residues involved in the interactions of substrates and products with mat have been identified and the results agree with all the previous data concerning mutagenesis experiments and crystallographic work moreover all the information provided from the analysis of the complexes has allowed us to postulate a catalytic mechanism for this family of enzymes in particular we propose a key role for lys  in the correct positioning of the substrates and asp    in stabilising the sulphonium group formed in the product sam
