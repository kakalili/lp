crystallographic snapshot of a productive glycosylasparaginase  substrate complex
glycosylasparaginase ga plays an important role in asparagine linked glycoprotein degradation a deficiency in the activity of human ga leads to a lysosomal storage disease named aspartylglycosaminuria ga belongs to a superfamily of n terminal nucleophile hydrolases that autoproteolytically generate their mature enzymes from inactive single chain protein precursors the side chain of the newly exposed n terminal residue then acts as a nucleophile during substrate hydrolysis by taking advantage of mutant enzyme of flavobacterium meningosepticum ga with reduced enzymatic activity we have obtained a crystallographic snapshot of a productive complex with its substrate nacglc asn  at     resolution this complex structure provided us an excellent model for the michaelis complex to examine the specific contacts critical for substrate binding and catalysis substrate binding induces a conformational change near the active site of ga to initiate catalysis the side chain of the n terminal thr  is polarized by the free  amino group on the same residue mediated by the side chain hydroxyl group of thr   cleavage of the amide bond is then accomplished by a nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon of the amide linkage in the substrate leading to the formation of an acyl enzyme intermediate through a negatively charged tetrahedral transition state
