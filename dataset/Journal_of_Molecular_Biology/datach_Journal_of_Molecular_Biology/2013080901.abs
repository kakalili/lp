structural basis for the recognition of ubc  by the shigella flexneri effector ospi
ubc  is a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that plays a key role in the nuclear factor  b signal transduction pathway in human diseases the shigella flexneri effector ospi affects inflammatory responses by catalyzing the deamidation of a specific glutamine residue at position   in ubc  during infection this modification prevents the activation of the tnf tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor  leading to modulation of the diacylglycerol  cbm card  bcl   malt  complex  tnf receptor associated factor   nuclear factor  b signaling pathway to elucidate the structural basis of ospi function we determined the crystal structures of the catalytically inert ospi c a mutant and its complex with ubc  at resolutions of   and     respectively the structure of the ospi  ubc  complex revealed that the interacting surfaces between ospi and ubc  are a hydrophobic surface and a complementary charged surface furthermore we predict that the complementary charged surface of ospi plays a key role in substrate specificity determination
