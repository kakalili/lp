the importance of somatic mutations in the v  gene a in human monoclonal anti dna antibodies edited by i b holland
a is the most commonly rearranged gene in the human v  locus it has been postulated that certain immunoglobulin genes including a  are rearranged preferentially because their germline sequences encode structures capable of binding to a range of antigens somatic mutation could then increase the specificity and affinity of binding to a particular antigen we studied the properties of five igg molecules in which the same heavy chain was paired with different light chains derived from a  the pattern of somatic mutations in a was shown to be crucial in conferring the ability to bind dna but two different patterns of mutation each conferred this ability computer generated models of the three dimensional structures of these antibodies illustrate the ability of a to form a dna binding site in different ways somatic mutations at the periphery of the dna binding site were particularly important in two different light chains mutations to arginine at different sites in the complementarity determining regions cdrs enhanced binding to dna in a third light chain however mutation to arginine at a different site blocked binding to dna
