structural organisation of the head to tail interface of a bacterial virus edited by t richmond
in tailed icosahedral bacteriophages the connection between the  fold symmetric environment of the portal vertex in the capsid and the  fold symmetric phage tail is formed by a complex interface structure the current study provides the detailed analysis of the assembly and structural organisation of such an interface within a phage having a long tail the region of the interface assembled as part of the viral capsid connector was purified from dna filled capsids of the bacillus subtilis bacteriophage spp  it is composed of oligomers of gp  the spp portal protein of gp  and of gp  the spp connector structure is formed by a mushroom like portal protein whose cap faces the interior of the viral capsid in intact virions an annular structure below the stem of the mushroom and a second narrower annulus that is in direct contact with the helical tail extremity the layered arrangement correlates to the stacking of gp  gp  and gp  on top of the tail the gp  ring is exposed to the virion outside during spp morphogenesis gp participates in the procapsid assembly reaction an early step in the assembly pathway while gp  and gp  bind to the capsid portal vertex after viral chromosome encapsidation gp  is processed during or after tail attachment to the connector region the portal protein gp has  fold cyclical symmetry in the connector structure whereas assembly na  ve gp exhibits  fold symmetry we propose that it is the interaction of gp with other viral morphogenetic proteins that drives its assembly into the  mer state
