the paradoxical behavior of a highly structured misfolded intermediate in rna folding
like many structured rnas the tetrahymena group i ribozyme is prone to misfolding here we probe a long lived misfolded species referred to as m and uncover paradoxical aspects of its structure and folding previous work indicated that a non native local secondary structure termed alt p  led to formation of m during folding in vitro surprisingly hydroxyl radical footprinting fluorescence measurements with site specifically incorporated  aminopurine and functional assays indicate that the native p  not alt p  is present in the m state the paradoxical behavior of alt p presumably arises because alt p biases folding toward m but after commitment to this folding pathway and before formation of m alt p is replaced by p  further structural and functional probes demonstrate that the misfolded ribozyme contains extensive native structure with only local differences between the two states and the misfolded structure even possesses partial catalytic activity despite the similarity of these structures re folding of m to the native state is very slow and is strongly accelerated by urea na  and increased temperature and strongly impeded by mg  and the presence of native peripheral contacts the paradoxical observations of extensive native structure within the misfolded species but slow conversion of this species to the native state are readily reconciled by a model in which the misfolded state is a topological isomer of the native state and computational results support the feasibility of this model we speculate that the complex topology of rna secondary structures and the inherent rigidity of rna helices render kinetic traps due to topological isomers considerably more common for rna than for proteins
