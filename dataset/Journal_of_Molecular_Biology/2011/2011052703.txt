X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ensures dosage compensation in mammals. Random XCI is a process where a single X chromosome is silenced in each cell of the epiblast of mouse female embryos. Operating at the level of an entire chromosome, XCI is a major paradigm for epigenetic processes. Here we review the most recent discoveries concerning the role of long noncoding RNAs, pluripotency factors, and chromosome structure in random XCI.
