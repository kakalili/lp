cell invasion of highly metastatic mtln cancer cells is dependent on phospholipase d  pld  and janus kinase  jak
mtln cells are highly invasive breast adenoacarcinoma cells the relative level of the epidermal growth factor stimulated invasion of this cell line is greater than two other breast cancer cell lines mda mb   and mcf  and one non small cell lung cancer cell line h    we have determined that the mechanism of cancer cell invasion involves the presence of an enzymatically active phospholipase d pld  with the pld isoform being more relevant than pld  pld silencing abrogated invasion whereas ectopic expression of pld augmented cell invasion in all four cell lines with an efficacy mtln  mda mb   gt h   mcf  that correlated well with their abilities to invade matrigel in vitro we also report that pld is under the control of janus kinase  jak  with the kinase phosphorylating pld at the y  residue thus enabling its activation y  is located downstream of a ph domain and upstream of the catalytic hkd  domain of pld  jak knockdown abrogated lipase activity and epidermal growth factor stimulated cell invasion directly for the purposes of activating pld for cell invasion jak operates via an alternative pathway that is independent of stat at least in mtln cells we also consistently found that jak and pld pathways are utilized at the maximum efficiency phosphorylation and activity in highly invasive mtln cells versus a relatively low utilization in the less invasive mcf  cell line in summary a high level of cell invasiveness of cancer cells can be explained for the first time by combined high jak pld phosphorylation and activity involving pld s y  residue which might constitute a novel target to inhibit cancer cell invasion
