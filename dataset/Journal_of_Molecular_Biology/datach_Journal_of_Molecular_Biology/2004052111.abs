unique structural characteristics of peptide deformylase from pathogenic bacterium leptospira interrogans
peptide deformylase pdf  which is essential for normal growth of bacteria but not for higher organisms is explored as an attractive target for developing novel antibiotics here we present the crystal structure of leptospira interrogans pdf lipdf at    resolution to our knowledge this is the first crystal structure of pdf associating in a stable dimer the key loop named the cd loop amino acid residues     near the active site pocket adopts  closed  or  open  conformations in the two monomers forming the dimer in the closed subunit the cd loop and residue arg  block the entry of the substrate binding pocket while the active site pocket of the open subunit is occupied by the c terminal tail from the neighbouring molecule moreover a formate group as one product of deformylisation is observed bound with the active site zinc ion lipdf displays significant structural differences in the c terminal region compared to both type i and type ii pdfs suggesting a new family of pdfs
