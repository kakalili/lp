structure of a longitudinal actin dimer assembled by tandem w domains implications for actin filament nucleation
actin filament nucleators initiate polymerization in cells in a regulated manner a common architecture among these molecules consists of tandem wasp homology  domains w domains that recruit three to four actin subunits to form a polymerization nucleus we describe a low resolution crystal structure of an actin dimer assembled by tandem w domains where the first w domain is cross linked to cys  of the actin subunit bound to it whereas the last w domain is followed by the c terminal pointed end capping helix of thymosin   while the arrangement of actin subunits in the dimer resembles that of a long pitch helix of the actin filament important differences are observed these differences result from steric hindrance of the w domain with intersubunit contacts in the actin filament we also determined the structure of the first w domain of vibrio parahaemolyticus vopl cross linked to actin cys  and show it to be nearly identical with non cross linked w actin structures this result validates the use of cross linking as a tool for the study of actin nucleation complexes whose natural tendency to polymerize interferes with most structural methods combined with a biochemical analysis of nucleation the structures may explain why nucleators based on tandem w domains with short inter w linkers have relatively weak activity cannot stay bound to filaments after nucleation and are unlikely to influence filament elongation the findings may also explain why nucleation promoting factors of the arp  complex which are related to tandem w domain nucleators are ejected from branch junctions after nucleation we finally show that the simple addition of the c terminal pointed end capping helix of thymosin   to tandem w domains can change their activity from actin filament nucleation to monomer sequestration
