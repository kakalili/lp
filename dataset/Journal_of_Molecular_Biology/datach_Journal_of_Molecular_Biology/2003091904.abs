essential role of histidine  in elongation factor tu for the chemical step of gtp hydrolysis on the ribosome
elongation factor tu ef tu is a gtp binding protein that delivers aminoacyl trna to the a site of the ribosome during protein synthesis the mechanism of gtp hydrolysis in ef tu on the ribosome is poorly understood it is known that mutations of a conserved histidine residue in the switch ii region of the factor his  in escherichia coli ef tu impair gtp hydrolysis however the partial reaction which is directly affected by mutations of his  was not identified and the effect on gtp hydrolysis was not quantified here we show that the replacement of his  with ala reduces the rate constant of gtp hydrolysis more than   fold whereas the preceding steps of ternary complex binding to the ribosome codon recognition and most importantly the gtpase activation step are affected only slightly these results show that his  plays a key role in the chemical step of gtp hydrolysis rate constants of gtp hydrolysis by wild type ef tu measured using the slowly hydrolyzable gtp analog gtp s showed no dependence on ph indicating that his  does not act as a general base we propose that the catalytic role of his  is to stabilize the transition state of gtp hydrolysis by hydrogen bonding to the attacking water molecule or possibly the  phosphate group of gtp
