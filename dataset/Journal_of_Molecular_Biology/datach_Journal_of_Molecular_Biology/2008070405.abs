molecular structure and metal binding properties of the periplasmic copk protein expressed in cupriavidus metallidurans ch  during copper challenge
the copk gene is localized on the pmol  plasmid of cupriavidus metallidurans ch  within the complex cop cluster of genes for which  genes have been identified the expression of the corresponding periplasmic copk protein is strongly upregulated in the presence of copper leading to a high periplasmic accumulation the structure and metal binding properties of copk were investigated by nmr and mass spectrometry the protein is dimeric in the apo state with a dissociation constant in the range of   m estimated from analytical ultracentrifugation mass spectrometry revealed that copk has two high affinity cu i binding sites per monomer with different cu i affinities binding of cu ii was observed but appeared to be non specific the solution structure of apo copk revealed an all  fold formed of two  sheets in perpendicular orientation with an unstructured c terminal tail the dimer interface is formed by the surface of the c terminal  sheet binding of the first cu i ion induces a major structural modification involving dissociation of the dimeric apo protein backbone chemical shifts determined for the cu i bound form confirm the conservation of the n terminal  sheet while the last strand of the c terminal sheet appears in slow conformational exchange we hypothesize that the partial disruption of the c terminal  sheet is related to dimer dissociation nh exchange data acquired on the apo protein are consistent with a lower thermodynamic stability of the c terminal sheet copk contains seven methionine residues five of which appear highly conserved chemical shift data suggest implication of two or three methionines met  met  met  in the first cu i site addition of a second cu i ion further increases protein plasticity comparison of the structural and metal binding properties of copk with other periplasmic copper binding proteins reveals two conserved features within these functionally related proteins the all  fold and the methionine rich cu i binding site
