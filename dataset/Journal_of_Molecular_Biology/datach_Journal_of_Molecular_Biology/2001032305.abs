crystal structure of the stromelysin  mmp   catalytic domain complexed with a phosphinic inhibitor mimicking the transition state edited by r huber
stromelysin  st  is a matrix metalloproteinase mmp   whose proteolytic activity plays an important role in tumorigenicity enhancement in breast cancer st is a bad prognosis marker its expression is associated with a poor clinical outcome this enzyme therefore represents an attractive therapeutic target the topology of matrix metalloproteinases mmps is remarkably well conserved making the design of highly specific inhibitors difficult the major difference between mmps lies in the s   subsite a well defined hydrophobic pocket of variable depth the present crystal structure the first d structure of the st catalytic domain in interaction with a phosphinic inhibitor mimicking a d l peptide clearly demonstrates that its s   pocket corresponds to a tunnel running through the enzyme this open channel is filled by the inhibitor p   group which adopts a constrained conformation to fit this pocket together with two water molecules interacting with the st specific residue gln   these observations provide clues for the design of more specific inhibitors and show how st can accommodate a phosphinic inhibitor mimicking a d l peptide the presence of a water molecule interacting with one oxygen atom of the inhibitor phosphinyl group and the proline residue of the met turn suggests how the intermediate formed during proteolysis may be stabilized furthermore the hydrogen bond distance observed between the methyl of the phosphinic group and the carbonyl group of ala  mimics the interaction between this carbonyl group and the amide group of the cleaved peptidic bond our crystal structure provides a good model to study the mmps mechanism of proteolysis
