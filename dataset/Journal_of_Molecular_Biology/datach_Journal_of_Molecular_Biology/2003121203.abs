comparison of the structure and dna binding properties of the e proteins from an oncogenic and a non oncogenic human papillomavirus
human papillomaviruses hpvs that infect the genital tract can be divided into two groups high risk hpv types such as hpv  and hpv   are associated with cancer low risk hpv types such as hpv  are associated with benign warts in both high risk and low risk hpv types the papillomavirus e protein binds to four sites within the viral long control region lcr and regulates viral gene expression here we present the crystal structure of the minimal dna binding domain dbd from the hpv  e protein we show that the hpv  e dbd is structurally more similar to the hpv  and bovine papillomavirus type  bpv  e proteins than it is to the hpv  e protein using gel retardation assays we show that the hierarchy of e sites within the hpv  and hpv  lcrs are different however despite these differences in structure and site preference both the hpv  and  e dbds recognise an extended version of the consensus e binding site derived from studies of the bpv e protein in both cases the preferred binding site is   aaccgn cggtt   where the additional flanking base pairs are in bold and n represents a four base pair central spacer both of these hpv proteins bind preferentially to e sites that contain an a t rich central spacer we show that the preference for an a t rich central spacer is due at least in part to the need to adopt a dna conformation that facilitates protein contacts with the flanking base pairs
