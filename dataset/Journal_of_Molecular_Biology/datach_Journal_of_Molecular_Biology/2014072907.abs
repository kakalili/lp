specific inhibition of p  vcp atpase and kinetic analysis demonstrate interaction between d and d atpase domains
the p  aaa atpase associated with diverse cellular activities  also called vcp valosin containing protein  is an important therapeutic target for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases p  forms a hexamer composed of two aaa domains d and d  that form two stacked rings and an n terminal domain that binds numerous cofactor proteins the interplay between the three domains in p  is complex and a deeper biochemical understanding is needed in order to design selective p  inhibitors as therapeutic agents it is clear that the d atpase domain hydrolyzes atp in vitro but whether d contributes to atpase activity is controversial here we use walker a and b mutants to demonstrate that d is capable of hydrolyzing atp and show for the first time that nucleotide binding in the d domain increases the catalytic efficiency kcat km of d atp hydrolysis   fold by increasing kcat  fold and decreasing km about  fold we further show that an nd construct lacking d but including the linker between d and d is catalytically active resolving a conflict in the literature applying enzymatic observations to small molecule inhibitors we show that four p  inhibitors dbeq ml   ml   and nms   have differential responses to walker a and b mutations to disease causing ibmpfd mutations and to the presence of the n domain binding cofactor protein p  these differential effects provide the first evidence that p  cofactors and disease mutations can alter p  inhibitor potency and suggest the possibility of developing context dependent inhibitors of p
