l m substitution in the interface of subunit subunit interactions enhances escherichia coli reca protein properties important for its recombinogenic activity edited by j karn
genetic analysis of reca protein chimeras and their ancestors recaec from escherichia coli and recapa pseudomonas aeruginosa had allowed us to place these proteins with respect to their recombinogenic activities in the following order recapa gt recax  gt recax  recaec while recax  differs from recaec in five amino acid residues with two substitutions  s a and i v  at the interface of subunit interactions in the reca polymer recax  and recax  differ only by a single substitution l m present at the interface here we present an analysis of the biochemical properties considered important for the recombinogenic activity of all four reca proteins while recax  was very similar to recaec by all activities analysed recax  differed from recaec in several respects these differences included an increased affinity for double stranded dna a more active displacement of ssb protein from single stranded dna ssdna  a decreased end dependent recax  protein dissociation from a presynaptic complex and a greater accumulation of intermediate products relative to the final product in the strand exchange reaction recapa was more tolerant than recax  only to the end dependent reca protein dissociation in addition recapa was more resistant to temperature and salt concentrations in its ability to form a presynaptic recapa  atp  ssdna filament calculations of conformational energy revealed that the l m substitution in recax  polymer caused an increase in its flexibility this led us to conclude that even a small change in the flexibility of the reca presynaptic complex could profoundly affect its recombinogenic properties
