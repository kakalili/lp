structure based design of a protein immunogen that displays an hiv  gp  neutralizing epitope
antibody z e is a relatively broadly neutralizing anti human immunodeficiency virus type  antibody that recognizes the membrane proximal external region mper of the human immunodeficiency virus type  envelope glycoprotein gp  based on the crystal structure of an mper epitope peptide in complex with z e fab we identified an unrelated protein interleukin il   with a surface exposed region that is structurally homologous in its backbone to the gp  z e epitope by grafting the gp  z e epitope sequence onto the structurally homologous region in il   we engineered a novel protein z  il   that contains the mper epitope sequence for use as a potential immunogen and as a reagent for the detection of z e like antibodies the z  il   protein binds fab z e with a kd of   nm the crystal structure of z  il   in complex with fab z e shows that the epitope region is faithfully replicated in the fab bound scaffold protein however isothermal calorimetry studies indicate that fab binding to z  il   is not a lock and key event leaving open the question of whether conformational changes upon binding occur in the fab in z  il   or in both
