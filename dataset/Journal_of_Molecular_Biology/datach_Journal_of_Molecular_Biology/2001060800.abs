the importance of framework residues h  h and h  in antibody heavy chains experimental evidence for a new structural subclassification of antibody vh domains
the n terminal segment fr h  of the heavy chain vh of antibodies shows significant conformational variability correlating with the nature of the amino acids h  h and h  kabat h  in this study we have established a causal relationship between the local sequence and the structure of this framework region and linked this relationship to important biophysical properties such as affinity folding yield and stability we have generated six mutants of the scfv fragment al  covering some of the most abundant amino acid combinations in positions h  h and h  according to a new consensus nomenclature kabat h  for the al wild type w t  with the sequence q p a and for two of the mutants the x ray structures have been determined the structure of the triple mutant al  e s g shows the fr h backbone conformations predicted for this amino acid combination which is distinctly different from the structure of the w t thus supporting our hypothesis that these residues determine the conformation of this segment the mutant al  e p g represents a residue combination not occurring in natural antibody sequences it shows a completely different unique structure in the first  strand of vh not observed in natural fv fragments and forms a novel type of diabody two vh domains of the mutant associate by swapping the first  strand concentration dependent changes in trp fluorescence indicate that this dimerization also occurs in solution the mutations in amino acids h  h and h  kabat h  influence the dimerization behavior of the scfv and its thermodynamic stability all the observations reported here have practical implications for the cloning of fv fragments with degenerate primers as well as for the design of new antibodies by cdr grafting or synthetic libraries
