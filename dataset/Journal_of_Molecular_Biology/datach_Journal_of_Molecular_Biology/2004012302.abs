gtp dependent recognition of the methionine moiety on initiator trna by translation factor eif
eukaryotic translation initiation factor  eif  is a g protein that functions as a central switch in the initiation of protein synthesis in its gtp bound state it delivers the methionyl initiator trna met trnai to the small ribosomal subunit and releases it upon gtp hydrolysis following the recognition of the initiation codon we have developed a complete thermodynamic framework for the assembly of the saccharomyces cerevisiae eif  gtp met trnai ternary complex and have determined the effect of the conversion of gtp to gdp on eif s affinity for met trnai in solution in its gtp bound state the factor forms a positive interaction with the methionine moiety on met trnai that is disrupted when gtp is replaced with gdp while contacts between the factor and the body of the trna remain intact this positive interaction with the methionine residue on the trna may serve to ensure that only charged initiator trna enters the initiation pathway the toggling on and off of the factor s interaction with the methionine residue is likely to play an important role in the mechanism of initiator trna release upon initiation codon recognition in addition we show that the conserved base pair a u  which is known to be a critical identity element distinguishing initiator from elongator methionyl trna is required for recognition of the methionine moiety by eif  our data suggest that a role of this base pair is to orient the methionine moiety on the initiator trna in its recognition pocket on eif
