the flexible n terminal domain of ribosomal protein l  from escherichia coli is necessary for the activation of stringent factor
the stringent response is activated by the binding of stringent factor to stalled ribosomes that have an unacylated trna in the ribosomal aminoacyl site ribosomes lacking ribosomal protein l  are deficient in stimulating stringent factor l  consists of a dynamic n terminal domain amino acid residues     connected to an rna binding c terminal domain amino acid residues      by a flexible linker amino acid residues      in vivo data show that mutation of proline  in the n terminal domain is important for initiation of the stringent response here six different l  point and deletion mutants have been constructed to determine which regions of l  are necessary for the activation of stringent factor the different mutants were reconstituted with programmed   s  l  ribosomes and tested for their ability to stimulate stringent factor in a sensitive in vitro pppgpp synthesis assay it was found that a single site mutation at proline  in the linker region between the two domains did not affect the stimulatory activity of the reconstituted ribosomes whereas the single site mutation at proline  reduced the activity of sf to   compared to ribosomes reconstituted with wild type l  removal of the entire linker between the n and c terminal domains or removal of the entire proline rich helix beginning at proline  in l  resulted in an l  protein which was unable to stimulate stringent factor in the ribosome dependent assay surprisingly the n terminal domain of l  on its own activated stringent factor in a ribosome dependent manner without restoring the l  footprint in   s rrna in the   s subunit this suggests that the n terminal domain can activate stringent factor in trans it is also shown that this activation is dependent on unacylated trna
