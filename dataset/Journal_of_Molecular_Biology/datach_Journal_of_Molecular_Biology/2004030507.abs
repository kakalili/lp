inactivation of the      exonuclease of the replicative t dna polymerase allows translesion dna synthesis at an abasic site
here we have investigated the consequences of the loss of proof reading exonuclease function on the ability of the replicative t dna polymerase gp  to elongate past a single abasic site located on model dna substrates our results show that wild type t dna polymerase stopped at the base preceding the lesion on two linear substrates having different sequences whereas the gp  d  a exonuclease deficient mutant was capable of efficient bypass when replicating the same substrates the structure of the dna template did not influence the behavior of the exonuclease proficient or deficient t dna polymerases in fact when replicating a damaged  minicircle  dna substrate constructed by circularizing one of the linear dna elongation by wild type enzyme was still completely blocked by the abasic site while the d  a mutant was capable of bypass during dna replication the t dna polymerase associates with accessory factors whose combined action increases the polymerase binding capacity and processivity and could modulate the behavior of the enzyme towards an abasic site we thus performed experiments measuring the ability of wild type and exonuclease deficient t dna polymerases in conjunction with these replicative accessory proteins to perform translesion dna replication on linear or circular damaged dna substrates we found no evidence of either stimulation or inhibition of the bypass activities of the wild type and exonuclease deficient forms of t dna polymerase following addition of the accessory factors indicating that the presence or absence of the proof reading activity is the major determinant in dictating translesion synthesis of an abasic site by t dna polymerase
