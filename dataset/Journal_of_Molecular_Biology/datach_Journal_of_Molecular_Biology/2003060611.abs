crystal structure of a family  endoglucanase from melanocarpus albomyces mechanistic implications based on the free and cellobiose bound forms
cellulose a polysaccharide of    linked d glucosyl units is the major component of plant cell walls and one of the most abundant biopolymers in nature cellulases cellobiohydrolases and endoglucanases are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of cellulose to smaller oligosaccharides a process of paramount importance in biotechnology the thermophilic fungus melanocarpus albomyces produces a  kda endoglucanase known as  k cellulase that has been found particularly useful in the textile industry the crystal structures of free  k cellulase and its complex with cellobiose have been determined at    resolution the enzyme classified into the glycoside hydrolase family   exhibits the characteristic six stranded  barrel found before in humicola insolens endoglucanase v structure however the active site in the  k cellulase shows a closing of approximately       while a mobile loop identified previously in humicola insolens endoglucanase v and implicated in the catalytic mechanism is well defined in  k cellulase in addition the crystal structure of the cellobiose complex shows a shift in the cellobiose position at the substrate binding cleft it is therefore proposed that these alterations may reflect differences in the binding mechanism and catalytic action of the enzyme
