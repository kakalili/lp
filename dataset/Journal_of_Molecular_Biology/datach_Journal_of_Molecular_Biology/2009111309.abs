all atom monte carlo approach to protein  peptide binding
we develop a procedure for exploring the free energy landscape of protein  peptide binding at atomic detail and apply it to pdz domain  peptide interactions the procedure involves soft constraints on receptor proteins providing limited chain flexibility including backbone motions peptide chains are left fully flexible and kept in spatial proximity of the protein through periodic boundary conditions by extensive monte carlo simulations full representative conformational ensembles at temperatures where bound and unbound states coexist are obtained to make this approach computationally feasible we develop an effective all atom energy function centering on hydrophobicity hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions our initial focus is a set of  pdz domain  peptide pairs with experimentally determined complex structures minimum energy conformations are found to be highly similar to the respective native structures in eight of the cases all atom peptide rmsds lt    having achieved that we turn to a more complete characterization of the bound peptide state through a clustering scheme applied on the full ensembles of peptide structures we find a significant diversity among bound peptide conformations for several pdz domains in particular involving the n terminal side of the peptide chains our computational model is then tested further on a set of nine pdz domain  peptide pairs where the peptides are not originally present in the experimentally determined structures we find a similar success rate in terms of the nativeness of minimum energy conformations finally we investigate the ability of our approach to capture variations in binding affinities for different peptide sequences this is done in particular for a set of related sequences binding to the third pdz domain of psd  with encouraging results
