the structure of yeast glutaminyl trna synthetase and modeling of its interaction with trna
eukaryotic glutaminyl trna synthetase glnrs contains an appended n terminal domain ntd whose precise function is unknown although glnrs structures from two prokaryotic species are known no eukaryotic glnrs structure has been reported here we present the first crystallographic structure of yeast glnrs finding that the structure of the c terminal domain is highly similar to escherichia coli glnrs but that   residues including the ntd are crystallographically disordered we present a model of the full length enzyme in solution using the structures of the c terminal domain and the isolated ntd with small angle x ray scattering data of the full length molecule we proceed to model the enzyme bound to trna using the crystallographic structures of gatcab and glnrs  trna complex from bacteria we contrast the trna bound model with the trna free solution state and perform molecular dynamics on the full length glnrs  trna complex which suggests that trna binding involves the motion of a conserved hinge in the ntd
