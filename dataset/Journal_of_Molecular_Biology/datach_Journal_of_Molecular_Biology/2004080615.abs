crystal structure of ems  in complex with the integrin   i domain
snake venoms contain a number of heterodimeric c type lectin like proteins clps that interact specifically with components of the haemostatic system ems  from the venom of echis multisquamatus binds to the collagen receptor integrin     also known as glycoprotein gp ia iia and specifically inhibits collagen binding here we report the crystal structure of ems  in complex with recombinant integrin   i domain that plays a central role in collagen binding the structure of the complex at    resolution reveals that the collagen binding site of the   i domain is covered completely by the bound ems  this blockage by ems  appears to spatially inhibit collagen binding to the   i domain the bound   i domain adopts a closed conformation which is seen in the absence of ligand suggesting that ems  stabilizes a closed conformation corresponding to the less active structure of the   i domain ems  does not directly bind to the manganese ion and residues of the metal ion dependent adhesion site midas of the   i domain suggesting that ems  may have the potential to bind specifically to the   i domain in a metal ion independent fashion
