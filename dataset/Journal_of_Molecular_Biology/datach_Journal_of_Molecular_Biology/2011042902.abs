transcriptional and cellular responses to defective mitochondrial proteolysis in fission yeast
lon and m aaa are the principal regulated proteases required for protein maturation and turnover in the mitochondrial matrix of diverse species to understand their roles in fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondria we generated deletion strains lacking lon and m aaa individually  lon and  m aaa or together  lon  m aaa     all three strains were viable but incapable of respiratory growth on a non fermentable carbon source due to mitochondrial dysfunction confocal and electron microscopy revealed a decrease in membrane potential and ultrastructural changes in  lon   m aaa and    mitochondria consistent with a respiratory defect and aggregation of proteins in the mitochondrial matrix to understand the global adaptations required for cell survival in the absence of lon and m aaa proteases we compared genome wide gene expression signatures of the deletion strains with the isogenic wild type strain deletion of lon caused a distinctive transcriptional footprint of just  differentially expressed genes  of which were up regulated genes located on the proximal mitochondrial genome mitochondrial dna  in contrast m aaa deletion caused a much larger transcriptional response involving   almost exclusively nuclear genes genes ameliorating stress and iron assimilation were up regulated while diverse mitochondrial genes and other metabolic enzymes were down regulated the connection with iron dysregulation was further explored using biochemical chemical and cellular assays although  m aaa and    contained more cellular iron than the wild type strain their transcriptomes strongly resembled a signature normally evoked by iron insufficiency or disrupted assembly of iron  sulfur clusters in mitochondria based on these findings we posit that excess iron accumulation could contribute to the pathology of human neurodegenerative disorders arising from defects in m aaa function
