the motif of sparc that inhibits dna synthesis is not a nuclear localization signal
sparc secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine  although primarily known as a secreted matricellular protein has also been identified in urothelial cell nuclei many biological activities including inhibition of cell adhesion and repression of dna synthesis have been ascribed to sparc but the influence of its intracellular localization on each of these activities is unknown when exposed by epitope retrieval and nuclear matrix unmasking techniques endogenous sparc was found to localize strongly to the nuclei and the nuclear matrix of cultured urothelial cells live cell time lapse imaging revealed that exogenous fluorescently labeled recombinant r sparc was taken up from medium over a   h period and accumulated inside cells two variants of rsparc with alterations in its putative nuclear localization signal nls were generated to investigate the existence and effects of the nls these variants demonstrated similar biophysical characteristics as the wild type protein visualization by a variety of techniques including live cell imaging deconvolution microscopy and cell fractionation all concurred that exogenous rsparc was not able to localize to cell nuclei but instead accumulated as perinuclear clusters localization of the rsparc nls variants was no different than wild type arguing against the presence of an active nls in rsparc imaging experiments showed that only permeabilized dead cells avidly took up rsparc into their nuclei the rsparc no nls variant proved ineffective at inhibiting dna synthesis whereas the rsparc strong nls variant was a more potent inhibitor of dna synthesis than was wild type rsparc the motif of sparc that inhibits the synthesis of urothelial cell dna is therefore not a nuclear localization signal but its manipulation holds therapeutic potential to generate a  super sparc  that can quiesce proliferative tissues
