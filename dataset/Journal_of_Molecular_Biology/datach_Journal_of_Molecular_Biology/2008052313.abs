zinc binding catalytic domain of human tankyrase
tankyrases are recently discovered proteins implicated in many important functions in the cell including telomere homeostasis and mitosis tankyrase modulates the activity of target proteins through poly adp ribosyl ation and here we report the structure of the catalytic poly adp ribose polymerase parp domain of human tankyrase  this is the first structure of a parp domain from the tankyrase subfamily the present structure reveals that tankyrases contain a short zinc binding motif which has not been predicted tankyrase activity contributes to telomere elongation observed in various cancer cells and tankyrase inhibition has been suggested as a potential route for cancer therapy in comparison with other parps significant structural differences are observed in the regions lining the substrate binding site of tankyrase  these findings will be of great value to facilitate structure based design of selective parp inhibitors in general and tankyrase inhibitors in particular
