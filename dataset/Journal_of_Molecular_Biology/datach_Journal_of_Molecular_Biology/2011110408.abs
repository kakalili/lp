the nlrp  pyrin domain structure dynamics and functional insights
the initial line of defense against infection is sustained by the innate immune system together membrane bound toll like receptors and cytosolic nucleotide binding domain and leucine rich repeat containing receptors nlr play key roles in the innate immune response by detecting bacterial and viral invaders as well as endogenous stress signals nlrs are multi domain proteins with varying n terminal effector domains that are responsible for regulating downstream signaling events here we report the structure and dynamics of the n terminal pyrin domain of nlrp  nlrp  pyd determined using nmr spectroscopy nlrp  is a non inflammasome nlr that has been implicated in the regulation of toll like receptor dependent nuclear factor  b activation nlrp  pyd adopts a typical six helical bundle death domain fold by direct comparison with other pyd structures we identified hydrophobic residues that are essential for the stable fold of the nlrp pyd family in addition we report the first in vitro confirmed non homotypic pyd interaction between nlrp  pyd and the pro apoptotic protein fas associated factor  faf   which links the innate immune system to apoptotic signaling interestingly all residues that participate in this protein protein interaction are confined to the      surface a region of nlrp  pyd that differs most between currently reported nlrp pyd structures finally we experimentally highlight a significant role for tryptophan  in the interaction between nlrp  pyd and the faf  uba domain
