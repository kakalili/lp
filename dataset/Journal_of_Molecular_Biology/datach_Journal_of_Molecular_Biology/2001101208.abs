quantification of dnasei sensitivity by real time pcr quantitative analysis of dnasei hypersensitivity of the mouse  globin lcr edited by j karn
we employ real time pcr to allow us to quantify the sensitivity of chromatin to digestion by dnasei this approach has three clear advantages over the more conventional use of the southern hybridization assay the accuracy of quantification is improved the resolution of the assay is enhanced by designing primers to amplify small amplicons it is possible to analyze sequences both co incident and proximal to sites of dnasei hypersensitivity less material is needed as little as  ng of treated genomic dna we applied this method in an analysis of the chromatin structure of the previously described mouse  globin locus control region lcr using fetal liver cells the four hypersensitive sites of the canonical mouse lcr hs to hs  are shown to have kinetics of digestion consistent with these sequences being nucleosome free in vivo a different pattern was seen for hs  a recently described  weak  hypersensitive site the site was also rapidly lost but more of the sites proved resistant we interpreted this to show that this hypersensitive was only forming in a portion of the erythroid cells this finding implies that in vivo the lcr is structurally heterogeneous sequences proximal to the hypersensitive sites show a third pattern of intermediate sensitivity consistent with the chromatin being unfolded but the sites still bound by a continual nucleosomal array our results demonstrate that this method has the potential to achieve accurate and detailed mapping of chromatin structure from small amounts of tissue samples
