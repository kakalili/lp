origins of the high stability of an in vitro selected cold shock protein
in previous work we had identified stabilized forms of the cold shock protein bs cspb from bacillus subtilis in a combinatorial library by an in vitro selection procedure in this library the sequence positions          and  had been randomized because bs cspb differs from the naturally thermostable homolog bc csp from bacillus caldolyticus among others at these six positions for the most stable selected variant the midpoint of thermal unfolding tm increased by   deg c and the gibbs free energy of unfolding  gd by  kj mol here we analyzed by site directed mutagenesis how the selected residues contribute individually to this strong stabilization val and val  which replace glu and glu  of wild type bs cspb each contribute about kj mol to stability the thr arg substitution contributes  kj mol and  kj mol originate from the ala leu replacement gly  at the carboxy terminus is unimportant for stability the arg selected at position  is overall slightly destabilizing but improves the coulombic interactions the best variant differs from bc csp at all six positions nevertheless natural and in vitro selection followed similar principles in both cases negatively charged residues at the adjacent positions  and  are avoided and a positively charged residue is introduced into this area of the protein surface its exact location is unimportant it can be at position  as in the thermophilic bc csp or at positions  or   as in the most stable selected variant these positively charged residues contribute to stability not by engaging in pairwise coulombic interactions with a specific carboxyl group but by generally improving the charge distribution in this particular region of the protein surface these coulombic effects contribute significantly to the thermostability of the cold shock proteins they are only weakly interdependent and best explained by the presence of a flexible ion network at the protein surface our results emphasize that surface positions are very good candidates for optimizing protein stability
