posttranslational modifications affect the interaction of s  proteins with tumor suppressor p
proteins of the s  family bind to the intrinsically disordered transactivation domain tad residues     and c terminus residues      of the tumor suppressor p  both regions provide sites that are subject to posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation that can alter the affinity for interacting proteins such as p  and mdm  here we found that s  a  s  a  s  a  s  a  and s  b bound to two subdomains of the tad tad and tad  both subdomains were mandatory for high affinity binding to s  proteins phosphorylation of ser and thr residues increased the affinity for the p  tad conversely acetylation and phosphorylation of the c terminus of p  decreased the affinity for s  a and s  b in contrast we found that nitrosylation of s  b caused a minor increase in binding to the p  c terminus whereas binding to the tad remained unaffected as activation of p  is usually accompanied by phosphorylation and acetylation at several sites our results suggest that a shift in binding from the c terminus in favor of the n terminus occurs upon the modification of p  we propose that binding to the p  tad might be involved in the stimulation of p  activity by s  proteins
