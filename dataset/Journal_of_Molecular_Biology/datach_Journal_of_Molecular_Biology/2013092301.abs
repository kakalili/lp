nuclear respiratory factor   nrf   recruits nrf   to the nucleus by binding to importin    via an unusual monopartite type nuclear localization signal
nuclear respiratory factor  nrf  is a mammalian transcription factor composed of two distinct and unrelated proteins nrf   which binds to dna through its ets domain and nrf   which contains the transcription activation domain the activity of nrf  in neurons is regulated by nuclear localization however the mechanism by which nrf  is imported into the nucleus remains unknown by using in vitro nuclear import assays and immuno cytofluorescence we dissect the nuclear import pathways of nrf  we show that both nrf   and nrf   contain intrinsic nuclear localization signals nlss  the ets domain within nrf   and the nls within nrf   amino acids     eeppakrqcie that is recognized by importin    when nrf   and nrf   form a complex the nuclear import of nrf    becomes strictly dependent on the nls within nrf   therefore the nuclear import mechanism of nrf  is unique among ets factors the nrf   nls contains only two lysine arginine residues unlike other known importin    dependent nlss using elisa based binding assays we show that it is bound by importin  in almost the same manner and with similar affinity to that of the classical monopartite nlss such as c myc and sv  t antigen nlss however the part of the tryptophan array of importin  that is essential for the recognition of classical monopartite nlss by generating apolar pockets for the p and the p lysine arginine side chains is not required for the recognition of the nrf   nls we conclude that the nrf   nls is an unusual but is nevertheless a bona fide monopartite type nls
