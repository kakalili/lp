structural insight into p  recognition by the  bp tandem tudor domain
the tumor suppressor p  and the dna repair factor  bp  p  binding protein  regulate gene transcription and responses to genotoxic stresses upon dna damage p  undergoes dimethylation at lys   p k  me  and this posttranslational modification is recognized by  bp  the molecular mechanism of nonhistone methyl lysine mark recognition remains unknown here we report a     resolution crystal structure of the tandem tudor domain of human  bp bound to a p k  me peptide in the complex dimethylated lys  is restrained by a set of hydrophobic and cation   interactions in a cage formed by four aromatic residues and an aspartate of  bp  the signature hkkme motif of p  which defines specificity is identified through a combination of nmr resonance perturbations mutagenesis measurements of binding affinities and docking simulations and analysis of the crystal structures of  bp bound to p  peptides containing other dimethyl lysine marks p k  me  p  dimethylated at lys   and p k  me  p  dimethylated at lys   binding of the  bp tudor domain to p k  me may facilitate p  accumulation at dna damage sites and promote dna repair as suggested by chromatin immunoprecipitation and dna repair assays together our data detail the molecular mechanism of p    bp association and provide the basis for deciphering the role of this interaction in the regulation of p  and  bp functions
