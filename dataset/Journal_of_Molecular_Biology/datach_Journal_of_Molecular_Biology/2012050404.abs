identification of a region in the n terminus of escherichia coli lon that affects atpase substrate translocation and proteolytic activity
lon also known as protease la is an aaa protease machine that contains the atpase and proteolytic domain within each enzyme subunit three truncated escherichia coli lon elon mutants were generated based on a previous limited tryptic digestion result and hydrogen  deuterium exchange mass spectrometry analyses performed in this study using methods developed for characterizing wild type wt lon we compared the atpase atp dependent protein degradation and atp dependent peptidase activities with the exception of not degrading a putative structured substrate known as ccrm cell cycle regulated dna methyltransferase  the mutant lacking the first   residues behaved like wt elon comparing the activity data of wt and elon mutants reveals that the first   residues are not needed for minimal enzyme catalysis the mutants lacking the first   residues or residues      displayed compromised atpase protein degradation and atp dependent peptide translocation abilities but retained wt like steady state peptidase activity the binding affinities of wt and lon mutants were evaluated by determining the concentration of  n k n needed to achieve   maximal atpase stimulation comparing the k n values reveals that the region encompassing      of elon could contribute to  n binding but the effect is modest taken together results generated from this study reveal that the region constituting residues      of elon is important for atpase activity substrate translocation and protein degradation
