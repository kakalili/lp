functional expression of a chimeric myosin containing motor domain of chara myosin and neck and tail domains of dictyostelium myosin ii edited by j karn
we succeeded in expressing a chimeric myosin that comprises the motor domain of characean algal myosin  the fastest known motor protein  and the neck and tail domains of dictyostelium myosin ii although the chimeric myosin showed an atpase activity comparable to that of muscle myosin   times higher than that of the wild type dictyostelium myosin ii  the motile activity of the chimera was only   times higher than that of the wild type however this is the first chimeric myosin that showed motile activity faster than at least one of the parent myosins it was suggested therefore that the motor domain of chara myosin has the potential for performing fast sliding movement
