structural characterisation of bisintercalation in higher order dna at a junction like quadruplex
we report the single crystal x ray structure for the complex of the bisacridine bis  aminooctyl  dimethylaminoethyl acridine  carboxamide  with the oligonucleotide d cgtacg  to a resolution of    solution studies with closed circular dna show this compound to be a bisintercalating threading agent but so far we have no crystallographic or nmr structural data conforming to the model of contiguous intercalation within the same duplex here with the hexameric duplex d cgtacg  the dna is observed to undergo a terminal cytosine base exchange to yield an unusual guanine quadruplex intercalation site through which the bisacridine threads its octamethylene linker to fuse two dna duplexes the  carboxamide side chains form anchoring hydrogen bonding interactions with guanine o atoms on each side of the quadruplex this higher order dna structure provides insight into an unexpected property of bisintercalating threading agents and suggests the idea of targeting such compounds specifically at four way dna junctions
