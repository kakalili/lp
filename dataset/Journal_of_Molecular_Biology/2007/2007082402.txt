We investigated the influence of hydration water on the relationship between structure, dynamics and function in a biological membrane system.For the example of the purple membrane (PM) with its protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-driven proton pump, complementary information from neutron diffraction, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and dielectric spectroscopy will form a comprehensive picture of the structural and dynamic behavior of the PM in the temperature range between 150 and 290 K.Temperature- and humidity-dependent changes in the membrane system influence the accessibility of the different photocycle intermediates of BR.The melting of the ‘freezing bound water’ between 220 and 250 K could be related to the transition from the M1 to the M2 intermediate, which represents the key step in the photocycle. The dynamic transition in the vicinity of 180 K was shown to be necessary to ensure that the M1 intermediate can be populated and that the melting of crystallized bulk water above 255 K enables the completion of the photocycle.
