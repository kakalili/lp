solution nmr structure of apo calmodulin in complex with the iq motif of human cardiac sodium channel nav
the function of the human voltage gated sodium channel nav  is regulated in part by intracellular calcium signals the ubiquitous calcium sensor protein calmodulin cam is an important part of the complex calcium sensing apparatus in nav   cam interacts with an iq isoleucine  glutamine motif in the large intracellular c terminal domain of the channel using co expression and co purification we have been able to isolate a cam  iq motif complex and to determine its high resolution structure in absence of calcium using multi dimensional solution nmr under these conditions the nav  iq motif interacts with the c terminal domain c lobe of cam with the n terminal domain remaining free in solution the structure reveals that the c lobe adopts a semi open conformation with the iq motif bound in a narrow hydrophobic groove sequence similarities between voltage gated sodium channels and voltage gated calcium channels suggest that the structure of the cam  nav  iq motif complex can serve as a general model for the interaction between cam and ion channel iq motifs under low calcium conditions the structure also provides insight into the biochemical basis for disease associated mutations that map to the iq motif in nav
