Genome packaging is an essential step to generate infectious HIV-1 virions and is mediated by interactions between the viral protein Gag and cis-acting elements in the full-length RNA. The sequence necessary and sufficient to allow RNA genome packaging into an HIV-1 particle has not been defined. Here, we used two distinct reporter systems to determine the HIV-1 sequence required for heterologous, non-viral RNAs to be packaged into viral particles. Although the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the HIV-1 RNA is known to be important for RNA packaging, we found that its ability to mediate packaging relies heavily on the context of the downstream sequences. Insertion of the 5′ UTR and the first 32-nt of gag into two different reporter RNAs is not sufficient to mediate the packaging of these RNA into HIV-1 particles. However, adding the 5′ half of the gag gene to the 5′ UTR strongly facilitates the packaging of two reporter RNAs; such RNAs can be packaged at &gt;50% of the efficiencies of an HIV-1 near full-length vector. To further examine the role of the gag sequence in RNA packaging, we replaced the 5′ gag sequence in the HIV-1 genome with two codon-optimized gag sequences and found that such substitutions only resulted in a moderate decrease of RNA packaging efficiencies. Taken together, these results indicated that both HIV-1 5′ UTR and the 5′ gag sequence are required for efficient packaging of non-viral RNA into HIV-1 particles, although the gag sequence likely plays an indirect role in genome packaging.
