htlv  hbz protein deregulates interactions between cellular factors and the kix domain of p  cbp
the complex retrovirus human t cell leukemia virus type  htlv  is the causative agent of adult t cell leukemia deregulation of cellular transcription is thought to be an important step for t cell transformation caused by viral infection htlv  basic leucine zipper factor hbz is one of the viral proteins believed to be involved in this process as it deregulates the expression of numerous cellular genes in the context of the provirus hbz represses htlv  transcription in part by binding to the homologous cellular coactivators p  and cbp these coactivators play a central role in transcriptional regulation in this study we determined that hbz binds with high affinity to the kix domain of p  cbp this domain contains two binding surfaces that are differentially targeted by multiple cellular factors we show that two  xx   motifs in the activation domain of hbz mediate binding to a single surface of the kix domain the mixed lineage leukemia mll binding surface formation of this interaction inhibits binding of mll to the kix domain while enhancing the binding of the transcription factor c myb to the opposite surface of kix consequently hbz inhibits transcriptional activation mediated by mll and enhances activation mediated by c myb creb which binds the same surface of kix as c myb also exhibited an increase in activity through hbz these results indicate that hbz is able to alter gene expression by competing with transcription factors for the occupancy of one surface of kix while enhancing the binding of factors to the other surface
