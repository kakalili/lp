stability and cdr composition biases enrich binder functionality landscapes
the rugged protein sequence  function landscape complicates efforts both in nature and in the laboratory to evolve protein function protein library diversification must strike a balance between sufficient variegation to thoroughly sample alternative functionality versus the probability of mutant destabilization below an expressible threshold in this work we explore the sequence  function landscape in the context of screening for molecular recognition from an ig scaffold library the fibronectin type iii domain is used to explore the impact of two sequence diversification strategies  a partial wild type conservation at structurally important positions within the paratope region and b tailored amino acid composition mimicking antibody binding site composition at putative paratope positions structurally important positions within the paratope region were identified through stability structural and phylogenetic analyses and partially or fully conserved in sequence to achieve tailored antibody like diversity we designed a set of skewed nucleotide mixtures yielding codons approximately matching the distribution observed in antibody complementarity determining regions without incurring the expense of triphosphoramidite based construction these design elements were explored via comparison of three library designs a random library a library with wild type bias in the de loop only and tyrosine  serine diversity elsewhere and a library with wild type bias at  positions and the antibody inspired amino acid distribution using pooled libraries for direct competition in a single tube selection and maturation of binders to seven targets yielded  of  clones that originated from the structurally biased tailored diversity library design sequence analysis of the selected clones supports the importance of both tailored compositional diversity and structural bias in addition selection of both well and poorly expressed clones from two libraries further elucidated the impact of structural bias
