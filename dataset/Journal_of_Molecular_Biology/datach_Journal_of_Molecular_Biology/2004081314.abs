a highly unusual palindromic transmembrane helical hairpin formed by sars coronavirus e protein
the agent responsible for the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak is a previously unidentified coronavirus while there is a wealth of epidemiological studies little if any molecular characterization of sars coronavirus scov proteins has been carried out here we describe the molecular characterization of scov e protein a critical component of the virus responsible for virion envelope morphogenesis we conclusively show that scov e protein contains an unusually short palindromic transmembrane helical hairpin around a previously unidentified pseudo center of symmetry a structural feature which seems to be unique to scov the hairpin deforms lipid bilayers by way of increasing their curvature providing for the first time a molecular explanation of e protein s pivotal role in viral budding the molecular understanding of this critical component of scov may represent the beginning of a concerted effort aimed at inhibiting its function and consequently viral infectivity
