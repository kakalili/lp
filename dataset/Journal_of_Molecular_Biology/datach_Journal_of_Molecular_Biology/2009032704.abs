clic ryr interaction and structural characterization by cryo electron microscopy
chloride intracellular channel  clic  a newly discovered small protein distantly related to the glutathione transferase gst structural family is highly expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle although its physiological function in these tissues has not been established in the present study  h ryanodine binding ca  efflux from skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum sr vesicles single channel recording and cryo electron microscopy were employed to investigate whether clic can interact with skeletal ryanodine receptor ryr  and modulate its channel activity we found that   clic facilitated  h ryanodine binding to skeletal sr and purified ryr  by increasing the binding affinity of ryanodine for its receptor without significantly changing the apparent maximal binding capacity   clic reduced the maximal ca  efflux rate from skeletal sr vesicles   clic decreased the open probability of ryr channel through increasing the mean closed time of the channel   clic bound to a region between domains  and  in the clamp shaped region of ryr    and in the same clamp region domains  and  became separated after clic binding indicating clic induced a conformational change of ryr  these data suggest that clic can interact with ryr and modulate its channel activity we propose that clic functions as an intrinsic stabilizer of the closed state of ryr channels
