the s d method simultaneous sequence based prediction of the statistical populations of ordered and disordered regions in proteins
extensive amounts of information about protein sequences are becoming available as demonstrated by the over  million entries in the uniprot database yet it is still challenging to obtain proteome wide experimental information on the structural properties associated with these sequences fast computational predictors of secondary structure and of intrinsic disorder of proteins have been developed in order to bridge this gap these two types of predictions however have remained largely separated often preventing a clear characterization of the structure and dynamics of proteins here we introduce a computational method to predict secondary structure populations from amino acid sequences which simultaneously characterizes structure and disorder in a unified statistical mechanics framework to develop this method called s d we exploited recent advances made in the analysis of nmr chemical shifts that provide quantitative information about the probability distributions of secondary structure elements in disordered states the results that we discuss show that the s d method predicts secondary structure populations with an average error of about   a validation on three datasets of mostly disordered mostly structured and partly structured proteins respectively shows that its performance is comparable to or better than that of existing predictors of intrinsic disorder and of secondary structure these results indicate that it is possible to perform rapid and quantitative sequence based characterizations of the structure and dynamics of proteins through the predictions of the statistical distributions of their ordered and disordered regions
