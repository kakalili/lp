structural studies on the extracellular domain of sensor histidine kinase yycg from staphylococcus aureus and its functional implications
bacterial two component signal transduction systems are used to adapt to fluctuations in the environment yycg a key two component histidine kinase in staphylococcus aureus plays an essential role in cell viability and regulates cell wall metabolism biofilm formation virulence and antibiotic resistance for these reasons yycg is considered a compelling target for the development of novel antibiotics however to date the signaling mechanism of yycg and its stimulus are poorly understood mainly because of a lack of structural information on yycg to address this deficiency we determined the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of s aureus yycg yycgex at    resolution the crystal structure indicated two subunits with an extracellular per arnt sim pas topology packed into a dimer with interloop interactions disulfide scanning using cysteine substituted mutants revealed that yycgex possessed dimeric interfaces not only in the loop but also in the helix   cross linking studies using intact yycg demonstrated that it was capable of forming high molecular weight oligomers on the cell membrane furthermore we also observed that two auxiliary proteins of yycg yych and yyci cooperatively interfered with the multimerization of yycg from these results we propose that signaling through yycg is regulated by multimerization and binding of yych and yyci these structural studies combined with biochemical analyses provide a better understanding of the signaling mechanism of yycg which is necessary for developing novel antibacterial drugs targeting s aureus
