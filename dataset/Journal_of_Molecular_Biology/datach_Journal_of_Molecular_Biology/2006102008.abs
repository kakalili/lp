direct analysis of backbone  backbone hydrogen bond formation in protein folding transition states
here we investigate the role of backbone  backbone hydrogen bonding interactions in stabilizing the protein folding transition states of two model protein systems the b domain of protein l protl and the p  arc repressor a backbone modified analogue of protl containing an amide to ester bond substitution between residues   and   was prepared by total chemical synthesis and the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters associated with its folding reaction were evaluated utlimately these parameters were used in a  value analysis to determine if the native backbone  backbone hydrogen bonding interaction perturbed in this analogue i e a hydrogen bond in the first  turn of protl s            fold was formed in the transition state of protl s folding reaction also determined were the kinetic parameters associated with the folding reactions of two arc repressor analogues each containing an amide to ester bond substitution in the backbone of their polypeptide chains these parameters were used together with previously established thermodynamic parameters for the folding of these analogues in  value analyses to determine if the native backbone  backbone hydrogen bonding interactions perturbed in these analogues i e a hydrogen bond at the end of the intersubunit  sheet interface and hydrogen bonds at the beginning of the second  helix in arc repressor s       structure were formed in the transition state of arc repressor s folding reaction our results reveal that backbone  backbone hydrogen bonding interactions are formed in the  turn and  helical transition state structures of protl and arc repressor respectively and they were not formed in the intersubunit  sheet interface of arc repressor a region of arc repressor s polypeptide chain previously shown to have other non native like conformations in arc s protein folding transition state
