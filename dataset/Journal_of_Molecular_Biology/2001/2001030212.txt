The structure and energetics of protein-folding intermediates are poorly understood. We have identified, in the thermal unfolding of the apoflavodoxin from Anabaena PCC 7119, an equilibrium intermediate with spectroscopic properties of a molten globule and substantial enthalpy and heat capacity of unfolding. The structure of the intermediate is probed by mutagenesis (and phi analysis) of polar residues involved in surface-exposed hydrogen bonds connecting secondary-structure elements in the native protein. All hydrogen bonds analysed are formed in the molten globule intermediate, either with native strength or debilitated. This suggests the overall intermediateâ€™s topology and surface tertiary interactions are close to native, and indicates that hydrogen bonding may contribute significantly to shape the conformation and energetics of folding intermediates.
