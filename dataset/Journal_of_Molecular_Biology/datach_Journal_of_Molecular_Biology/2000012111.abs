identification of related proteins on family superfamily and fold level edited by f c cohen
proteins might have considerable structural similarities even when no evolutionary relationship of their sequences can be detected this property is often referred to as the proteins sharing only a  fold   of course there are also sequences of common origin in each fold called a  superfamily   and in them groups of sequences with clear similarities designated  family   developing algorithms to reliably identify proteins related at any level is one of the most important challenges in the fast growing field of bioinformatics today however it is not at all certain that a method proficient at finding sequence similarities performs well at the other levels or vice versa here we have compared the performance of various search methods on these different levels of similarity as expected we show that it becomes much harder to detect proteins as their sequences diverge for family related sequences the best method gets   of the top hits correct when the sequences differ but the proteins belong to the same superfamily this drops to    and in the case of proteins with only fold similarity it is as low as    we have made a more complete analysis of the performance of different algorithms than earlier studies also including threading methods in the comparison using this method a more detailed picture emerges showing multiple sequence information to improve detection on the two closer levels of relationship we have also compared the different methods of including this information in prediction algorithms for lower specificities the best scheme to use is a linking method connecting proteins through an intermediate hit for higher specificities better performance is obtained by psi blast and some procedures using hidden markov models we also show that a threading method threader performs significantly better than any other method at fold recognition
