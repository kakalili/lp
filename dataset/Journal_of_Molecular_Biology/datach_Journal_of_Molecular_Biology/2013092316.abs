a pseudo atomic model for the capsid shell of bacteriophage lambda using chemical cross linking mass spectrometry and molecular modeling
bacteriophage lambda is one of the most exhaustively studied of the double stranded dna viruses its assembly pathway is highly conserved among the herpesviruses and many of the bacteriophages making it an excellent model system despite extensive genetic and biophysical characterization of many of the lambda proteins and the assembly pathways in which they are implicated there is a relative dearth of structural information on many of the most critical proteins involved in lambda assembly and maturation including that of the lambda major capsid protein toward this end we have utilized a combination of chemical cross linking mass spectrometry and computational modeling to construct a pseudo atomic model of the lambda major capsid protein as a monomer as well as in the context of the assembled procapsid shell the approach described here is generalizable and can be used to provide structural models for any biological complex of interest the procapsid structural model is in good agreement with published biochemical data indicating that procapsid expansion exposes hydrophobic surface area and that this serves to nucleate assembly of capsid decoration protein gpd the model further implicates additional molecular interactions that may be critical to the assembly of the capsid shell and for the stabilization of the structure by the gpd decoration protein
