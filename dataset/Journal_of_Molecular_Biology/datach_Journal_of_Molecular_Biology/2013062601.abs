an ire  phk chimera reveals a dispensable role of autokinase activity in endoplasmic reticulum stress response
the endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane receptor ire senses over accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and initiates the unfolded protein response upr  the cytoplasmic portion of ire has a protein kinase domain kd and a kinase extension nuclease ken domain that cleaves an mrna for encoding the hac transcription factor needed to express upr genes during this upr signaling ire proteins self assemble into an oligomer of dimers which essentially requires autophosphorylation of a constituent activation loop in the kd however it is not clear how dimerization autophosphorylation and ken domain function are precisely coordinated in this study we uncoupled the kd and ken domain functions by removing the activation loop along with an extended region that we called the auto inhibitory region air  or by swapping the activation loop with a homologous loop from phosphorylase kinase  ire phk  both ire  air and ire phk activated the upr even when either protein contained a mutation d  a that abolished the ability of ire kd to transfer phosphates to the air neither protein functioned when containing mutations in key atp binding residues e  a and n  a or in residues that disrupted ire dimer interface w  a or r  d  we interpret these results as evidence supporting the notion that the primary function of the kinase domain is to autophosphorylate the air in order to relieve auto inhibition and that adp acts as a switch to activate the ken domain catalyzed hac mrna cleavage
