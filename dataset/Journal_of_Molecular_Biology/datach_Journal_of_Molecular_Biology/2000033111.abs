nmr structure of activated chey edited by p e wright
the chey protein is the response regulator in bacterial chemotaxis phosphorylation of a conserved aspartyl residue induces structural changes that convert the protein from an inactive to an active state the short half life of the aspartyl phosphate has precluded detailed structural analysis of the active protein persistent activation of escherichia coli chey was achieved by complexation with beryllofluoride bef   and the structure determined by nmr spectroscopy to a backbone r m s d of         formation of a hydrogen bond between the thr  oh group and an active site acceptor presumably asp  bef   stabilizes a coupled rearrangement of highly conserved residues thr  and tyr   along with displacement of   and h  to yield the active state the coupled rearrangement may be a more general mechanism for activation of receiver domains
