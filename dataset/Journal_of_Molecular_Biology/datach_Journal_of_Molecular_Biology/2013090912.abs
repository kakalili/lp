structural determinants of oligomerization of   pyrroline  carboxylate dehydrogenase identification of a hexamerization hot spot
the aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh superfamily member   pyrroline  carboxylate dehydrogenase p cdh catalyzes the nad dependent oxidation of glutamate semialdehyde to glutamate which is the final step of proline catabolism defects in p cdh activity lead to the metabolic disorder type ii hyperprolinemia p cdh is essential for virulence of the fungal pathogen cryptococcus neoformans and bacterial p cdhs have been targeted for vaccine development although the enzyme oligomeric state is known to be important for aldh function the oligomerization of p cdh has remained relatively unstudied here we determine the oligomeric states and quaternary structures of four bacterial p cdhs using a combination of small angle x ray scattering x ray crystallography and dynamic light scattering the p cdhs from thermus thermophilus and deinococcus radiodurans form trimer of dimers hexamers in solution which is the first observation of a hexameric aldh in solution in contrast two bacillus p cdhs form dimers in solution but do not assemble into a higher order oligomer site directed mutagenesis was used to identify a hexamerization hot spot that is centered on an arginine residue in the nad binding domain mutation of this critical arg residue to ala in either of the hexameric enzymes prevents hexamer formation in solution paradoxically the dimeric arg to ala t thermophilus mutant enzyme packs as a hexamer in the crystal state which illustrates the challenges associated with predicting the biological assembly in solution from crystal structures the observation of different oligomeric states among p cdhs suggests potential differences in cooperativity and protein  protein interactions
