post transcriptional fine tuning of cop signalosome subunit biosynthesis is regulated by the c myc lin b let  pathway
the cop signalosome csn complex controls protein degradation via the ubiquitin ub proteasome system ups in eukaryotes in mammalian cells the multimeric csn is composed of eight subunits csn   csn  it regulates cullin ring ub ligases crls  which target essential regulatory proteins for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation thereby the csn cooperates with the ups in a variety of essential cellular functions including dna repair cell cycle and differentiation although functions of the csn have been elucidated mechanisms and regulatory principles of its de novo formation are completely unknown here we show that there is a fundamental mechanism that allows a coordinated expression of all csn subunits a prerequisite for csn assembly csn subunit mrnas are targets of mirnas of the let  family suppressing csn subunit expression in human cells factors that reduce or block let  mirnas induce the coordinated expression of csn subunits for instance over expression of csn specifically traps let a  mirna and elevates csn subunit levels by two to fourfold in a coordinated manner csn subunit expression is also increased by specific mirna inhibitors or by interferon ifn mediated induction of stat and c myc reducing levels of let  mirnas activation of stat by ifn  or ifn  induces c myc which increases csn subunit expression via the lin b let  regulatory pathway by contrast a let a  mimic reduces csn subunit expression our data show that let  mirnas control the fine tuning and coordinated expression of subunits for csn de novo formation presumably a general regulatory principle for other zomes complexes as well
