towards understanding human mitochondrial leucine aminoacylation identity
specific recognition of trnas by aminoacyl trna synthetases is governed by sets of aminoacylation identity elements well defined for numerous prokaryotic systems and eukaryotic cytosolic systems only restricted information is available for aminoacylation of human mitochondrial trnas despite their particularities linked to the non classical structures of the trnas and their involvement in a growing number of human neurodegenerative disorders linked to mutations in the corresponding trna genes a major difficulty to be overcome is the preparation of active in vitro transcripts enabling a rational mutagenic analysis as is currently performed for classical trnas here structural and aminoacylation properties of in vitro transcribed trnaleu uur are presented solution probing using a combination of enzymatic and chemical tools revealed only partial folding into an l shaped structure with an acceptor branch but with a floppy anticodon branch optimization of aminoacylation conditions allowed charging of up to   of molecules showing that despite its partially relaxed structure in vitro transcribed trnaleu uur is able to adapt to the synthetase in addition mutational analysis demonstrates that the discriminator base as well as residue a  are important leucine identity elements thus human mitochondrial leucylation is dependent on rules similar to those that apply in escherichia coli the impact of a subset of pathology related mutations on aminoacylation and on trna structure has been explored these variants do not show significant structural rearrangements and either do not affect aminoacylation mutations t  c t  c c  t or lead to marked effects interestingly two variants with a mutation at the same position a  g and a  t lead to markedly different losses in aminoacylation efficiencies tenfold and   fold respectively
