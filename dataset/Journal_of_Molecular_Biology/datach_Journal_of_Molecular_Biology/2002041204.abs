states of thin filament regulatory proteins as revealed by combined cross linking x ray diffraction techniques edited by m f moody
the regulatory protein system in the skeletal muscle thin filaments is known to exhibit three discrete states called  off  or  blocked   no ca    on  or  closed   with ca  alone and  potentiated  or  open   with strongly bound myosin head states biochemical studies have shown that only weak interactions with myosin are allowed in the second state characterization of each state is often difficult because the equilibria among these states are readily shifted by experimental conditions to overcome this problem we chemically cross linked the skeletal muscle thin filament in the three states with the zero length cross linker  ethyl   dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide edc  in overstretched muscle fibers the state of the regulatory proteins was monitored by measuring the intensity of the second actin layer line  nd ll reflection in x ray diffraction patterns structurally the thin filaments cross linked in the three states exhibited three corresponding discrete levels of nd ll intensities which were not ca  sensitive any more functionally the thin filament cross linked in the  off blocked  state inhibited strong interaction with myosin head subgfragment  or s  the thin filament cross linked in the  potentiated open  state allowed strong interaction and full atpase activity of s as described previously the thin filament cross linked in the  on closed  state allowed strong interactions with s and actin activated atpase without enhancing the nd ll to the level of  potentiated open  state contrary to the expectations from the biochemical studies the results demonstrate the potential of edc as a tool for studying the states of calcium regulation and the apparent uncoupling between the nd ll intensity and the function provides a new insight into the mechanism of thin filament regulation
