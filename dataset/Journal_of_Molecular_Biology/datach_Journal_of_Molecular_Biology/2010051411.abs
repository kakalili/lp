mapping of drebrin binding site on f actin
drebrin is a filament binding protein involved in organizing the dendritic pool of actin previous in vivo studies identified the actin binding domain of drebrin drabd  which causes the same rearrangements in the cytoskeleton as the full length protein site directed mutagenesis electron microscopic reconstruction and chemical cross linking combined with mass spectrometry analysis were employed here to map the drabd binding interface on actin filaments drabd could be simultaneously attached to two adjacent actin protomers using the combination of  iminothiolane traut s reagent and mts    methanediyl bis methanethiosulfonate  site directed mutagenesis combined with chemical cross linking revealed that residue   of drabd is located within     from c  of actin protomer  and that native cysteine   of drebrin is near c  of actin protomer  mass spectrometry analysis revealed that a zero length cross linker  ethyl   dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide can link the n terminal g  s extension of the recombinant drabd to e  and or e  on actin efficient cross linking of drebrin residues           and   to actin residue  was achieved with reagents of different lengths         these results suggest that the  core  drabd is centered on actin subdomain  and may adopt a folded conformation upon binding to f actin the results of electron microscopic reconstruction which are in a good agreement with the cross linking data revealed polymorphism in drabd binding to f actin and suggested the existence of two binding sites these results provide new structural insight into the previously observed competition between drebrin and several other f actin binding proteins
