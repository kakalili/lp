The yeast Set1 histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase contains, in addition to its catalytic SET domain, a conserved RNA recognition motif (RRM1). We present here the crystal structure and the secondary structure assignment in solution of the Set1 RRM1. Although RRM1 has the expected βαββαβ RRM-fold, it lacks the typical RNA-binding features of these modules. RRM1 is not able to bind RNA by itself in vitro, but a construct combining RRM1 with a newly identified downstream RRM2 specifically binds RNA. In vivo, H3K4 methylation is not affected by a point mutation in RRM2 that preserves Set1 stability but affects RNA binding in vitro. In contrast mutating RRM1 destabilizes Set1 and leads to an increase of dimethylation of H3K4 at the 5′-coding region of active genes at the expense of trimethylation, whereas both, dimethylation decreases at the 3′-coding region. Taken together, our results suggest that Set1 RRMs bind RNA, but Set1 RNA-binding activity is not linked to H3K4 methylation.
