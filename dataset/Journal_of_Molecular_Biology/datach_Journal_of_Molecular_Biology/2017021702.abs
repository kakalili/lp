the journey of the autophagosome through mammalian cell organelles and membranes
autophagy is an intracellular degradation process carried out by a double membrane organelle termed the autophagosome which sequesters cytoplasmic material destined for lysosomal degradation and recycling autophagy and autophagosome biogenesis are highly conserved processes in eukaryotes and are essential for cell survival stress responses and homeostasis autophagosomes are dynamic and complex organelles that can originate from several different membrane compartments autophagosomes traffic through the cell to fuse with lysosomes or other compartments despite identification of key proteins necessary for autophagosome assembly and transport such as those encoded by the autophagy related genes the relationship and interdependence of the autophagosome with other intracellular endo membranes including those of organelles involved in exocytosis and endocytic trafficking pathways are still poorly understood here we discuss formation of autophagosomes the journey of these organelles through the cell and their close interplay with other mammalian organelles from points of view of signalization platforms and membrane dynamics
