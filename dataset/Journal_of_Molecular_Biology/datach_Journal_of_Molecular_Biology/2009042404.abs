the crystal structure of the pseudomonas dacunhae aspartate  decarboxylase dodecamer reveals an unknown oligomeric assembly for a pyridoxal   phosphate dependent enzyme
the pseudomonas dacunhae l aspartate  decarboxylase abdc aspartate  decarboxylase aspartate  carboxylyase e c      is a pyridoxal   phosphate plp dependent enzyme that catalyzes the  decarboxylation of l aspartate to produce l alanine and co  this catalytically versatile enzyme is known to form functional dodecamers at its optimal ph and is thought to work in conjunction with an l asp l ala antiporter to establish a proton gradient across the membrane that can be used for atp biosynthesis we have solved the atomic structure of abdc to     resolution using single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing the structure reveals that abdc oligomerizes as a homododecamer in an unknown mode among plp dependent enzymes and has highest structural homology with members of the plp dependent aspartate aminotransferase subfamily the structure shows that the abdc active site is very similar to that of aspartate aminotransferase however an additional arginine side chain arg  was observed flanking the re side of the plp ring in the abdc active site the mutagenesis results show that although arg  is not required for activity it appears to be involved in the abdc catalytic cycle
