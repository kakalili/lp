slow conformational changes in muts and dna direct ordered transitions between mismatch search recognition and signaling of dna repair
muts functions in mismatch repair mmr to scan dna for errors identify a target site and trigger subsequent events in the pathway leading to error removal and dna re synthesis these actions enabled by the atpase activity of muts are now beginning to be analyzed from the perspective of the protein itself this study provides the first ensemble transient kinetic data on muts conformational dynamics as it works with dna and atp in mmr using a combination of fluorescence probes on thermus aquaticus muts and dna and signals intensity anisotropy and resonance energy transfer  we have monitored the timing of key conformational changes in muts that are coupled to mismatch binding and recognition atp binding and hydrolysis as well as sliding clamp formation and signaling of repair significant findings include a a slow step that follows weak initial interaction between muts and dna in which concerted conformational changes in both macromolecules control mismatch recognition and b rapid binary switching of muts conformations that is concerted with atp binding and hydrolysis and c is stalled after mismatch recognition to control formation of the atp bound muts sliding clamp these rate limiting pre and post mismatch recognition events outline the mechanism of action of muts on dna during initiation of mmr
