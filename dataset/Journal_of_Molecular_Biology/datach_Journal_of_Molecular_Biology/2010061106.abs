a novel signal transduction protein pii variant from synechococcus elongatus pcc   indicates a two step process for nagk  pii complex formation
pii signal transduction proteins are highly conserved in bacteria archaea and plants and have key functions in coordination of central metabolism by integrating signals from the carbon nitrogen and energy status of the cell in the cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus pcc    pii binds atp and  oxoglutarate  og in a synergistic manner with the atp binding sites also accepting adp depending on its effector molecule binding status pii from this cyanobacterium and other oxygenic phototrophs complexes and regulates the arginine controlled enzyme of the cyclic ornithine pathway n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk  to control arginine biosynthesis to gain deeper insights into the process of pii binding to nagk we searched for pii variants with altered binding characteristics and found pii variants i n and i t to be able to bind to an nagk variant r  a that was previously shown to be unable to bind wild type pii protein analysis of interactions between these pii variants and wild type nagk as well as with the nagk r  a variant suggested that the pii i n variant was a superactive nagk binder to reveal the structural basis of this property we solved the crystal structure of the pii i n variant at atomic resolution the large t loop which prevails in most receptor interactions of pii proteins is present in a tightly bended conformation that mimics the t loop of s elongatus pii after having latched onto nagk moreover both pii i  variants display a specific defect in  og binding implying a role of residue i  in  og binding we propose a two step model for the mechanism of pii  nagk complex formation in an initiating step a contact between r  of nagk and e  of pii initiates the bending of the extended t loop of pii followed by a second step where a bended t loop deeply inserts into the nagk clefts to form the tight complex
