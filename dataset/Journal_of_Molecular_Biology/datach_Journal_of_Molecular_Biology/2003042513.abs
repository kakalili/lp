structural characterization of a mannose binding protein  trimannoside complex using residual dipolar couplings
the ligand binding properties of a  kda homomultimeric trimer from mannose binding protein mbp have been investigated using residual dipolar couplings rdcs that are easily measured from nmr spectra of the ligand and isotopically labeled protein using a limited set of h   n backbone amide nmr assignments for mbp and orientational information derived from the rdc measurements in aligned media an order tensor for mbp has been determined that is consistent with symmetry based predictions of an axially symmetric system  c  h couplings for a bound trisaccharide ligand methyl   di o   d mannopyranosyl   d mannopyranoside trimannoside have been determined at natural abundance and used as orientational constraints the bound ligand geometry and orientational constraints allowed docking of the trimannoside ligand in the binding site of mbp to produce a structural model for mbp  oligosaccharide interactions
