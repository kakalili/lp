domains  and  interact to form critical elements of the group ii intron active site
group ii introns are self splicing rna molecules that also behave as mobile genetic elements the secondary structure of group ii intron rnas is typically described as a series of six domains that project from a central wheel most structural and mechanistic analyses of the intron have focused on domains  and  which contain the residues essential for catalysis and on domain  which contains the branch point adenosine domains  and  d  d  have been shown to make important contributions to intronic activity however information about their function is quite limited to elucidate the role of d and d in group ii ribozyme catalysis we built a series of multi piece ribozyme constructs based on the ai  group ii intron these constructs are designed to shed light on the roles of d and d in some of the major reactions catalyzed by the intron    exon cleavage branching and substrate hydrolysis reactions with these constructs demonstrate that d stimulates the chemical rate constant of group ii intron reactions and that it behaves as a form of catalytic effector however d is unable to associate independently with the ribozyme core docking of d is mediated by a short duplex that is found at the base of d  in addition to recruiting d into the core the d stem directs the folding of the adjacent j  linker which is among the most conserved elements in the group ii intron active site in turn the d stem contributes to   splice site docking and ribozyme conformational change nucleotide analog interference mapping suggests an interaction between the d stem and d that builds on the known      interaction and extends it into d  these results establish that d and the base of d are key elements of the group ii intron core and they suggest a hierarchy for active site assembly
