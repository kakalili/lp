e coli rna polymerase determinants of open complex lifetime and structure
in transcription initiation by escherichia coli rna polymerase rnap  initial binding to promoter dna triggers large conformational changes bending downstream duplex dna into the rnap cleft and opening  bp to form a short lived open intermediate i  subsequent conformational changes increase lifetimes of  pr and t a open complexes ocs by gt   fold and gt   fold respectively oc lifetime is a target for regulation to characterize late conformational changes we determine effects on oc dissociation kinetics of deletions in rnap mobile elements   region          jaw and    sequence insertion  si  in very stable oc formed by the wild type wt rnap with  pr rpo and by     rnap with  pr or t a  we conclude that downstream duplex dna is bound to the jaw in an assembly with si  and bases   to  of the nontemplate strand discriminator region are stably bound in a positively charged track in the cleft we deduce that polyanionic    destabilizes oc by competing for binding sites in the cleft and on the jaw with the polyanionic discriminator strand and downstream duplex respectively examples of    destabilized oc are the final t a oc and the  pr i intermediate oc deleting    and either    jaw or si equalizes oc lifetimes for  pr and t a  dna closing rates are similar for both promoters and all rnap variants we conclude that late conformational changes that stabilize oc like early ones that bend the duplex into the cleft are primary targets of regulation while the intrinsic dna opening closing step is not
