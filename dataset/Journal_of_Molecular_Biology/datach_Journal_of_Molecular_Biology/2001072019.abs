solution structure of the tumor necrosis factor receptor  death domain edited by p e wright
tumor necrosis factor receptor  death domain tnfr  dd is the intracellular functional domain responsible for the receptor signaling activities the solution structure of the r  k mutant of tnfr  dd was solved by nmr spectroscopy a total of  structures were calculated by means of hybrid distance geometry simulated annealing using a total of   distance constraints and   torsion angle constraints the atomic rms distribution about the mean coordinate positions for the  structures for residues composing the secondary structure region is     for the backbone atoms and     for all atoms the structure consists of six antiparallel  helices arranged in a similar fashion to the other members of the death domain superfamily the secondary structure and three dimensional structure of r  k tnfr dd are very similar to the secondary structure and deduced topology of the r  a tnfr dd mutant mutagenesis studies identified critical residues located in   and part of   and   that are crucial for self interaction and interaction with tradd structural superposition with previously solved proteins in the death domain superfamily reveals that the major differences between the structures reside in      and   interestingly these regions correspond to the binding sites of tnfr dd providing a structural basis for the specificity of death domain interactions and its subsequent signaling event
