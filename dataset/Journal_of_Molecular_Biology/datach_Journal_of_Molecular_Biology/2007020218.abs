structural basis of enhanced binding of extended and helically constrained peptide epitopes of the broadly neutralizing hiv  antibody e
potent broadly hiv  neutralizing antibodies nabs may be invaluable for the design of an aids vaccine  e  is the broadest hiv  nab known to date and recognizes a contiguous and highly conserved helical epitope in the membrane proximal region of gp  the e  epitope is thus an excellent target for vaccine design as it is also highly amenable to peptide engineering to enhance its helical character to investigate the structural effect of both increasing the peptide length and of introducing helix promoting constraints in the e  epitope we have determined crystal structures of fab e  bound to an optimized peptide epitope nwfditnwlwyikkkk nh  an aib constrained peptide epitope nwfditnaiblwrr nh  and a thioether linked peptide nwfcitowlwkkkk nh  to resolutions of          and     respectively the thioether linked peptide is the first reported structure of a cyclic tethered helical peptide bound to an antibody the introduced helix constraints limit the conformational flexibility of the peptides without affecting interactions with e  the substantial increase in affinity   nm versus   nm of the ic  of the original kgnd peptide template is largely realized by e  interaction with an additional helical turn at the peptide c terminus that includes leu  and trp   thus the core e  epitope was extended and modified to a wfx i l t s xx l i w motif where x does not play a major role in e  binding and can be used to introduce helical promoting constraints in the peptide epitope
