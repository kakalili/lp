The functional relevance of respiratory supercomplexes in various eukaryotes including mammals, plants, and fungi is hitherto poorly elucidated. However, substantial evidence indicates as a major role the assembly and/or stabilization of mammalian complex I by supercomplex formation with complexes III and IV. Here, we demonstrate by using native electrophoresis that the long-lived Podospora anserina mutant Cyc1-1, respiring exclusively via the alternative oxidase (AOX), lacks an assembled complex III and possesses complex I partially assembled with complex IV into a supercomplex. This resembles the situation in complex-IV-deficient mutants displaying a corresponding phenotype but possessing Iâ€“III supercomplexes instead, suggesting that either complex III or complex IV is in a redundant manner necessary for assembly/stabilization of complex I as previously shown in mammals. To corroborate this notion, we constructed the double mutant Cyc1-1,Cox5::ble. Surprisingly, this mutant lacking both complexes III and IV is viable and essentially a phenocopy of mutant Cyc1-1 including the reversal of the phenotype towards wild-type-like characteristics by the several-fold overexpression of the AOX in mutant Cyc1-1,Cox5::ble(Gpd-Aox). Fungal specific features (not found in mammals) that must be responsible for assembly/stabilization of fungal complex I when complexes III and IV are absent, such as the presence of the AOX and complex I dimerization, are addressed and discussed. These intriguing results unequivocally prove that complexes III and IV are dispensable for assembly/stability of complex I in fungi contrary to the situation in mammals, thus highlighting the imperative to unravel the biogenesis of complex I as well as the true supramolecular organization of the respiratory chain and its functional significance in a variety of model eukaryotes. In summary, we present the first obligatorily aerobic eukaryote with an artificial, simultaneous lack of the respiratory complexes III and IV.
