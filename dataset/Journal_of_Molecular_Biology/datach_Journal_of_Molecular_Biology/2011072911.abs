functional characterization of human cyclin t n terminal region for human immunodeficiency virus  tat transcriptional activation
transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  requires the interaction of the cyclin t  cyct  subunit of a host cellular factor positive transcription elongation factor b with the viral tat protein at the transactivation response tar element of nascent viral transcripts the involvement of the interaction between tat and cyct is known to be through the tat  tar recognition motif trm on cyct  here we have further characterized this molecular interaction and clarified the role of the cyct n terminal region in tat action we found crucial and distinctive roles of q  q  and f  of human cyct protein in tat mediated transcription by creating various ala substitution mutants of cyct based on its three dimensional structure we confirmed the involvement of these amino acid residues in binding to tat with q  and q  and to a lesser extent with f   by in vitro pull down assay relative transactivation activities of wild type cyct chimeras and mutant derivatives on the hiv  long terminal repeat were determined by luciferase reporter assays whereas cyct q a alone had impaired transcriptional activity the cyct q a  tat chimeric protein retained almost full activity of the wild type cyct  however cyct mutants c  y q a or f  a or their chimeric counterparts had lost the transactivation capacity moreover a triple mutant chimera containing q a q a and f  a mutations completely abolished the transcriptional activity indicating that these amino acid residues are involved through distinct mechanisms these findings provide new insights for the development of anti hiv drugs
