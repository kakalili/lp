the x ray crystal structures of wild type and eq i   mutant cytochrome c oxidases from rhodobacter sphaeroides
the structure of cytochrome c oxidase from rhodobacter sphaeroides has been solved at      anisotropic resolution  this high resolution structure revealed atomic details of a bacterial terminal oxidase including water molecule positions and a potential oxygen pathway which has not been reported in other oxidase structures a comparative study of the wild type and the eq i   mutant enzyme revealed structural rearrangements around e i   that could be crucial for proton transfer in this enzyme in the structure of the mutant enzyme eq i    which cannot transfer protons during oxygen reduction the side chain of q i   does not have the hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of m i   that is seen in the wild type structure furthermore the q i   mutant has a different arrangement of water molecules and residues in the vicinity of the q side chain these differences between the structures could reflect conformational changes that take place upon deprotonation of e i   during turnover of the wild type enzyme which could be part of the proton pumping machinery of the enzyme
