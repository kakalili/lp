structural implications of siglec  mediated sialoglycan recognition
sialic acid sia ig like binding lectins are important mediators of recognition and signaling events among myeloid cells to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying sialic acid ig like lectin siglec functions we determined the crystal structure of the two n terminal extracellular domains of human myeloid cell inhibitory receptor siglec  cd   and its complexes with two sialylated carbohydrates the native structure revealed an unusual conformation of the cc  ligand specificity loop and a unique interdomain disulfide bond the     and     sialyllactose complexed structures showed a conserved sia recognition motif that involves both arg  and a portion of the g strand in the v set domain forming  sheet like hydrogen bonds with the glycerol side chain of the sia only few protein contacts to the subterminal sugars are observed and mediated by the highly variable gg  linker and cc  loop these structural observations in conjunction with surface plasmon resonance binding assays provide mechanistic insights into linkage dependent siglec carbohydrate recognition and suggest that siglec  and other cd  related siglec receptors are more promiscuous in sialoglycan recognition than previously understood
