mechanism of replicative dna polymerase delta pausing and a potential role for dna polymerase kappa in common fragile site replication
common fragile sites cfss are hot spots of chromosomal breakage and cfs breakage models involve perturbations of dna replication here we analyzed the contribution of specific repetitive dna sequence elements within cfss to the inhibition of dna synthesis by replicative and specialized dna polymerases pols  the efficiency of in vitro dna synthesis was quantitated using templates corresponding to regions within fra d and fra b harboring at rich microsatellite and quasi palindrome qp sequences qps were predicted to form stems of      self homology separated by    bases of intervening sequences analysis of dna synthesis progression by human pol  demonstrated significant synthesis perturbation both at a n and ta n repeats in a length dependent manner and at short  lt  base pairs qp sequences dna synthesis by the y family polymerase  was significantly more efficient than pol  through both types of repetitive elements using dna trap experiments we show that pol  pauses within cfs sequences are sites of enzyme dissociation and dissociation was observed in the presence of rfc loaded pcna we propose that enrichment of microsatellite and qp elements at cfs regions contributes to fragility by perturbing replication through multiple mechanisms including replicative pol pausing and dissociation our finding that pol  dissociates at specific cfs sequences is significant since dissociation of the replication machinery and inability to efficiently recover the replication fork can lead to fork collapse and or formation of double strand breaks in vivo our biochemical studies also extend the potential involvement of y family polymerases in cfs maintenance to include polymerase
