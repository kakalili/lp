the haddock  web server user friendly integrative modeling of biomolecular complexes
the prediction of the quaternary structure of biomolecular macromolecules is of paramount importance for fundamental understanding of cellular processes and drug design in the era of integrative structural biology one way of increasing the accuracy of modeling methods used to predict the structure of biomolecular complexes is to include as much experimental or predictive information as possible in the process this has been at the core of our information driven docking approach haddock we present here the updated version   of the haddock portal which offers new features such as support for mixed molecule types additional experimental restraints and improved protocols all of this in a user friendly interface with well over   registered users and     jobs served an increasing fraction of which on grid resources we hope that this timely upgrade will help the community to solve important biological questions and further advance the field the haddock  web server is freely accessible to non profit users at http  haddock science uu nl services haddock
