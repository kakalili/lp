archaeal aif b interacts with eukaryotic translation initiation factors eif  and eif b  implications for aif b function and eif b regulation
translation initiation is down regulated in eukaryotes by phosphorylation of the  subunit of eif  eukaryotic initiation factor   which inhibits its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eif b the n terminal s domain of phosphorylated eif  interacts with a subcomplex of eif b formed by the three regulatory subunits  gcn   gcd  and  gcd  blocking the gdp  gtp exchange activity of the catalytic  subunit of eif b these regulatory subunits have related sequences and have sequences in common with many archaeal proteins some of which are involved in methionine salvage and co fixation our sequence analyses however predicted that members of one phylogenetically distinct and coherent group of these archaeal proteins designated aif bs archaeal initiation factor bs  are functional homologs of the     and  subunits of eif b three of these proteins from different archaea have been shown to bind in vitro to the  subunit of the archaeal aif from the cognate archaeon in one case the aif b protein was shown further to bind to the s domain of the  subunit of yeast eif in vitro and to interact with eif b  gcn in vivo in yeast the aif b  eif  interaction was however independent of eif  phosphorylation mass spectrometry has identified several proteins that co purify with aif b from thermococcus kodakaraensis and these include aif   a sugar phosphate nucleotidyltransferase with sequence similarity to eif b  and several large subunit  s ribosomal proteins based on this evidence that aif b has functions in common with eif b the crystal structure established for an aif b was used to construct a model of the eif b regulatory subcomplex in this model the evolutionarily conserved regions and sites of regulatory mutations in the three eif b subunits in yeast are juxtaposed in one continuous binding surface for phosphorylated eif
