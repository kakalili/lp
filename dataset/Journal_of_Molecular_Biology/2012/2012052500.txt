The 37-kDa/67-kDa laminin receptor [laminin receptor precursor/high-affinity laminin receptor (LRP/LR)] is thought to play a major role in invasion and adhesion, key components of metastatic cancer. Lung cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer are among the top 10 cancer types worldwide. Here, we report that LRP/LR levels on the surface of lung cancer cells, cervical cancer cells, colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells are significantly increased compared to non-tumorigenic fibroblasts. Adhesion of lung cancer cells, cervical cancer cells, colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells to laminin-1 is significantly reduced, employing the anti-LRP/LR-specific antibody IgG1-iS18. Invasion of these cell lines into the Matrigelâ„¢ matrix was significantly impeded with IgG1-iS18. The Pearson's correlation coefficient proves a correlation between LRP/LR cell-surface levels and invasion potential, as well as adhesion and invasion, respectively. Our findings suggest that IgG1-iS18 antibody might act as alternative therapeutic tool for treatment of various metastatic cancer types.
