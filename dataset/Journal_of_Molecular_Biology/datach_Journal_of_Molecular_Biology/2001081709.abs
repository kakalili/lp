crystal structure of ptp sl ptpbr catalytic domain implications for map kinase regulation edited by d rees
protein tyrosine phosphatases ptp sl and ptpbr are isoforms belonging to cytosolic membrane associated and to receptor like ptps rptps  respectively they represent a new family of ptps with a major role in activation and translocation of map kinases specifically the complex formation between ptp sl and erk involves an unusual interaction leading to the phosphorylation of ptp sl by erk at thr  and the inactivating dephosphorylation of erk by ptp sl this interaction is strictly dependent upon a kinase interaction motif kim  residues      situated at the n terminus of the ptp sl catalytic domain we report the first crystal structure of the catalytic domain for a member of this family ptp sl residues      identical with residues      of ptpbr  providing an example of an rptp with single cytoplasmic domain which is monomeric having an unhindered catalytic site in addition to the characteristic ptp core structure ptp sl has an n terminal helix possibly orienting the kim motif upon interaction with the target erk  an unusual residue in the catalytically important wpd loop promotes formation of a hydrophobically and electrostatically stabilised clamp this could induce increased rigidity to the wpd loop and therefore reduced catalytic activity in agreement with our kinetic measurements a docking model based on the ptp sl structure suggests that in the complex with erk  the phosphorylation of ptp sl should be accomplished first the subsequent dephosphorylation of erk seems to be possible only if a conformational rearrangement of the two interacting partners takes place
