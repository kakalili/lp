The developmental regulatory protein σF of Bacillus subtilis, a member of the σ70-family of bacterial RNA polymerase σ factors, is negatively regulated by the anti-σ factor SpoIIAB, which binds to σF, sequestering it in an inactive complex. SpoIIAB binding to σF is strongly stimulated by ATP. Here, we use a combination of gel filtration chromatography, dynamic light-scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation, limited proteolysis with N-terminal sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry, and deletion analysis to probe the SpoIIAB-σF complex. The studies were facilitated by investigating the homologs from Bacillus stearothermophilus as well as co-expression of the proteins in Escherichia coli, allowing purification of large quantities of the in vivo assembled complex. We determined the stoichiometry of the complex to be SpoIIAB2:σ1F. Alone, σF is rapidly degraded by the protease trypsin. In the complex with SpoIIAB, however, σF is remarkably resistant to proteolysis. Analysis of the protease cleavage data indicates the anti-σ binds σF through contacts with mutliple conserved regions of the σ factor, supporting previous findings based on genetic data.
