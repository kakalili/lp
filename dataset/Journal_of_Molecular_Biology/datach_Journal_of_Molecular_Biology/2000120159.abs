relationship between exopolysaccharide production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation in gram negative bacteria edited by m yaniv
the phosphorylation of proteins at tyrosine residues is known to play a key role in the control of numerous fundamental processes in animal systems in contrast the biological significance of protein tyrosine phosphoryl ation in bacteria which has only been recognised recently is still unclear here we have analysed the role in escherichia coli cells of an autophosphorylating protein tyrosine kinase wzc and a phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase wzb by performing knock out experiments on the corresponding genes wzc and wzb and looking at the metabolic consequences induced the results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of wzc as regulated by wzb is directly connected with the production of a particular capsular polysaccharide colanic acid thus when wzc is phosphorylated on tyrosine no colanic acid is synthesised by bacteria but when dephosphorylated by wzb colanic acid is produced this process is rather specific to the pair of proteins wzc wzb indeed a much lesser effect if any on colanic acid synthesis is observed when knock out experiments are performed on another pair of genes etk and etp which also encode respectively a protein tyrosine kinase etk and a phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase etp in e coli in addition the analysis of the phosphorylation reaction at the molecular level reveals differences between gram negative and gram positive bacteria namely in the number of protein components required for this reaction to occur
