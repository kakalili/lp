expect the unexpected or caveat for drug designers multiple structure determinations using aldose reductase crystals treated under varying soaking and co crystallisation conditions
in structure based drug design accurate crystal structure determination of protein  ligand complexes is of utmost importance in order to elucidate the binding characteristics of a putative lead to a given target it is the starting point for further design hypotheses to predict novel leads with improved properties often crystal structure determination is regarded as ultimate proof for ligand binding providing detailed insight into the specific binding mode of the ligand to the protein this widely accepted practise relies on the assumption that the crystal structure of a given protein  ligand complex is unique and independent of the protocol applied to produce the crystals we present two examples indicating that this assumption is not generally given even though the composition of the mother liquid for crystallisation was kept unchanged multiple crystal structure determinations of aldose reductase complexes obtained under varying crystallisation protocols concerning soaking and crystallisation exposure times were performed resulting in a total of  complete data sets and ten refined crystal structures eight in complex with zopolrestat and two complexed with tolrestat in the first example a flip of a peptide bond is observed obviously depending on the crystallisation protocol with respect to soaking and co crystallisation conditions this peptide flip is accompanied by a rupture of an h bond formed to the bound ligand zopolrestat the indicated enhanced local mobility of the complex is in agreement with the results of molecular dynamics simulations as a second example the aldose reductase  tolrestat complex is studied unexpectedly two structures could be obtained one with one and a second with four inhibitor molecules bound to the protein they are located in and near the binding pocket facilitated by crystal packing effects accommodation of the four ligand molecules is accompanied by pronounced shifts concerning two helices interacting with the additional ligands
