cluspro dc dimer classification by the cluspro server for protein  protein docking
cluspro dc https  cluspro bu edu  implements a straightforward approach to the discrimination between crystallographic and biological dimers by docking the two subunits to exhaustively sample the interaction energy landscape if a substantial number of low energy docked poses cluster in a narrow vicinity of the native structure of the dimer then one can assume that there is a well defined free energy well around the native state which makes the interaction stable in contrast if the interaction sites in the docked poses do not form a large enough cluster around the native structure then it is unlikely that the subunits form a stable biological dimer the number of near native structures is used to estimate the probability of a dimer being biological currently the server examines only the stability of a given interface rather than generating all putative quaternary structures as accomplished by pisa or eppic but it complements the information provided by these methods
