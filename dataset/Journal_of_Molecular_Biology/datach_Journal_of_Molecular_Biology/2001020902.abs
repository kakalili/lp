non autonomous mobile elements in the crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus edited by j karn
the genome of the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus p contains at least four types of short sequence elements lacking open reading frames which are similar to eukaryal non autonomous mobile elements the most conserved elements sm      bp and sm       bp  with   sequence identity are present in  and  copies respectively the less conserved elements sm       bp and sm       bp  with      identity occur in  and  copies respectively in total the   sm elements constitute about    of the genome the wide distribution of each class of conserved element throughout the genome and their precise locations indicate that they are mobile direct evidence arises from the presence of sm and sm in only a fraction of genomic copies of a given class of insertion element and within copies of open reading frames that are conserved in sequence sm to sm are likely to be mobilized by transposases encoded by insertion elements isc   isc   isc   and isc   respectively furthermore the occurrence of clusters of interwoven sm and insertion elements in potentially mobile units suggests a mechanism for the transfer of sm elements to other organisms
