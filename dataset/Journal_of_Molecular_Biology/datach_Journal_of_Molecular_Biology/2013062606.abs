thermostabilisation of the serotonin transporter in a cocaine bound conformation
structure determination of mammalian integral membrane proteins is challenging due to their instability upon detergent solubilisation and purification recent successes in the structure determination of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs resulted from the development of gpcr specific protein engineering strategies one of these conformational thermostabilisation could in theory facilitate structure determination of other membrane proteins by improving their tolerance to detergents and locking them in a specific conformation we have therefore used this approach on the cocaine sensitive rat serotonin transporter sert  out of a panel of   point mutants throughout sert   were found to improve its thermostability the most stabilising mutations were combined to make the thermostabilised mutants sah  l a g  a a  l and sah  l  a p  a a  l that were more stable than sert by   c and   c respectively inhibitor binding assays showed that both of the thermostabilised sert mutants bound   i rti    cit with affinity similar to that of the wild type transporter although cocaine bound with increased affinity   to  fold whilst ibogaine imipramine and paroxetine all bound with lower affinity up to  fold  neither sah nor sah was capable of transporting  h serotonin into hek  cell lines stably expressing the mutants although serotonin bound to them with an apparent ki of   m or   m respectively these data combined suggest that sah and sah are thermostabilised in a specific cocaine bound conformation making them promising candidates for crystallisation conformational thermostabilisation is thus equally applicable to membrane proteins that are transporters in addition to those that are gpcrs
