intestinal li cadherin acts as a ca  dependent adhesion switch
cadherins are ca  dependent transmembrane glycoproteins that mediate cell cell adhesion and are important for the structural integrity of epithelia li cadherin and the classical e cadherin are the predominant two cadherins in the intestinal epithelium li cadherin consists of seven extracellular cadherin repeats and a short cytoplasmic part that does not interact with catenins in contrast e cadherin is composed of five cadherin repeats and a large cytoplasmic domain that is linked via catenins to the actin cytoskeleton whereas e cadherin is concentrated in adherens junctions li cadherin is evenly distributed along the lateral contact area of intestinal epithelial cells to investigate if the particular structural properties of li cadherin result in a divergent homotypic adhesion mechanism we analyzed the binding parameters of li cadherin on the single molecule and the cellular level using atomic force microscopy affinity chromatography and laser tweezer experiments homotypic trans interaction of li cadherin exhibits low affinity binding with a short lifetime of only   s interestingly li cadherin binding responds to small changes in extracellular ca  below the physiological plasma concentration with a high degree of cooperativity thus li cadherin might serve as a ca  regulated switch for the adhesive system on basolateral membranes of the intestinal epithelium
