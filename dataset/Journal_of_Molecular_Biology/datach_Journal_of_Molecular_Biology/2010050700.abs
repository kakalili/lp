the effects of phosphomimetic lid mutation on the thermostability of the n terminal domain of mdm
the multidomain e ubiquitin ligase mdm catalyzes p  ubiquitination by a  dual site  docking mechanism whereby mdm binding to at least two distinct peptide motifs on p  promotes ubiquitination one protein  protein interaction occurs between the n terminal hydrophobic pocket of mdm and the transactivation motif of p  and the second interaction occurs between the acidic domain of mdm and a motif in the dna binding domain of p  a flexible n terminal pseudo substrate or  lid  adjacent to the n terminal hydrophobic pocket of mdm has a phosphorylation site and there are distinct models proposed on how the phosphorylated lid could affect mdm function biochemical studies have predicted that phosphomimetic mutation will stabilize the lid on the surface of mdm and will  open  the hydrophobic pocket and stabilize the mdm  p  complex while nmr studies proposed that phosphomimetic mutation  closes  the lid over the mdm pocket and inhibits mdm  p  complex formation to resolve these discrepancies we utilized a quantitative fluorescence based dye binding assay to measure the thermal unfolding of wild type wt   lid and s d n terminal domains of mdm as a function of increasing ligand concentration our data reveal that s d lid mutation increases rather than decreases the thermostability of the n terminal domain of mdm in the absence or in the presence of ligand  lid mutation by contrast increases mdm thermoinstability this is consistent with biochemical data using full length mdm  showing that the s d mutation stabilizes the mdm  p  complex and increases the specific activity of the e ubiquitin ligase function of mdm  these data indicate that phosphomimetic lid mutation results in an  opening   rather than a  closing   of the pocket of mdm and highlight the ability of small intrinsically disordered or unstructured peptide motifs to regulate the specific activity of a protein
