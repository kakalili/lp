long range identification of hepatocyte nuclear factor  foxa high and low affinity binding sites with a chimeric nuclease edited by m yaniv
identifying the complete set of transcription factors that bind the promoter and other regulatory regions of a gene of interest is an essential step in functional genomics we have developed an original assay for the systematic detection of hepatocyte nuclear factor  hnf  binding sites within cloned promoters this assay is based on expression of a recombinant enzyme hnf   fn that is comprised of the rat hnf   dna binding domain and the non specific nuclease domain of the foki restriction enzyme southern analysis of target plasmids with proven hnf  binding sites showed that hnf   fn was able to specifically cut both dna strands in the vicinity of these binding sites whereas mutagenized binding sites were no longer cleaved likewise as yet undescribed hnf  binding sites were detected easily over a distance spanning several thousand bases the functionality of such binding sites was confirmed by electromobility shift assay furthermore the extent of cleavage by hnf   fn at a given binding site was tightly correlated with the affinity of a natural hnf   molecule for this site this novel approach can be extended to other transcription factors for long range identification of functional transcription factor binding sites in genes
