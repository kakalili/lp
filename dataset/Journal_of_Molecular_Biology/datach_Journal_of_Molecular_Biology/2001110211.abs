the role of backbone motions in ligand binding to the c src sh domain edited by p e wright
the src homology  sh  domain of pp c src src plays dual roles in signal transduction through stabilizing the repressed form of the src kinase and through mediating the formation of activated signaling complexes transition of the src sh domain between a variety of binding partners during progression through the cell cycle requires adjustment of a delicate free energy balance although numerous structural and functional studies of sh have provided an in depth understanding of structural determinants for binding the origins of binding energy in sh ligand interactions are not fully understood considering only the protein ligand interface the observed favorable change in standard enthalpy  h     kcal mol and unfavorable change in standard entropy t s     kcal mol upon binding the proline rich ligand rlp  ralpplpry are inconsistent with the predominantly hydrophobic interaction surface to investigate possible origins of ligand binding energy backbone dynamics of free and rlp bound sh were performed via  n nmr relaxation and hydrogen deuterium h h exchange measurements on the ps ns time scale assuming uncorrelated motions ligand binding results in a significant reduction in backbone entropy        kcal mol  binding also suppresses motions on the  s ms time scale which may additionally contribute to an unfavorable change in entropy a large increase in protection from h h exchange is observed upon ligand binding providing evidence for entropy loss due to motions on longer time scales and supporting the notion that stabilization of pre existing conformations within a native state ensemble is a fundamental paradigm for ligand binding observed changes in motion on all three time scales occur at locations both near and remote from the protein ligand interface the propagation of ligand binding interactions across the sh domain has potential consequences in target selection through altering both free energy and geometry in intact src and suggests that looking beyond the protein ligand interface is essential in understanding ligand binding energetics
