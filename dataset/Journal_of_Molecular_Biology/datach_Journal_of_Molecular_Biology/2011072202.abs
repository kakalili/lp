hiv  matrix protein binding to rna
the matrix ma domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  precursor gag prgag protein plays multiple roles in the viral replication cycle one essential role is to target prgag proteins to their lipid raft associated phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate pi   p  assembly sites at the plasma membranes of infected cells in addition to this role several reports have implicated nucleic acid binding properties to retroviral mas evidence indicates that rna binding enhances the binding specificity of ma to pi   p containing membranes and supports a hypothesis in which rna binding to ma acts as a chaperone that protects ma from associating with inappropriate cellular membranes prior to prgag delivery to plasma membrane assembly sites to gain a better understanding of hiv  ma  rna interactions we have analyzed the interaction of hiv ma with rna ligands that were selected previously for their high affinities to ma binding interactions were characterized via bead binding fluorescence anisotropy gel shift and analytical ultracentrifugation methods moreover ma residues that are involved in rna binding were identified from nmr chemical shift data our results indicate that the ma rna and pi   p binding sites overlap and suggest models for gag  membrane and gag  rna interactions and for the hiv assembly pathway
