kinetic control in protein folding for light chain amyloidosis and the differential effects of somatic mutations
light chain amyloidosis is a devastating disease where immunoglobulin light chains form amyloid fibrils resulting in organ dysfunction and death previous studies have shown a direct correlation between the protein thermodynamic stability and the propensity for amyloid formation for some proteins involved in light chain amyloidosis here we investigate the effect of somatic mutations on protein stability and in vitro fibril formation of single and double restorative mutants of the protein al   compared to the wild type germline control protein a scan rate dependence and hysteresis in the thermal unfolding and refolding was observed for all proteins this indicates that the unfolding refolding reaction is kinetically determined with different kinetic constants for unfolding and refolding even though the process remains experimentally reversible our structural analysis of al   and al   delp ains suggests a kinetic coupling of the unfolding refolding process with cis  trans prolyl isomerization our data reveal that the deletion of proline  a al   delp ains  which removes the trans  cis di proline motif present in the patient protein al   results in a dramatic increment in the thermodynamic stability and a significant delay in fibril formation kinetics with respect to al   fibril formation is ph dependent all proteins form fibrils at ph  reactions become slower and more stochastic as the ph increases up to ph  based on these results we propose that in addition to thermodynamic stability kinetic stability possibly influenced by the presence of cis proline  a plays a major role in the al   amyloid fibril formation process
