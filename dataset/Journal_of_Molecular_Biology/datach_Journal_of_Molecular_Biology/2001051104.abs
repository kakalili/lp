the tolc protein of escherichia coli serves as a cell surface receptor for the newly characterized tls bacteriophage edited by b holland
the tolc protein of escherichia coli is implicated in a variety of diverse cellular functions including antibiotic efflux and  hemolysin secretion an incidental role of tolc is to facilitate the entry of the bacteriophage tls and colicin e into the bacterial cell despite the resolution of tolc  s atomic structure the roles of specific residues in its diverse functions are unknown here we describe a genetic strategy for isolating missense tolc mutations that abolish the bacteriophage receptor activity of the tolc protein without influencing its role in antibiotic efflux these spontaneous mutations affected two regions of the tolc protein and included base pair substitutions insertions and deletions comparison of the tolc sequence with those of its homologues revealed two hypervariable stretches that were predicted to represent loops interestingly all but one of the tolc alterations preventing phage binding were located in these two hypervariable regions which are likely to be exposed on the cell surface this was substantiated by the recently solved three dimensional structure of tolc curiously all the phage resistant tolc mutants showed varying degrees of resistance to colicin e  suggesting the involvement of overlapping regions of tolc in colicin e import and phage binding the phage used in this study tls was earlier reported as a strain of u  however we show here that unlike the previously reported lipopolysaccharide specific u phage this phage displays a distinctly different host range and discrete morphological features and in addition to utilizing tolc as receptor it requires the inner core of a lipopolysaccharide
