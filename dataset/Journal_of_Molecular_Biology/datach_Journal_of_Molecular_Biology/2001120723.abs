towards a reliable objective function for multiple sequence alignments edited by j karn
multiple sequence alignment is a fundamental tool in a number of different domains in modern molecular biology including functional and evolutionary studies of a protein family multiple alignments also play an essential role in the new integrated systems for genome annotation and analysis thus the development of new multiple alignment scores and statistics is essential in the spirit of the work dedicated to the evaluation of pairwise sequence alignments for database searching techniques we present here normd a new objective scoring function for multiple sequence alignments normd combines the advantages of the column scoring techniques with the sensitivity of methods incorporating residue similarity scores in addition normd incorporates ab initio sequence information such as the number length and similarity of the sequences to be aligned the sensitivity and reliability of the normd objective function is demonstrated using structural alignments in the scop and balibase databases the normd scores are then applied to the multiple alignments of the complete sequences macs detected by blastp with e value lt   for a set of   hypothetical proteins encoded by the vibrio cholerae genome unrelated or badly aligned sequences were automatically removed from the macs leaving a high quality multiple alignment which could be reliably exploited in a subsequent functional and or structural annotation process after removal of unreliable sequences       of the alignments contained at least one sequence with a functional annotation   of these new matches were supported by significant hits to the interpro domain and motif database
