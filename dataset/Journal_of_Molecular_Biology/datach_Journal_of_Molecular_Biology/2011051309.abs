small angle x ray scattering study of a rex family repressor conformational response to nadh and nad binding in solution
the transcriptional repressor rex is a sensor of the intracellular nadh nad redox state through direct binding of nadh or nad  homodimeric rex protein from thermus aquaticus t rex and bacillus subtilis b rex exists in several different conformations in both organisms rex in complex with nadh has the dna binding domains packed together at the dimer interface whereas in the apo form of b rex the linkers connecting these domains to the core are flexible the crystal structures of the apo forms of b rex and a mutated variant of t rex are radically different we describe the solution structures of b rex in complex with nad or nadh and in its apo form on the basis of small angle x ray scattering saxs measurements this study addresses to what extent the unusual orientation of the dna recognition domains of the crystal structure of apo b rex is due to stabilization by crystal packing low resolution ab initio solution structures were obtained for apo b rex b rex nadh and b rex nad  models giving a more detailed picture of these three solution structures were obtained also by rigid body fitting of the crystallographic domains the saxs data confirm the elongated and flexible nature of apo b rex and the existence of two distinct and more rigid conformations for the complexes with nadh and nad  the models emerging from this study indicate a reaction mechanism for b rex in which the recognition domains are rotated upon binding to nadh
