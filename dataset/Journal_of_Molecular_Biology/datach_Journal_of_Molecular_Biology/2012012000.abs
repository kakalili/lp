facilitated assembly of the preinitiation complex by separated tail and head middle modules of the mediator
mediator is a general coactivator of rna polymerase ii rna pol ii bridging enhancer bound transcriptional factors with rna pol ii mediator is organized in three distinct subcomplexes head middle and tail modules the head and middle modules interact with rna pol ii and the tail module interacts with transcriptional activators deletion of one of the tail subunits sin results in derepression of a subset of genes including flr  by a largely unknown mechanism here we show that derepression of flr transcription in sin  cells occurs by enhanced recruitment of the mediator as well as swi snf and saga complexes the tail and head middle modules of the mediator behave as separate complexes at the induced flr promoter while the tail module remains anchored to the promoter the head middle modules are also found in the coding region the separation of the tail and head middle modules in sin  cells is also supported by the altered stoichiometry of the tail and head middle modules at several tested promoters deletion of another subunit of the tail module med in sin  cells results in significantly decreased transcription of flr  pointing to the importance of the integrity of the separated tail module in derepression all tested genes exhibited increased recruitment of the tail domain however only genes with increased occupancy of the head middle modules also displayed increased transcription the separated tail module thus represents a promiscuous transcriptional factor that binds to many different promoters and is necessary for derepression of flr in sin  cells
