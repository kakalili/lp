mechanism of coenzyme recognition and binding revealed by crystal structure analysis of ferredoxin  nadp reductase complexed with nadp
the flavoenzyme ferredoxin  nadp reductase fnr catalyses the production of nadph in photosynthesis the three dimensional structure of fnr presents two distinct domains one for binding of the fad prosthetic group and the other for nadp binding in spite of extensive experiments and different crystallographic approaches many aspects about how the nadp substrate binds to fnr and how the hydride ion is transferred from fad to nadp remain unclear the structure of an fnr nadp complex from anabaena has been determined by x ray diffraction analysis of the cocrystallised units to    resolution structural perturbation of fnr induced by complex formation produces a narrower cavity in which the   phospho amp and pyrophosphate portions of the nadp are perfectly bound in addition the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety is placed in a new pocket created near the fad cofactor with the ribose being in a tight conformation the crystal structure of this fnr nadp complex obtained by cocrystallisation displays nadp in an unusual conformation and can be considered as an intermediate state in the process of coenzyme recognition and binding structural analysis and comparison with previously reported complexes allow us to postulate a mechanism which would permit efficient hydride transfer to occur besides this structure gives new insights into the postulated formation of the ferredoxin fnr nadp ternary complex by prediction of new intermolecular interactions which could only exist after fnr nadp complex formation finally structural comparison with the members of the broad fnr structural family also provides an explanation for the high specificity exhibited by fnr for nadp h versus nad h
