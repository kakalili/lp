the biochemical requirements of dna polymerase v mediated translesion synthesis revisited
in addition to replicative dna polymerases cells contain specialized dna polymerases involved in processes such as lesion tolerance mutagenesis and immunoglobulin diversity in escherichia coli dna polymerase v pol v  encoded by the umudc locus is involved in translesion synthesis tls and mutagenesis genetic studies have established that mutagenesis requires both umuc and a proteolytic product of umud umud   in addition reca protein and the replication processivity factor the  clamp were genetically found to be essential co factors for mutagenesis here we have reconstituted pol v mediated bypass of three common replication blocking lesions namely the two major uv induced lesions and a guanine adduct formed by a chemical carcinogen g aaf under conditions that fulfil these in vivo requirements two co factors are essential for efficient pol v mediated lesion bypass  i a dna substrate onto which the  clamp is stably loaded and ii an extended single stranded reca atp filament assembled downstream from the lesion site for efficient bypass pol v needs to interact simultaneously with the  clamp and the   tip of the reca filament formation of an extended reca atp filament and stable loading of the  clamp are best achieved on long single stranded circular dna templates in contrast to previously published data the single stranded dna binding protein ssb is not absolutely required for pol v mediated lesion bypass provided atp instead of atp s activates the reca filament further discrepancies with the existing literature are explainable by the use of either inadequate dna substrates or a umuc fusion protein instead of native pol v
