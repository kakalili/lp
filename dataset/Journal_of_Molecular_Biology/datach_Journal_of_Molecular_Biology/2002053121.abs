interactions of protein complexes on supercoiled dna the mechanism of selective synapsis by tn resolvase
looping  interactions of distant sites on dna molecules mediated by dna binding proteins feature in many regulated genetic processes we used plasmids containing up to six res recombination sites for tn resolvase to analyse looping interactions synapsis in this system we observed that in plasmids with four or more res sites certain pairs of sites recombine faster than others the relative rates of recombination depend on the number relative orientation and arrangement of the sites to account for the differences in rate we propose that pairing interactions between resolvase bound res sites are in a state of rapid flux leading to configurations in which the maximum number of sites within each supercoiled substrate molecule are synapsed in a topologically simple arrangement recombination rates reflect the steady state concentrations of these synapse configurations our results are at variance with models for selective synapsis that rely on ordered motions within supercoiled dna   slithering  or  tracking   but are compatible with models that call for reversible synapsis of pairs of sites by random collision followed by formation of an interwound productive synapse
