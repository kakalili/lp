structure of the utrophin actin binding domain bound to f actin reveals binding by an induced fit mechanism edited by m f moody
utrophin is a large ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein homologous to dystrophin the protein disrupted in duchenne muscular dystrophy the association of both proteins with the actin cytoskeleton is functionally important and is mediated by a domain at their n termini conserved in members of the spectrin superfamily including  actinin   spectrin and fimbrin we present the structure of the actin binding domain of utrophin in complex with f actin determined by cryo electron microscopy and helical reconstruction and a pseudo atomic model of the complex generated by docking the crystal structures of the utrophin domain and f actin into the reconstruction in contrast to the model of actin binding proposed for fimbrin the utrophin actin binding domain appears to associate with actin in an extended conformation this conformation places residues that are highly conserved in utrophin and other members of the spectrin superfamily at the utrophin interface with actin confirming the likelihood of this binding orientation this model emphasises the importance of protein flexibility in modeling interactions and presents the fascinating possibility of a diversity of actin binding mechanisms among related proteins
