structure function and dynamics of the dimerization and dna binding domain of oncogenic transcription factor v myc edited by p e wright
the protein product c myc of the protooncogene c myc is a transcriptional regulator playing a key role in cellular growth differentiation and apoptosis deregulated myc genes like the transduced retroviral v myc allele are oncogenic and cause cell transformation the c terminal bhlhzip domain of v myc encompassing protein dimerization helix loop helix leucine zipper and dna contact basic region surfaces was expressed in bacteria as a highly soluble p v myc recombinant protein dissociation constants kd for the heterodimer formed with the recombinant bhlhzip domain of the myc binding partner max p max and for the myc max dna complex were estimated using circular dichroism cd spectroscopy and quantitative electrophoretic mobility shift assay emsa  multi dimensional nmr spectroscopy was used to characterize the solution structural and dynamic properties of the v myc bhlhzip domain significant secondary chemical shifts indicate the presence of two separated  helical regions the c terminal leucine zipper region forms a compact  helix while the n terminal basic region exhibits conformational averaging with substantial  helical content both helices lack stabilizing tertiary side chain interactions and represent exceptional examples for loosely coupled secondary structural segments in a native protein these results and cd thermal denaturation data indicate a monomeric state of the v myc bhlhzip domain the  n relaxation data revealed backbone mobilities which corroborate the existence of a partially folded state and suggest a  beads on a string  motional behaviour of the v myc bhlhzip domain in solution the preformation of  helical regions was confirmed by cd thermal denaturation studies and quantification of the entropy changes caused by the hydrophobic effect and the reduction of conformational entropy upon protein dimerization the restricted conformational space of the v myc bhlhzip domain reduces the entropy penalty associated with heterodimerization and allows rapid and accurate recognition by the authentic myc binding partner max
