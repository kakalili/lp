structures of five antibiotics bound at the peptidyl transferase center of the large ribosomal subunit
structures of anisomycin chloramphenicol sparsomycin blasticidin s and virginiamycin m bound to the large ribosomal subunit of haloarcula marismortui have been determined at    resolution most of these antibiotics bind to sites that overlap those of either peptidyl trna or aminoacyl trna consistent with their functioning as competitive inhibitors of peptide bond formation two hydrophobic crevices one at the peptidyl transferase center and the other at the entrance to the peptide exit tunnel play roles in binding these antibiotics midway between these crevices nucleotide a   of h marismortui    escherichia coli varies in its conformation and thereby contacts antibiotics bound at either crevice the aromatic ring of anisomycin binds to the active site hydrophobic crevice as does the aromatic ring of puromycin while the aromatic ring of chloramphenicol binds to the exit tunnel hydrophobic crevice sparsomycin contacts primarily a p site bound substrate but also extends into the active site hydrophobic crevice virginiamycin m occupies portions of both the a and p site and induces a conformational change in the ribosome blasticidin s base pairs with the p loop and thereby mimics c  and c  of a p site bound trna
