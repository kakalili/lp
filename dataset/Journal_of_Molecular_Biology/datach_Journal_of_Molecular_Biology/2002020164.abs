atomic resolution structures of oxidized  fe s ferredoxin from bacillus thermoproteolyticus in two crystal forms systematic distortion of  fe s cluster in the protein edited by d rees
diffraction data of two crystal forms forms i and ii of  fe s ferredoxin from bacillus thermoproteolyticus have been collected to     and     resolutions respectively at   k using synchrotron radiation anisotropic temperature factors were introduced for all non hydrogen atoms in the refinement with shelx   in which stereochemical restraints were applied to the protein chain but not to the  fe s cluster the final crystallographic r factors are    for        resolution data of the form i and    for the        resolution data of the form ii many hydrogen atoms as well as multiple conformations for several side chains have been identified the present refinement has revised the conformations of several peptide bonds and side chains assigned previously at    resolution the largest correction was that the main chain of pro and the side chain of lys were changed by rotating the c  c bond of lys  although the overall structures in the two crystal forms are very similar conformational differences are observed in the two residues at the middle glu  and asp  and the c terminal residues which have large temperature factors the  fe s cluster is a distorted cube with non planar rhombic faces slight but significant compression of the four fe s bonds along one direction is observed in both crystal forms and results in the d d symmetry of the cluster the compressed direction of the cluster relative to the protein is conserved in the two crystal forms and consistent with that in one of the clusters in clostridium acidurici ferredoxin
