differential receptor subunit affinities of type i interferons govern differential signal activation
type i interferons ifns elicit antiviral antiproliferative and immunmodulatory responses by binding to a shared cell surface receptor comprising the transmembrane proteins ifnar and ifnar  activation of differential response patterns by ifns has been observed suggesting that members of the family play different roles in innate immunity the molecular basis for differential signaling has not been identified yet here we have investigated the recognition of various ifns including several human ifn  species human ifn  and human ifn  as well as ovine ifn  by the receptor subunits in detail binding to the extracellular domains of ifnar  ifnar ec and ifnar  ifnar ec was monitored in real time by reflectance interference and total internal reflection fluorescence spectroscopy for all ifns investigated competitive   interaction not only with ifnar ec but also with ifnar ec was shown furthermore ternary complex formation was studied with ifnar ec and ifnar ec tethered onto solid supported membranes these analyses confirmed that the signaling complexes recruited by ifns have very similar architectures however differences in rate and affinity constants over several orders of magnitude were observed for both the interactions with ifnar ec and ifnar ec these data were correlated with the potencies of isgf activation antiviral and anti proliferative activity on ftgh cells the isgf formation and antiviral activity correlated very well with the binding affinity towards ifnar  in contrast the affinity towards ifnar played a key role for antiproliferative activity a striking correlation was observed for relative binding affinities towards ifnar and ifnar with the differential antiproliferative potency this correlation was confirmed by systematically engineering ifn  mutants with very high differential antiproliferative potency
