Association of the 30 S initiation complex (30SIC) and the 50 S ribosomal subunit, leading to formation of the 70 S initiation complex (70SIC), is a critical step of the translation initiation pathway. The 70SIC contains initiator tRNA, fMet-tRNAfMet, bound in the P (peptidyl)-site in response to the AUG start codon. We have formulated a quantitative kinetic scheme for the formation of an active 70SIC from 30SIC and 50 S subunits on the basis of parallel rapid kinetics measurements of GTP hydrolysis, Pi release, light-scattering, and changes in fluorescence intensities of fluorophore-labeled IF2 and fMet-tRNAfMet. According to this scheme, an initially formed labile 70 S complex, which promotes rapid IF2-dependent GTP hydrolysis, either dissociates reversibly into 30 S and 50 S subunits or is converted to a more stable form, leading to 70SIC formation. The latter process takes place with intervening conformational changes of ribosome-bound IF2 and fMet-tRNAfMet, which are monitored by spectral changes of fluorescent derivatives of IF2 and fMet-tRNAfMet. The availability of such a scheme provides a useful framework for precisely elucidating the mechanisms by which substituting the non-hydrolyzable analog GDPCP for GTP or adding thiostrepton inhibit formation of a productive 70SIC. GDPCP does not affect stable 70 S formation, but perturbs fMet-tRNAfMet positioning in the P-site. In contrast, thiostrepton severely retards stable 70 S formation, but allows normal binding of fMet-tRNAfMet(prf20) to the P-site.
