multiple barriers to recombination between divergent hiv  variants revealed by a dual marker recombination assay
recombination is a major force for generating human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  diversity and produces numerous recombinants circulating in the human population we previously established a cell based system using green fluorescent protein gene gfp as a reporter to study the mechanisms of hiv  recombination we now report an improved system capable of detecting recombination using authentic viral sequences frameshift mutations were introduced into the gag gene so that parental viruses do not express full length gag however recombination can generate a progeny virus that expresses a functional gag we demonstrate that this gag reconstitution assay can be used to detect recombination between two group m hiv  variants of the same or of different subtypes using both gfp and gag assays we found that similar to group m viruses group o viruses also recombine frequently when recombination between a group m virus and a group o virus was examined we found three distinct barriers for intergroup recombination first similar to recombination within group m viruses intergroup recombination is affected by the identity of the dimerization initiation signal dis  variants with the same dis recombined at a higher rate than those with different dis second using the gfp recombination assay we showed that intergroup recombination occurs much less frequently than intragroup recombination even though the gfp target sequence is identical in all viruses finally gag reconstitution between variants from different groups is further reduced compared with green fluorescent protein indicating that sequence divergence interferes with recombination efficiency in the gag gene compared with identical sequences we estimate that recombination rates are reduced by  fold and by   to  fold when the target regions in gag contain   and     sequence identities respectively these results show that there are at least three distinct mechanisms preventing exchange of genetic information between divergent hiv  variants from different groups
