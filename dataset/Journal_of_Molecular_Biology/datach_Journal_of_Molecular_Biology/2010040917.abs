structure of bacteriophage t endonuclease ii mutant e  a a tetrameric giy yig enzyme
coliphage t endonuclease ii endoii  encoded by gene dena is a small   kda    aa enzyme belonging to the giy yig family of endonucleases which lacks a c terminal domain corresponding to that providing most of the binding energy in the structurally characterized giy yig endonucleases i tevi and uvrc in vivo it is involved in degradation of host dna permitting scavenging of host derived nucleotides for phage dna synthesis endoii primarily catalyzes single stranded nicking of dna   to  fold less frequently double stranded breaks are produced the glu  ala mutant of endoii was crystallized in space group p  with four monomers in the asymmetric unit the fold of the endoii monomer is similar to that of the catalytic domains of uvrc and i tevi in contrast to these enzymes endoii forms a striking x shaped tetrameric structure composed as a dimer of dimers with a protruding hairpin domain not present in uvrc or i tevi providing most of the dimerization and tetramerization interfaces a bound phosphate ion in one of the four active sites of endoii likely mimics the scissile phosphate in a true substrate complex in silico docking experiments showed that a protruding loop containing a nuclease associated modular domain  element is likely to be involved in substrate binding as well as residues forming a separate nucleic acid binding surface adjacent to the active site the positioning of these sites within the endoii primary dimer suggests that the substrate would bind to a primary endoii dimer diagonally over the active sites requiring significant distortion of the enzyme or the substrate dna or both for simultaneous nicking of both dna strands the scarcity of potential nucleic acid binding residues between the active sites indicates that endoii may bind its substrate inefficiently across the two sites in the dimer offering a plausible explanation for the catalytic preponderance of single strand nicks mutations analyzed in earlier functional studies are discussed in their structural context
