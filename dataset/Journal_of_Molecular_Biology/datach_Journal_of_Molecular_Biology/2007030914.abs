a tightly packed hydrophobic cluster directs the formation of an off pathway sub millisecond folding intermediate in the  subunit of tryptophan synthase a tim barrel protein
protein misfolding is now recognized as playing a crucial role in both normal and pathogenic folding reactions an interesting example of misfolding at the earliest state of a natural folding reaction is provided by the  subunit of tryptophan synthase a     tim barrel protein the molecular basis for the formation of this off pathway misfolded intermediate ibp and a subsequent on pathway intermediate i  was probed by mutational analysis of  branched aliphatic side chains distributed throughout the sequence the elimination of ibp and the substantial destabilization of i by replacement of a selective set of the isoleucine leucine or valine residues ilv with alanine in a large ilv cluster external to the barrel and spanning the n and c termini cluster  implies tight packing at most sites in both intermediates differential effects on ibp and i for replacements in     and   at the boundaries of cluster  suggest that their incorporation into i but not ibp reflects non native folds at the edges of the crucial         core in ibp the retention of ibp and the smaller and consistent destabilization of both ibp and i by similar replacements in an internal to the barrel ilv cluster cluster  and a second external to the barrel ilv cluster cluster  imply molten globule like packing the tight packing inferred in part for ibp or for all of i in cluster  but not in clusters  and  may reflect the larger size of cluster  and or the enhanced number of isoleucine leucine and valine self contacts in and between contiguous elements of secondary structure tightly packed ilv dominated hydrophobic clusters could serve as an important driving force for the earliest events in the folding and misfolding of the tim barrel and other members of the    n class of proteins
