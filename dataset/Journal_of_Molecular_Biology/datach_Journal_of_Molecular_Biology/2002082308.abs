crystallographic structure of the retinal and the protein after deprotonation of the schiff base the switch in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle
we illuminated bacteriorhodopsin crystals at  k to produce in a photostationary state with   occupancy the earliest m intermediate m  of the photocycle the crystal structure of this state was then determined from x ray diffraction to    resolution when the refined model is placed after the recently determined structure for the k intermediate but before the reported structures for two later m states a sequence of structural changes becomes evident in which movements of protein atoms and bound water are coordinated with relaxation of the initially strained photoisomerized  cis  anti retinal in the k state only retinal atoms are displaced but in m water   moves also nearly   away from the unprotonated retinal schiff base nitrogen this breaks the hydrogen bond that bridges them and initiates rearrangements of the hydrogen bonded network of the extracellular region that develop more fully in the intermediates that follow in the m to m transition relaxation of the c   c  and c   nz torsion angles to near    reorients the retinylidene nitrogen atom from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic direction water   becomes undetectable and the side chain of arg  is displaced strongly toward glu  and glu   finally in the m to m   transition correlated with release of a proton to the extracellular surface the retinal assumes a virtually fully relaxed bent shape and the  methyl group thrusts against the indole ring of trp  which tilts in the cytoplasmic direction comparison of the structures of m and m reveals the principal switch in the photocycle the change of the angle of the c   nz  ce plane breaks the connection of the unprotonated schiff base to the extracellular side and establishes its connection to the cytoplasmic side
