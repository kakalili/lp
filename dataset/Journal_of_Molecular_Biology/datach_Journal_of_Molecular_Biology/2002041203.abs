transthyretin fibrillogenesis entails the assembly of monomers a molecular model for in vitro assembled transthyretin amyloid like fibrils edited by m moody
extracellular accumulation of transthyretin ttr variants in the form of fibrillar amyloid deposits is the pathological hallmark of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy fap  the ttr leu pro variant occurs in the most aggressive forms of this disease inhibition of ttr wild type wt and particularly ttr leu pro fibril formation is of interest as a potential therapeutic strategy and requires a thorough understanding of the fibril assembly mechanism to this end we report on the in vitro assembly properties as observed by transmission electron microscopy tem  atomic force microscopy afm and quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy stem for both ttr wt fibrils produced by acidification and ttr leu pro fibrils assembled at physiological ph the morphological features and dimensions of ttr wt and ttr leu pro fibrils were similar with up to   nm long  nm wide fibrils being the most prominent species in both cases other species were evident    nm wide fibrils     nm wide fibrils and oligomers of various sizes stem mass per length mpl measurements revealed discrete fibril types with masses of   and       kda nm for ttr wt fibrils and      and       kda nm for ttr leu pro fibrils these mpl values are consistent with a model in which fibrillar ttr structures are composed of two three four or five elementary protofilaments with each protofilament being a vertical stack of structurally modified ttr monomers assembled with the   nm axial monomer monomer spacing indicated by x ray fibre diffraction data ex vivo ttr amyloid fibrils were examined from their morphological appearance compared to these the in vitro assembled ttr wt and leu pro fibrils examined may represent immature fibrillar species the in vitro system operating at physiological ph for ttr leu pro and the model presented for the molecular arrangement of ttr monomers within fibrils may therefore describe early fibril assembly events in vivo
