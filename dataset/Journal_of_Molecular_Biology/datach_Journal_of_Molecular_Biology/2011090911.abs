two dimensional kinetics of inter connexin interactions from single molecule force spectroscopy
gap junction channels are intercellular channels that form by docking the extracellular loops of connexin protein subunits while the structure and function of gap junctions as intercellular channels have been characterized using different techniques the physics of the inter connexin interaction remain unknown moreover as far as we know the capacity of gap junction channels to work as adhesion complexes supporting pulling forces has not yet been quantitatively addressed we report the first quantitative characterization of the kinetics and binding strength of the interaction of a short peptide mimicking extracellular loop  of cx  with membrane reconstituted cx  combining the imaging and force spectroscopy capabilities of atomic force microscopy the fast dissociation rate inferred a dynamic bond while the slow association rate reflected the reduced flexibility and small size of extracellular loops our results propose the gap junction channel as an adhesion complex that associates slowly and dissociates fast at low force but is able to support important pulling forces in its native hexameric form
