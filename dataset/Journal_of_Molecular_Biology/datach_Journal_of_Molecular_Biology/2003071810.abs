multiple interactions within the hepatitis c virus rna polymerase repress primer dependent rna synthesis
the hepatitis c virus hcv rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp initiates rna synthesis in vivo by a de novo mechanism in vitro however the hcv rdrp can initiate de novo or extend from a primed template a novel  loop near the rdrp active site was previously found to prevent the use of primed templates we found that in addition to the  loop the c terminal tail of the hcv rdrp and the de novo initiation gtp are required to exclude the use of primed templates gtp binding to the ntpi site of the hcv rdrp orchestrates the participation of other structures the interactions of the  loop c terminal tail and gtp provide an elegant solution to ensure de novo initiation of hcv rna synthesis
