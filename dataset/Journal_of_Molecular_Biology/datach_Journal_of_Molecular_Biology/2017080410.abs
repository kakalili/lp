transcriptional signatures of aging
genome wide studies of aging have identified subsets of genes that show age related changes in expression although the types of genes that are age regulated vary among different tissues and organisms some patterns emerge from these large data sets first aging is associated with a broad induction of stress response pathways although the specific genes and pathways involved differ depending on cell type and species in contrast a wide variety of functional classes of genes are downregulated with age often including tissue specific genes although the upregulation of age regulated genes is likely to be governed by stress responsive transcription factors questions remain as to why particular genes are susceptible to age related transcriptional decline here we discuss recent findings showing that splicing is misregulated with age while defects in splicing could lead to changes in protein isoform levels they could also impact gene expression through nonsense mediated decay of intron retained transcripts the discovery that splicing is misregulated with age suggests that other aspects of gene expression such as transcription elongation termination and polyadenylation must also be considered as potential mechanisms for age related changes in transcript levels moreover the considerable variation between genome wide aging expression studies indicates that there is a critical need to analyze the transcriptional signatures of aging in single cell types rather than whole tissues since age associated decreases in gene expression could contribute to a progressive decline in cellular function understanding the mechanisms that determine the aging transcriptome provides a potential target to extend healthy cellular lifespan
