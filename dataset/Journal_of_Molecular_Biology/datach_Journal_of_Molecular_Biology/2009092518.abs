the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin forms functional octameric complexes
the assembly of bacterial toxins and virulence factors is critical to their function but the regulation of assembly during infection has not been studied we begin to address this question using anthrax toxin as a model the protective antigen pa component of the toxin assembles into ring shaped homooligomers that bind the two other enzyme components of the toxin lethal factor lf and edema factor ef  to form toxic complexes to disrupt the host these toxic complexes are endocytosed such that the pa oligomer forms a membrane spanning channel that lf and ef translocate through to enter the cytosol using single channel electrophysiology we show that pa channels contain two populations of conductance states which correspond to two different pa pre channel oligomers observed by electron microscopy  the well described heptamer and a novel octamer mass spectrometry demonstrates that the pa octamer binds four lfs and assembly routes leading to the octamer are populated with even numbered dimeric and tetrameric pa intermediates both heptameric and octameric pa complexes can translocate lf and ef with similar rates and efficiencies here we report a    crystal structure of the pa octamer the octamer comprises       of the oligomers on cells but outside of the cell the octamer is more stable than the heptamer under physiological ph thus the pa octamer is a physiological stable and active assembly state capable of forming lethal toxins that may withstand the hostile conditions encountered in the bloodstream this assembly mechanism may provide a novel means to control cytotoxicity
