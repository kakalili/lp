protein family and fold occurrence in genomes power law behaviour and evolutionary model edited by j thornton
global surveys of genomes measure the usage of essential molecular parts defined here as protein families superfamilies or folds in different organisms based on surveys of the first  completely sequenced genomes we observe that the occurrence of these parts follows a power law distribution that is the number of distinct parts f with a given genomic occurrence v decays as f  av  b with a few parts occurring many times and most occurring infrequently for a given organism the distributions of families superfamilies and folds are nearly identical and this is reflected in the size of the decay exponent b moreover the exponent varies between different organisms with those of smaller genomes displaying a steeper decay i e larger b  clearly the power law indicates a preference to duplicate genes that encode for molecular parts which are already common here we present a minimal but biologically meaningful model that accurately describes the observed power law although the model performs equally well for all three protein classes we focus on the occurrence of folds in preference to families and superfamilies this is because folds are comparatively insensitive to the effects of point mutations that can cause a family member to diverge beyond detectable similarity in the model genomes evolve through two basic operations  i duplication of existing genes  ii net flow of new genes the flow term is closely related to the exponent b and can accommodate considerable gene loss however we demonstrate that the observed data is reproduced best with a net inflow i e with more gene gain than loss moreover we show that prokaryotes have much higher rates of gene acquisition than eukaryotes probably reflecting lateral transfer a further natural outcome from our model is an estimation of the fold composition of the initial genome which potentially relates to the common ancestor for modern organisms supplementary material pertaining to this work is available from www partslist org powerlaw
