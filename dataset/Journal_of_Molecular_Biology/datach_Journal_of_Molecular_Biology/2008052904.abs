polar peritrichous and lateral flagella belong to three distinguishable flagellar families
the bacterial flagellum transforms its shape into several distinguishable helical shapes polymorphs under various environmental conditions polymorphs of each type of flagellum stay on a circle in the pitch diameter p versus  d plot indicating that they all belong to one family previously we showed that the flagellar family of a marine bacterium idiomarina loihiensis family ii differed from the conventional flagellar family of salmonella typhimurium family i  the pitch and diameter of family ii flagella are half those of family i flagella we have suggested that family i encompasses peritrichous flagella while family ii forms a polar flagellum in this study we have surveyed the polymorphs of flagella from  other species and categorized their family types previous observations were confirmed family i form peritrichous flagella and family ii form polar flagella furthermore we found that lateral flagella had helical parameters much smaller than those of the other two families and thus belong to a new family family iii
