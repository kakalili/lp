unc  encodes a tropomodulin in caenorhabditis elegans
unc  is one of about  genes in caenorhabditis elegans that when mutant displays an abnormal muscle phenotype two mutant alleles of unc   su  and sf  show reduced motility and brood size and disorganization of muscle structure in unc  mutants immunofluorescence microscopy shows that a number of known sarcomeric proteins are abnormal but the most dramatic effect is in the localization of f actin with some abnormally accumulated near muscle cell to cell boundaries electron microscopy shows that unc  sf  mutants have large accumulations of thin filaments near the boundaries of adjacent muscle cells multiple lines of evidence prove that unc  encodes a tropomodulin a conserved protein known from other systems to bind to both actin and tropomyosin at the pointed ends of actin thin filaments su  is a splice site mutation in intron  which is specific to one of the two unc  isoforms isoform a sf  has a stop codon in exon  which is shared by both isoform a and isoform b the use of promoter green fluorescent protein constructs in transgenic animals revealed that unc  a is expressed in body wall vulval and uterine muscles whereas unc  b is expressed in pharyngeal anal depressor vulval and uterine muscles and in spermatheca and intestinal epithelial cells by western blot anti unc  antibodies detect polypeptides of expected size from wild type wild type sized proteins of reduced abundance from unc  su   and no detectable unc  products from unc  sf   using these same antibodies unc  localizes as two closely spaced parallel lines flanking the m lines consistent with localization to the pointed ends of thin filaments in addition unc  is localized near muscle cell to cell boundaries
