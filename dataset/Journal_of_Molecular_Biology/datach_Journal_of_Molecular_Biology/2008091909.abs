ligand binding mode of gabaa receptor associated protein
the  aminobutyric acid type a gabaa receptor associated protein is a versatile adaptor protein playing an important role in intracellular vesicle trafficking particularly in neuronal cells we present the x ray structure of the soluble form of human gabaa receptor associated protein complexed with a high affinity synthetic peptide at     resolution the data shed light on the probable binding modes of key interaction partners including the gabaa receptor and the cysteine protease atg  the resulting models provide a structural background for further investigation of the unique biological properties of this protein
