molecular basis for the glycosphingolipid binding specificity of  synuclein key role of tyrosine  in membrane insertion
cell surface glycosphingolipids gsls including gangliosides play a key role in the regulation of the conformation oligomerization and fibrillation of amyloidogenic proteins correspondingly most amyloidogenic proteins possess a functional gsl binding motif gbm  sequence alignments of gsl binding proteins against the gbm of  synuclein allowed the establishment of a consensus gbm sequence defined as k h r x    y f x    k h r where at least one of the x    residues is glycine the gbms of  synuclein   kegvlyvgsktk   and alzheimer s disease  amyloid peptide a    rhdsgyevhhqk   consist of a structurally related loop centered on tyrosine y  for  synuclein y  for a   surface pressure measurements of gsl monolayers at the air  water interface allowed us to determine the following order for  synuclein  gsl interactions gm gt gb gt galcer nfa gt gm gt sulfatide gt galcer hfa gt laccer gt gm gt gm gt asialo gm gt gd  indicating a marked preference for gsls with one three or five sugar units the insertion of  synuclein into sphingomyelin containing monolayers was strongly stimulated by the presence of gm  this effect was not observed with phosphatidylcholine monolayers suggesting that the ganglioside facilitated the insertion of  synuclein into raft like membrane domains molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the side chain of y  was deeply inserted between gm head groups monolayer experiments with mutant gbm peptides showed that y  k  and k  were important for gm binding whereas only y  appeared critical for gm recognition the interaction of a     with gm involved r  h  h  and k  but not y  these data indicate that subtle amino acid variations in the consensus gbm of  synuclein and a  conferred distinct gsl binding properties
