evidence for bidentate substrate binding as the basis for the k  linkage specificity of otubain
otubain  belongs to the ovarian tumor otu domain class of cysteine protease deubiquitinating enzymes we show here that human otubain  hotu  is highly linkage specific cleaving lys  k  linked polyubiquitin but not k   k   k  or k  linked polyubiquitin or linear  linked polyubiquitin cleavage is not limited to either end of a polyubiquitin chain and both free and substrate linked polyubiquitin are disassembled intriguingly cleavage of k  diubiquitin by hotu can be inhibited by diubiquitins of various linkage types as well as by monoubiquitin nmr studies and activity assays suggest that both the proximal and distal units of k  diubiquitin bind to hotu  reaction of cys  with ubiquitin vinylsulfone identified a ubiquitin binding site that is distinct from the active site which includes cys  occupancy of the active site is needed to enable tight binding to the second site we propose that distinct binding sites for the ubiquitins on either side of the scissile bond allow hotu to discriminate among different isopeptide linkages in polyubiquitin substrates bidentate binding may be a general strategy used to achieve linkage specific deubiquitination
