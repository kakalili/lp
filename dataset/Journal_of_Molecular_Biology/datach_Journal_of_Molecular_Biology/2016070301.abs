pot  tpp binding and unfolding of telomere dna discriminates against structural polymorphism
telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that reside at the ends of linear chromosomes and help maintain genomic integrity protection of telomeres  pot  and tpp are telomere specific proteins that bind as a heterodimer to single stranded telomere dna to prevent illicit dna damage responses and to enhance telomerase mediated telomere extension telomere dna is guanosine rich and as such can form highly stable secondary structures including g quadruplexes g quadruplex dna folds into different topologies that are determined by several factors including monovalent ion composition and the precise sequence and length of the dna here we explore the influence of dna secondary structure on pot  tpp binding equilibrium binding assays reveal that the pot  tpp complex binds g quadruplex structures formed in buffers containing na with an affinity that is fivefold higher than for g quadruplex structures formed in the presence of k  however the binding of the second heterodimer is insensitive to dna secondary structure presumably due to unfolding resulting from binding of the first pot  tpp  we further show that the rate constant for pot  tpp induced unfolding of dna secondary structure is substantially faster for g quadruplex topologies formed in the presence of na ions when bound to dna pot  tpp forms complexes with similar cd spectra and enhances telomerase activity for all dna substrates tested regardless of the substrate secondary structure or solution monovalent ion composition together these data indicate that binding of pot  tpp unfolds telomere secondary structure to assist loading of additional heterodimers and to ensure efficient promotion of telomerase mediated extension
