the highly refined solution structure of the cytotoxic ribonuclease  sarcin reveals the structural requirements for substrate recognition and ribonucleolytic activity edited by m f summers
sarcin selectively cleaves a single phosphodiester bond in a universally conserved sequence of the major rrna that inactivates the ribosome the elucidation of the three dimensional solution structure of this   residue enzyme is a crucial step towards understanding  sarcin  s conformational stability ribonucleolytic activity and its exceptionally high level of specificity here the solution structure has been determined on the basis of   conformationally relevant distances restraints including stereoespecific assignments and   torsional angular restraints by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods a total of  converged structures have been computed using the program dyana the  best dyana structures following restrained energy minimization by gromos represent the solution structure of  sarcin the resulting average pairwise root mean square deviation is     for backbone atoms and     for all heavy atoms when the more variable regions are excluded from the analysis the pairwise root mean square deviation drops to     and     for backbone and heavy atoms respectively the  sarcin structure is similar to that reported for restrictocin although some differences are clearly evident especially in the loop regions the average rmsd between the structurally aligned backbones of the  final  sarcin structures and the crystal structure of restrictocin is     on the basis of a docking model constructed with  sarcin solution structure and the crystal structure of a  nt rna containing the sarcin ricin domain the regions in the protein that could interact specifically with the substrate have been identified the structural elements that account for the specificity of rna recognition are located in two separate regions of the protein one is composed by residues  to  and loop  and the other region located more than    away in the structure is the positively charged segment formed by residues   to
