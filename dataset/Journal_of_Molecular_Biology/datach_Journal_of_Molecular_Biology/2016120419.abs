death receptor  networks require membrane cholesterol for proper structure and function
death receptor  dr  is an apoptosis inducing member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily whose activity has been linked to membrane cholesterol content upon ligand binding dr forms large clusters within the plasma membrane that have often been assumed to be manifestations of receptor co localization in cholesterol rich membrane domains however we have recently shown that dr clusters are more than just randomly aggregated receptors instead these are highly structured networks held together by receptor dimers these dimers are stabilized by specific transmembrane helix  helix interactions including a disulfide bond in the long isoform of the receptor the complex relationships among dr network formation transmembrane helix dimerization membrane cholesterol and receptor activity has not been established it is unknown whether the membrane itself plays an active role in driving dr transmembrane helix interactions or in the formation of the networks we show that cholesterol depletion in cells does not inhibit the formation of dr networks however the networks that form in cholesterol depleted cells fail to induce caspase cleavage these results suggest a potential structural difference between active and inactive networks as evidence we show that cholesterol is necessary for the covalent dimerization of dr transmembrane domains molecular simulations and experiments in synthetic vesicles on the dr transmembrane dimer suggest that dimerization is facilitated by increased helicity in a thicker bilayer
