unprecedented abundance of protein tyrosine phosphorylation modulates shigella flexneri virulence
evidence is accumulating that protein tyrosine phosphorylation plays a crucial role in the ability of important human bacterial pathogens to cause disease while most works have concentrated on its role in the regulation of a major bacterial virulence factor the polysaccharide capsule recent studies have suggested a much broader role for this post translational modification this prompted us to investigate protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the human pathogen shigella flexneri we first completed a tyrosine phosphoproteome identifying   unique tyrosine phosphorylation sites on at least   proteins approximately   of all proteins  this is the most tyrosine phosphorylated sites and proteins in a single bacterium identified to date substantially more than the level seen in eukaryotic cells most had not previously been identified and included proteins encoded by the virulence plasmid which is essential for s flexneri to invade cells and cause disease in order to investigate the function of these phosphorylation sites in important virulence factors phosphomimetic and ablative mutations were constructed in the type  secretion system atpase spa  and the master virulence regulator virb this revealed that tyrosine residues phosphorylated in our study are critical for spa  and virb activity and tyrosine phosphorylation likely regulates their functional activity and subsequently the virulence of this major human pathogen this study suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a critical role in regulating a wide variety of virulence factors in the human pathogen s flexneri and serves as a base for future studies defining its complete role
