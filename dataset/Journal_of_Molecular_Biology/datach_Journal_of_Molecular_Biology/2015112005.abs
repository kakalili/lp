brainless but multi headed decision making by the acellular slime mould physarum polycephalum
because of its peculiar biology and the ease with which it can be cultured the acellular slime mould physarum polycephalum has long been a model organism in a range of disciplines due to its macroscopic syncytial nature it is no surprise that it has been a favourite amongst cell biologists its inclusion in the experimental tool kit of behavioural ecologists is much more recent these recent studies have certainly paid off they have shown that for an organism that lacks a brain or central nervous system p polycephalum shows rather complex behaviour for example it is capable of finding the shortest path through a maze it can construct networks as efficient as those designed by humans it can solve computationally difficult puzzles it makes multi objective foraging decisions it balances its nutrient intake and it even behaves irrationally are the slime mould s achievements simply  cute   worthy of mentioning in passing but nothing to take too seriously or do they hint at the fundamental processes underlying all decision making we will address this question after reviewing the decision making abilities of the slime mould
