existence of multiple isoforms of hs associated protein x  in murine and human tissues
to date the literature concerning the hs  haematopoietic cell specific protein  associated protein x  hax  protein has reported considerable variation regarding its function in mammalian cells subcellular localisation and binding partners we show here that hax comprises a family of proteins murine tissues express three mrna variants encoded by two genes on chromosomes  and  the chromosome  gene is intronless and would encode a protein   identical with that encoded by chromosome  in humans alternative splice variants encoded by the chromosome  gene produce a family of transcripts composed of up to eight members based on the sequences published in genbank and ensembl we designed specific primers and detected by pcr three mrna species in murine tissues and eight variants in human cells we screened a panel of  human cell lines as well as primary fibroblasts oral keratinocytes and freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells all human cells studied expressed at least six of the possible hax mrna variants in silico analysis of the variants revealed an open reading frame in all of them suggesting that murine and human tissues can express two and eight hax proteins respectively analysis of human protein lysates by western blotting with the use of a monoclonal anti hax antibody revealed multiple bands these bands were decreased after treatment of cells with a single small interfering rna duplex targeting a region common to six of the variants confirming their identity as hax proteins comparison of the human variants with the six hax homologues described to date in the chimpanzee pan troglodytes and the four homologues described in macaque macaca mulatta revealed very high conservation with only one amino acid substitution between human and chimpanzee homologues moreover a number of additional products were amplified and sequenced which indicated that further human isoforms are likely to exist these findings are likely to explain the current confusion concerning putative hax function
