In bacteria, the SecYEG protein translocation complex employs the cytosolic ATPase SecA to couple the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the mechanical force required to push polypeptides through the membrane. The molecular basis of this energy transducing reaction is not well understood. A peptide-binding array has been employed to identify sites on SecYEG that interact with SecA. These results along with fluorescence spectroscopy have been exploited to characterise a long-distance conformational change that connects the nucleotide-binding fold of SecA to the transmembrane polypeptide channel in SecY. These movements are driven by binding of non-hydrolysable ATP analogues to a monomer of SecA in association with the SecYEG complex. We also determine that interaction with SecYEG simultaneously decreases the affinity of SecA for ATP and inhibitory magnesium, favouring a previously identified active state of the ATPase. Mutants of SecA capable of binding but not hydrolysing ATP do not elicit this conformationally active state, implicating residues of the Walker B motif in the early chain of events that couple ATP binding to the mobility of the channel.
