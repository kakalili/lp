formation of helical hairpins during membrane protein integration into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane role of the n and c terminal flanking regions edited by f cohen
the helical hairpin two closely spaced transmembrane helices separated by a short turn is a common structural element in integral membrane proteins previous studies on the sequence determinants of helical hairpin formation have focussed on the role of polar and charged residues placed centrally in a long stretch of hydrophobic residues and have yielded a  propensity scale  for the relative efficiency with which different residues promote the formation of helical hairpins in this study we shift our attention to the role of charged residues flanking the hydrophobic stretch clusters of charged residues are known to hinder membrane translocation and thus flanking charged residues may conceivably force a long hydrophobic segment to form a helical hairpin even if there are no or only weakly turn promoting residues in the hydrophobic stretch we indeed find that lys and more surprisingly asp residues strongly affect helical hairpin formation when placed next to a poly leu based transmembrane segment we also find that a cluster of four consecutive lys residues can affect the efficiency of helical hairpin formation even when placed    residues downstream of the hydrophobic stretch these observations have interesting implications for the way we picture membrane protein topogenesis within the context of the endoplasmic reticulum er translocon
