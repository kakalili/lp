crystal structures of the sh domain of grb  highlight on the binding of a new high affinity inhibitor edited by r huber
the activation of growth factor receptors induces phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in its c terminal part creating binding sites for sh domain containing proteins grb is a protein that recruits sos the exchange factor for ras recruitment of sos allows for ras activation and subsequent signal transmission this promotes translocation of map kinases into the nucleus and activation of early transcription factors grb  a  kda protein is composed of one sh domain surrounded by two sh domains the sh domain of grb binds to class ii phosphotyrosyl peptides with the consensus sequence pyxnx thus grb is a good example of a bifunctional adaptor protein that brings proteins into close proximity allowing signal transduction through proteins located in different compartments to explore the interactions between grb and phosphorylated ligands we have solved the crystal structure of complexes between the grb sh domain and peptides corresponding to shc derived sequences two structures are described the grb sh domain in complex with pspyvnvqn at     and the grb sh domain in complex with maz  py  me py n nh pseudo peptide at    both are compared to an unliganded sh structure determined at    which interestingly enough forms a dimer through two swapping subdomains from two symmetry related molecules the nanomolar affinity of the maz py  me py n nh pseudo peptide for grb sh is related to new interactions with non conserved residues the design of grb sh domain inhibitors that prevent interaction with tyrosine kinase proteins or other adaptors like shc or irs should provide a means to interrupt the ras signaling pathway newly synthesized pseudo peptides exhibit nanomolar affinities for the grb sh domain it will then be possible to design new inhibitors with similar affinity and simpler chemical structures
