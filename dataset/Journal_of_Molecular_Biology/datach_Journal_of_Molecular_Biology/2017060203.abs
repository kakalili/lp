structural insights into the interaction of coronavirus papain like proteases and interferon stimulated gene product  from different species
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov encode multifunctional papain like proteases plps that have the ability to process the viral polyprotein to facilitate rna replication and antagonize the host innate immune response the latter function involves reversing the post translational modification of cellular proteins conjugated with either ubiquitin ub or ub like interferon stimulated gene product   isg   ub is known to be highly conserved among eukaryotes but surprisingly isg  is highly divergent among animals the ramifications of this sequence divergence to the recognition of isg  by coronavirus plps at a structural and biochemical level are poorly understood therefore the activity of plps from sars cov mers  cov and mouse hepatitis virus was evaluated against seven isg s originating from an assortment of animal species susceptible and not to certain coronavirus infections excitingly our kinetic thermodynamic and structural analysis revealed an array of different preferences among plps included in these studies is the first insight into a coronavirus plp  s interface with isg  via sars cov plpro in complex with the principle binding domain of human isg  hisg  and mouse isg s misg s  the first x ray structure of the full length misg  protein is also reported and highlights a unique twisted hinge region of isg  that is not conserved in hisg  suggesting a potential role in differential recognition taken together this new information provides a structural and biochemical understanding of the distinct specificities among coronavirus plps observed and addresses a critical gap of how plps can interact with isg s from a wide variety of species
