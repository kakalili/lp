analysis of the human replication protein a rad  complex evidence for crosstalk between rpa  rpa  rad  and dna
the eukaryotic single stranded dna binding protein replication protein a rpa  is essential for dna replication and plays important roles in dna repair and dna recombination rad  and rpa along with other members of the rad  epistasis group of genes repair double stranded dna breaks dsbs  two repair pathways involve rpa and rad  homologous recombination and single strand annealing two binding sites for rad  have been identified on rpa they include the previously identified c terminal domain ctd of rpa  residues      and the newly identified domain containing residues      of rpa  a region on rad  which includes residues      binds rpa  as well as rpa  the n terminal region of rpa  does not appear to play a role in the formation of the rpa rad  complex it appears that the rpa ctd can substitute for rpa  in binding rad  sequence homology between rpa  and rpa  was used to identify a putative rad  binding site on rpa  that is located near dna binding domains a and b rad  binding to rpa increases ssdna affinity significantly mutations in dbd d on rpa  show that this domain is primarily responsible for the ssdna binding enhancement rpa binding to rad  inhibits the higher order self association of rad  rings implications for these results for the  hand off  mechanism between protein  protein partners including rad  in homologous recombination and single strand annealing are discussed
