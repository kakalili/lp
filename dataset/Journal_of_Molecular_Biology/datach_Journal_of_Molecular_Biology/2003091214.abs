complete nucleotide sequence of phg  a ralstonia eutropha h  megaplasmid encoding key enzymes of h based lithoautotrophy and anaerobiosis
the self transmissible megaplasmid phg carries essential genetic information for the facultatively lithoautotrophic and facultatively anaerobic lifestyles of its host the gram negative soil bacterium ralstonia eutropha h  we have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of phg  this megaplasmid is     bp in size and carries   potential genes groups of functionally related genes form loose clusters flanked by mobile elements the largest functional group consists of lithoautotrophy related genes these include a set of  genes for the biosynthesis of the three previously identified hydrogenases and of a fourth novel hydrogenase another large cluster carries the genetic information for denitrification in addition to a dissimilatory nitrate reductase both specific and global regulators were identified also located in the denitrification region is a set of genes for cytochrome c biosynthesis determinants for several enzymes involved in the mineralization of aromatic compounds were found the genes for conjugative plasmid transfer predict that r eutropha forms two types of pili one of them is related to the type iv pili of pathogenic enterobacteria phg also carries an extensive  junkyard  region encompassing  remnants of mobile elements and  partial or intact genes for phage type integrase among the mobile elements is a novel member of the is family in which the transposase gene is interrupted by a group ii intron
