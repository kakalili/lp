structural and molecular characterization of the prefoldin  subunit from thermococcus strain ks
prefoldin pfd is a heterohexameric molecular chaperone that is found in eukaryotic cytosol and archaea pfd is composed of  and  subunits and forms a  jellyfish like  structure pfd binds and stabilizes nascent polypeptide chains and transfers them to group ii chaperonins for completion of their folding recently the whole genome of thermococcus kodakaraensis kod was reported and shown to contain the genes of two  and two  subunits of pfd the genome of thermococcus strain ks  also possesses two sets of     and   and  subunits   and   of pfd tspfd  however the functions and roles of each of these pfd subunits have not been investigated in detail here we report the crystal structure of the tspfd   subunit at     resolution and its functional analysis tspfd   subunits form a tetramer with four coiled coil tentacles resembling the jellyfish like structure of heterohexameric pfd the  hairpin linkers of   subunits assemble to form a  barrel  body  around a central fourfold axis size exclusion chromatography and multi angle light scattering analyses show that the   subunits form a tetramer at ph   and a dimer of tetramers at ph   the tetrameric   subunits can protect against aggregation of relatively small proteins insulin or lysozyme the structural and biochemical analyses imply that pfd   subunits act as molecular chaperones in living cells of some archaea
