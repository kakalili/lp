structural studies of the nudix hydrolase dr   from deinococcus radiodurans and its ligand complexes
we have determined the crystal structure at    of the nudix hydrolase dr   from the extremely radiation resistant bacterium deinococcus radiodurans the protein forms an intertwined homodimer by exchanging n terminal segments between chains we have identified additional conserved elements of the nudix fold including the metal binding motif a kinked  strand characterized by a proline two positions upstream of the nudix consensus sequence and participation of the n terminal extension in the formation of the substrate binding pocket crystal structures were also solved of dr   crystallized in the presence of magnesium and either a gtp analog or ap a both at    resolution  in the ap a co crystal the electron density indicated that the product of asymmetric hydrolysis atp was bound to the enzyme the gtp analog bound structure showed that gtp was bound almost identically as atp neither nucleoside triphosphate was further cleaved
