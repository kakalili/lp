vesicle permeabilization by purified soluble oligomers of prion protein a comparative study of the interaction of oligomers and monomers with lipid membranes
the conversion of normal cellular prion protein prp into its pathological isoform scrapie prp may occur at the cell surface or more probably in late endosomes the early events leading to the structural conversion of prp appear to be related to the presence of more or less stable soluble oligomers which might mediate neurotoxicity in the current study we investigate the interaction of  rich prp monomers and  rich size exclusion chromatography purified prp oligomers with lipid membranes we compare their structural properties when associated with lipid bilayers and study their propensities to permeabilize the membrane at physiological ph we also study the influence of the n terminal flexible region residues      by comparing full length prp     and n terminally truncated prp     oligomers we showed that both  subunit oligomers cause an immediate and large increase in the permeability of the membrane whereas equivalent amounts of monomeric forms cause no detectable leakage although the two monomeric prp constructs undergo an  to  conformational change when bound to the negatively charged membrane only the full length form of monomeric prp has a weak fusogenic effect finally the oligomers affect the integrity of the membrane differently from the monomers independently of the presence of the n terminal flexible domain as for other forms of amyloidogenesis a reasonable mechanism for the toxicity arising from prp fibrillization must be associated with low molecular weight oligomeric intermediates rather than with mature fibrils knowledge of the mechanism of action of these soluble oligomers would have a high impact on the development of novel therapeutic targets
