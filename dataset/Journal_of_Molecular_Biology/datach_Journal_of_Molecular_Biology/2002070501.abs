structure of porphobilinogen synthase from pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with  fluorolevulinic acid suggests a double schiff base mechanism
all natural tetrapyrroles including hemes chlorophylls and vitamin b  share porphobilinogen pbg as a common precursor porphobilinogen synthase pbgs synthesizes pbg through the asymmetric condensation of two molecules of aminolevulinic acid ala  crystal structures of pbgs from various sources confirm the presence of two distinct binding sites for each ala molecule termed a and p we have solved the structure of the active site variant d  n of the mg  dependent pbgs from pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with the inhibitor  fluorolevulinic acid at high resolution uniquely full occupancy of both substrate binding sites each by a single substrate like molecule was observed both inhibitor molecules are covalently bound to two conserved active site lysine residues lys  and lys   through schiff bases the active site now also contains a monovalent cation that may critically enhance enzymatic activity based on these structural data we postulate a catalytic mechanism for p aeruginosa pbgs initiated by a c  c bond formation between a and p side ala followed by the formation of the intersubstrate schiff base yielding the product pbg
