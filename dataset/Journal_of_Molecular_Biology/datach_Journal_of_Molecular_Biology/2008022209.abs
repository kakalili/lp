thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of apohmph a fast folding bacterial globin
despite the widespread presence of the globin fold in most living organisms only eukaryotic globins have been employed as model proteins in folding stability studies so far this work introduces the first thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of a prokaryotic globin that is the apo form of the heme binding domain of flavohemoglobin apohmph from escherichia coli this bacterial globin has a widely different sequence but nearly identical structure to its eukaryotic analogues we show that apohmph is a well folded monomeric protein with moderate stability at room temperature apparent  g un w        kcal mol   mun     kcal mol   m   and predominant  helical structure remarkably apohmph is the fastest folding globin known to date as it refolds about  to  fold more rapidly than its eukaryotic analogues e g  sperm whale apomyoglobin and soybean apoleghemoglobin  populating a compact kinetic intermediate  i      with significant helical content additionally the single trp   located in the native h helix becomes locked into a fully native like environment within  ms suggesting that this residue and its closest spatial neighbors complete their folding at ultrafast submillisecond speed in summary apohmph is a bacterial globin that shares the general folding scheme i e  a rapid burst phase followed by slower rate determining phases of its eukaryotic analogues but displays an overall faster folding and a kinetic intermediate with some fully native like traits this study supports the view that the general folding features of bacterial and eukaryotic globins are preserved through evolution while kinetic details differ
