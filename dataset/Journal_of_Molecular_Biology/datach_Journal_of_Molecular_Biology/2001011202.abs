in vitro evolution of beta glucuronidase into a beta galactosidase proceeds through non specific intermediates
the escherichia coli beta glucuronidase gus was evolved in vitro to catalyze the hydrolysis of a beta galactoside substrate   times more efficiently kcat km than the wild type with a  million fold inversion in specificity the amino acid substitutions that recurred among  clones isolated in three rounds of dna shuffling and screening were mapped to the active site the functional consequences of these mutations were investigated by introducing them individually or in combination into otherwise wild type gusa genes the kinetic behavior of the purified mutant proteins in reactions with a series of substrate analogues show that four mutations account for the changes in substrate specificity and that they are synergistic an evolutionary intermediate unlike the wild type and evolved forms exhibits broadened specificity for substrates dissimilar to either glucuronides or galactosides these results are consistent with the  patchwork  hypothesis which postulates that modern enzymes diverged from ancestors with broad specificity
