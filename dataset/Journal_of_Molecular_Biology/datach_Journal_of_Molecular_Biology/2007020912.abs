solution structure and backbone dynamics of the reduced form and an oxidized form of e coli methionine sulfoxide reductase a msra  structural insight of the msra catalytic cycle
methionine sulfoxide reductases msr reduce methionine sulfoxide metso containing proteins back to methionine met  msras are stereospecific for the s epimer whereas msrbs reduce the r epimer of metso although structurally unrelated the msrs characterized so far display a similar catalytic mechanism with formation of a sulfenic intermediate on the catalytic cysteine and a concomitant release of met followed by formation of at least one intramolecular disulfide bond between the catalytic and a recycling cysteine  which is then reduced by thioredoxin in the case of the msra from escherichia coli two disulfide bonds are formed i e first between the catalytic cys  and the recycling cys  and then between cys  and the second recycling cys   three crystal structures including e coli and mycobacterium tuberculosis msras which for the latter possesses only the unique recycling cys   have been solved so far in these structures the distances between the cysteine residues involved in the catalytic mechanism are too large to allow formation of the intramolecular disulfide bonds here structural and dynamical nmr studies of the reduced wild type and the oxidized cys  cys   forms of c s c  s msra from e coli have been carried out the mapping of metso substrate bound c a msra has also been performed the data support   a conformational switch occurring subsequently to sulfenic acid formation and or met release that would be a prerequisite to form the cys  cys  bond and   a high mobility of the c terminal part of the cys  cys  oxidized form that would favor formation of the second cys  cys  disulfide bond
