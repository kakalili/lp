prospects for ab initio protein structural genomics edited by b honig
we present the results of a large scale testing of the rosetta method for ab initio protein structure prediction models were generated for two independently generated lists of small proteins up to   amino acid residues  and the results were evaluated using traditional rmsd based measures and a novel measure based on the structure based comparison of the models to the structures in the pdb using dali for   of   all  and    proteins  to   residues in length the method produced at least one model within   rmsd of the native structure in   attempts for  of these proteins the closest structure match in the pdb to at least one of the ten most frequently generated conformations was found to be structurally related four standard deviations above background to the native protein these results suggest that ab initio structure prediction approaches may soon be useful for generating low resolution models and identifying distantly related proteins with similar structures and perhaps functions for these classes of proteins on the genome scale
