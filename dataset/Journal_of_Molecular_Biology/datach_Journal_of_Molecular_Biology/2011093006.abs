increased hydrophobicity and decreased backbone flexibility explain the lower solubility of a cataract linked mutant of  d crystallin
a number of point mutations in  d crystallin are associated with human cataract the pro  to thr p t mutation is perhaps the most common is geographically widespread and presents itself in a variety of phenotypes it is therefore important to understand the molecular basis of lens opacity due to this mutation in our earlier studies we noted that p t shows retrograde and sharply lowered solubility most likely due to the emergence of hydrophobic patches involved in protein aggregation binding of    dianilino    binaphthyl    disulfonate bis ans dye a probe commonly used for detecting surface hydrophobicity competed with aggregation suggesting that the residues involved in bis ans binding are also involved in protein aggregation here using nmr spectroscopy in conjunction with bis ans binding we identify three residues y  d  and y  in p t that are involved in binding the dye furthermore using  n nmr relaxation experiments we show that in the mutant protein backbone fluctuations are restricted to the picosecond to nanosecond and microsecond timescales relative to the wild type our present studies specify the residues involved in these two pivotal characteristics of the mutant protein namely increased surface hydrophobicity and restricted mobility of the protein backbone which can explain the nucleation and further propagation of protein aggregates thus we have now identified the residues in the p t mutant that give rise to novel hydrophobic surfaces as well as those regions of the protein backbone where fluctuations in different timescales are restricted providing a comprehensive understanding of how lens opacity could result from this mutation
