an immuno electron microscopical analysis of transcribing multinucleosomal templates what happens to the histones  edited by w baumeister
immuno electron microscopy was used to visualize the structure of reconstituted chromatin after in vitro transcription by purified t rna polymerase t rna polymerase disrupts the nucleosomal structure in the transcribed region this disruption is not influenced by the template linear or supercoiled and the presence or absence of nucleosomal positioning sequences in the transcribed region in this study we used monoclonal autoantibodies reacting with the nucleosome core particles and epitopes within several regions of the four different core histones some of the residues recognized by the autoantibodies are accessible on the surface of the nucleosomes and some are more internal and therefore less exposed at the surface we show that the loss of the nucleosomal configuration during transcription is due to the loss of histone dna binding and that at least part of the histones are transferred to the nascent rna chains consequently after in vitro transcription by t rna polymerase the nucleosomal template does not conserve its original configuration and no interaction of antigen antibodies is observed anymore in the region that has been transcribed therefore we conclude that in our in vitro transcription assay nucleosomes are detached from the template and not simply unfolded with histones remaining attached to the dna
