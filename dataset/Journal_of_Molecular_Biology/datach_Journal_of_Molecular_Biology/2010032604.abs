dna packaging associated hyper capsid expansion of bacteriophage t
evidence that in vivo bacteriophage t dna packaging includes capsid hyper expansion that is triggered by lengthening of incompletely packaged dna ipdna is presented here this evidence includes observation that some of the longer ipdnas in t infected cells are packaged in ipdna containing capsids with hyper expanded outer shells he ipdna capsids  in addition artificially induced hyper expansion is observed for the outer shell of a dna free capsid detection and characterization of he ipdna capsids are based on two dimensional non denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis followed by structure determination with electron microscopy and protein identification with sds page mass spectrometry after expulsion from he ipdna capsids ipdna forms sharp bands during gel electrophoresis the following hypotheses are presented   t has evolved feedback initiated atp driven capsid contraction hyper expansion cycles that accelerate dna packaging when packaging is slowed by increase in the packaging resisting force of the ipdna and   each gel electrophoretic ipdna band reflects a contraction hyper expansion cycle
