refined structure of   tubulin at    resolution edited by i a wilson
we present a refined model of the   tubulin dimer to    resolution an improved experimental density for the zinc induced tubulin sheets was obtained by adding   electron diffraction patterns at     tilt and increasing the completeness of structure factor amplitudes to     the refined structure was obtained using maximum likelihood including phase information from experimental images and simulated annealing cartesian refinement to an r factor of   and free r factor of    the current model includes residues                one molecule of gtp one of gdp and one of taxol as well as one magnesium ion at the non exchangeable nucleotide site and one putative zinc ion near the m loop in the  tubulin subunit the acidic c terminal tails could not be traced accurately neither could the n terminal loop including residues    in the  subunit there are no major changes in the overall fold of tubulin with respect to the previous structure testifying to the quality of the initial experimental phases the overall geometry of the model is however greatly improved and the position of side chains especially those of exposed polar charged groups is much better defined three short protein sequence frame shifts were detected with respect to the non refined structure in light of the new model we discuss details of the tubulin structure such as nucleotide and taxol binding sites lateral contacts in zinc sheets and the significance of the location of highly conserved residues
