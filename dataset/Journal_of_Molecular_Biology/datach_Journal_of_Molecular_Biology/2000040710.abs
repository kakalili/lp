experimental analysis and computer prediction of ctf nfi transcription factor dna binding sites edited by m yaniv
accurate prediction of transcription factor binding sites is needed to unravel the function and regulation of genes discovered in genome sequencing projects to evaluate current computer prediction tools we have begun a systematic study of the sequence specific dna binding of a transcription factor belonging to the ctf nfi family using a systematic collection of rationally designed oligonucleotides combined with an in vitro dna binding assay we found that the sequence specificity of this protein cannot be represented by a simple consensus sequence or weight matrix for instance ctf nfi uses a flexible dna binding mode that allows for variations of the binding site length from the experimental data we derived a novel prediction method using a generalised profile as a binding site predictor experimental evaluation of the generalised profile indicated that it accurately predicts the binding affinity of the transcription factor to natural or synthetic dna sequences furthermore the in vitro measured binding affinities of a subset of oligonucleotides were found to correlate with their transcriptional activities in transfected cells the combined computational experimental approach exemplified in this work thus resulted in an accurate prediction method for ctf nfi binding sites potentially functioning as regulatory regions in vivo
