x ray analysis of mycobacterium smegmatis dps and a comparative study involving other dps and dps like molecules
the structure of the dna binding protein from starved cells from mycobacterium smegmatis has been determined in three crystal forms and has been compared with those of similar proteins from other sources the dodecameric molecule can be described as a distorted icosahedron the interfaces among subunits are such that the dodecameric molecule appears to have been made up of stable trimers the situation is similar in the proteins from escherichia coli and agrobacterium tumefaciens which are closer to the m smegmatis protein in sequence and structure than those from other sources which appear to form a dimer first trimerisation is aided in the three proteins by the additional n terminal stretches that they possess the m smegmatis protein has an additional c terminal stretch compared to other related proteins the stretch known to be involved in dna binding is situated on the surface of the molecule a comparison of the available structures permits a delineation of the rigid and flexible regions in the molecule the subunit interfaces around the molecular dyads where the ferroxidation centres are located are relatively rigid regions in the vicinity of the acidic holes centred around molecular  fold axes are relatively flexible so are the dna binding regions the crystal structures of the protein from m smegmatis confirm that dna molecules can occupy spaces within the crystal without disturbing the arrangement of the protein molecules however contrary to earlier suggestions the spaces do not need to be between layers of protein molecules the cubic form provides an arrangement in which grooves which could hold dna molecules criss cross the crystal
