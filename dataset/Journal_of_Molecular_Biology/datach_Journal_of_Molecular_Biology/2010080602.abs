evolved lactococcus lactis strains for enhanced expression of recombinant membrane proteins
the production of complex multidomain membrane proteins is a major hurdle in structural genomics and a generic approach for optimizing membrane protein expression is still lacking we have devised a selection method to isolate mutant strains with improved functional expression of recombinant membrane proteins by fusing green fluorescent protein and an erythromycin resistance marker ermc to the c terminus of a target protein one simultaneously selects for variants with enhanced expression increased erythromycin resistance and correct folding green fluorescent protein fluorescence  three evolved hosts displaying  to  fold increased expression of a plethora of proteins were fully sequenced and shown to carry single site mutations in the nisk gene nisk is the sensor protein of a two component regulatory system that directs nisin a mediated expression the levels of recombinant membrane proteins were increased in the evolved strains and in some cases their folding states were improved the generality and simplicity of our approach allow rapid improvements of protein production yields by directed evolution in a high throughput way
