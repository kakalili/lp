long range interactions in the alpha subunit of tryptophan synthase help to coordinate ligand binding catalysis and substrate channeling
the  subunit of tryptophan synthase  ts catalyzes the conversion of indole  glycerol phosphate to d glyceraldehyde  phosphate and indole we propose that allosteric networks intrinsic to  ts are modulated by the binding of the  subunit to regulate  ts function understanding these long range amino acid networks in  ts thus gives insight into the coordination of the two active sites within ts in this study we have used ala residues as probes for structural and dynamic changes of  ts throughout its catalytic cycle in the absence of the  subunit projection analysis of the chemical shift changes by site specific amino acid substitutions and ligand titrations indicates that  ts has three important conformational states ligand free glyceraldehyde  phosphate bound like  and the active states the amino acid networks within these conformations are different as suggested by chemical shift correlation analysis in particular there are long range connections only in the active state between ala  which reports on structural and dynamic changes associated with the general acid base glu  and residues within the    loop which contains the catalytically important asp  residue these long range interactions are likely important for coordinating chemical catalysis in the free state but not in the active state there are connections between the    and    loops that likely help to coordinate substrate binding changes in the allosteric networks are also accompanied by protein dynamic changes during catalytic turnover the protein becomes more rigid on the millisecond timescale and the active site dynamics are driven to a faster nanosecond timescale
