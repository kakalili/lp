alternative s hinge regions of the myosin rod differentially affect muscle function myofibril dimensions and myosin tail length
muscle myosin heavy chain mhc rod domains intertwine to form alpha helical coiled coil dimers these subsequently multimerize into thick filaments via electrostatic interactions the subfragment  light meromyosin  hinge  region of the mhc rod located in the c terminal third of heavy meromyosin may form a less stable coiled coil than flanking regions partial  melting  of this region has been proposed to result in a helix to random coil transition a portion of the drosophila melanogaster mhc hinge is encoded by mutually exclusive alternative exons  a and  b the use of which correlates with fast hinge a or slow hinge b muscle physiological properties to test the functional significance of alternative hinge regions we constructed transgenic fly lines in which fast muscle isovariant hinge a was switched for slow muscle hinge b in the mhc isoforms of indirect flight and jump muscles substitution of the slow muscle hinge b impaired flight ability increased sarcomere lengths by approximately   and resulted in minor disruption to indirect flight muscle sarcomeric structure compared with a transgenic control with age residual flight ability decreased rapidly and myofibrils developed peripheral defects computational analysis indicates that hinge b has a greater coiled coil propensity and thus reduced flexibility compared to hinge a intriguingly the mhc rod with hinge b was    nm longer than myosin with hinge a consistent with the more rigid coiled coil conformation predicted for hinge b our study demonstrates that hinge b cannot functionally substitute for hinge a in fast muscle types likely as a result of differences in the molecular structure of the rod subtle changes in myofibril structure and decreased ability to maintain sarcomere structure in indirect flight muscle myofibrils thus alternative hinges are important in dictating the distinct functional properties of myosin isoforms and the muscles in which they are expressed
