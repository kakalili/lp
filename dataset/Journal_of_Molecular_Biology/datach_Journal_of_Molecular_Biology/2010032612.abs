resonance assignment and three dimensional structure determination of a human  defensin hnp  by solid state nmr
human  defensins human neutrophil peptides hnps  are immune defense mini proteins that act by disrupting microbial cell membranes elucidating the three dimensional  d structures of hnps in lipid membranes is important for understanding their mechanisms of action using solid state nmr ssnmr  we have determined the d structure of hnp  in a microcrystalline state outside the lipid membrane which provides benchmarks for structure determination and comparison with the membrane bound state from a suite of two dimensional and d magic angle spinning experiments  c and  n chemical shifts that yielded torsion angle constraints were obtained while inter residue distances were obtained to restrain the d fold together these constraints led to the first high resolution ssnmr structure of a human defensin the ssnmr structure has close similarity to the crystal structures of the hnp family with the exception of the loop region between the first and second  strands the difference which is partially validated by direct torsion angle measurements of selected loop residues suggests possible conformational variation and flexibility of this segment of the protein which may regulate hnp interaction with the phospholipid membrane of microbial cells
