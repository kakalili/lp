co evolution of proteins with their interaction partners edited by b honig
the divergent evolution of proteins in cellular signaling pathways requires ligands and their receptors to co evolve creating new pathways when a new receptor is activated by a new ligand however information about the evolution of binding specificity in ligand receptor systems is difficult to glean from sequences alone we have used phosphoglycerate kinase pgk  an enzyme that forms its active site between its two domains to develop a standard for measuring the co evolution of interacting proteins the n terminal and c terminal domains of pgk form the active site at their interface and are covalently linked therefore they must have co evolved to preserve enzyme function by building two phylogenetic trees from multiple sequence alignments of each of the two domains of pgk we have calculated a correlation coefficient for the two trees that quantifies the co evolution of the two domains the correlation coefficient for the trees of the two domains of pgk is    which establishes an upper bound for the co evolution of a protein domain with its binding partner the analysis is extended to ligands and their receptors using the chemokines as a model we show that the correlation between the chemokine ligand and receptor trees  distances is    the chemokine family of protein ligands and their g protein coupled receptors have co evolved so that each subgroup of chemokine ligands has a matching subgroup of chemokine receptors the matching subfamilies of ligands and their receptors create a framework within which the ligands of orphan chemokine receptors can be more easily determined this approach can be applied to a variety of ligand and receptor systems
