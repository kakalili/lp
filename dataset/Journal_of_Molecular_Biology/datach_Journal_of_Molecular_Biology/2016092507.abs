differential regulation of cxcl production by different g protein subunits with synergistic stimulation by gi and gq regulated pathways
cxcl  also known as interleukin  or il  is a proinflammatory chemokine that not only modulates the inflammatory and immune responses but whose upregulation is often associated with diseases including various types of cancer although numerous ligands for g protein coupled receptors gpcrs have been shown to stimulate the production of cxcl  the specificity of the g protein signal remains undefined by expressing the constitutively active g  subunits in hek  cells cxcl production was herein demonstrated to be most effectively stimulated by g q family members while those of g s and g   elicited much weaker activities and g i being totally ineffective however in cell lines such as hepg  hela and mcf  that endogenously express g   responsive phospholipase c  isoforms plc    activation of the gi coupled   adrenoceptor significantly stimulated cxcl production this gi induced cxcl production was apparently mediated via specific g   dimers and required the presence of plc    co activation of gi coupled   adrenoceptor and gq coupled bradykinin receptor resulted in a synergistic cxcl production with g   responsive plc    src erk and stat serving as critical signaling intermediates the treatment of hepg and b  endothelial cells with bradykinin stimulated cxcl production and cell proliferation interestingly the latter response was driven by cxcl autocrine signaling because it was abolished by sb    an antagonist that prevents cxcl from binding to cxcr  collectively our results provide a mechanistic basis for various g protein subfamilies to regulate the production of cxcl  which may then lead to paracrine and or autocrine signaling with major implications in both normal physiology and pathophysiological conditions
