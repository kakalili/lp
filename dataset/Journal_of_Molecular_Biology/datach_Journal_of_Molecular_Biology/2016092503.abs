signal transduction at the single cell level approaches to study the dynamic nature of signaling networks
signal transduction or how cells interpret and react to external events is a fundamental aspect of cellular function traditional study of signal transduction pathways involves mapping cellular signaling pathways at the population level however population averaged readouts do not adequately illuminate the complex dynamics and heterogeneous responses found at the single cell level recent technological advances that observe cellular response computationally model signaling pathways and experimentally manipulate cells now enable studying signal transduction at the single cell level these studies will enable deeper insights into the dynamic nature of signaling networks
