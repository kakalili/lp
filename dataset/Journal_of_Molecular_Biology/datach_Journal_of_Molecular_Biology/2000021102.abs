the solution structure of ribosomal protein l  from thermus thermophilus reveals a zinc ribbon like fold edited by p e wright
we have determined the solution nmr structure of the ribosomal protein l  from thermus thermophilus l  is the smallest protein in the large subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome the sequence contains three completely conserved cysteine residues and one conserved histidine residue in a c x c x  c x h motif extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy was used to confirm that a purified l  sample contains an equimolar amount of zinc the structure of l  was determined using simulated annealing based on noe distance restraints dihedral angle restraints and hydrogen bond distance restraints derived from nmr spectra of  n labeled and non labeled l  samples at ph  and   c and by imposing tetrahedral zinc ion coordination geometry the l  fold is characterized by a triple stranded antiparallel  sheet with the zinc binding site at one end the structure of the zinc site is well determined and shows that the three cysteine sulphur atoms are supported by hydrogen bonds to backbone amide protons the conserved histidine residue is located in a short   helix and coordinates zinc by the n  atom the electrostatic surface potential and location of conserved arg lys and his side chains suggest a large continuous l  rrna interaction interface the folding topology as well as position and conformation of many conserved side chains in l  are very similar to those of zinc ribbon domains found in the archaeal transcription factor tfiib n terminus and the eukaryal transcription elongation factor htfiis c terminus given the relative antiquity of the ribosome it is possible that l  reflects the parent of transcription related zinc ribbons
