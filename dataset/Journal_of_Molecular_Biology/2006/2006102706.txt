CRABPII is a small, cytosolic protein that solubilizes and transfers retinoic acid (RA) to the nucleus while also enhancing its transcriptional activity. We have determined the first high-resolution structure of apo-wild type (WT) CRABPII at 1.35 Å. Using three different data sets collected on apo-WT CRABPII we have shown that apo- and holo-CRABPII share very similar structures. Binding of RA appears to increase the overall rigidity of the structure, although the induced structural changes are not as pronounced as previously thought. The enhanced structural rigidity may be an important determinant for the enhanced nuclear localization of the RA-bound protein. Comparison of our apo-WT with a mutant apo-CRABPII structure shows that mutation of Arg111, a conserved residue of CRABPII and a key residue in RA binding, causes structural changes in the molecule. We further investigated the structural importance of conserved residues by determining the structure of the F15W mutant CRABPII (F15W-CRABPII). Our structures also demonstrate structural changes induced by crystal packing and show that a crystal can harbor demonstrative structural differences in the asymmetric unit.
