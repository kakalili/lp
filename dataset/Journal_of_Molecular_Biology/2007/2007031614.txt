β-2 Microglobulin (β2m) is a small, globular protein, with high solubility under conditions comparable to human serum. A complication of hemodialysis in renal failure patients is the deposition of unmodified β2m as amyloid fibers. In vitro, exposure of β2m to equimolar Cu2+ under near-physiological conditions can result in self-association leading to amyloid fiber formation. Previously, we have shown that the early steps in this process involve a catalyzed structural rearrangement followed by formation of discrete oligomers. These oligomers, however, have a continued requirement for Cu2+ while mature fibers are resistant to addition of metal chelate. Here, we report that the transition from Cu2+ dependent to chelate resistant states occurs in the context of small oligomers, dimeric to hexameric in size. These species require Cu2+ to form, but once generated, do not need metal cation for stability. Importantly, this transition occurs gradually over several days and the resulting oligomers are isolatable and kinetically stable on timescales exceeding weeks. In addition, formation is enhanced by levels of urea similar to those found in hemodialysis patients. Our results are consistent with our hypothesis that transient encounter of full-length wild-type β2m with transition metal cation at the dialysis membrane interface is causal to dialysis related amyloidosis.
