molecular bases and role of viruses in the human microbiome
viruses are dependent biological entities that interact with the genetic material of most cells on the planet including the trillions within the human microbiome their tremendous diversity renders analysis of human viral communities   viromes   to be highly complex because many of the viruses in humans are bacteriophage their dynamic interactions with their cellular hosts add greatly to the complexities observed in examining human microbial ecosystems we are only beginning to be able to study human viral communities on a large scale mostly as a result of recent and continued advancements in sequencing and bioinformatic technologies bacteriophage community diversity in humans not only is inexorably linked to the diversity of their cellular hosts but also is due to their rapid evolution horizontal gene transfers and intimate interactions with host nucleic acids there are vast numbers of observed viral genotypes on many body surfaces studied including the oral gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts and even in the human bloodstream which previously was considered a purely sterile environment the presence of viruses in blood suggests that virome members can traverse mucosal barriers as indeed these communities are substantially altered when mucosal defenses are weakened perhaps the most interesting aspect of human viral communities is the extent to which they can carry gene functions involved in the pathogenesis of their hosts particularly antibiotic resistance persons in close contact with each other have been shown to share a fraction of oral virobiota which could potentially have important implications for the spread of antibiotic resistance to healthy individuals because viruses can have a large impact on ecosystem dynamics through mechanisms such as the transfers of beneficial gene functions or the lysis of certain populations of cellular hosts they may have both beneficial and detrimental roles that affect human health including improvements in microbial resilience to disturbances immune evasion maintenance of physiologic processes and altering the microbial community in ways that promote or prevent pathogen colonization
