membrane anchored human fcrn can oligomerize in the absence of igg
fcrn is unique among immunoglobulin g igg fc receptors in that it is structurally closely related to major histocompatibility complex class i molecules and likewise consists of an  chain and   microglobulin crystallographic data show that rat fcrn  chain  m heterodimers can further dimerize via ionic interactions and a carbohydrate handshake intriguingly however no dimers are found in crystals of human fcrn probably because the charged amino acids and the carbohydrate implicated in dimerization of rat fcrn are not conserved here we show that although a secreted soluble form of human fcrn does not dimerize the membrane anchored receptor can form both non covalent and covalent dimers furthermore dimerization of human fcrn occurs in the absence of its ligand igg
