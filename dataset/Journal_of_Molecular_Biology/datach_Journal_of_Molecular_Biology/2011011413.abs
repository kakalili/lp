molecular architecture and connectivity of the budding yeast mtw kinetochore complex
kinetochores are large multiprotein complexes that connect centromeres to spindle microtubules in all eukaryotes among the biochemically distinct kinetochore complexes the conserved four protein mtw complex is a central part of the kinetochore in all organisms here we present the biochemical reconstitution and characterization of the budding yeast mtw complex direct visualization by electron microscopy revealed an elongated bilobed structure with a  nm long axis the complex can be assembled from two stable heterodimers consisting of mtw p  nnf p and dsn p  nsl p and it interacts directly with the microtubule binding ndc  kinetochore complex via the centromere proximal spc  spc  head domain in addition we have reconstituted a partial ctf  complex and show that it directly associates with the mtw complex in vitro ndc  and ctf  complexes do not compete for binding to the mtw complex suggesting that mtw can bridge the microtubule binding components of the kinetochore to the inner centromere
