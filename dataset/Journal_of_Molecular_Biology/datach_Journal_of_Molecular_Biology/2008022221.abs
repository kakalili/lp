hla b  subtypes differentially associated with disease exhibit conformational differences in solution
human leukocyte antigen hla class i molecules consist of a heavy chain    microglobulin and a peptide that are noncovalently bound certain hla b  subtypes are associated with ankylosing spondylitis such as hla b    whereas others such as hla b    are not both differ in only one residue asp  and his   respectively in the f pocket that accommodates the peptide c terminus an isotope edited ir spectroscopy study of these hla b  subtypes complexed with the self peptide rrkwrrwhl was carried out revealing that the heavy chain is more flexible in the hla b   than in the hla b   subtype in agreement with these experimental data molecular dynamics simulations showed an increased flexibility of the hla b   binding groove in comparison with that of the hla b   subtype this difference correlates with an opening of the hla b   binding groove accompanied by a partial detachment of the c terminal peptide anchor these combined results demonstrate how the deeply embedded polymorphic heavy chain residue   influences the flexibility of the peptide binding groove in a subtype dependent manner a feature that could also influence the recognition of the hla b  complexes by effector cells
