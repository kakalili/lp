engineering gst m  for high activity with indene   oxide and indication of an h site residue sustaining catalytic promiscuity
the substrate binding h site of human glutathione transferase gst m  was subjected to iterative saturation mutagenesis in order to obtain an efficient enzyme with the novel epoxide substrate indene   oxide residues     and   were targeted and the activities with the alternative substrates benzyl isothiocyanate and the prodrug azathioprine undergoing divergent chemical reactions were monitored for comparison in general increased activities were found when the smaller residues gly ser and ala replaced the original thr   the most active mutant t  g was further mutated at position   but no mutant showed enhanced catalytic activity however saturation mutagenesis of position  identified one double mutant t  g i c with   fold higher specific activity with indene   oxide than wild type gst m   this enhanced epoxide activity of    mol min   mg   resulted primarily from an increased kcat value   s    the specific activity is  fold higher than that of wild type gst m   which is otherwise the most proficient gst enzyme with epoxide substrates a second double mutant t  g i w displayed  fold increased activity with azathioprine     mol min   mg   in both double mutants the replacement of ile  led to narrowed acceptance of alternative substrates ile  is evolutionarily conserved in related class mu gsts conservation usually indicates preservation of a particular function and in the mu class it would appear that the conserved ile  is not necessary to maintain catalytic functions but to prevent loss of broad substrate acceptance in summary our data underscore the facile transition between alternative substrate selectivity profiles in gsts by a few mutations
