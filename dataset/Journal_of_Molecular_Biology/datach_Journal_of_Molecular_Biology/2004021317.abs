dna binding orientation and domain conformation of the e coli rep helicase monomer bound to a partial duplex junction single molecule studies of fluorescently labeled enzymes
the sf dna helicases are multi domain proteins that can unwind duplex dna in reactions that are coupled to atp binding and hydrolysis crystal structures of two such helicases escherichia coli rep and bacillus stearothermophilus pcra show that the b sub domain of these proteins can be found in dramatically different orientations closed versus open with respect to the remainder of the protein suggesting that the b domain is highly flexible by systematically using fluorescence resonance energy transfer at the single molecule level we have determined both the orientation of an e coli rep monomer bound to a   single stranded double stranded ss ds dna junction in solution as well as the relative orientation of its b sub domain to accomplish this we developed a highly efficient procedure for site specific fluorescence labeling of rep and a bio friendly immobilization scheme which preserves its activities both ensemble and single molecule experiments were carried out although the single molecule experiments proved to be essential here in providing quantitative distance information that could not be obtained by steady state ensemble measurements using distance constrained triangulation procedures we demonstrate that in solution the b sub domain of a rep monomer is primarily in the  closed  conformation when bound to a   ss ds dna similar to the orientation observed in the complex of pcra bound to a   ss ds dna previous biochemical studies have shown that a rep monomer bound to such a   ss ds dna substrate is unable to unwind the dna and that a rep oligomer is required for helicase activity therefore the closed form of rep bound to a partial duplex dna appears to be an inhibited form of the enzyme
