ph dependent conformational changes in bacterial hsp  reveal a grp  like conformation at ph  that is highly active in suppression of citrate synthase aggregation
the molecular chaperone hsp  depends upon large conformational rearrangements for its function one driving force for these rearrangements is the intrinsic atpase activity of hsp  as seen with other chaperones however unlike other chaperones structural and kinetic studies have shown that the atpase cycle of hsp  is not conformationally deterministic that is rather than dictating the conformational state atp binding and hydrolysis shift the equilibrium between a preexisting set of conformational states in an organism dependent manner while many conformations of hsp  have been described little is known about how they relate to chaperone function in this study we show that the conformational equilibrium of the bacterial hsp  htpg can be shifted with ph using small angle x ray scattering we identify a two state ph dependent conformational equilibrium for apo htpg our structural modeling reveals that this equilibrium is observed between the previously observed extended state and a second state that is strikingly similar to the recently solved grp  crystal structure in the presence of nonhydrolyzable   adenylyl    imidodiphosphate a third state which is identical with the solved amppnp bound structure from yeast hsp  is populated electron microscopy confirmed the observed conformational equilibria we also identify key histidine residues that control this ph dependent equilibrium using mutagenesis we successfully modulate the conformational equilibrium at neutral ph using these mutations we show that the grp  like state provides stronger aggregation protection compared to the extended apo conformation in the context of a citrate synthase aggregation assay these studies provide a more detailed view of htpg s conformational dynamics and provide the first linkage between a specific conformation and chaperone function
