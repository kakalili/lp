antisense transcript long noncoding rna lncrna hotair is transcriptionally induced by estradiol
hotair hox antisense intergenic rna is a long noncoding rna lncrna that is transcribed from the antisense strand of homeobox c gene locus in chromosome   hotair coordinates with chromatin modifying enzymes and regulates gene silencing it is overexpressed in various carcinomas including breast cancer herein we demonstrated that hotair is crucial for cell growth and viability and its knockdown induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells we also demonstrated that hotair is transcriptionally induced by estradiol e  its promoter contains multiple functional estrogen response elements eres  estrogen receptors ers along with various er coregulators such as histone methylases mll  mixed lineage leukemia  and mll and creb binding protein p  bind to the promoter of hotair in an e dependent manner level of histone h lysine  trimethylation histone acetylation and rna polymerase ii recruitment is enriched at the hotair promoter in the presence of e  knockdown of ers and mlls downregulated the e induced hotair expression thus similar to protein coding gene transcription e induced transcription of antisense transcript hotair is coordinated via ers and er coregulators and this mechanism of hotair overexpression potentially contributes towards breast cancer progression
