protein  protein f rster resonance energy transfer analysis of nucleosome core particles containing h a and h a z
a protein  protein f rster resonance energy transfer fret system employing probes at multiple positions was designed to specifically monitor the dissociation of the h a  h b dimer from the nucleosome core particle ncp  tryptophan donors and cys aedans acceptors were chosen because compared to previous ncp fret fluorophores they   are smaller and less hydrophobic which should minimize perturbations of histone and ncp structure and   have an r of     which is much less than the dimensions of the ncp      width and      diameter  equilibrium protein unfolding titrations indicate that the donor and acceptor moieties have minimal effects on the stability of the h a  h b dimer and h  h  tetramer ncps containing the various fret pairs were reconstituted with the   dna positioning element equilibrium nacl induced dissociation of the modified ncps showed that the   sequence stabilized the ncp to dimer dissociation relative to weaker positioning sequences this finding implies a significant role for the h a  h b dimers in determining the dna sequence dependence of ncp stability the free energy of dissociation determined from reversible and well defined sigmoidal transitions revealed two distinct phases reflecting the dissociation of individual h a  h b dimers confirming cooperativity as suggested previously these data allow quantitative description of the cooperativity the fret system was then used to study the effects of the histone variant h a z on ncp stability previous studies have reported both destabilizing and stabilizing effects h a z fret ncp dissociation transitions suggest a slight increase in stability but a significant increase in cooperativity of the dimer dissociations thus the utility of this protein  protein fret system to monitor the effects of histone variants on ncp dynamics has been demonstrated and the system appears equally well suited for dissection of the kinetic processes of dimer association and dissociation from the ncp
