structural analysis of cysteine s nitrosylation a modified acid based motif and the emerging role of trans nitrosylation
s nitrosylation the selective and reversible addition of nitric oxide no moiety to cysteine cys sulfur in proteins regulates numerous cellular processes in recent years proteomic approaches that are capable of identifying nitrosylated cys residues have been developed however the features underlying the specificity of cys modification with no remain poorly defined previous studies suggested that s nitrosylated cys may be flanked by an acid  base motif or hydrophobic areas and show high reactivity low pka and high sulfur atom exposure in the current study we prepared an extensive manually curated data set of proteins with s nitrosothiols accounting for a variety of biochemical functions organisms of origin and physiological responses to no analysis of this generic no cys data set revealed that proximal acid  base motif cys pka sulfur atom exposure and cys conservation or hydrophobicity in the vicinity of the modified cys do not define the specificity of s nitrosylation instead this analysis revealed a revised acid  base motif which is located more distantly to the cys and has its charged groups exposed we hypothesize that rather than being strictly used for direct activation of cys the modified acid  base motif is engaged in protein  protein interactions thereby contributing to trans nitrosylation as an important and widespread mechanism for reversible modification of cys with no moiety for proteins lacking the revised motif we discuss alternative mechanisms including a potential role of nitrosoglutathione as a trans acting agent
