crystal structures of the free and ligand bound fk  fk domain segment of fkbp  reveal a flexible inter domain hinge
the human hsp  co chaperone fkbp  belongs to the family of fk  binding proteins which act as peptidyl prolyl isomerases fkbp  specifically enhances the signaling of steroid hormone receptors modulates ion channels and regulates neuronal outgrowth dynamics in turn small molecule ligands of fkbp  have been suggested as potential neurotrophic or anti prostate cancer agents the usefulness of available ligands is however limited by a lack of selectivity the immunophilin fkbp  is composed of three domains an fk  binding domain with peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity an fkbp like domain of unknown function and a tpr clamp domain which recognizes the c terminal peptide of hsp  with high affinity the herein reported crystal structures of fkbp  reveal that the short linker connecting the fk  binding domain and the fkbp like domain acts as a flexible hinge this enhanced flexibility and its modulation by phosphorylation might explain some of the functional antagonism between the closely related homologs fkbp  and fkbp  we further present two co crystal structures of fkbp  in complex with the prototypic ligand fk  and a synthetic analog thereof these structures revealed the molecular interactions in great detail which enabled in depth comparison with the corresponding complexes of the other cytosolic fkbps fkbp  and fkbp  the observed subtle differences provide crucial insights for the rational design of ligands with improved selectivity for fkbp
