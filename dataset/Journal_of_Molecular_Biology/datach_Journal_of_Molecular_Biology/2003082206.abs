the structural basis of receptor binding by escherichia coli associated with diarrhea and septicemia
gafd in escherichia coli g f  fimbriae is associated with diarrheal disease and the structure of the ligand binding domain gafd    has been determined at    resolution in the presence of the receptor sugar n acetyl d glucosamine the overall fold is a  barrel jelly roll fold the ligand binding site was identified and localized to the side of the molecule receptor binding is mediated by side chain as well main chain interactions ala  asn  ser  thr  form the sugar acetamide specificity pocket while asp  confers tight binding and trp  appears to position the ligand there is a disulfide bond that rigidifies the acetamide specificity pocket the three fimbrial lectins gafd fimh and papg share similar  barrel folds but display different ligand binding regions and disulfide bond patterns we suggest an evolutionary path for the evolution of the very diverse fimbrial lectins from a common ancestral fold
