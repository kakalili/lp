site directed mutagenesis of escherichia coli acetylglutamate kinase and aspartokinase iii probes the catalytic and substrate binding mechanisms of these amino acid kinase family enzymes and allows three dimensional modelling of aspartokinase
we test using site directed mutagenesis predictions based on the x ray structure of n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk  the paradigm of the amino acid kinase protein family about the roles of specific residues on substrate binding and catalysis the mutations k r and d  e decreased v sustrate     fold and   fold respectively in agreement with the predictions that k catalyzes phosphoryl transfer and d  organizes the catalytic groups r k and n  q increased selectively kmasp three to four orders of magnitude in agreement with the binding of r  and n  to the c  substituents of nag mutagenesis in parallel of aspartokinase iii akiii phosphorylates aspartate instead of acetylglutamate  another important amino acid kinase family member of unknown  d structure identified in akiii two residues k and d   that appear to play roles similar to those of k and d  of nagk and supports the involvement of e  and r   similarly to r  and n  of nagk in the binding of the amino acid substrate apparently interacting respectively with the  nh  and  coo  of aspartate these results and an improved alignment of the nagk and akiii sequences have guided us into  d modelling of the amino acid kinase domain of akiii using nagk as template the model has good stereochemistry and validation parameters it provides insight into substrate binding and catalysis agreeing with mutagenesis results with another aspartokinase that were not considered when building the model akiii is homodimeric and is inhibited by lysine lysine may bind to a regulatory region that is c terminal to the amino acid kinase domain we make a c terminally truncated akiii akiiit and show that the c region is involved in intersubunit interactions since akiiit is found to be monomeric further it is inactive as demanded if dimer formation is essential for activity models for akiii architecture are proposed that account for these findings
