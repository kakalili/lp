The sequence and structural conservation of folding transition states have been predicted on theoretical grounds. Using homologous sequence alignments of proteins previously characterized via coupled mutagenesis/kinetics studies, we tested these predictions experimentally. Only one of the six appropriately characterized proteins exhibits a statistically significant correlation between residuesâ€™ roles in transition state structure and their evolutionary conservation. However, a significant correlation is observed between the contributions of individual sequence positions to the transition state structure across a set of homologous proteins. Thus the structure of the folding transition state ensemble appears to be more highly conserved than the specific interactions that stabilize it.
