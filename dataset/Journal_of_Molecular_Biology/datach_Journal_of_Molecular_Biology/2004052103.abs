unique physicochemical profile of  amyloid peptide variant a    e g protofibrils conceivable neuropathogen in arctic mutant carriers
a new early onset form of alzheimer s disease ad was described recently where a point mutation was discovered in codon   of the  amyloid a  precursor protein gene the arctic mutation the mutation translates into a single amino acid substitution glutamic acid  glycine in position  of the a  peptide the mutation carriers have lower plasma levels of a  than normal while in vitro studies show that a    e g protofibril formation is significantly enhanced we have explored the nature of the a    e g peptide in more detail in particular the protofibrils using size exclusion chromatography sec and circular dichroism spectroscopy cd kinetic and secondary structural characteristics were compared with other a     peptides and the a     fragment all having single amino acid substitutions in position   we have found that a    e g protofibrils are a group of comparatively stabile  sheet containing oligomers with a heterogeneous size distribution ranging from gt   kda to gt   kda small a    e g protofibrils are generated about   times faster than large ones salt promotes their formation which significantly exceeds all the other peptides studied here including the dutch mutation a    e q position  substitutions had significant effects on aggregation kinetics of a     and in a      although the qualitative aspects of the effects differed between the native peptide and the fragment as no protofibrils were formed by the fragments the rank order of protofibril formation of a     and its variants was the same as the rank order of the length of the nucleation lag phase of the a     fragments e v gt e a  e g gt e q  e  and correlated with the degree of hydrophobicity of the position  substituent the molecular mass of peptide monomers and protofibrils were estimated better in sec studies using linear rather than globular calibration standards the characteristics of the a    e g suggest an important role for the peptide in the neuropathogenesis in the arctic form of ad
