deriving heterospecific self assembling protein  protein interactions using a computational interactome screen
interactions between naturally occurring proteins are highly specific with protein network imbalances associated with numerous diseases for designed protein  protein interactions ppis  required specificity can be notoriously difficult to engineer to accelerate this process we have derived peptides that form heterospecific ppis when combined this is achieved using software that generates large virtual libraries of peptide sequences and searches within the resulting interactome for preferentially interacting peptides to demonstrate feasibility we have i generated   peptide sequences based on the parallel dimeric coiled coil motif and varied residues known to be important for stability and specificity  ii screened the      member interactome for predicted tm values and iii used predicted tm cutoff points to isolate eight peptides that form four heterospecific ppis when combined this required that all  hypothetical off target interactions within the eight peptide interactome be disfavoured and that the four desired interactions pair correctly lastly we have verified the approach by characterising all  pairs within the interactome in analysing the output we hypothesised that several sequences are capable of adopting antiparallel orientations we subsequently improved the software by removing sequences where doing so led to fully complementary electrostatic pairings our approach can be used to derive increasingly large and therefore complex sets of heterospecific ppis with a wide range of potential downstream applications from disease modulation to the design of biomaterials and peptides in synthetic biology
