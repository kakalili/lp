dynamic behavior of trigger factor on the ribosome
trigger factor tf is the only ribosome associated chaperone in bacteria it interacts with hydrophobic segments in nascent chain ncs as they emerge from the ribosome tf binds via its n terminal ribosome binding domain rbd mainly to ribosomal protein ul  at the tunnel exit on the large ribosomal subunit whereas earlier structural data suggested that tf binds as a rigid molecule to the ribosome recent comparisons of structural data on substrate bound ribosome bound and tf in solution from different species suggest that this chaperone is a rather flexible molecule here we present two cryo electron microscopy structures of tf bound to ribosomes translating an mrna coding for a known tf substrate from escherichia coli of a different length the structures reveal distinct degrees of flexibility for the different tf domains a conformational rearrangement of the rbd upon ribosome binding and an increase in rigidity within tf when the nc is extended molecular dynamics simulations agree with these data and offer a molecular basis for these observations
