dna wrapping and distortion by an oligomeric homeodomain protein
many transcription factors alter dna or chromatin structure changes in chromatin structure are often brought about by the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins chromatin modifying proteins or other transcription co activator or co repressor proteins however some transcription factors form oligomeric assemblies that may themselves induce changes in dna conformation and chromatin structure the proline rich homeodomain prh hex protein is a transcription factor that regulates cell differentiation and cell proliferation and has multiple roles in embryonic development earlier we showed that prh can repress transcription by multiple mechanisms including the recruitment of co repressor proteins belonging to the tle family of chromatin binding proteins our in vivo crosslinking studies have shown that prh forms oligomeric complexes in cells and a variety of biophysical techniques suggest that the protein forms octamers however as yet we have little knowledge of the role played by prh oligomerisation in the regulation of promoter activity or of the architecture of promoters that are regulated directly by prh in cells here we compare the binding of prh and the isolated prh homeodomain to dna fragments with single and multiple prh sites using gel retardation assays and dnase i and chemical footprinting we show that the prh oligomer binds to multiple sites within the human goosecoid promoter with high affinity and that the binding of prh brings about dna distortion we suggest that prh octamers wrap dna in order to bring about transcriptional repression
