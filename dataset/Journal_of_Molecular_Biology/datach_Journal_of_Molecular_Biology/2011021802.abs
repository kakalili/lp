the human mitochondrial trnamet structure function relationship of a unique modification in the decoding of unconventional codons
human mitochondrial mrnas utilize the universal aug and the unconventional isoleucine aua codons for methionine in contrast to translation in the cytoplasm human mitochondria use one trna hmtrnametcau to read aug and aua codons at both the peptidyl  p  and aminoacyl  a  sites of the ribosome the hmtrnametcau has a unique post transcriptional modification  formylcytidine at the wobble position   f c   and a cytidine substituting for the invariant uridine at position  of the canonical u turn in trnas the structure of the trna anticodon stem and loop domain hmtaslmetcau  determined by nmr restrained molecular modeling revealed how the f c  modification facilitates the decoding of aua at the p and the a sites the f c  defined a reduced conformational space for the nucleoside in what appears to have restricted the conformational dynamics of the anticodon bases of the modified hmtaslmetcau the hmtaslmetcau exhibited a c turn conformation that has some characteristics of the u turn motif codon binding studies with both escherichia coli and bovine mitochondrial ribosomes revealed that the f c  facilitates aua binding in the a site and suggested that the modification favorably alters the asl binding kinetics mitochondrial translation by many organisms including humans sometimes initiates with the universal isoleucine codons auu and auc the f c  enabled p site codon binding to these normally isoleucine codons thus the physicochemical properties of this one modification f c  expand codon recognition from the traditional aug to the non traditional synonymous codons auu and auc as well as aua in the reassignment of universal codons in the mitochondria
