three dimensional solution structure and conformational plasticity of the n terminal scavenger receptor cysteine rich domain of human cd
the lymphocyte receptor cd influences cell activation by modifying the strength of the intracellular response initiated by antigen engagement regulation through cd involves the interaction of one or more of its three scavenger receptor cysteine rich domains present in the extracellular region here we present the d solution structure of a non glycosylated double mutant of the n terminal domain of human cd expressed in escherichia coli ecd d m  which has enhanced solubility compared to the non glycosylated wild type ecd d  in common with a glycosylated form expressed in pichia pastoris the  n h correlation spectra of both ecd d and ecd d m exhibit non uniform temperature dependent signal intensities indicating extensive conformational fluctuations on the micro  millisecond timescale although approximately one half of the signals expected for the domain are absent at   k essentially complete resonance assignments and a solution structure could be obtained at   k because of the sparse nature of the experimental restraint data and the potentially important contribution of conformational exchange to the nuclear overhauser effect peak intensity we applied inferential structure determination to calculate the ecd d m structure the inferential structure determination ensemble has similar features to that obtained by traditional simulated annealing methods but displays superior definition and structural quality the ecd d m structure is similar to other members of the scavenger receptor cysteine rich superfamily but the position of the lone  helix differs due to interactions with the unique n terminal region of the domain the availability of an experimentally tractable form of cd d  together with its d structure provides new tools for further investigation of its function within intact cd
