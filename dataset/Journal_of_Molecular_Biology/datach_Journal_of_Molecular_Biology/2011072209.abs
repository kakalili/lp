structure and stoichiometry of template directed recombinant hiv  gag particles
size polydispersity of immature human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  particles represents a challenge for traditional methods of biological ultrastructural analysis an in vitro model for immature hiv  particles constructed from recombinant gag proteins lacking residues     and the p domain assembled around spherical nanoparticles functionalized with dna this template directed assembly approach led to a significant reduction in size polydispersity and revealed previously unknown structural features of immature like hiv  particles electron microscopy and image reconstruction of these particles suggest that the gag shell formed from different protein regions that are connected by a  scar   an extended defect connecting the edges of two continuous regularly packed protein layers thus instead of a holey protein array the experimental model presented here appears to consist of a continuous array of     proteins enveloping the core in which regular regions are separated by extended areas of disorder
