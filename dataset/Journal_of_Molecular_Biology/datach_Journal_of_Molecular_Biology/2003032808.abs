a kinase anchoring protein akap interaction and dimerization of the ri  and ri  regulatory subunits of protein kinase a in vivo by the yeast two hybrid system
protein kinase a pka regulatory r subunits dimerize through an n terminal motif such dimerization is necessary for binding to pka anchoring proteins akaps and targeting of pka to its site of action in the present study we used the yeast two hybrid system as an in vivo bio reporter assay and analyzed the formation of homo and heterodimeric complexes of ri  and ri  as well as akap binding of ri dimers native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis page of yeast extracts confirmed the two hybrid data both ri  and ri  homodimers as well as an ri  ri  heterodimer were observed single double and one triple mutation were introduced into the ri  and ri  subunits and dimerization properties of the mutants were analyzed consistent with previous reports ri  c h dimerized although the disulfide bridges were disrupted whereas the additional mutation of f  or f  abolished the dimerization corresponding mutations c h f a f a in ri  were not sufficient to abolish the ri  dimerization indicating that additional or other amino acids are important ri  ri  heterodimers of the mutants were formed at intermediate stringency analysis of ternary complexes by the yeast two hybrid system revealed that ri  and ri  homodimers as well as an ri  ri  heterodimer and several of the mutants were able to bind to the r binding domain of akap  d akap  furthermore an ri  akap  complex was identified following introduction of ri  into hek  cells importantly ri  revealed akap binding properties similar to those of ri  indicating that ri  holoenzymes may be anchored
