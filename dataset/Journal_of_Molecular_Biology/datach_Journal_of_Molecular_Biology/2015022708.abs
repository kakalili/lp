bactobolin a binds to a site on the  s ribosome distinct from previously seen antibiotics
the ribosome is the target of a large number of antibiotics here we report a    resolution crystal structure of bactobolin a bound to  s ribosome  trna complex the antibiotic binds at a previously unseen site in the  s subunit and displaces trna bound at the p site it thus likely has a similar mechanism of action as blasticidin s despite binding to a different site the structure also rationalizes previously identified resistance mutations
