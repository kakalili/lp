functional studies of potential intrastrand triplex elements in the escherichia coli genome
we previously used a pattern recognition program for nucleic acids to detect sequences with the potential to form intrastrand triplexes potential intrastrand triplex pit element families were found in escherichia coli synechocystis sp and haemophilus influenza we were particularly intrigued with the family found in e coli which contained  dispersed copies of a particular pit sequence corresponding to the purine triplex motif e coli pit elements appear to occur exclusively in non coding regions we now report biochemical experiments testing the interaction of e coli pit elements with polymerases and single stranded dna binding protein ssb  the elements were also tested in genetic experiments as promoters transcription terminators or replication pause sites in e coli we show that pit elements display provocative characteristics in certain biochemical assays when appropriately oriented the elements block elongation by taq dna polymerase at   c but not elongation by t dna polymerase at   c the g rich strand of the e coli pit sequence folds into a form with reduced affinity for ssb on the other hand in vivo studies did not detect replication delays for conjugal transfer of episomes containing pit elements these sequences were shown not to act as promoters but the presence of pit elements in rna leaders upstream of a coding region could strongly influence expression of the downstream gene these effects were shown to be post transcriptional and were solely dependent on the watson  crick stem  loop structure within the pit element thus although pit element dna displays unusual biochemical properties it remains unknown how these elements arose and why they persist in the e coli genome
