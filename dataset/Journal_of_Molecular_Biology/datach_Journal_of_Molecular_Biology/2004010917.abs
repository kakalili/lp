functional activity of eukaryotic signal sequences in escherichia coli the ovalbumin family of serine protease inhibitors
it is widely assumed that the functional activity of signal sequences has been conserved throughout evolution at least between gram negative bacteria and eukaryotes the ovalbumin family of serine protease inhibitors serpins provides a unique tool to test this assumption since individual members can be secreted ovalbumin  cytosolic leukocyte elastase inhibitor lei  or targeted to both compartments plasminogen activator inhibitor  pai   the facultative secretion of pai  is mediated by a signal sequence proposed to be inefficient by design we show here that the same internal domain that promotes an inefficient translocation of murine pai  in mammalian cells is a weak signal sequence in escherichia coli in contrast the ovalbumin signal sequence is much more efficient whereas the corresponding sequence elements from lei maspin and pi  are entirely devoid of signal sequence activity in e coli mutations that improve the activity of the pai  signal sequence and that convert the n terminal regions of maspin and pi  into efficient signal sequences have been characterized taken together these results indicate that several structural features contribute to the weak activity of the pai  signal sequence and provide new insights into the plasticity of the  hydrophobic core  of signal sequences high level expression of two chimeric proteins containing the pai  signal sequence is toxic and the reduced viability is accompanied by a rapid decrease in the membrane proton motive force in atp levels and in translation in unc  cells which lack the f f atp synthase the chimeric proteins retain their toxicity and their expression only affected the proton motive force thus the properties of these toxic signal sequences offer a new tool to dissect the interactions of signal sequences with the protein export machinery
