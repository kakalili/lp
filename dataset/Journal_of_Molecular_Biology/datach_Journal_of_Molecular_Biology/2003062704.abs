site of functional interaction of release factor  with the ribosome
ribosomal protein l  consists of a c terminal and an n terminal domain to determine the importance of each domain for interaction with release factor  which works specifically at the uag termination codon we constructed escherichia coli strains lacking either the entire l  protein or just the n terminal portion strains lacking l  exhibited uag suppression defective growth and high temperature lethality phenotypes that were reversed by expression of l  protein from a plasmid strains lacking only the n terminal portion of l  grew well at physiological temperatures and survived at high temperature but they were defective in uag dependent termination our results show for the first time that it is precisely the n terminal part of ribosomal protein l  that is required for the functional interaction of release factor  with the ribosome in the cell
