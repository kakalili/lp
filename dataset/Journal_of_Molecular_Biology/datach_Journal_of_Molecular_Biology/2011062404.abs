light induced conformational change and transient dissociation reaction of the bluf photoreceptor synechocystis pixd slr
the light induced reaction of the bluf blue light photoreceptor using flavin adenine dinucleotide photoreceptor pixd from synechocystis sp pcc   slr   was investigated using the time resolved transient grating method a conformational change coupled with a volume contraction of   ml mol   was observed with a time constant of   ms following photoexcitation at a weak excitation light intensity there were no further changes in volume and diffusion coefficient d  the determined d value        m s   suggests that pixd exists as a decamer in solution and this oligomeric state was confirmed by size exclusion chromatography and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis surprisingly by increasing the excitation laser power we observed a large increase in d with a time constant of   ms following the volume contraction reaction the d value of this photoproduct species        m s   is close to that of the pixd dimer combined with transient grating and size exclusion chromatography measurements under light illuminated conditions the light induced increase in d was attributed to a transient dissociation reaction of the pixd decamer to a dimer for the m a mutated pixd no volume or d change was observed furthermore we showed that the m a mutant did not form the decamer but only the dimer in the dark state these results indicate that the formation of the decamer and the conformational change around the met residue are important factors that control the regulation of the downstream signal transduction by the pixd photoreceptor
