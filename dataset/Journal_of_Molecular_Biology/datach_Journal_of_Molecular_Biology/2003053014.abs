regulation of reca protein binding to dna by opposing effects of atp and adp on inter domain contacts analysis by urea induced unfolding of wild type and c terminal truncated reca
reca protein requires atp and its hydrolysis to adp to complete the dna strand exchange reaction we investigated how the nucleotides activate reca by examining their effect on urea induced unfolding which could reflect domain  domain contact of protein reca is folded into three continuous domains the n terminal central and c terminal domains the fluorescence of tyrosine residues which lie mainly in the central domain was modified in    m urea while the red shift of fluorescence peak of the tryptophan residues located in the c terminal domain occurred only in    m urea thus the c terminal domain of reca is unfolded after the central part unfolds the change in intensity of tryptophan fluorescence without a large shift in the peak at low concentrations of urea suggests that there are weak interactions between the central and c terminal domains this is supported by our observation that reca protein lacking the c terminal tail unfolded at lower concentrations of urea than the entire reca and with clear transitions unlike the entire reca atp and its unhydrolyzable analog atp s  which enhance the binding of reca to dna facilitated the urea induced change in reca tryptophan fluorescence while adp an antagonist of atp prevented the change atp probably weakens the domain  domain contact and facilitates the dna binding while adp stabilizes the contact and inhibits it supporting this conclusion the binding of reca lacking the c terminal tail to dna was not inhibited by adp while that of the intact reca was
