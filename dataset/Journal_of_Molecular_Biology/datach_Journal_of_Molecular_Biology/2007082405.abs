evidence for an interaction between the sh domain and the n terminal extension of the essential light chain in class ii myosins
the function of the src homology  sh  domain in class ii myosins a distinct  barrel structure remains unknown here we provide evidence using electron cryomicroscopy in conjunction with light scattering fluorescence and kinetic analyses that the sh domain facilitates the binding of the n terminal extension of the essential light chain isoform elc  to actin the  residue extension contains four conserved lysine residues followed by a repeating sequence of seven pro ala residues it is widely believed that the highly charged region interacts with actin while the pro ala rich sequence forms a rigid tether that bridges the    nm distance between the myosin lever arm and the thin filament in order to localize the n terminus of elc in the actomyosin complex an engineered cys was reacted with undecagold maleimide and the labeled elc was exchanged into myosin subfragment  s  electron cryomicroscopy of s bound actin filaments together with computer based docking of the skeletal s crystal structure into d reconstructions showed a well defined peak for the gold cluster near the sh domain given that sh domains are known to bind proline rich ligands we suggest that the n terminal extension of elc interacts with actin and modulates myosin kinetics by binding to the sh domain during the atpase cycle
