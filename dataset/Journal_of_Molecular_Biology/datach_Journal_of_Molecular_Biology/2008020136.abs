conformation of pseudoazurin in the   kda electron transfer complex with nitrite reductase determined by paramagnetic nmr
copper containing nitrite reductase is able to catalyze the reduction of nitrite with a turnover rate of several hundreds per second electrons for the reaction are donated by the electron transfer protein pseudoazurin the process of protein complex formation electron transfer and dissociation must occur on the millisecond timescale to enable the fast turnover of the enzyme the structure of this transient protein complex has been studied using paramagnetic nmr spectroscopy gadolinium complexes were attached specifically through two engineered cys residues on three sites on the surface of nitrite reductase causing strong distance dependent relaxation effects on the residues of pseudoazurin docking of the two proteins based on these nmr derived distance restraints and the chemical shift perturbation data shows convergence to a cluster of structures with an average root mean square deviation of     the binding interface consists of polar and non polar residues surrounded by charges the interprotein distance between the two type  copper sites is         enabling fast interprotein electron transfer the nmr based lower limit estimate of   s   for the dissociation rate constant and the fast electron transfer are consistent with the transient nature of the complex
