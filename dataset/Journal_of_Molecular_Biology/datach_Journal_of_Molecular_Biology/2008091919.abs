picomolar affinity fibronectin domains engineered utilizing loop length diversity recursive mutagenesis and loop shuffling
the  th type iii domain of human fibronectin fn  has been validated as an effective scaffold for molecular recognition in the current work it was desired to improve the robustness of selection of stable high affinity fn domains a yeast surface display library of fn was created in which three solvent exposed loops were diversified in terms of amino acid composition and loop length the library was screened by fluorescence activated cell sorting to isolate binders to lysozyme an affinity maturation scheme was developed to rapidly and broadly diversify populations of clones by random mutagenesis as well as homologous recombination driven shuffling of mutagenized loops the novel library and affinity maturation scheme combined to yield stable monomeric fn domains with  pm affinity for lysozyme a secondary affinity maturation identified a stable   pm binder the highest affinity yet reported for an fn domain in addition to extension of the affinity limit for this scaffold the results demonstrate the ability to achieve high affinity binding while preserving stability and the monomeric state this library design and affinity maturation scheme is highly efficient utilizing an initial diversity of    clones and screening only    mutants totaled over all affinity maturation libraries  analysis of intermediate populations revealed that loop length diversity loop shuffling and recursive mutagenesis of diverse populations are all critical components
