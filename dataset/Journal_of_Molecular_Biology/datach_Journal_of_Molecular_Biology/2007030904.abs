crystal structures of human ipp isomerase new insights into the catalytic mechanism
type i isopentenyl diphosphate ipp  dimethylally diphosphate dmapp isomerase is an essential enzyme in human isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway it catalyzes isomerization of the carbon carbon double bonds in ipp and dmapp which are the basic building blocks for the subsequent biosynthesis we have determined two crystal structures of human ipp isomerase i hippi under different crystallization conditions high similarity between structures of human and escherichia coli ipp isomerases proves the conserved catalytic mechanism unexpectedly one of the hippi structures contains a natural substrate analog ethanol amine pyrophosphate eapp  based on this structure a water molecule is proposed to be the direct proton donor for ipp and different conformations of ipp and dmapp bound in the enzyme are also proposed in addition structures of human ippi show a flexible n terminal  helix covering the active pocket and blocking the entrance which is absent in e coli ippi besides the active site conformation is not the same in the two hippi structures such difference leads to a hypothesis that substrate binding induces conformational change in the active site the inhibition mechanism of high mn  concentrations is also discussed
