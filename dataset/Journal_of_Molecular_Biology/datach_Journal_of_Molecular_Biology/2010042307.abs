the subunit interfaces of weakly associated homodimeric proteins
we analyzed subunit interfaces in   homodimers with an x ray structure in the protein data bank validated by checking the literature for data that indicate that the proteins are dimeric in solution and that in the case of the  weak  dimers the homodimer is in equilibrium with the monomer the interfaces of the  weak dimers which are smaller by a factor of   on average than in the remainder of the set are comparable in size with antibody  antigen or protease  inhibitor interfaces nevertheless they are more hydrophobic than in the average transient protein  protein complex and similar in amino acid composition to the other homodimer interfaces the mean numbers of interface hydrogen bonds and hydration water molecules per unit area are also similar in homodimers and transient complexes parameters related to the atomic packing suggest that many of the weak dimer interfaces are loosely packed and we suggest that this contributes to their low stability to evaluate the evolutionary selection pressure on interface residues we calculated the shannon entropy of homologous amino acid sequences at   sequence identity in   of the homodimers the interface residues are better conserved than the residues on the protein surface the weak dimers display the same high degree of interface conservation as other homodimers but their homologs may be heterodimers as well as homodimers their interfaces may be good models in terms of their size composition and evolutionary conservation for the labile subunit contacts that allow protein assemblies to share and exchange components allosteric proteins to undergo quaternary structure transitions and molecular machines to operate in the cell
