the alzheimer s amyloid      peptide forms off pathway oligomers and fibrils that are distinguished structurally by intermolecular organization
increasing evidence suggests that soluble aggregates of amyloid   a  initiate the neurotoxicity that eventually leads to dementia in alzheimer s disease knowledge on soluble aggregate structures will enhance our understanding of the relationship between structures and toxicities our group has reported a stable and homogeneous preparation of a      oligomers that has been characterized by various biophysical techniques here we have further analyzed this species by solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and compared nmr results to similar observations on amyloid fibrils nmr experiments on a      oligomers reveal chemical shifts of labeled residues that are indicative of  strand secondary structure results from two dimensional dipolar assisted rotational resonance experiments indicate proximities between i  aliphatic and f  aromatic carbons an isotope dilution experiment further indicates that these contacts between f  and i  are intermolecular contrary to models of a  oligomers proposed previously by others for a      fibrils we observed similar nmr lineshapes and inter side chain contacts indicating similar secondary and quaternary structures the most prominent structural differences between a      oligomers and fibrils were observed through measurements of intermolecular  c   c dipolar couplings observed in pithirds ct experiments pithirds ct data indicate that unlike fibrils oligomers are not characterized by in register parallel  sheets structural similarities and differences between a      oligomers and fibrils suggest that folded  strand peptide conformations form early in the course of self assembly and that oligomers and fibrils differ primarily in schemes of intermolecular organization distinct intermolecular arrangements between a      oligomers and fibrils may explain why this oligomeric state appears off pathway for monomer self assembly to fibrils
