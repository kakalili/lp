rpod promoters in campylobacter jejuni exhibit a strong periodic signal instead of a    box
we have used a hidden markov model hmm to identify the consensus sequence of the rpod promoters in the genome of campylobacter jejuni the identified promoter consensus sequence is unusual compared to other bacteria in that the region upstream of the tata box does not contain a conserved    region but shows a very strong periodic variation in the at content and semi conserved t stretches with a period of     nucleotides the tata box is in some but not all cases preceded by a tgx similar to an extended    promoter we predicted a total of   presumed rpod promoters in the c jejuni genome of which   were located upstream of annotated genes a similar promoter was identified in helicobacter pylori a close phylogenetic relative of campylobacter but not in escherichia coli vibrio cholerae or six other proteobacterial genomes or in staphylococcus aureus we used upstream regions of high confidence genes as training data n   for the c jejuni genome  we found it necessary to limit the training set to genes that are preceded by an intergenic region of gt  bp or by a gene oriented in the opposite direction to be able to identify a conserved sequence motif and ended up with a training set of   genes this leads to the conclusion that the remaining genes    are more rarely preceded by a rpod promoter and consequently that operon structure may be more widespread in c jejuni than has been assumed by others structural predictions of the regions upstream of the tata box indicates a region of highly curved dna and we assume that this facilitates the wrapping of the dna around the rna polymerase holoenzyme and offsets the absence of a conserved    binding motif
