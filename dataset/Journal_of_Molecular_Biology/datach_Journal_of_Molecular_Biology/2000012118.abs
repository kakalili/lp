active site water molecules revealed in the    resolution structure of a site directed mutant of isocitrate dehydrogenase edited by i a wilson
isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyses the two step acid base oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to  ketoglutarate lysine   was suggested to act as proton donor based on geometry and spatial proximity to isocitrate to clarify further the role of lysine   we co crystallized the lysine to methionine mutant k  m with isocitrate and with  ketoglutarate crystals were flash frozen and the two structures were determined and refined to     several new features were identified relative to the wild type structure seven side chains previously unplaced in the wild type structure were identified and included in the model and the amino acid terminus was extended by an alanine residue many additional water molecules were identified examination of the k  m active sites k  m isocitrate and k  m ketoglutarate revealed that tyrosine   protrudes further into the active site in the presence of either isocitrate or  ketoglutarate in k  m than it does in the wild type structure also methionine   was not as fully extended and asparagine   rotates     toward the ligand permitting polar interactions outside the active site cleft a tetragonal volume of density was identified as a sulfate molecule its location and interactions suggest it may influence the equilibrium between the tetragonal and the orthorhombic forms of isocitrate dehydrogenase differences observed in the active site water structure between the wild type and k  m structures were due to a single point mutation a water molecule was located in the position equivalent to that occupied by the wild type  amine of lysine   a water molecule in that location in k  m suggests it may influence catalysis in the mutant comparison of k  m complexed with isocitrate and  ketoglutarate illuminates the influence a ligand has on active site water structure
