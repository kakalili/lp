identification of the ssb binding site on e coli recq reveals a conserved surface for binding ssb s c terminus
recq dna helicases act in conjunction with heterologous partner proteins to catalyze dna metabolic activities including recombination initiation and stalled replication fork processing for the prototypical escherichia coli recq protein direct interaction with single stranded dna binding protein ssb stimulates its dna unwinding activity complex formation between recq and ssb is mediated by the recq winged helix domain which binds the nine c terminal most residues of ssb a highly conserved sequence known as the ssb ct element using nuclear magnetic resonance and mutational analyses we identify the ssb ct binding pocket on e coli recq the binding site shares a striking electrostatic similarity with the previously identified ssb ct binding site on e coli exonuclease i although the ssb binding domains in the two proteins are not otherwise related structurally substitutions that alter recq residues implicated in ssb ct binding impair recq binding to ssb and ssb dna nucleoprotein complexes these substitutions also diminish ssb stimulated dna helicase activity in the variants although additional biochemical changes in the recq variants indicate a role for the winged helix domain in helicase activity beyond ssb protein binding sequence changes in the ssb ct element are sufficient to abolish interaction with recq in the absence of dna and to diminish recq binding and helicase activity on ssb dna substrates these results support a model in which recq has evolved an ssb ct binding site on its winged helix domain as an adaptation that aids its cellular functions on ssb dna nucleoprotein substrates
