structure of the arsi c  as lyase insights into the mechanism of degradation of organoarsenical herbicides and growth promoters
arsenic is a ubiquitous and carcinogenic environmental element that enters the biosphere primarily from geochemical sources but also through anthropogenic activities microorganisms play an important role in the arsenic biogeochemical cycle by biotransformation of inorganic arsenic into organic arsenicals and vice versa arsi is a microbial non heme ferrous dependent dioxygenase that transforms toxic methylarsenite mas iii  to less toxic and carcinogenic inorganic arsenite as iii  by c  as bond cleavage an arsi ortholog tcarsi from the thermophilic bacterium thermomonospora curvata was expressed purified and crystallized the structure was solved in both the apo form and with ni ii  co ii  or fe iii  the mas iii binding site is a vicinal cysteine pair in a flexible loop a structure with the loop occupied with  mercaptoethanol mimics binding of mas iii  the structure of a mutant protein y  h v  f was solved in two different crystal forms with two other orientations of the flexible loop these results suggest that a loop gating mechanism controls the catalytic reaction in the ligand free open state the loop is exposed to solvent where it can bind mas iii  the loop moves toward the active site where it forms a closed state that orients the c  as bond for dioxygen addition and cleavage elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism of this unprecedented c  as lyase reaction will enhance our understanding of recycling of environmental organoarsenicals
