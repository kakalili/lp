limulus polyphemus hemocyanin     cryo em structure sequence analysis molecular modelling and rigid body fitting reveal the interfaces between the eight hexamers
the blue copper protein hemocyanin from the horseshoe crab limulus polyphemus is among the largest respiratory proteins found in nature   mda and exhibits a highly cooperative oxygen binding its  subunits are arranged as eight hexamers   mers that form the native   mer in a nested hierarchy of   mers and   mers this quaternary structure is established by eight subunit types termed i iia ii iiia iiib iv v and vi  of which only type ii has been sequenced crystal structures of the   mer are available but for the   mer only a     d reconstruction exists consequently the structural parameters of the   mer are not firmly established and the molecular interfaces between the eight hexamers are still to be defined this however is crucial for understanding how allosteric transitions are mediated between the different levels of hierarchy here we show the    structure fsc  bit criterion of the oxygenated   mer from cryo electron microscopy cryo em and single particle analysis moreover we show its molecular model as obtained by dna sequencing of subunits ii iiia iv and vi and molecular modelling and rigid body fitting of all subunit types remarkably the latter enabled us to improve the resolution of the cryo em structure from    to the final     the    structure allows firm assessment of various structural parameters of the   mer the   mer and the   mer and reveals a total of  inter hexamer bridges these group as  types of interface four at the   mer level ii  ii ii  iv v  vi iv  vi  three form the   mer v  v v  vi vi  iiib iv v  and four are required to assemble the   mer iiia  iiia iiia  iiib ii  iv iv  iv  the molecular model shows the amino acid residues involved and reveals that several of the interfaces are intriguingly histidine rich and likely to transfer allosteric signals between the different levels of the nested hierarchy
