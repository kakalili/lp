open  structures of murd domain movements and structural similarities with folylpolyglutamate synthetase edited by r huber
udp n acetylmuramoyl l alanine d glutamate murd ligase catalyses the addition of d glutamate to the nucleotide precursor udp n acetylmuramoyl l alanine uma  the crystal structures of escherichia coli in the substrate free form and murd complexed with uma have been determined at    and     resolution respectively the murd structure comprises three domains each of a topology reminiscent of nucleotide binding folds in the two structures the c terminal domain undergoes a large rigid body rotation away from the n terminal and central domains these two  open  structures were compared with the four published  closed  structures of murd in addition the comparison reveals which regions are affected by the binding of uma atp and d glu also we compare and discuss two structurally characterized enzymes which belong to the same ligase superfamily murd and folylpolyglutamate synthetase fgs  the analysis allows the identification of key residues involved in the reaction mechanism of fgs the determination of the two  open  conformation structures represents a new step towards the complete elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism of the murd ligase
