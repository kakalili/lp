reverse conformational changes of the light chain binding domain of myosin v and vi processive motor heads during and after hydrolysis of atp by small angle x ray solution scattering
we used small angle x ray solution scattering saxs technique to investigate the nucleotide mediated conformational changes of the head domains subfragment  s  of myosin v and vi processive motors that govern their directional preference for motility on actin recombinant myosin v s with two iq motifs mv s iq  and myosin vi s  mvi s  were engineered from sf cells using a baculovirus expression system the radii of gyration rg of nucleotide free mv s iq and mvi s were   and      respectively in the presence of atp the rg value of mv s iq decreased to      while that of mvi s increased to      and the maximum chord length of the molecule decreased by ca  for mv s iq and increased by ca  for mvi s  these opposite directional changes were consistent with those occurring in s s with adp and vi or alf   bound i e  in states mimicking the adp pi bound state of atp hydrolysis  binding of amppnp induced rg changes of both constructs similar to those in the presence of atp suggesting that the timing of the structural changes for their motion on actin is upon binding of atp the pre hydrolysis state during the atpase cycle binding of adp to mv s iq and mvi s caused their rg values to drop below those in the nucleotide free state thus upon the release of pi the reverse conformational change could occur coupling to drive the directional motion on actin the amount of rg change upon the release of pi was ca   times greater in mvi s than in mv s iq  relating to the production of the large stroke of the mvi motor during its translocation on actin atomic structural models for these s s based upon the ab initio shape reconstruction from x ray scattering data were constructed showing that mvi s has the light chain binding domain positioned in the opposite direction to mv s iq in both the pre and post powerstroke transition the angular change between the light chain binding domains of mv s iq in the pre to post powerstroke transition was     comparable to that of mii s  on the other hand that of mvi s was     or     much less than the currently postulated changes to allow the maximal stroke size of myosin vi s but still significantly larger than those of other myosins reported so far the results suggest that some additional alterations or elements are required for mvi s to take maximal working strokes along the actin filament
