evaluating the effects of enhanced processivity and metal ions on translesion dna replication catalyzed by the bacteriophage t dna polymerase
the fidelity of dna replication is achieved in a multiplicative process encompassing nucleobase selection and insertion removal of misinserted nucleotides by exonuclease activity and enzyme dissociation from primer templates that are misaligned due to mispairing in this study we have evaluated the effect of altering these kinetic processes on the dynamics of translesion dna replication using the bacteriophage t replication apparatus as a model system the effect of enhancing the processivity of the t dna polymerase gp  on translesion dna replication was evaluated using a defined in vitro assay system while the t replicase gp  in complex with gp  can perform efficient processive replication using unmodified dna the t replicase cannot extend beyond an abasic site this indicates that enhancing the processivity of gp  does not increase unambiguously its ability to perform translesion dna replication surprisingly the replicase composed of an exonuclease deficient mutant of gp  was unable to extend beyond the abasic dna lesion thus indicating that molecular processes involved in dna polymerization activity play the predominant role in preventing extension beyond the non coding dna lesion although neither t replicase complex could extend beyond the lesion there were measurable differences in the stability of each complex at the dna lesion specifically the exonuclease deficient replicase dissociates at a rate constant koff of  s   while the wild type replicase remains more stably associated at the site of dna damage by virtue of a slower measured rate constant koff   s    the increased lifetime of the wild type replicase suggests that idle turnover the partitioning of the replicase from its polymerase to its exonuclease active site may play an important role in maintaining fidelity further attempts to perturb the fidelity of the t replicase by substituting mn  for mg  did not significantly enhance dna synthesis beyond the abasic dna lesion the results of these studies are interpreted with respect to current structural information of gp  alone and complexed with gp
