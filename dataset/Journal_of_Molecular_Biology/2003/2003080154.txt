Typical RNA-based cellular catalysts achieve their active structures only as complexes with protein cofactors, implying that protein binding compensates for some structural deficiencies in the RNA. An unresolved question was the extent to which protein-facilitation imposes additional structural costs, by requiring that an RNA maintain structures required for protein binding, beyond those required for catalysis. We used nucleotide analog interference to identify initially 71 functional group substitutions at phosphate, 2′-ribose, and adenosine base positions that compromise RNA self-splicing in the bI5 group I intron. Protein-facilitated splicing by CBP2 suppresses 11 of 30 interfering substitutions at the RNA backbone and a greater fraction, 27 of 41, at the adenosine base, including at structures conserved among group I introns. Only one substitution directly interferes with protein binding but not with self-splicing. This substitution, plus three adenosine base modifications that interfere more strongly in CBP2-dependent splicing than in self-splicing, yield a cost for protein facilitation of only four functional groups, as approximated by this set of analogs. The small observed structural cost provides a strong physical rationale for the evolutionary drive from RNA to RNP-based function in biology. Remarkably, the four extra requirements do not appear to report disruption of direct protein–RNA contacts and instead likely reflect design against misfolding rather than for maintenance of a protein-binding site.
