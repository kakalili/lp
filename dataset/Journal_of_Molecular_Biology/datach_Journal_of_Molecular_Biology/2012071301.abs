dda helicase tightly couples translocation on single stranded dna to unwinding of duplex dna dda is an optimally active helicase
helicases utilize the energy of atp hydrolysis to unwind double stranded dna while translocating on the dna mechanisms for melting the duplex have been characterized as active or passive depending on whether the enzyme actively separates the base pairs or simply sequesters single stranded dna ssdna that forms due to thermal fraying here we show that dda translocates unidirectionally on ssdna at the same rate at which it unwinds double stranded dna in both ensemble and single molecule experiments further the unwinding rate is largely insensitive to the duplex stability and to the applied force thus dda transduces all of its translocase activity into dna unwinding activity so that the rate of unwinding is limited by the rate of translocation and that the enzyme actively separates the duplex active and passive helicases have been characterized by dividing the velocity of dna unwinding in base pairs per second vun by the velocity of translocation on ssdna in nucleotides per second vtrans  if the resulting fraction is    then a helicase is considered to be at the lower end of the  active  range in the case of dda the average dna unwinding velocity was     bp s and the average translocation velocity was     nt s the vun vtrans value of   places dda in a unique category of being an essentially  perfectly  active helicase
