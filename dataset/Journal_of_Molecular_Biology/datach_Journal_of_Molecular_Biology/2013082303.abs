partitioning rs domain phosphorylation in an sr protein through the clk and srpk protein kinases
sr proteins are essential splicing factors whose biological function is regulated through phosphorylation of their c terminal rs domains prior studies have shown that cytoplasmic  nuclear translocalization of the sr protein srsf is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of a long arg ser repeat in the n terminus of the rs domain while subnuclear localization is controlled by phosphorylation of a shorter arg ser repeat along with several ser pro dipeptides in the c terminus of the rs domain to better understand how these two kinases partition arg ser versus ser pro specificities we monitored the phosphorylation of srsf by clk and srpk  although srpk initially binds at the center of the rs domain phosphorylating in an orderly n terminal direction clk makes widespread contacts in the rs domain and generates multiple enzyme  substrate complexes that induce a random addition mechanism while srpk rapidly phosphorylates n terminal serines srpk and clk display similar activities toward arg ser repeats in the c terminus suggesting that these kinases may not separate function in a strict linear manner along the rs domain clk induces a unique gel shift in srsf that is not the result of enhanced arg ser phosphorylation but rather is the direct result of the phosphorylation of several ser pro dipeptides these prolines are important for binding and phosphorylation of the sr protein by clk but not for the srpk dependent reaction the data establish a new view of sr protein regulation in which srpk and clk partition activities based on ser pro versus arg ser placement rather than on n and c terminal preferences along the rs domain
