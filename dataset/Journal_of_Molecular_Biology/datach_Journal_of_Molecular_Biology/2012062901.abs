structural comparison of mouse and human  synuclein amyloid fibrils by solid state nmr
fibrillar  synuclein as is the major component of lewy bodies the pathological hallmark of parkinson s disease mouse as mas aggregates much faster than human as has  although mas differs from has at only seven positions in its primary sequence currently little is known about the site specific structural differences between mas and has fibrils here we applied state of the art solid state nuclear magnetic resonance ssnmr methods to structurally characterize mas fibrils the assignment strategy employed a set of high resolution d and d ssnmr spectra recorded on uniformly  c  n    c glucose and   c glucose labeled mas fibrils an almost complete resonance assignment   of backbone amide  n and   of all  c nuclei was obtained for residues from gly  to val  which form the core of mas fibrils six  strands were identified to be within the fibril core of mas based on a secondary chemical shift and nhhc analysis intermolecular  c  n labeled restraints obtained from mixed    c  n labeled mas fibrils reveal a parallel in register supramolecular  sheet arrangement the results were compared in detail to recent structural studies on has fibrils and indicate the presence of a structurally conserved motif comprising residues glu   lys
