engineering stable cytoplasmic intrabodies with designed specificity
many attempts have been made to develop antibody fragments that can be expressed in the cytoplasm   intrabodies   in a stable and functional form the recombinant antibody fragment scfv f  is characterised by peculiarly high in vitro stability and functional folding in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cytoplasm to dissect the relative contribution of different scfv f  regions to cytoplasmic stability and specificity we designed and constructed five chimeric molecules scfv p to p  in which several groups of residues important for antigen binding in the poorly stable anti hen egg lysozyme hel scfv d   were progressively grafted onto the scfv f  scaffold all five chimeric scfvs were expressed in a soluble form in the periplasm and cytoplasm of escherichia coli all the periplasmic oxidised forms and the scfv p  extracted from the cytoplasm in reducing conditions had hel binding affinities essentially identical kd  nm to that of the cognate scfv d   fragment kd  nm the successful grafting of the antigen binding properties of d  onto the scfv f  opens the road to the exploitation of this molecule as a scaffold for the reshaping of intrabodies with desired specificities to be targeted to the cytoplasm
