equivalent mutations in the eight subunits of the chaperonin cct produce dramatically different cellular and gene expression phenotypes
the eukaryotic cytoplasmic chaperonin containing tcp  cct is a complex formed by two back to back stacked hetero octameric rings that assists the folding of actins tubulins and other proteins in an atp dependent manner here we tested the significance of the hetero oligomeric nature of cct in its function by introducing in each of the eight subunits in turn an identical mutation at a position that is conserved in all the subunits and is involved in atp hydrolysis in order to establish the extent of  individuality  of the various subunits our results show that these identical mutations lead to dramatically different phenotypes for example saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells with the mutation in subunit cct display heat sensitivity and cold sensitivity for growth have an excess of actin patches and are the only strain here generated that is pseudo diploid by contrast cells with the mutation in subunit cct are the only ones to accumulate juxtanuclear protein aggregates that may reflect an impaired stress response in this strain system level analysis of the strains using rna microarrays reveals connections between cct and several cellular networks including ribosome biogenesis and tor  that help to explain the phenotypic variability observed
