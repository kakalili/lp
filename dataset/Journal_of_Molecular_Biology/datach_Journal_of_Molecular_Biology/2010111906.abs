the osmolyte tmao stabilizes native rna tertiary structures in the absence of mg  evidence for a large barrier to folding from phosphate dehydration
the stabilization of rna tertiary structures by ions is well known but the neutral osmolyte trimethylamine oxide tmao can also effectively stabilize rna tertiary structure to begin to understand the physical basis for the effects of tmao on rna we have quantitated the tmao induced stabilization of five rnas with known structures so called m values the increment in unfolding free energy per molal of osmolyte at constant kcl activity are   for a hairpin secondary structure and between   and    kcal mol   m   for four rna tertiary structures      nt  further analysis of two rnas by small angle x ray scattering and hydroxyl radical probing shows that tmao reduces the radius of gyration of the unfolded ensemble to the same endpoint as seen in titration with mg  and that the structures stabilized by tmao and mg  are indistinguishable remarkably tmao induces the native conformation of a mg  ion chelation site formed in part by a buried phosphate even though mg  is absent tmao interacts weakly if at all with kcl ruling out the possibility that tmao stabilizes rna indirectly by increasing salt activity tmao is however strongly excluded from the vicinity of dimethylphosphate unfavorable interaction free energy    cal mol   m   for the potassium salt  an ion that mimics the rna backbone phosphate we suggest that formation of rna tertiary structure is accompanied by substantial phosphate dehydration loss of     water molecules in the rna structures studied and that tmao works principally by reducing the energetic penalty associated with this dehydration the strong parallels we find between the effects of tmao and mg  suggest that rna sequence is more important than specific ion interactions in specifying the native structure
