rapid conformational epitope mapping of anti gp  antibodies with a designed mutant panel displayed on yeast
gp  is a substrate for protein engineering both for human immunodeficiency virus hiv immunogen design and as a bait for isolating anti hiv antibodies from patient samples in this work we describe the display of a stripped core gp  on the yeast cell surface validation against a panel of neutralizing antibodies confirms that yeast displayed gp  presents the cd binding site in the correct conformation we map the epitope of the broadly neutralizing anti gp  antibody vrc  using both a random mutagenesis library and a defined mutant panel and find that the resultant epitope maps are consistent with one another and with the crystallographically identified contact residues mapping the vrc  competitive antibodies b  and b  reveals energetic differences in their epitopes that are not obvious from existing crystal structures these data suggest mutation sets that abrogate binding to broadly neutralizing antibodies with greater specificity than the canonical mutation d  r useful in rapidly assessing the nature of a vaccine response
