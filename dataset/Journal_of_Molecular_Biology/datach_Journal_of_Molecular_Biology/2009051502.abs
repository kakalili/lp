structural mimicry of o antigen by a peptide revealed in a complex with an antibody raised against shigella flexneri serotype a
the use of carbohydrate mimicking peptides to induce immune responses against surface polysaccharides of pathogenic bacteria offers a novel approach to vaccine development factors governing antigenic and immunogenic mimicry however are complex and poorly understood we have addressed this question using the anti lipopolysaccharide monoclonal antibody f   which was raised against shigella flexneri serotype a and shown to protect against homologous infection in a mouse model in a previous crystallographic study we described f   in complex with two synthetic fragments of the o antigen the serotype specific saccharide moiety of lipopolysaccharide here we present a crystallographic and nmr study of the interaction of f   with a dodecapeptide selected by phage display using the monoclonal antibody like the synthetic decasaccharide the peptide binds to f   with micromolar affinity although the peptide and decasaccharide use very similar regions of the antigen binding site indicating good antigenic mimicry immunogenic mimicry by the peptide was not observed the f    antigen interaction is significantly more hydrophobic with the peptide than with oligosaccharides nonetheless all hydrogen bonds formed between the peptide and f   have equivalents in the oligosaccharide complex two bridging water molecules are also in common adding to partial structural mimicry whereas the bound peptide is entirely helical its structure in solution as shown by nmr is helical in the central region only moreover docking the nmr structure into the antigen binding site shows that steric hindrance would occur revealing poor complementarity between the major solution conformation and the antibody that could contribute to the absence of immunogenic mimicry
