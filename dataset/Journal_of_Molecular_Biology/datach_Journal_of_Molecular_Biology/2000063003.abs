the anti  factor spoiiab forms a   complex with  f contacting multiple conserved regions of the  factor edited by r ebright
the developmental regulatory protein  f of bacillus subtilis a member of the   family of bacterial rna polymerase  factors is negatively regulated by the anti  factor spoiiab which binds to  f sequestering it in an inactive complex spoiiab binding to  f is strongly stimulated by atp here we use a combination of gel filtration chromatography dynamic light scattering analytical ultracentrifugation limited proteolysis with n terminal sequencing and electrospray mass spectrometry and deletion analysis to probe the spoiiab  f complex the studies were facilitated by investigating the homologs from bacillus stearothermophilus as well as co expression of the proteins in escherichia coli allowing purification of large quantities of the in vivo assembled complex we determined the stoichiometry of the complex to be spoiiab   f alone  f is rapidly degraded by the protease trypsin in the complex with spoiiab however  f is remarkably resistant to proteolysis analysis of the protease cleavage data indicates the anti  binds  f through contacts with mutliple conserved regions of the  factor supporting previous findings based on genetic data
