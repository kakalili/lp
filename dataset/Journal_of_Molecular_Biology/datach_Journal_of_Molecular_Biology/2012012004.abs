the structure and enzymatic properties of a novel rnase ii family enzyme from deinococcus radiodurans
exoribonucleases are vital in nearly all aspects of rna metabolism including rna maturation end turnover and degradation rnase ii and rnase r are paralogous members of the rnr superfamily of nonspecific        processive exoribonucleases in escherichia coli rnase ii plays a primary role in mrna decay and has a preference for unstructured rna rnase r in contrast is capable of digesting structured rna and plays a role in the degradation of both mrna and stable rna deinococcus radiodurans a radiation resistant bacterium contains two rnr family members the shorter of these drr  includes a sequence signature typical of rnase r but we show here that this enzyme is an rnase ii type exonuclease and cannot degrade structured rna we also report the crystal structure of this protein now termed drii the drii structure reveals a truncated rna binding region in which the n terminal cold shock domains typical of most rnr family nucleases are replaced by an unusual winged helix  turn  helix domain where the  wing  is contributed by the c terminal s domain consistent with its truncated rna binding region drii is able to remove   overhangs from rna molecules closer to duplexes than do other rnase ii type enzymes drii also displays distinct sensitivity to pyrimidine rich regions of single stranded rna and is able to process trna precursors with adenosine rich   extensions in vitro these data indicate that drii is the rnase ii of d radiodurans and that its structure and catalytic properties are distinct from those of other related enzymes
