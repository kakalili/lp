the tudor domain of the phd finger protein  is a dual reader of lysine trimethylation at lysine  of histone h and lysine  of histone variant h t
phf associates with the polycomb repressive complex  and it was demonstrated to stimulate its h k  trimethylation activity we studied the interaction of the phf tudor domain with modified histone peptides and found that it recognizes h k me and h tk me  on the histone variant h t and that it uses the same trimethyllysine binding pocket for the interaction with both peptides since both peptide sequences are very different this result indicates that reading domains can have dual specificities sub nuclear localization studies of full length phf in human hek  cells revealed that it co localizes with k me  but not with k me  and that this co localization depends on the trimethyllysine binding pocket indicating that k me is an in vivo target for the phf tudor domain our data suggest that phf binds to h tk me in human chromatin and h t has a more general role in polycomb regulation
