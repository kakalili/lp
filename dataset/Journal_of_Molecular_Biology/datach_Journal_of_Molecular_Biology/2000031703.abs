mot protein assembly into the bacterial flagellum a model based on mutational analysis of the motb gene edited by j h miller
the   residue motb protein anchors the stator complex of the escherichia coli flagellar motor to the peptidoglycan of the cell wall together with mota it comprises the transmembrane channel that delivers protons to the motor at the outset of the mutational analysis of motb described here we found that the non motile phenotype of a  motab strain was rescued better by a pmota b plasmid than the non motile phenotype of a  motb strain was rescued by a pmotb plasmid transcription in each case was from the inducible tac promoter but relied on the native ribosome binding site rbs  this result confirms that translational coupling to mota is important for normal translation of the motb mrna since overproduction of mota in trans did not improve complementation by pmotb however introduction of an optimized rbs into pmotb to generate pmotbo did to dissect the function of the periplasmic domain of motb site directed mutagenesis was used to replace gln ser and tyr codons scattered throughout motb with amber uag codons plasmid borne motbam genes were introduced into supo supe and supf strains to see what motility defects were imposed by particular amber mutations and whether the defects could be suppressed by amber suppressor trnas inserting the native or heterologous amino acids amber mutations at codon   or earlier in pmotb and at codon   or earlier in pmotbo or pmotab eliminated motility thus in agreement with the deletion analysis of motb by another laboratory we conclude that the portion of motb carboxyl terminal to its peptidoglycan binding motif residues   to   is not essential in strains containing supe or supf alleles motility defects associated with motbam mutations were suppressed weakly if at all in pmotb in contrast motility defects conferred by most motbam mutations in pmotbo or pmotab could be suppressed to a significant extent however the s am q  am q  am q  am y  am and y  am mutations were still suppressed extremely poorly full length motb was present at very low levels in suppressor strains containing the first four mutations but y  am and y  am were suppressed efficiently at the translational level we suggest that a translational pause by suppressor trnas reading uag at these two positions may divert the nascent polypeptide into an alternative folding pathway that traps motb in a non functional conformation we further propose that mota and motb form a stable pre assembly complex in the membrane in this complex motb exists in a form that cannot associate with peptidoglycan and blocks the proton conducting channel opening of the channel and attachment to the cell wall may occur when the complex collides with a flagellar basal body and mota makes specific contacts with the c ring and or the ms ring
