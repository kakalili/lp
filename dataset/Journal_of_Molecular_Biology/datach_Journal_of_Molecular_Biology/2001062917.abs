vps  rabex  and dss  proteins with weak but distinct nucleotide exchange activities for rab proteins edited by j karn
the activities of three rab specific factors with gdp gtp exchange activity vps p rabex  and dss  with their cognate gtpases ypt p rab and ypt p have been analysed quantitatively in contrast to other exchange factors examined and to dss  vps p and by analogy probably rabex  have considerably lower affinity than gdp to the respective gtpases in keeping with this they are relatively weak exchangers with a maximal rate constant for gdp release from the ternary complex between exchange factor gtpase and gdp of ca   s   which is several orders of magnitude lower than for other exchange factors examined if interaction with these proteins is a mandatory aspect of the rab cycle this suggests that the overall rate of cycling might be controlled at this point of the cycle surprisingly dss  which has the thermodynamic potential to displace gdp effectively from ypt p also does this very slowly again with a maximal rate constant of ca   s   an additional and based on present knowledge unique feature of the ypt p dss complex is that the association of gtp or gdp is more than   fold slower than to ypt p thus leading to a long life time of the binary complex between the two proteins even at the high nucleotide concentrations that prevail in the cell this leads to the conclusion that the protein protein complex is likely to have an important biological significance in addition to its probable role in gtp gdp exchange
