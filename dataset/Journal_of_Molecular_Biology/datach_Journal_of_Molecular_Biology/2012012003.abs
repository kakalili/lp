a transporter converted into a sensor a phototaxis signaling mutant of bacteriorhodopsin at
bacteriorhodopsin br and sensory rhodopsin ii srii  homologous photoactive proteins in haloarchaea have different molecular functions br is a light driven proton pump whereas srii is a phototaxis receptor that transmits a light induced conformational change to its transducer htrii despite these distinctly different functions a single residue substitution ala  to thr  in the br retinal binding pocket enables its photochemical reactions to transmit signals to htrii and mediate phototaxis we pursued a crystal structure of the signaling br mutant br a  t to determine the structural changes caused by the a  t mutation and to assess what new photochemistry is likely to be introduced into the br photoactive site we crystallized br a  t from bicelles and solved its structure to     resolution to enable an atomic level comparison the analysis was complemented by molecular dynamics simulation of br mutated in silico three main conclusions regarding the roles of photoactive site residues in signaling emerge from the comparison of br a  t br and srii structures  i the thr  residue in signaling br is positioned nearly identically with respect to the retinal chromophore as in srii consistent with its role in producing a steric conflict with the retinal c  group during photoisomerization proposed earlier to be essential for srii signaling from vibrational spectroscopy and motility measurements  ii tyr   thr  hydrogen bonding critical in srii signaling and mimicked in signaling br is likely auxiliary for example to maintain thr  in the proper position for the steric trigger to occur and iii the primary role of arg  in srii is spectral tuning and not signaling
