chaperone independent folding of type  pilus domains
an elementary step in the assembly of adhesive type  pili of escherichia coli is the folding of structural pilus subunits in the periplasm the previously determined x ray structure of the complex between the type  pilus adhesin fimh and the periplasmic pilus assembly chaperone fimc has shown that fimh consists of a n terminal lectin domain and a c terminal pilin domain and that fimc exclusively interacts with the pilin domain the pilin domain fold which is common to all pilus subunits is characterized by an incomplete  sheet that is completed by a donor strand from fimc in the fimc  fimh complex this together with unsuccessful attempts to refold isolated urea denatured fimh in vitro had suggested that folding of pilin domains strictly depends on sequence information provided by fimc we have now analyzed in detail the folding of fimh and its two isolated domains in vitro we find that not only the lectin domain but also the pilin domain can fold autonomously and independently of fimc however the thermodynamic stability of the pilin domain is very low    kjmol   so that a significant fraction of the domain is unfolded even in the absence of denaturant this explains the high tendency of structural pilus subunits to aggregate non specifically in the absence of stoichiometric amounts of fimc thus pilus chaperones prevent non specific aggregation of pilus subunits by native state stabilization after subunit folding
