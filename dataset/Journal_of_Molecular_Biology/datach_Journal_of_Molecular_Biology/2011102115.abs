inhibition of cullin ring ligases by cycle inhibiting factor evidence for interference with nedd induced conformational control
cycle inhibiting factor cif is produced by pathogenic intracellular bacteria and injected into the host cells via a type iii secretion system cif is known to interfere with the eukaryotic cell cycle by inhibiting the function of cullin ring e ubiquitin ligases crls  cullin proteins form the scaffold protein of crls and are modified with the ubiquitin like protein nedd  which exerts important conformational control required for crl activity cif has recently been shown to catalyze the deamidation of gln  in nedd to glu here we addressed how nedd deamidation inhibits crl activity our results indicate that burkholderia pseudomallei cif also known as chbp inhibits the deconjugation of nedd in vivo by inhibiting binding of the deneddylating cop signalosome csn complex we provide evidence that the reduced binding of csn and the inhibition of crl activity by cif are due to interference with nedd induced conformational control which is dependent on the interaction between the nedd hydrophobic patch and the cullin winged helix b subdomain of note mutation of gln  to glu in ubiquitin an additional target of cif inhibits the interaction between the hydrophobic surface of ubiquitin and the ubiquitin binding protein p  sqstm  showing conceptually that cif activity can impair ubiquitin ubiquitin like protein non covalent interactions our results also suggest that cif may exert additional cellular effects by interfering with the association between ubiquitin and ubiquitin binding proteins
