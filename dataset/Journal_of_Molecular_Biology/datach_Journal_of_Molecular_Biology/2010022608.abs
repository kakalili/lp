helix dynamics in lacy helices ii and iv
biochemical and biophysical studies based upon crystal structures of both a mutant and wild type lactose permease from escherichia coli lacy in an inward facing conformation have led to a model for the symport mechanism in which both sugar and h binding sites are alternatively accessible to both sides of the membrane previous findings indicate that the face of helix ii with asp  is important for the conformational changes that occur during turnover as shown here replacement of asp  at the cytoplasmic end of helix ii particularly with glu abolishes active transport but the mutants retain the ability to bind galactopyranoside in the x ray structure asp  and lys   helix iv lie within      of each other although a double mutant with cys replacements at both position  and position   cross links efficiently single replacements for lys  exhibit very significant transport activity site directed alkylation studies show that sugar binding by the asp  mutants causes closure of the cytoplasmic cavity similar to wild type lacy however strikingly the probability of opening the periplasmic pathway upon sugar binding is markedly reduced taken together with results from previous mutagenesis and cross linking studies these findings lead to a model in which replacement of asp  blocks a conformational transition involving helices ii and iv that is important for opening the periplasmic cavity evidence suggesting that movements of helices ii and iv are coupled functionally with movements in the pseudo symmetrically paired helices viii and x is also presented
