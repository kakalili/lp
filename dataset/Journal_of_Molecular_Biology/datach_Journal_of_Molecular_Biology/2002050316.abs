resolution of a disordered region at the entrance of the human sex hormone binding globulin steroid binding site
the crystal structure of human sex hormone binding globulin shbg has revealed how   dihydrotestosterone intercalates between the two seven stranded  sheets of its amino terminal laminin g like domain however a region of disorder residues   to   of shbg was identified together with a zinc binding site in immediate proximity to the steroid it has been important to resolve the structure of this region because previous studies have suggested that these residues may contribute to steroid binding directly here we present the    and    crystal structures of the amino terminal lg domain of shbg obtained from a tetragonal crystal form and by edta soaking of a trigonal crystal form respectively in both of these new structures residues pro  to arg  are now clearly visible substitution of the two residues leu  gly and lys  ala pointing towards the steroid has shown that only leu  contributes significantly to steroid binding rather than covering the steroid binding pocket in an extended conformation a   helical turn is formed by residues leu  to lys  in this segment unfolding of this secondary structure element can either facilitate the entry of the steroids into the binding site or modulate the important contribution that leu  makes to steroid binding a comparison with previous structures supports the concept that zinc binding re orients the side chain of his   and this residue serves as a lever causing disorder within the loop structure between pro  and arg
