the tryptophan switch changing ligand binding specificity from type i to type ii in sh domains
the ability of certain src homology  sh  domains to bind specifically both type i and type ii polyproline ligands is perhaps the best characterized but also the worst understood example in the family of protein interaction modules a detailed analysis of the structural variations in sh domains with respect to ligand binding specificity together with mutagenesis of sh fyn tyrosine kinase reveal the structural basis for types i and ii binding specificity by sh domains the conserved trp in the sh binding pocket can adopt two different orientations that in turn determine the type of ligand i or ii able to bind to the domain the only exceptions are ligands with leu at positions p   and p  that deviate from standard poly pro angles the motion of the conserved trp depends on the presence of certain residues located in a key position   for fyn  near the binding pocket sh domains placing aromatic residues in this key position are promiscuous by contrast those presenting beta branched or long aliphatic residues block the conserved trp in one of the two possible orientations preventing binding in a type i orientation this is experimentally demonstrated by a single mutation in fyn sh  y  i that abolishes type i ligand binding while preserving binding to type ii ligands thus simple conformational changes governed by simple rules can have profound effects on protein  protein interactions highlighting the importance of structural details to predict protein  protein interactions
