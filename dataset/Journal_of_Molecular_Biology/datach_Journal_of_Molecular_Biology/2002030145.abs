the methyl group of n  me arg containing peptides disturbs the active site geometry of thrombin impairing efficient cleavage
bivalent peptidic thrombin inhibitors consisting of an n terminal d cyclohexylalanine pro n  me arg active site fragment a flexible polyglycine linker and a c terminal hirugen like segment directed towards the fibrinogen recognition exosite inhibit thrombin with ki values in the picomolar range remaining stable in buffered solution at ph   for at least  hours in order to investigate the structural basis of this increased stability the most potent of these inhibitors i   ki  pm  containing an n  me arg thr bond was crystallized in complex with human  thrombin x ray data were collected to    resolution and the crystal structure of this complex was determined the fourier map displays clear electron density for the n terminal fragment and for the exosite binding segment it indicates however that in agreement with edman sequencing the peptide had been cleaved in the crystal presumably due to the long incubation time of  days needed for crystallization and data collection the n  me group is directed toward the carbonyl oxygen atom of ser   pushing the ser  o  atom out of its normal site this structure suggests that upon thrombin binding the scissile peptide bond of the intact peptide and the ser  o  are separated from each other impairing the nucleophilic attack of the ser  o  toward the n  me arg carbonyl group in the time scale of two weeks however cleavage geometries favoured by the crystal allow catalysis at a slow rate
