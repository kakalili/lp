nmr structure of the integral membrane protein ompx
the structure of the integral membrane protein ompx from escherichia coli reconstituted in  kda dhpc micelles ompx dhpc was calculated from   noe upper limit distance constraints the structure determination was based on complete sequence specific assignments for the amide protons and the val leu and ile   methyl groups in ompx which were selectively protonated on a perdeuterated background the solution structure of ompx in the dhpc micelles consists of a well defined eight stranded antiparallel  barrel with successive pairs of  strands connected by mobile loops several long range noes observed outside of the transmembrane barrel characterize an extension of a four stranded  sheet beyond the height of the barrel this protruding  sheet is believed to be involved in intermolecular interactions responsible for the biological functions of ompx the present approach for de novo structure determination should be quite widely applicable to membrane proteins reconstituted in mixed micelles with overall molecular masses up to about   kda and may also provide a platform for additional functional studies
