interplay between network structures regulatory modes and sensing mechanisms of transcription factors in the transcriptional regulatory network of e coli
though the bacterial transcription regulation apparatus is distinct in terms of several structural and functional features from its eukaryotic counterpart the gross structure of the transcription regulatory network trn is believed to be similar in both superkingdoms here we explore the fine structure of the bacterial trn and the underlying  co regulatory network   crn to show that despite the superficial similarities to the trn of the eukaryotic model organism yeast the bacterial networks display entirely different organizational principles in particular unlike in eukaryotes hubs of the bacterial networks are both global regulators and integrators of diverse disparate transcriptional responses these and other organizational differences might correlate with the fundamental differences in gene and promoter organization in the two superkingdoms especially the presence of operons and regulons in bacteria further we explored to find the interplay if any between network structures mode of regulatory interactions and signal sensing of transcription factors tfs in shaping up the bacterial transcriptional regulatory responses for this purpose we first classified tfs according to their regulatory mode activator repressor or dual regulator and sensory mechanism one component systems responding to internal or external signals tfs from two component systems and chromosomal structure modifying tfs in the bacterial model organism escherichia coli and then we studied the overall evolutionary optimization of network structures the incorporation of tfs in different hierarchical elements of the trn appears to involve on a multi dimensional selection process depending on regulatory and sensory modes of tfs in motifs co regulatory associations between tfs of different functional classes and transcript half lives as a result it appears to have generated circuits that allow intricately regulated physiological state changes we identified the biological significance of most of these optimizations which can be further used as the basis to explore similar controls in other bacteria we also show that though on the larger evolutionary scale unrelated tfs have evolved to become hubs within lineages like  proteobacteria there is strong tendency to retain hubs as well as certain higher order network modules that have emerged through lineage specific paralog duplications
