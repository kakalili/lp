the pdb is a covering set of small protein structures
structure comparisons of all representative proteins have been done employing the relative root mean square deviation rmsd from native enables the assessment of the statistical significance of structure alignments of different lengths in terms of a z score two conclusions emerge first proteins with their native fold can be distinguished by their z score second and somewhat surprising all small proteins up to   residues in length have significant structure alignments to other proteins in a different secondary structure and fold class i e    of them have   coverage by a template protein with a rmsd below    and   have   coverage if the restriction that we align proteins only having different secondary structure types is removed then in a representative benchmark set of proteins of   residues or smaller   can be aligned to a single template structure with average sequence identity of    with a rmsd less than   and   average coverage in this sense the current protein data bank pdb is almost a covering set of small protein structures the length of the aligned region relative to the whole protein length does not differ among the top hit proteins indicating that protein structure space is highly dense for larger proteins non related proteins can cover a significant portion of the structure moreover these top hit proteins are aligned to different parts of the target protein so that almost the entire molecule can be covered when combined the number of proteins required to cover a target protein is very small e g the top ten hit proteins can give   coverage below a rmsd of    for proteins up to   residues long these results give a new view of the nature of protein structure space and its implications for protein structure prediction are discussed
