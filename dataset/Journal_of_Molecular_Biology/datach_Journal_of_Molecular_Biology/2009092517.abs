the lim homeodomain protein isl activates insulin gene promoter directly through synergy with beta
the lim homeodomain transcription factor isl  islet factor  is essential for pancreatic islet cell and dorsal mesenchyme development mutations in isl are associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young and type  diabetes whether isl plays a role in the insulin gene expression has not been fully elucidated in the present study we show that isl can synergistically activate insulin gene transcription with beta in pancreatic  cells the protein  protein interactions of isl and beta are directly mediated by the lim domains of isl and the basic helix  loop  helix domain of beta  deletion of the two lim domains of isl enhances the transcriptional activation of the insulin gene indicating a key role for the homeodomain in activating the insulin promoter furthermore isl can bind with the a  box in the rat insulin gene  promoter through its homeodomain isl expression is up regulated at the mrna level in type  diabetes db db mouse model but down regulated by dexamethasone in rat insulinoma cells these results suggest that isl is a transcriptional activator for insulin gene expression and the interactions of isl with beta are required for the transcriptional activity of the insulin gene reduction in isl gene expression appears to be involved in the impairment of insulin expression mediated by dexamethasone
