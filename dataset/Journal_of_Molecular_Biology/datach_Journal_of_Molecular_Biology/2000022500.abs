photocrosslinking of benzophenone labeled single cysteine troponin i mutants to other thin filament proteins edited by p e wright
the interaction sites of rabbit skeletal troponin i tni with troponin c tnc  troponin t tnt  tropomyosin tm and actin were mapped systematically using nine single cysteine residue tni mutants with mutation sites at positions                  or   tni  tni  etc  each mutant was labeled with the heterobifunctional photocrosslinker  maleimidobenzophenone bp mal  and incorporated into the tni tnc binary complex the tni tnc tnt ternary troponin tn complex and the tn tm f actin synthetic thin filament photocrosslinking reactions carried out in the presence and absence of ca  yielded the following results   bp tni photocrosslinked primarily to tnc with a small degree of ca  dependence in all the complex forms   bp tni  tni  and tni  photocrosslinked to tnt with no ca  dependence photocrosslinking to tnc was reduced in the ternary versus the binary complex bp tni  also photocrosslinked to actin with higher yields in the absence of ca  than in its presence   bp tni  and tni  photocrosslinked to actin with much higher yields in the absence than in the presence of ca    bp tni  photocrosslinked to tnc with a small degree of ca  dependence and did not photocrosslink to actin   bp tni  and tni  photocrosslinked to tnc tnt and actin but all with low yields all the labeled mutants photocrosslinked to tnc with varying degrees of ca  dependence and none to tm these results along with those published allowed us to construct a structural and functional model of tni in the tn complex in the presence of ca  residues   of tni interact with the c terminal domain hydrophobic cleft of tnc      with tnt      with tnc  s central helix       with tnc  s n terminal domain hydrophobic cleft and      with tnc  s a helix in the absence of ca  residues      move out of tnc  s n terminal domain hydrophobic cleft and trigger the movements of residues      and      away from tnc and towards actin
