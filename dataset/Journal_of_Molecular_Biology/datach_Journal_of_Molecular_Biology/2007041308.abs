isolation and characterization of conditional alleles of the yeast sir gene
sir is a protein deacetylase that mediates transcriptional silencing at the hm loci telomeres and rdna repeats in yeast to identify functionally significant regions of the sir protein we have characterized two types of mutations first we used random mutagenesis to create temperature sensitive alleles of the sir gene mutations conferring conditional silencing can be isolated throughout the sir gene causing both enzymatic and protein interaction defects we used external deletions to identify regions essential for silencing in the non conserved regions of sir  deletions of the sir n terminal  amino acid residues caused a subtle increase in silencing while deletions encompassing residues      caused loss of sir interactions with both sir and net  this loss of protein interaction correlates with a loss of sir mediated silencing and is consistent with a model in which net and sir compete for interaction with sir  these results indicate that recognition of the binding partners of sir is a key function of non conserved sequences
