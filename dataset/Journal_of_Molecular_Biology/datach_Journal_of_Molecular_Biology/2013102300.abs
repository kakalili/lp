crystal structure of the cmr  cmr subcomplex in the crispr  cas rna silencing effector complex
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr loci found in prokaryotes are transcribed to produce crispr rnas crrnas that together with crispr associated cas proteins target and degrade invading genetic materials cmr proteins cmr    and crrna form a sequence specific rna silencing effector complex here we report the crystal structures of the pyrococcus furiosus cmr  cmr subcomplex bound with nucleotides    amp or atp  the association of cmr and cmr forms an idiosyncratic crevasse which binds the nucleotides cmr shares structural similarity with cas  which cleaves precursor crrna for maturation suggesting the divergent evolution of these proteins due to the structural resemblance the properties of the rna binding surface observed in cas are well conserved in cmr  indicating the rna binding ability of cmr  this surface of cmr constitutes the crevasse observed in the cmr  cmr complex our findings suggest that the cmr  cmr complex uses the crevasse to bind crrna and or substrate rna during the reaction
