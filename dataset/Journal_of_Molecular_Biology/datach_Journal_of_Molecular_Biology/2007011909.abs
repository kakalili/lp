mechanism of template independent nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by a template dependent dna polymerase
numerous template dependent dna polymerases are capable of catalyzing template independent nucleotide additions onto blunt end dna such non canonical activity has been hypothesized to increase the genomic hypermutability of retroviruses including human immunodeficiency viruses here we employed pre steady state kinetics and x ray crystallography to establish a mechanism for blunt end additions catalyzed by sulfolobus solfataricus dpo  our kinetic studies indicated that the first blunt end datp incorporation was  fold more efficient than the second and among natural deoxynucleotides datp was the preferred substrate due to its stronger intrahelical base stacking ability such base stacking contributions are supported by the  fold higher ground state binding affinity of a nucleotide analog pyrene nucleoside   triphosphate which lacks hydrogen bonding ability but possesses four conjugated aromatic rings a     resolution structure of dpo   blunt end dna  ddatp revealed that the base and sugar of the incoming ddatp respectively stack against the   base of the opposite strand and the   base of the elongating strand this unprecedented base stacking pattern can be applied to subsequent blunt end additions only if all incorporated damps are extrahelical leading to predominantly single non templated datp incorporation
