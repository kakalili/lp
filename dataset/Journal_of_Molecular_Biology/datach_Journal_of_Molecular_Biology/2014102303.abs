dynamic and thermodynamic response of the ras protein cdc hs upon association with the effector domain of pak
human cell division cycle protein   cdc hs is a small rho type guanosine triphosphatase involved in multiple cellular processes through its interactions with downstream effectors the binding domain of one such effector the actin cytoskeleton regulating p  activated kinase  is known as pbd  nitrogen  backbone and carbon  methyl nmr relaxation was measured to investigate the dynamical changes in activated gmppcp cdc hs upon pbd  binding changes in internal motion of the cdc hs as revealed by methyl axis order parameters were observed not only near the cdc hs  pbd  interface but also in remote sites on the cdc hs molecule the binding induced changes in side chain dynamics propagate along the long axis of cdc hs away from the site of pbd  binding with sharp distance dependence overall the binding of the pbd  effector domain on the dynamics of methyl bearing side chains of cdc hs results in a modest rigidification which is estimated to correspond to an unfavorable change in conformational entropy of approximately   kcalmol   at  k a cluster of methyl probes closest to the nucleotide binding pocket of cdc hs becomes more rigid upon binding of pbd  and is proposed to slow the catalytic hydrolysis of the  phosphate moiety an additional cluster of methyl probes surrounding the guanine ring becomes more flexible on binding of pbd  presumably facilitating nucleotide exchange mediated by a guanosine exchange factor in addition the rho insert helix which is located at a site remote from the pbd  binding interface shows a significant dynamic response to pbd  binding
