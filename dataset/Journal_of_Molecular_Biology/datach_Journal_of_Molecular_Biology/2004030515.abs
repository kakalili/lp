nmr solution structure of the mitochondrial f  presequence from nicotiana plumbaginifolia
we have isolated characterized and determined the three dimensional nmr solution structure of the presequence of atpsynthase f  subunit from nicotiana plumbaginifolia a general method for purification of presequences is presented the method is based on overexpression of a mutant precursor containing a methionine residue introduced at the processing site followed by cnbr cleavage and purification of the presequence on a cation exchange column the f  presequence   amino acid residues long retained its native properties as evidenced by inhibition of in vitro mitochondrial import and processing at micromolar concentrations cd spectroscopy revealed that the f  presequence formed an  helical structure in membrane mimetic environments such as sds and dpc micelles      helix  and in acidic phospholipid bicelles      helix  the nmr solution structure of the f  presequence in sds micelles was determined on the basis of   distance and  torsion angle constraints the structure was found to contain two helices an n terminal amphipathic  helix residues     and a c terminal  helix residues      separated by a largely unstructured  residue long internal domain the n terminal amphipathic  helix forms the putative tom  receptor binding site whereas the c terminal  helix is located upstream of the mitochondrial processing peptidase cleavage site
