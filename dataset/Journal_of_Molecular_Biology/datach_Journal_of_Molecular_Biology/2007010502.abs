the nmr structure of the gpu tail terminator protein from bacteriophage lambda identification of sites contributing to mg ii mediated oligomerization and biological function
during the late stages of  bacteriophage assembly the protein gpu terminates tail polymerization and participates at the interface between the mature capsid and tail components when it engages the lambda tail gpu undergoes a monomer  hexamer transition to achieve its biologically active form towards understanding how gpu participates in multiple protein  protein interactions we have solved the structure of gpu in its monomeric state using nmr methods the structure reveals a mixed    motif with several dynamic loops at the periphery addition of   mm mgcl is known to oligomerize gpu in the absence of its protein partners multiple image analysis of electron micrographs revealed ring like structures of magnesium ion saturated gpu with a    pore consistent with its function as a portal for the passage of viral dna into the host bacterium the ability of magnesium ions to promote oligomerization was lost when substitutions were made at a cluster of acidic amino acids in the vicinity of helix   and the     loop furthermore substitutions at these sites abolished the biological activity of gpu
