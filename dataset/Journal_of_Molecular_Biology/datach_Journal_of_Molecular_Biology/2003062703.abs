staying straight with a tracts a dna analog of the hiv  polypurine tract
the polypurine tract ppt from the hiv  genome is resistant to digestion by reverse transcriptase following    strand synthesis and is used to prime   strand synthesis during retroviral replication we have determined the crystal structure of the asymmetric dna dna analog  mer duplex ctttttaaaagaaaag cttttcttttaaaaag comprising most of the  visible  portion of the rna dna hybrid from the polypurine tract of hiv  which was previously reported in a complex with hiv  reverse transcriptase our  mer completely encompasses a  mer dna duplex analog of the hiv  ppt we report here a detailed analysis of our b  form  mer dna structure including three full pure a tracts as well as a comparative structural analysis with polypurine tract and other a tract containing nucleic acid structures our analysis reveals that the polypurine tract structures share structural features despite being different nucleic acid forms i e dna dna versus rna dna  in addition the previously reported a tract containing dna molecules bound to topoisomerase i are remarkably similar to our polypurine tract  mer structure on the basis of our analysis we suggest that the specific topology of long pure a tracts is remarkably comparable across a wide array of biological environments
