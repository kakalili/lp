rational design of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase from bacillus circulans strain   to increase  cyclodextrin production edited by g von heijne
cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases cgtase  ec      are extracellular bacterial enzymes that generate cyclodextrins from starch all known cgtases produce mixtures of     and  cyclodextrins a maltononaose inhibitor bound to the active site of the cgtase from bacillus circulans strain   revealed sugar binding subsites distant from the catalytic residues which have been proposed to be involved in the cyclodextrin size specificity of these enzymes to probe the importance of these distant substrate binding subsites for the     and  cyclodextrin product ratios of the various cgtases we have constructed three single and one double mutant y g y d s  p and y d s  p using site directed mutagenesis the mutations affected the cyclization coupling disproportionation and hydrolyzing reactions of the enzyme the double mutant y d s  p showed a twofold increase in the production of  cyclodextrin from starch this mutant protein was crystallized and its x ray structure in a complex with a maltohexaose inhibitor was determined at    resolution the bound maltohexaose molecule displayed a binding different from the maltononaose inhibitor allowing rationalization of the observed change in product specificity hydrogen bonds s   and hydrophobic contacts y  appear to contribute strongly to the size of cyclodextrin products formed and thus to cgtase product specificity changes in sugar binding subsites   and   thus result in mutant proteins with changed cyclodextrin production specificity
