histidine kinase regulation by a cyclophilin like inhibitor
the sensor histidine kinase a kina from bacillus subtilis triggers a phosphorelay that activates sporulation the antikinase kipi prevents sporulation by binding kina and inhibiting the autophosphorylation reaction using neutron contrast variation mutagenesis and fluorescence data we show that two kipi monomers bind via their c domains at a conserved proline in the kina dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer dhp domain our crystal structure of the kipi c domain reveals the binding motif has a distinctive hydrophobic groove formed by a five stranded antiparallel  sheet a characteristic of the cyclophilin family of proteins that bind prolines and often act as cis  trans peptidyl prolyl isomerases we propose that the dhp domain of kina transmits conformational signals to regulate kinase activity via this proline mediated interaction given that both kina and kipi homologues are widespread in the bacterial kingdom this mechanism has broad significance in bacterial signal transduction
