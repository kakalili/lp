evolution of class specific peptides targeting a hot spot of the g s subunit
the four classes of heterotrimeric g protein  subunits act as molecular routers inside cells gating signals based on a bound guanosine nucleotide guanosine   triphosphate versus guanosine   diphosphate  ligands that specifically target individual subunits provide new tools for monitoring and modulating these networks but are challenging to design due to the high sequence homology and structural plasticity of the g  binding surface here we have created an mrna display library of peptides based on the short g  modulating peptide r a  and selected variants that target a convergent protein binding surface of g s guanosine   diphosphate after selection evolution the most g s specific peptide g s s binding peptide gsp  was used to design a second generation library resulting in several new affinity and selectivity matured peptides denoted as mgsps the two step evolutionary walk from r a  to mgsp  resulted in an   fold inversion in binding specificity altered seven out of nine residues in the starting peptide core and incorporated both positive and negative design steps the resulting mgsp  peptide shows remarkable selectivity and affinity exhibiting little or no binding to nine homologous g  subunits or human h ras and even discriminates the g s splice variant g s l  selected peptides make specific contacts with the effector binding region of g  which may explain an interesting bifunctional activity observed in gsp overall our work demonstrates a design of simple linear highly specific peptides that target a protein binding surface of g s and argues that mrna display based selection evolution is a powerful route for targeting protein families with high class specificity and state specificity
