crystal structure of hypusine containing translation factor eif a bound to a rotated eukaryotic ribosome
eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif a promotes protein synthesis by resolving polyproline induced ribosomal stalling here we report a     resolution crystal structure of eif a bound to the yeast  s ribosome the structure reveals a previously unseen conformation of an eif a  ribosome complex and highlights a possible functional link between conformational changes of the ribosome during protein synthesis and the eif a  ribosome association
