The 36 residue villin headpiece helical subdomain (HP36) is one of the fastest cooperatively folding proteins, folding on the microsecond timescale. HP36‘s simple three helix topology, fast folding and small size have made it an attractive model system for computational and experimental studies of protein folding. Recent experimental studies have explored the denatured state of HP36 using fragment analysis coupled with relatively low-resolution spectroscopic techniques. These studies have shown that there is apparently only a small tendency to form locally stabilized secondary structure. Here, we complement the experimental studies by using replica exchange molecular dynamics with explicit solvent to investigate the structural features of these peptide models of unfolded HP36. To ensure convergence, two sets of simulations for each fragment were performed with different initial structures, and simulations were continued until these generated very similar final ensembles. These simulations reveal low populations of native-like structure and early folding events that cannot be resolved by experiment. For each fragment, calculated J-coupling constants and helical propensities are in good agreement with experimental trends. HP-1, corresponding to residues 41 to 53 and including the first α-helix, contains the highest helical population. HP-3, corresponding to residues 62 through 75 and including the third α-helix, contains a small population of helical turn residing at the N terminus while HP-2, corresponding to residues 52 through 61 and including the second α-helix, formed little to no structure in isolation. Overall, HP-1 was the only fragment to adopt a native-like conformation, but the low population suggests that formation of significant structure only occurs after formation of specific tertiary interactions.
