transcription in mycoplasma pneumoniae analysis of the promoters of the acka and ldh genes
the nucleotide sequences that control transcription initiation and regulation in mycoplasma pneumoniae are poorly understood moreover only few regulatory events have been reported for m pneumoniae we have studied changes in the global protein synthesis pattern in m pneumoniae in response to the presence of glycerol the acka and ldh genes encoding acetate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase respectively were controlled in a carbon source dependent manner while the acka gene was strongly expressed in the presence of glucose transcription of ldh was induced by glycerol the promoters of both genes were mapped by primer extension analysis molecular analysis of transcription regulatory mechanisms in m pneumoniae has so far not been possible due to the lack of appropriate reporter systems that can be used to study the activity of promoter fragments and their mutant derivatives in vivo recently a reporter system has been developed which allows cloning of promoter fragments in front of a promoterless lacz gene and inserting this construct into the genome of m pneumoniae to study the requirements of m pneumoniae rna polymerase for promoter recognition a series of fusions of deletion and mutant variants of the ldh promoter was constructed and analyzed in vivo while mutations affecting the    region strongly interfered with gene expression the    region seems to be of minor importance in m pneumoniae
