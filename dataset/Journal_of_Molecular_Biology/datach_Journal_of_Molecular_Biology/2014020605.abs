flexible gates generate occluded intermediates in the transport cycle of lacy
the major facilitator superfamily mfs transporter lactose permease lacy alternates between cytoplasmic and periplasmic open conformations to co transport a sugar molecule together with a proton across the plasma membrane indirect experimental evidence suggested the existence of an occluded transition intermediate of lacy which would prevent leaking of the proton gradient as no experimental structure is known the conformational transition is not fully understood in atomic detail we simulated transition events from a cytoplasmic open conformation to a periplasmic open conformation with the dynamic importance sampling molecular dynamics method and observed occluded intermediates analysis of water permeation pathways and the electrostatic free energy landscape of a solvated proton indicated that the occluded state contains a solvated central cavity inaccessible from either side of the membrane we propose a pair of geometric order parameters that capture the state of the pathway through the mfs transporters as shown by a survey of available crystal structures and models we present a model for the occluded state of apo lacy which is similar to the occluded crystal structures of the mfs transporters emrd peptso naru pipt and xyle our simulations are consistent with experimental double electron spin  spin distance measurements that have been interpreted to show occluded conformations during the simulations a salt bridge that has been postulated to be involved in driving the conformational transition formed our results argue against a simple rigid body domain motion as implied by a strict  rocker switch mechanism  and instead hint at an intricate coupling between two flexible gates
