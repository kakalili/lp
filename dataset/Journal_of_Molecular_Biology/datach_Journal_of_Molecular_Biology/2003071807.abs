native like partially folded conformations and folding process revealed in the n terminal large fragments of staphylococcal nuclease a study by nmr spectroscopy
the n terminal large fragments of staphylococcal nuclease snase  snase       residues  snase       residues  and snase       residues  and the fragment mutants g w   g w   v w  and v w  were studied by heteronuclear multidimensional nmr spectroscopy ensembles of co existent native like partially folded and unfolded states were observed for fragments the persistent native like tertiary interaction drives fragments to be in partially folded states which reveal native like  barrel conformations g w and v w mutations modulate the extent of inherent native like tertiary interaction in fragment molecules and in consequence fragment mutants fold into native like  subdomain conformations in cooperation with the inherent tertiary interaction  m tmao trimethylamine n oxide can promote the folding reaction of fragments through the changes of unfolding free energy and a native like  subdomain conformation is observed when the chain length contains   residues heterogeneous partially folded conformations of     and     fragments due to cis and trans x prolyl bond of lys   pro  make a non unique folding pathway of fragments the folding reaction of fragments can be characterized as a hierarchical process
