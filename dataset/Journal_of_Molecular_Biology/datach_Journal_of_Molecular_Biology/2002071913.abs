kinetic model of dna replication in eukaryotic organisms
we formulate a kinetic model of dna replication that quantitatively describes recent results on dna replication in the in vitro system of xenopus laevis prior to the mid blastula transition the model describes well a large amount of different data within a simple theoretical framework this allows one for the first time to determine the parameters governing the dna replication program in a eukaryote on a genome wide basis in particular we have determined the frequency of origin activation in time and space during the cell cycle although we focus on a specific stage of development this model can easily be adapted to describe replication in many other organisms including budding yeast
