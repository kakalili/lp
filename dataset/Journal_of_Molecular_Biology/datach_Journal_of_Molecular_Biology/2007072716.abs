the crystal structure of the human mov  mpn domain reveals a metal free dimer
the  s proteasome is a large protein complex involved in protein degradation we have shown previously that the psmd mov  subunit of the human proteasome contains a proteolytically resistant mpn domain mpn domain family members comprise subunits of the proteasome cop signalosome and translation initiation factor  complexes here the crystal structure of two c terminally truncated proteins mpn    and mpn    were solved to   and     resolution respectively mpn    is formed by nine  strands surrounded by three  helices plus a fourth  helix at the c terminus this final  helix emerges from the domain core and folds along with a symmetrically related subunit typical of a domain swap the crystallographic dimer is consistent with size exclusion chromatography and dls analysis showing that mpn    is a dimer in solution mpn    shows an overall architecture highly similar to the previously reported crystal structure of the archaeal mpn domain afjamm of archaeoglobus fulgidus however previous structural and biophysical analyses have shown that neither mpn    nor full length human mov  bind metal in opposition to the zinc binding afjamm structures the zinc ligand residues observed in afjamm are conserved in the yeast rpn  proteasome and csn cop signalosome subunits which is consistent with the isopeptidase activity described for these proteins the results presented here show that although the mpn domain of mov  shows a typical metalloprotease fold it is unable to coordinate a metal ion this finding and amino acid sequence comparisons can explain why the mpn containing proteins mov  psmd  rpn  csn  prp p and the translation initiation factor  subunits f and h do not show catalytic isopeptidase activity allowing us to propose the hypothesis that in these proteins the mpn domain has a primarily structural function
