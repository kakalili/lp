molecular basis for the recognition of phosphorylated stat by importin
interferon  stimulation triggers tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor stat at position   which is associated with switching from carrier independent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling to carrier mediated nuclear import unlike most substrates that carry a classical nuclear localization signal nls and bind to importin   stat possesses a nonclassical nls recognized by the isoform importin   in the present study we have analyzed the mechanisms by which importin   binds phosphorylated stat  pstat  we found that a homodimer of pstat is recognized by one equivalent of importin   with kd     nm whereas tyrosine phosphorylation at position   is essential to assemble a pstat  importin   complex the phosphate moiety is not a direct binding determinant for importin   in contrast to classical nls substrates pstat binding to importin   is not displaced by the n terminal importin  binding domain and requires the importin   c terminal acidic tail   eedd    a local unfolding of importin   armadillo arm repeat  accompanies high affinity binding to pstat  this unfolding is mediated by a single conserved tyrosine at position   of importin   which is inserted between arm repeat  helices h  h  h  thereby preventing intramolecular helical stacking essential to stabilize the folding conformation of arm   introducing a glycine at this position as in importin   disrupts high affinity binding to pstat  suggesting that pstat recognition is dependent on the intrinsic flexibility of arm   using the quantitative stoichiometry and binding data presented in this article together with mutational information available in the literature we propose that importin   binds between two stat monomers with two major binding determinants in the sh and dna binding domains in vitro this model is supported by the observation that a  mer dna oligonucleotide containing two tandem cfosm  promoters can displace importin   from pstat  suggesting a possible role for dna in releasing activated stat in the cell nucleus
