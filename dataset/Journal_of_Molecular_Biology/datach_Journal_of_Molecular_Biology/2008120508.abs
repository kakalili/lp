genetic and structural characterization of an l  p global suppressor substitution in tem   lactamase
tem   lactamase confers bacterial resistance to penicillin antibiotics and has acquired mutations that permit the enzyme to hydrolyze extended spectrum cephalosporins or to avoid inactivation by  lactamase inhibitors however many of these substitutions have been shown to reduce activity against penicillin antibiotics and or result in loss of stability for the enzyme in order to gain more information concerning the tradeoffs associated with active site substitutions a genetic selection was used to find second site mutations that partially restore ampicillin resistance levels conferred by an r  a active site tem   lactamase mutant an l  p substitution distant from the active site that enhanced ampicillin resistance levels and increased protein expression levels of the r  a tem  mutant was identified the l  p substitution also increases the ampicillin resistance levels and restores expression levels of a poorly expressed tem  mutant with a core disrupting substitution in vitro thermal denaturation of purified protein indicated that the l  p mutation increases the tm value of the tem  enzyme the x ray structure of the l  p tem  mutant was determined to gain insight into the increase in enzyme stability the proline substitution occurs at the n terminus of an  helix and may stabilize the enzyme by reducing the helix dipole as well as by lowering the conformational entropy cost of folding due to the reduced number of conformations available in the unfolded state collectively the data suggest that l  p promotes tolerance of some deleterious tem  mutations by enhancing the protein stability of these mutants
