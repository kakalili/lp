structure of a eukaryotic decoding region a site rna edited by i tinoco
the aminoglycoside antibiotics target a region of highly conserved nucleotides in the aminoacyl trna site a site of  s rna on the  s subunit the structures of a prokaryotic decoding region a site oligonucleotide free in solution and bound to the aminoglycosides paromomycin and gentamicin c a have been determined here the structure of a eukaryotic decoding region a site oligonucleotide has been determined using homonuclear and heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy and compared to the unbound prokaryotic rrna structure the two structures are similar with a u   u   base pair a c   g   watson crick base pair and a g   a   base pair instead of the a   a   base pair of the prokaryotic structure the two structures differ in the orientation of the   position with respect to a   g   is rotated toward the major groove which is the binding pocket for aminoglycosides the structures also differ in the stacking geometry of g   on a   which could have slight long range conformational effects
