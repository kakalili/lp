sequence specific binding to a subset of iscr regulated promoters does not require iscr fe  s cluster ligation
iscr is an fe  s protein that functions as a transcriptional regulator of fe  s biogenesis and other fe  s protein encoding genes in escherichia coli in this study we investigated the requirement for the ligation of the  fe  s cluster of iscr to regulate a subset of iscr target promoters phyaa pydiu pnapf and phybo and defined the requirements for sequence specific binding to the iscr target site in the hyaa promoter region in contrast to previous results with the iscr promoter we found that the fe  s cluster is dispensable for iscr regulation of phyaa pydiu pnapf and phybo since iscr mutants containing alanine substitutions of the cysteine fe  s ligands retained iscr dependent regulation of these promoters in vivo in vitro assays showed that both  fe  s iscr and an iscr mutant lacking the cluster iscr c a c a c  a bound the hya site with similar affinity explaining why the mutant protein retained its ability to repress phyaa in vivo characterization of the oligomeric state of iscr showed that both apo iscr and  fe  s iscr were dimers in solution and four protomers of either form bound to the hya site also binding of either apo or  fe  s iscr to the hya site showed cooperativity suggesting that both forms interact similarly with the target site analysis of mutations in the hya site using dna competition assays showed that apo iscr most likely recognizes an imperfect palindrome within the hya promoter furthermore the strength of apo iscr binding to psufa pydiu pnapf and phybo iscr sites correlated with the number of matches to the hya site bases shown to be important in the competition assay thus our data indicated that unexpectedly apo iscr is a site specific dna binding protein and the role of apo iscr needs to be considered in developing models for how iscr globally regulates transcription
