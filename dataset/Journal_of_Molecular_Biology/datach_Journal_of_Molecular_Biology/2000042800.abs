quadruplet codons implications for code expansion and the specification of translation step size edited by j h miller
one of the requirements for engineering expansion of the genetic code is a unique codon which is available for specifying the new amino acid the potential of the quadruplet uaga in escherichia coli to specify a single amino acid residue in the presence of a mutant trnaleu molecule containing the extra nucleotide u at position   of its anticodon loop has been examined with this mrna trna combination and at least partial inactivation of release factor  the uaga quadruplet specifies a leucine residue with an efficiency of  to    the decoding properties of trnaleu with u at position   of its eight membered anticodon loop and a counterpart with a at position    strongly suggest that in both cases their anticodon loop bases stack in alternative conformations the identity of the codon immediately   of the uaga quadruplet influences the efficiency of quadruplet translation via the properties of its cognate trna when there is the potential for the anticodon of this trna to dissociate from pairing with its codon and to re pair to mrna at a nearby   closely matched codon the efficiency of quadruplet translation at uaga is reduced evidence is presented which suggests that when there is a purine base at position  of this   flanking trna it influences decoding of the uaga quadruplet
