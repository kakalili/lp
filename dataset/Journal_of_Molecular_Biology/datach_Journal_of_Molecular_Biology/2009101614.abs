structure based and random mutagenesis approaches increase the organophosphate degrading activity of a phosphotriesterase homologue from deinococcus radiodurans
an enzyme from the amidohydrolase family from deinococcus radiodurans dr oph with homology to phosphotriesterase has been shown to exhibit activity against both organophosphate op and lactone compounds we have characterized the physical properties of dr oph and have found it to be a highly thermostable enzyme remaining active after  h of incubation at    c and withstanding incubation at temperatures up to    c in addition it can withstand concentrations of at least   mg ml these properties make dr oph a promising candidate for development in commercial applications however compared to the most widely studied op degrading enzyme that from pseudomonas diminuta dr oph has low hydrolytic activity against certain op substrates therefore we sought to improve the op degrading activity of dr oph specifically toward the pesticides ethyl and methyl paraoxon using structure based and random approaches site directed mutagenesis random mutagenesis and site saturation mutagenesis were utilized to increase the op degrading activity of dr oph out of a screen of more than    potential mutants a total of  mutant enzymes were purified and characterized kinetically crystal structures of w t dr oph of dr oph in complex with a product analog and of  mutant enzymes were determined to resolutions between   and     information from these structures directed the design and production of  additional mutants for analysis in total our mutagenesis efforts improved the catalytic activity of dr oph toward ethyl and methyl paraoxon by   and   fold and raised the specificity for these two substrates by   and   fold respectively our work highlights the importance of an iterative approach to mutagenesis proving that large rate enhancements are achieved when mutations are made in already active mutants in addition the relationship between the kinetic parameters and the introduced mutations has allowed us to hypothesize on those factors most important for maintaining the structure and function of the enzyme
