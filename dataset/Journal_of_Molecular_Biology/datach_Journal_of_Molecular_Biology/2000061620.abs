the role of weak protein protein interactions in multivalent lectin carbohydrate binding crystal structure of cross linked fril edited by r huber
binding of multivalent glycoconjugates by lectins often leads to the formation of cross linked complexes type i cross links which are one dimensional are formed by a divalent lectin and a divalent glycoconjugate type ii cross links which are two or three dimensional occur when a lectin or glycoconjugate has a valence greater than two type ii complexes are a source of additional specificity since homogeneous type ii complexes are formed in the presence of mixtures of lectins and glycoconjugates this additional specificity is thought to become important when a lectin interacts with clusters of glycoconjugates e g as is present on the cell surface the cryst al structure of the glc man binding legume lectin fril in complex with a trisaccharide provides a molecular snapshot of how weak protein protein interactions which are not observed in solution can become important when a cross linked complex is formed in solution fril is a divalent dimer but in the crystal fril forms a tetramer which allows for the formation of an intricate type ii cross linked complex with the divalent trisaccharide the dependence on weak protein protein interactions can ensure that a specific type ii cross linked complex and its associated specificity can occur only under stringent conditions which explains why lectins are often found forming higher order oligomers
