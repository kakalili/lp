crystallographic analysis of the reaction pathway of zoogloea ramigera biosynthetic thiolase edited by i a wilson
biosynthetic thiolases catalyze the biological claisen condensation of two acetyl coa molecules to form acetoacetyl coa this is one of the fundamental categories of carbon skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step in many biosynthetic pathways including those which generate cholesterol steroid hormones and ketone body energy storage molecules high resolution crystal structures of the tetrameric biosynthetic thiolase from zoogloea ramigera were determined i in the absence of active site ligands  ii in the presence of coa and iii from protein crystals which were flash frozen after a short soak with acetyl coa the enzyme  s substrate in the biosynthetic reaction in the latter structure a reaction intermediate was trapped the enzyme was found to be acetylated at cys  and a molecule of acetyl coa was bound in the active site pocket a comparison of the three new structures and the two previously published thiolase structures reveals that small adjustments in the conformation of the acetylated cys  side chain allow coa and acetyl coa to adopt identical modes of binding the proximity of the acetyl moiety of acetyl coa to the sulfur atom of cys  supports the hypothesis that cys  is important for proton exchange in both steps of the reaction the thioester oxygen atom of the acetylated enzyme points into an oxyanion hole formed by the nitrogen atoms of cys  and gly   thus facilitating the condensation reaction the interaction between the thioester oxygen atom of acetyl coa and his  assists the condensation step of catalysis by stabilizing a negative charge on the thioester oxygen atom our structure of acetyl coa bound to thiolase also highlights the importance in catalysis of a hydrogen bonding network between cys  and cys   which includes the thioester oxygen atom of acetyl coa and extends from the catalytic site through the enzyme to the opposite molecular surface this hydrogen bonding network is different in yeast degradative thiolase indicating that the catalytic properties of each enzyme may be modulated by differences in their hydrogen bonding networks
