dissection of the atp driven reaction cycle of the bacteriophage t dna replication processivity clamp loading system edited by r ebright
processive dna replication requires the loading of a multisubunit ring shaped protein complex known as a sliding or processivity clamp onto the primer template p t dna this clamp then binds to the replication polymerase to form a processive polymerase holoenzyme the processivity of the holoenzyme derives from the topological properties of the clamp which encircles the dna without actually binding to it multisubunit complexes known as clamp loaders utilize atp to drive the placement of this ring around the dna to further understand the role of atp binding and hydrolysis in driving clamp loading in the dna replication system of bacteriophage t  we report the results of a series of presteady state and steady state kinetic atpase experiments involving the various components of the reconstituted system the results obtained are consistent with a mechanism in which a slow step which involves the binary atp bound clamp clamp loader complex activates this complex and permits p t dna to bind and stimulate atp hydrolysis atp hydrolysis itself as well as the subsequent after clamp loading dissociation of the clamp loader and the slippage of the loaded clamp from the p t dna construct are shown to be fast steps a second slow step occurs after atp hydrolysis this step involves the dissociated clamp loader complex and may reflect adp release only one molecule of atp is hydrolyzed per clamp loading event rate constants for each step and an overall reaction mechanism for the t clamp loading system are derived from these data and from other results in the literature the principles that emerge fit into a general framework that can apply to many biological processes involving atp driven reaction cycles
