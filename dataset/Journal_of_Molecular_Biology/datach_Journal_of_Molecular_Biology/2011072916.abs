association of mitochondrial lysyl trna synthetase with hiv  gagpol involves catalytic domain of the synthetase and transframe and integrase domains of pol
cytosolic and mitochondrial lysyl trna synthetases lysrs are encoded by a single gene and can be distinguished only according to their very n terminal sequences it was believed that cytosolic lysrs is packaged into hiv  virions via its association with gag using monospecific antibodies it was later shown that only the mitochondrial lysrs is taken up in viral particles along with trna lys the primer for reverse transcription of the hiv  genome in this work we re analyzed the interaction between lysrs and gagpol to determine whether the particular n terminal sequence of mitochondrial lysrs triggers a specific recognition with gagpol or if differential routing of the two lysrs species in vivo could explain specific and exclusive packaging of the mitochondrial species here we show that lysrs associates with the pol domain of gagpol more specifically the transframe tf or p   and integrase in domain proteins of pol interact with the catalytic domain of lysrs a model of the assembly of the lysrs  trna lys  gagpol packaging complex is proposed which is consistent with the release of its different components after maturation of gagpol in the virions the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial lysrs species share an identical catalytic domain accordingly we found that both enzymes have the intrinsic capacity to bind to gagpol in vitro in addition both enzymes interact with p  in vitro the scaffold protein of the cytoplasmic multi aminoacyl trna synthetase complex even though only the cytoplasmic species of lysrs is a bona fide component of this complex these results suggest that the different lysrs species are strictly targeted in vivo and open new perspectives for the search of a new class of inhibitors of the hiv  development cycle that would block the packaging of trna lys into viral particles
