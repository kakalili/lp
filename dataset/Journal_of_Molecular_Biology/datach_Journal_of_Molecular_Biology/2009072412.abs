crystal structures of catalytic intermediates of human selenophosphate synthetase
selenophosphate synthetase catalyzes the synthesis of the highly active selenium donor molecule selenophosphate a key intermediate in selenium metabolism we have determined the high resolution crystal structure of human selenophosphate synthetase  hsps  an unexpected reaction intermediate with a tightly bound phosphate and adp at the active site has been captured in the structure an enzymatic assay revealed that hsps possesses low adp hydrolysis activity in the presence of phosphate our structural and enzymatic results suggest that consuming the second high energy phosphoester bond of atp could protect the labile product selenophosphate during catalytic reaction we solved another hsps structure with potassium ions at the active sites comparing the two structures we were able to define the monovalent cation binding site of the enzyme the detailed mechanism of the adp hydrolysis step and the exact function of the monovalent cation for hsps catalytic reaction are proposed
