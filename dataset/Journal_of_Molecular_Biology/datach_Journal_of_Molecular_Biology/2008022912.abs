the nucleoid binding protein h ns acts as an anti channeling factor to favor intermolecular tn  transposition and dissemination
dissemination of the bacterial transposon tn  is limited by target site channeling a process wherein the transposon ends are forced to interact with and insert into a target site located within the transposon integration host factor ihf promotes this self destructive event by binding to the transpososome and forming a dna loop close to one or both transposon ends this loop imposes geometric and topological constraints that are responsible for channeling we demonstrate that a second  host  protein histone like nucleoid structuring protein h ns  acts as an anti channeling factor to limit self destructive intramolecular transposition events in vitro evidence that h ns competes with ihf for binding to the tn  transpososome to block channeling and that this event is relatively insensitive to the level of dna supercoiling present in the tn  containing substrate plasmid are presented this latter observation is atypical for h ns as h ns binding to other dna sequences such as promoters is generally affected by subtle changes in dna structure
