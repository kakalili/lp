proteolytic post translational processing of adhesins in a pathogenic bacterium
mollicutes including mycoplasmas and spiroplasmas have been considered as good representatives of the  minimal cell  concept these wall less bacteria are small in size and possess a minimal genome and restricted metabolic capacities however the recent discovery of the presence of post translational modifications unknown so far such as the targeted processing of membrane proteins of mycoplasma pathogens for human and swine revealed a part of the hidden complexity of these microorganisms in this study we show that in the phytopathogen insect vectored spiroplasma citri gii  adhesion related protein scarp adhesins are post translationally processed through an atp dependent targeted cleavage the cleavage efficiency could be enhanced in vitro when decreasing the extracellular ph or upon the addition of polyclonal antibodies directed against scarp repeated units suggesting that modification of the surface charge and or scarp conformational changes could initiate the cleavage the two major sites for primary cleavage are localized within predicted disordered regions and do not fit any previously reported cleavage motif in addition the inhibition profile and the metal ion requirements indicate that this post translational modification involves at least one non conventional protease such a proteolytic process may play a role in s citri colonization of cells of the host insect furthermore our work indicates that post translational cleavage of adhesins represents a common feature to mollicutes colonizing distinct hosts and that processing of surface antigens could represent a way to make the most out of a minimal genome
