operating on chromatin a colorful language where context matters
histones the fundamental packaging elements of eukaryotic dna are highly decorated with a diverse set of post translational modifications ptms that are recognized to govern the structure and function of chromatin ten years ago we put forward the histone code hypothesis which provided a model to explain how single and or combinatorial ptms on histones regulate the diverse activities associated with chromatin e g  gene transcription  at that time there was a limited understanding of both the number of ptms that occur on histones and the proteins that place remove and interpret them since the conception of this hypothesis the field has witnessed an unprecedented advance in our understanding of the enzymes that contribute to the establishment of histone ptms as well as the diverse effector proteins that bind them while debate continues as to whether histone ptms truly constitute a strict  code   it is becoming clear that ptms on histone proteins function in elaborate combinations to regulate the many activities associated with chromatin in this special issue we celebrate the  th anniversary of the landmark publication of the lac operon with a review that provides a current view of the histone code hypothesis the lessons we have learned over the last decade and the technologies that will drive our understanding of histone ptms forward in the future
