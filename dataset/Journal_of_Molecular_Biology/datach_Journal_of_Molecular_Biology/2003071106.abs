crystal structures of the ferric ferrous and ferrous  no forms of the asp  ala mutant of human heme oxygenase  catalytic implications
site directed mutagenesis studies have shown that asp  in both human and rat heme oxygenase  is critical for enzyme activity here we report the d  a mutant crystal structure in the fe iii and fe ii redox states as well as the fe ii  no complex as a model for the fe ii  oxy complex these structures are compared to the corresponding wild type structures the mutant and wild type structures are very similar except for the distal heme pocket solvent structure in the fe iii d  a mutant one water molecule takes the place of the missing asp  carboxylate side chain and a second water molecule novel to the mutant binds in the distal pocket upon reduction to the fe ii state the distal helix running along one face of the heme moves closer to the heme in both the wild type and mutant structures thus tightening the active site no binds to both the wild type and mutant in a bent conformation that orients the no o atom toward the  meso heme carbon atom a network of water molecules provides a h bonded network to the no ligand suggesting a possible proton shuttle pathway required to activate dioxygen for catalysis in the wild type structure asp  exhibits two conformations suggesting a dynamic role for asp  in shuttling protons from bulk solvent via the water network to the iron linked oxy complex on the basis of these structures we consider why the d  a mutant is inactive as a heme oxygenase but active as a peroxidase
