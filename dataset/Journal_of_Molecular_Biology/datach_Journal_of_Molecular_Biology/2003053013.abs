searching sequence space for high affinity binding peptides using ribosome display
we present the construction of a synthetic library based on the scaffold of bovine heart fatty acid binding protein fabp with      independent members ribosome display was applied to select streptavidin binding peptides in vitro from     molecules of the library each encoding fabp with  contiguous random amino acid residues at its n terminus the selection yielded several different binding peptides the best binder possessed a dissociation constant as low as nm and in contrast to the previously isolated peptides contained no hpq motif a substitution analysis enabled shortening of the  mer peptide and revealed a  mer variant with a dissociation constant of  nm which is a   fold increase of affinity compared to the already known peptides of this size this high affinity binding peptide in combination with the whole set of streptavidin conjugates should be an extremely useful tool for the detection and purification of recombinant proteins
