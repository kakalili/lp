comprehensive mapping of the c terminus of flap endonuclease  reveals distinct interaction sites for five proteins that represent different dna replication and repair pathways
flap endonuclease  fen  is a multifunctional and structure specific nuclease that plays a critical role in maintaining human genome stability through rna primer removal long patch base excision repair resolution of dna secondary structures and stalled dna replication forks and apoptotic dna fragmentation how fen  is involved in multiple pathways of which some are seemingly contradictory is of considerable interest to date at least  proteins are known to interact with fen  some form distinct complexes that affect one or more fen  activities presumably to direct fen  to a particular dna metabolic pathway fen  consists of a nuclease core domain and a c terminal extension while the core domain harbors the nuclease activity the c terminal extension may be important for protein  protein interactions here we have truncated or mutated the c terminus of fen  to identify amino acid residues that are critical for interaction with five proteins representing roles in different dna replication and repair pathways we found with all five proteins that the c terminus is important for binding and that each protein uses a subset of amino acid residues replacement of one or more residues with an alanine in many cases leads to the complete loss of interaction which may consequently lead to severe biological defects in mammals
