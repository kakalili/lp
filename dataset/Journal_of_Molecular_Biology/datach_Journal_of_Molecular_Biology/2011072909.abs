hiv  replication and latency are regulated by translational control of cyclin t
human immunodeficiency virus hiv exploits cellular proteins during its replicative cycle and latent infection the positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb is a key cellular transcription factor critical for these viral processes and is a drug target during viral replication p tefb is recruited via interactions of its cyclin t subunit with the hiv tat transactivator of transcription protein and tar transactivation response element through rna silencing and over expression experiments we discovered that nuclear factor   nf   a cellular rna binding protein regulates p tefb expression nf  depletion reduced cyclin t protein levels by inhibiting translation initiation regulation was mediated by the   untranslated region of cyclin t mrna independently of micrornas cyclin t induction is involved in the escape of hiv  from latency we show that the activation of viral replication by phorbol ester in latently infected monocytic cells requires the posttranscriptional induction of nf  and cyclin t  implicating nf  in protein kinase c signaling pathways this investigation reveals a novel mechanism of cyclin t regulation and establishes nf  as a regulator of hiv  replication during both productive infection and induction from latency
