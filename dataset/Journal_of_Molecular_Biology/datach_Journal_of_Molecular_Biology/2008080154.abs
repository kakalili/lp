structural insights into the substrate specificity and function of escherichia coli k  ygjk a glucosidase belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family
proteins belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family   gh  are found in bacteria archaea and eukaryotes eukaryotic gh  proteins are processing  glucosidase i enzymes that hydrolyze an oligosaccharide precursor of eukaryotic n linked glycoproteins in contrast the functions of the bacterial and archaeal gh  proteins are unclear here we determined the crystal structure of a bacterial gh  enzyme escherichia coli k  ygjk at     resolution and investigated some properties of the enzyme ygjk consists of the n domain and the a domain joined by a linker region the n domain is composed of  antiparallel  strands and is classified as a super  sandwich the a domain contains    helices   of which form an     barrel the remaining   helices are found in an extra structural unit that we designated as the a  region ygjk a member of the glycoside hydrolase clan gh g shares structural similarity with glucoamylase gh  and chitobiose phosphorylase gh   both of which belong to clan gh l in crystal structures of ygjk in complex with glucose mannose and galactose all of the glucose mannose and galactose units were located in the catalytic cleft ygjk showed the highest activity for the    glucosidic linkage of nigerose but also hydrolyzed trehalose kojibiose and maltooligosaccharides from maltose to maltoheptaose although the activities were low these findings suggest that ygjk is a glucosidase with relaxed specificity for sugars
