folding of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti variants in which almost half the residues are alanine edited by c r matthews
recent studies indicate that a fraction of the information contained in an amino acid sequence may be sufficient for specifying a native protein structure an earlier alanine scanning experiment conducted on bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti   residues suggested that if cumulative mutations have additive effects on protein stability a native protein structure could be built from bpti sequences that contained many alanine residues distributed throughout the protein to test this hypothesis we designed and produced six bpti mutants containing from  to  alanine residues we found that the melting temperature of mutants containing up to  alanine residues    of the total number of residues could be predicted quite well by the sum of the change in melting temperature for the single mutations additionally these same mutants folded into a native like structure as judged by their cooperative thermal denaturation curves and heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation hmqc nmr spectra a bpti mutant containing  alanine residues was further shown by d and d nmr to fold into a structure very similar to that of native bpti and to be a functional trypsin inhibitor these results provide insight into the extent to which native protein structure and function can be achieved with a highly simplified amino acid sequence
