in vitro dna tethering of hiv  integrase by the transcriptional coactivator ledgf p
although ledgf p  is believed to act as a cellular cofactor of lentiviral integration by tethering integrase in to chromatin there is no good in vitro model to analyze this functionality we designed an alphascreen assay to study how ledgf p  modulates the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type  in with dna in bound with similar affinity to dna mimicking the long terminal repeat or to random dna while ledgf p  bound dna strongly a mutant of ledgf p  with compromised nuclear localization signal nls at hook interacted weakly and the ledgf p  pwwp domain did not interact corroborating previous reports on the role of nls and at hooks in charge dependent dna binding ledgf p  stimulated in binding to dna  fold to  fold stimulation of in  dna binding required a direct interaction between in and the c terminus of ledgf p  addition of either the c terminus of ledgf p  amino acids      or ledgf p  mutated in the nls at hooks interfered with in binding to dna our results are consistent with an in vitro model of ledgf p  mediated tethering of in to dna the inhibition of in  dna interaction by the ledgf p  c terminus may provide a novel strategy for the inhibition of hiv in activity and may explain the potent inhibition of hiv replication observed after the overexpression of c terminal fragments in cell culture
