structural and dynamics studies of pax reveal asymmetry in stability and dna binding by the paired domain
the eukaryotic transcription factor pax or b cell specific activator protein bsap is central to b cell development and has been implicated in a large number of cellular malignancies resulting from loss or gain of function mutations in this study we characterized the dna binding paired domain pd of pax in its free and dna bound forms using nmr spectroscopy in isolation the pd folds as two independent helical bundle subdomains separated by a conformationally disordered linker the two subdomains differ in stability with the c terminal subdomain ctd being   fold more protected from amide hydrogen exchange hx than the n terminal subdomain ntd  upon binding dna the linker and an induced n terminal  hairpin become ordered with significantly dampened motions and increased hx protection both subdomains of the pd contribute to specific dna binding resulting in an equilibrium dissociation constant more than three orders of magnitude lower than exhibited by the separate subdomains for their respective half sites nm versus  m  the isolated ctd binds non specific dna sequences with only   fold weaker affinity than cognate sequences in contrast the ntd associates very poorly with non specific dna we propose that the more stable ctd has evolved to provide relatively low affinity non specific contacts with dna in contrast the more dynamic ntd discriminates between cognate and non specific sites the distinct roles of the pd subdomains may enable efficient searching of genomic dna by pax while retaining specificity for functional regulatory sites
