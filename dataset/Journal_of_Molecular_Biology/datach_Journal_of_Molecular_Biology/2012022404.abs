the carboxy terminal third of dystrophin enhances actin binding activity
dystrophin is an actin binding protein that is thought to stabilize the cardiac and skeletal muscle cell membranes during contraction here we investigated the contributions of each dystrophin domain to actin binding function cosedimentation assays and pyrene  actin fluorescence experiments confirmed that a fragment spanning two thirds of the dystrophin molecule from n terminal actin binding domain abd  through abd  bound actin filaments with high affinity and protected filaments from forced depolymerization but was less effective in both assays than full length dystrophin while a construct encoding the c terminal third of dystrophin displayed no specific actin binding activity or competition with full length dystrophin our data show that it confers an unexpected regulation of actin binding by the n terminal two thirds of dystrophin when present in cis time resolved phosphorescence anisotropy experiments demonstrated that the presence of the c terminal third of dystrophin in cis also influences actin interaction by restricting actin rotational amplitude we propose that the c terminal region of dystrophin allosterically stabilizes an optimal actin binding conformation of dystrophin
