apobec de antagonizes hepatitis b virus restriction factors apobec f and apobec g
the apobec locus consists of seven genes a a  a c a de a f  a h that encode dna cytidine deaminases these enzymes deaminate single stranded dna the result being dna peppered with cg  ta mutations preferentially in the context of   tpc with the exception of apobec g a g  which prefers   cpc dinucleotides hepatitis b virus hbv dna is vulnerable to genetic editing by apobec cytidine deaminases a g being a major restriction factor apobec de a de stands out in that it is catalytically inactive due to a fixed tyr  cys substitution in the c terminal domain as a de is closely related to a f and a g which can form homo and heterodimers and multimers the impact of a de on hbv replication via modulation of other apobec restriction factors was investigated a de binds to itself a f and a g and antagonizes a f and to a lesser extent a g restriction of hbv replication a de suppresses a f and a g from hbv particles leading to enhanced hbv replication ironically while being part of a cluster of innate restriction factors the a de phenotype is proviral as the gorilla genome encodes the same tyr  cys substitution this proviral phenotype seems to have been selected for
