structural analysis of the human galectin  n terminal carbohydrate recognition domain reveals unexpected properties that differ from the mouse orthologue
galectins are a family of  galactoside binding lectins that contain a conserved carbohydrate recognition domain crd  they exhibit high affinities for small  galactosides as well as variable binding specificities for complex glycoconjugates structural and biochemical analyses of the mechanism governing specific carbohydrate recognition provide a useful template to elucidate the function of these proteins here we report the crystal structures of the human galectin  n terminal crd ncrd in the presence of lactose and forssman pentasaccharide mouse galectin  ncrd the structure of which was previously solved by our group forms a non canonical dimer in both the crystal state and in solution human galectin  ncrd however exists as a monomer in crystals despite a high sequence identity to the mouse homologue comparative frontal affinity chromatography analysis of the mouse and human galectin  ncrds revealed different carbohydrate binding specificities with disparate affinities for complex glycoconjugates human galectin  ncrd exhibited a high affinity for forssman pentasaccharide the association constant for mouse galectin  ncrd was   fold less than that observed for the human protein the combination of structural data with mutational studies demonstrated that non conserved amino acid residues on the concave surface were important for determination of target specificities the human galectin  ncrd exhibited greater inhibition of cell proliferation than the mouse ncrd we discuss the biochemical and structural differences between highly homologous proteins from different species
