structural studies of the final enzyme in the  aminoadipate pathway saccharopine dehydrogenase from saccharomyces cerevisiae
the     structure of the apoenzyme form of saccharopine dehydrogenase sdh from saccharomyces cerevisiae shows the enzyme to be composed of two domains with similar dinucleotide binding folds with a deep cleft at the interface the structure reveals homology to alanine dehydrogense despite low primary sequence similarity a model of the ternary complex of sdh nad and saccharopine identifies residues lys  and glu  as potentially important for substrate binding and or catalysis consistent with a proton shuttle mechanism furthermore the model suggests that a conformational change is required for catalysis and that residues lys  and asp  may be instrumental in mediating this change analysis of the crystal structure in the context of other homologous enzymes from pathogenic fungi and human sources sheds light into the suitability of sdh as a target for antimicrobial drug development
