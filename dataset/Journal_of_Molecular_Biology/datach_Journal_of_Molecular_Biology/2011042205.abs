ancylostoma ceylanicum excretory  secretory protein  adopts a netrin like fold and defines a novel family of nematode proteins
hookworms are human parasites that have devastating effects on global health particularly in underdeveloped countries ancylostoma ceylanicum infects humans and animals making it a useful model organism to study disease pathogenesis a ceylanicum excretory  secretory protein  acees   a highly immunoreactive molecule secreted by adult worms at the site of intestinal attachment is partially protective when administered as a mucosal vaccine against hookworm anemia the crystal structure of acees  determined at     resolution shows that it adopts a netrin like fold similar to that found in tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases timps and in complement factors c and c  however recombinant acees  does not significantly inhibit the  most abundant human matrix metalloproteases or complement mediated cell lysis the presence of a highly acidic surface on acees  suggests that it may function as a cytokine decoy receptor several small nematode proteins that have been annotated as timps or netrin domain containing proteins display sequence homology in structurally important regions of acees   s netrin like fold together our results suggest that acees  defines a novel family of nematode netrin like proteins which may function to modulate the host immune response to hookworm and other parasites
