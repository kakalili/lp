vgnm a better model for understanding the dynamics of proteins in crystals
the dynamics of proteins are important for understanding their functions in recent years the simple coarse grained gaussian network model gnm has been fairly successful in interpreting crystallographic b factors however the model clearly ignores the contribution of the rigid body motions and the effect of crystal packing the model cannot explain the fact that the same protein may have significantly different b factors under different crystal packing conditions in this work we propose a new gnm called vgnm which takes into account both the contribution of the rigid body motions and the effect of crystal packing by allowing the amplitude of the internal modes to be variables it hypothesizes that the effect of crystal packing should cause some modes to be amplified and others to become less important in doing so vgnm is able to resolve the apparent discrepancy in experimental b factors among structures of the same protein but with different crystal packing conditions which gnm cannot explain with a small number of parameters vgnm is able to reproduce experimental b factors for a large set of proteins with significantly better correlations having a mean value of   as compared to   by gnm  the results of applying vgnm also show that the rigid body motions account for nearly   of the total fluctuations in good agreement with previous findings
