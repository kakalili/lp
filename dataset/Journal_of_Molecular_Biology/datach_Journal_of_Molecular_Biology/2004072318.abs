pairwise interactions of the six human mcm protein subunits
the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance mcm proteins have six subunits mcm to p together they play essential roles in the initiation and elongation of dna replication and the human mcm proteins present attractive targets for potential anticancer drugs the six mcm subunits interact and form a ring shaped heterohexameric complex containing one of each subunit in a variety of eukaryotes and subcomplexes have also been observed however the architecture of the human mcm heterohexameric complex is still unknown we systematically studied pairwise interactions of individual human mcm subunits by using the yeast two hybrid system and in vivo protein  protein crosslinking with a non cleavable crosslinker in human cells followed by co immunoprecipitation in the yeast two hybrid assays we revealed multiple binary interactions among the six human mcm proteins and a subset of these interactions was also detected as direct interactions in human cells based on our results we propose a model for the architecture of the human mcm protein heterohexameric complex we also propose models for the structures of subcomplexes thus this study may serve as a foundation for understanding the overall architecture and function of eukaryotic mcm protein complexes and as clues for developing anticancer drugs targeted to the human mcm proteins
