Filamin C is a dimeric, actin-binding protein involved in organization of cortical cytoskeleton and of the sarcomere. We performed crystallographic, small-angle X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments on the constructs containing carboxy-terminal domains of the protein (domains 23–24 and 19–21). The crystal structure of domain 23 of filamin C showed that the protein adopts the expected immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments performed on filamin C tandem Ig-like domains 23 and 24 reveal a dimer that is formed by domain 24 and that domain 23 has little interactions with itself or with domain 24, while the analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the filamin C domains 19–21 form elongated monomers in diluted solutions.
