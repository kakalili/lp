mutagenic mapping of helical structures in the transmembrane segments of the yeast  factor receptor edited by i b holland
the  mating pheromone receptor encoded by the yeast ste gene is a g protein coupled receptor that initiates signaling via a map kinase pathway that prepares haploid cells for mating to establish the range of allowed amino acid substitutions within transmembrane segments of this receptor we conducted extensive random mutagenesis of receptors followed by screening for receptor function a total of   amino acid positions in seven different mutagenic libraries corresponding to the seven predicted transmembrane segments were analyzed yielding   alleles that retain at least   of normal signaling function these alleles contained a total of   unique amino acid substitutions including   of all the possible amino acid changes that can arise from single base substitutions the receptor exhibits a surprising tolerance for amino acid substitutions every amino acid in the mutagenized regions of the transmembrane regions could be substituted by at least one other residue polar amino acids were tolerated in functional receptors at   different positions    of the total  hydrophobic amino acids were tolerated in functional receptors at all mutagenized positions substitutions introducing proline residues were recovered at   of all positions where they could be brought about by single base changes residues with charged side chains could also be tolerated at   of all positions where they were accessible through single base changes the spectrum of allowed amino acid substitutions was characterized in terms of the hydrophobicity radius of gyration and charge of the allowed substitutions and mapped onto  helical structures by comparing the patterns of allowed substitutions with the recently determined structure of rhodopsin structural features indicative of helix helix interactions can be discerned in spite of the extreme sequence divergence between these two proteins
