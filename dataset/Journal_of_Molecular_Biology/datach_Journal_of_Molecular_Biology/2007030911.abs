relationships between the sequence of  synuclein and its membrane affinity fibrillization propensity and yeast toxicity
to investigate the  synuclein protein and its role in parkinson s disease we screened a library of random point mutants both in vitro and in yeast to find variants in an unbiased way that could help us understand the sequence  phenotype relationship we developed a rapid purification method that allowed us to screen  synuclein mutants in vitro and discovered two double point mutants that fibrillized slowly relative to wild type a p and a t  synucleins the yeast toxicity of all of these proteins was measured and we found no correlation with fibrillization rate suggesting that fibrillization is not necessary for synuclein induced yeast toxicity we found that  synuclein was of intermediate toxicity to yeast and  synuclein was non toxic co expression of parkinson s disease related genes dj  parkin pink  uch l  or synphilin with synuclein did not affect synuclein toxicity a second screen of several thousand library clones in yeast identified  non toxic  synuclein sequence variants most of these contained a mutation to either proline or glutamic acid that caused a defect in membrane binding we hypothesize that yeast toxicity is caused by synuclein binding directly to membranes at levels sufficient to non specifically disrupt homeostasis
