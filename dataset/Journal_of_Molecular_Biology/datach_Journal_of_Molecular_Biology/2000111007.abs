crystal structure of n acyl d glucosamine  epimerase from porcine kidney at    resolution edited by r huber
the x ray crystallographic structure of n acyl d glucosamine  epimerase age from porcine kidney which has been identified to be a renin binding protein rnbp  was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and refined at    resolution with a final r factor of    for  to    resolution data the refined structure of age comprised   amino acid residues one dimer and   water molecules the dimer of age had an asymmetric unit with approximate dimensions           the age monomer is composed of an     barrel the structure of which is found in glucoamylase and cellulase one side of the age     barrel structure comprises long loops containing five short  sheets and contributes to the formation of a deep cleft shaped like a funnel the putative active site pocket and a possible binding site for the substrate n acetyl d glucosamine glcnac were found in the cleft the other side of the     barrel comprises short loops and contributes to the dimer formation at the dimer interface which is composed of the short loops and  helices of the subunits five strong ion pair interactions were observed which play a major role in the dimer assembly this completely ruled out the previously accepted hypothesis that the formation of the rnbp homodimer and rnbp renin heterodimer requires the leucine zipper motif present in rnbp
