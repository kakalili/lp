a double chain reversal loop and two diagonal loops define the architecture of unimolecular dna quadruplex containing a pair of stacked g syn  g syn  g anti  g anti tetrads flanked by a g  t t triad and a t t t triple edited by m f summers
the architecture of g g g g tetrad aligned dna quadruplexes in monovalent cation solution is dependent on the directionality of the four strands which in turn are defined by loop connectivities and the guanine syn anti distribution along individual strands and within individual g g g g tetrads the smallest unimolecular g quadruplex belongs to the d g nng nng nng  family which has the potential to form two stacked g tetrads linked by nn loop connectivities previous studies have focused on the thrombin binding dna aptamer d g t g tgtg t g  where nn was t for the first and third connecting loops and tgt for the middle connecting loop this dna aptamer in k cation solution forms a unimolecular g quadruplex stabilized by two stacked g syn  g anti  g syn  g anti tetrads adjacent strands which are antiparallel to each other and edge wise connecting t  tgt and t loops we now report on the nmr based solution structure of the d g t g cag gt g t sequence which differs from the thrombin binding dna aptamer sequence in having longer first t  and third gt  loops and a shorter ca middle loop this d g t g cag gt g t sequence in na cation solution forms a unimolecular g quadruplex stabilized by two stacked g syn  g syn  g anti  g anti tetrads adjacent strands which have one parallel and one antiparallel neighbors and distinct non edge wise loop connectivities specifically the longer first t  and third gt  loops are of the diagonal type while the shorter middle loop is of the double chain reversal type in addition the pair of stacked g g g g tetrads are flanked on one side by a g  t t triad and on the other side by a t t t triple the distinct differences in strand directionalities loop connectivities and syn anti distribution within g g g g tetrads between the thrombin binding dna aptamer d g t g tgtg t g  quadruplex reported previously and the d g t g cag gt g t quadruplex reported here reinforces the polymorphic nature of higher order dna architectures further these two small unimolecular g quadruplexes which are distinct from each other and from parallel stranded g quadruplexes provide novel targets for ligand recognition our results demonstrate that the double chain reversal loop connectivity identified previously by our laboratory within the tetrahymena telomere d t g  quadruplex is a robust folding topology since it has now also been observed within the d g t g cag gt g t quadruplex the identification of a g  t t triad and a t t t triple expands on the available recognition alignments for base triads and triples
