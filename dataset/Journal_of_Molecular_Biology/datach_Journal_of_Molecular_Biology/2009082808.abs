correlation of rna secondary structure statistics with thermodynamic stability and applications to folding
the accurate prediction of the secondary and tertiary structure of an rna with different folding algorithms is dependent on several factors including the energy functions however an rna higher order structure cannot be predicted accurately from its sequence based on a limited set of energy parameters the inter and intramolecular forces between this rna and other small molecules and macromolecules in addition to other factors in the cell such as ph ionic strength and temperature influence the complex dynamics associated with transition of a single stranded rna to its secondary and tertiary structure since all of the factors that affect the formation of an rnas d structure cannot be determined experimentally statistically derived potential energy has been used in the prediction of protein structure in the current work we evaluate the statistical free energy of various secondary structure motifs including base pair stacks hairpin loops and internal loops using their statistical frequency obtained from the comparative analysis of more than    rna sequences stored in the rna comparative analysis database rcad at the comparative rna web crw site statistical energy was computed from the structural statistics for several datasets while the statistical energy for a base pair stack correlates with experimentally derived free energy values suggesting a boltzmann like distribution variation is observed between different molecules and their location on the phylogenetic tree of life our statistical energy values calculated for several structural elements were utilized in the mfold rna folding algorithm the combined statistical energy values for base pair stacks hairpins and internal loop flanks result in a significant improvement in the accuracy of secondary structure prediction the hairpin flanks contribute the most
