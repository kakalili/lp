recognition of nucleoside monophosphate substrates by haemophilus influenzae class c acid phosphatase
the e p  phosphatase from haemophilus influenzae functions in a vestigial nad utilization pathway by dephosphorylating nicotinamide mononucleotide to nicotinamide riboside p is also the prototype of class c acid phosphatases ccaps  which are nonspecific      nucleotidases localized to the bacterial outer membrane to understand substrate recognition by p and other class c phosphatases we have determined the crystal structures of a substrate trapping mutant p enzyme complexed with nicotinamide mononucleotide    amp    amp and   amp the structures reveal an anchor shaped substrate binding cavity comprising a conserved hydrophobic box that clamps the nucleotide base a buried phosphoryl binding site and three solvent filled pockets that contact the ribose and the hydrogen bonding edge of the base the span between the hydrophobic box and the phosphoryl site is optimal for recognizing nucleoside monophosphates explaining the general preference for this class of substrate the base makes no hydrogen bonds with the enzyme consistent with an observed lack of base specificity two solvent filled pockets flanking the ribose are key to the dual recognition of   nucleotides and   nucleotides these pockets minimize the enzyme s direct interactions with the ribose and provide sufficient space to accommodate   substrates in an anti conformation and   substrates in a syn conformation finally the structures suggest that class b acid phosphatases and ccaps share a common strategy for nucleotide recognition
