conformation changes in e coli rho monitored by hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry response to ligand binding
escherichia coli rho is a doughnut shaped homohexameric atp dependent rna  dna helicase that releases newly synthesized rna molecules from transcription complexes rho binds     bases of rna among six primary rna binding sites around the inside of its n terminal crown the rna then passes through the central hole of the hexamer here it triggers atp hydrolysis and is moved with respect to the protein we study protein conformation changes upon ligand binding using amide proton hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry global exchange studies indicate net mass differences of about   da after  h of exchange in the presence  versus in the absence  of the ligand mgatp or the rna poly c  sites of ligand dependent exchange differences were localized by mass determination of the peptic peptides of rho a peptide of the n terminal domain near the known primary rna sites aa      was protected from amide proton exchange in the presence of poly c  as was a novel n terminal domain peptide that is not near rna in the crystal structures or in nmr structures with rna oligomers aa      this result may further define the primary interaction site of rna with rho the q loop containing peptide in the central hole of the protein that interacts with rna was also protected by rna aa       the exchange rate of one peptide near the atpase active site aa       slowed in the presence of mgatp and increased in the presence of rna overall the results show changes in a few protein segments rather than a different overall conformation
