a free energy cascade with locks drives assembly and maturation of bacteriophage hk  capsid
we investigated the thermodynamic basis of hk  assembly by scanning calorimetry and cryo electron microscopy this pathway involves self assembly of hexamers and pentamers of the precursor capsid protein gp into procapsids proteolysis of their n terminal  domains expansion a major conformational change and covalent crosslinking the thermal denaturation parameters convey the changes in stability at successive steps in assembly and afford estimates of the corresponding changes in free energy the procapsid represents a kinetically accessible local minimum of free energy in maturation it progresses to lower minima in a cascade punctuated by irreversible processes   locks   i e proteolysis and crosslinking that lower kinetic barriers and prevent regression we infer that  domains not only guide assembly but also restrain the procapsid from premature expansion their removal by proteolysis is conducive to initiating expansion and to its proceeding to completion we also analyzed the mutant e  k whose capsomers reassemble in vitro into procapsids with vacant vertices called  whiffleballs   e  k assemblies all have markedly reduced stability compared to wild type gp   tp      c to     c where tp is the denaturation temperature  as the mutated residue is buried in the core of gp  we attribute the observed reduction in stability to steric and electrostatic perturbations of the packing of side chains in the subunit interior to explain the whiffleball phenotype we suggest that these effects propagate to the capsomer periphery in such a way as to differentially affect the stability or solubility of dissociated pentamers leaving only hexamers to reassemble
