crystal structures of artocarpin a moraceae lectin with mannose specificity and its complex with methyl  d mannose implications to the generation of carbohydrate specificity edited by r huber
the seeds of jack fruit artocarpus integrifolia contain two tetrameric lectins jacalin and artocarpin jacalin was the first lectin found to exhibit the  prism i fold which is characteristic of the moraceae plant lectin family jacalin contains two polypeptide chains produced by a post translational proteolysis which has been shown to be crucial for generating its specificity for galactose artocarpin is a single chain protein with considerable sequence similarity with jacalin it however exhibits many properties different from those of jacalin in particular it is specific to mannose the structures of two crystal forms form i and form ii of the native lectin have been determined at   and    resolution respectively the structure of the lectin complexed with methyl  mannose has also been determined at    resolution the structure is similar to jacalin although differences exist in details the crystal structures and detailed modelling studies indicate that the following differences between the carbohydrate binding sites of artocarpin and jacalin are responsible for the difference in the specificities of the two lectins firstly artocarpin does not contain unlike jacalin an n terminus generated by post translational proteolysis secondly there is no aromatic residue in the binding site of artocarpin whereas there are four in that of jacalin a comparison with similar lectins of known structures or sequences suggests that in general stacking interactions with aromatic residues are important for the binding of galactose while such interactions are usually absent in the carbohydrate binding sites of mannose specific lectins with the  prism i fold
