The γ-butyrolactone-type autoregulator/receptor systems in the Gram-positive bacterial genus Streptomyces regulate morphological differentiation or antibiotic production, or both. The autoregulator receptors act as DNA-binding proteins, and on binding their cognate ligands (γ-butyrolactones) they are released from the DNA, thus serving as repressors. The crystal structure of CprB in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), a homologue of the A-factor-receptor protein, ArpA, in Streptomyces griseus, was determined. The overall structure of CprB shows that the γ-butyrolactone receptors belong to the TetR family. CprB is composed of two domains, a DNA-binding domain and a regulatory domain. The regulatory domain contains a hydrophobic cavity, which probably serves as a ligand-binding pocket. On the basis of the crystal structure of CprB and on the analogy of the characteristics of ligand-TetR binding, the binding of γ-butyrolactones to the regulatory domain of the receptors is supposed to induce the relocation of the DNA-binding domain through conformational changes of residues located between the ligand-binding site and the DNA-binding domain, which would result in the dissociation of the receptors from their target DNA.
