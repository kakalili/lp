the    crystal structure of   acid glycoprotein orosomucoid solved by uv rip reveals the broad drug binding activity of this human plasma lipocalin
acid glycoprotein agp is an important drug binding protein in human plasma and as an acute phase protein it has a strong influence on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many pharmaceuticals we report the crystal structure of the recombinant unglycosylated human agp at     resolution which was solved using the new method of uv radiation damage induced phasing uv rip  agp reveals a typical lipocalin fold comprising an eight stranded  barrel of the four loops that form the entrance to the ligand binding site loop  which connects  strands a and b is among the longest observed so far and exhibits two full turns of an  helix furthermore it carries one of the five n linked glycosylation sites while a second one occurs underneath the tip of loop  the branched partly hydrophobic and partly acidic cavity together with the presumably flexible loop  and the two sugar side chains at its entrance explains the diverse ligand spectrum of agp which is known to vary with changes in glycosylation pattern
