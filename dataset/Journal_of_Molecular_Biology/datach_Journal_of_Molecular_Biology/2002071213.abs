hetero oligomerization among the tif family of rbcc trim domain containing nuclear cofactors a potential mechanism for regulating the switch between coactivation and corepression
the ring b box coiled coil rbcc motif also re named recently as the tripartite motif trim  is a widely distributed motif that is hypothesized to be a protein  protein interface the rbcc trim domain of the corepressor kap  is both necessary and sufficient to interact directly with the transcription repressor krab domain each subdomain of the kap  rbcc contributes directly to the oligomerization and or ligand recognition little is known about the function or the natural binding ligands for the rbcc trim domain of the other tif family members in order to investigate whether hetero oligomerization might be a biological regulatory mechanism we have evaluated the hetero oligomerization potential of the tif family members including kap  tif   tif   and the rbcc trim family members including pml  and mid  we have reconstituted and characterized the oligomerization for these proteins using baculovirus and mammalian expression systems by biochemical approaches our data indicate that the rbcc trim domains of kap  tif  and tif  exist in a homo oligomeric state however there is little cross talk between kap  and other tif family members suggesting that a high degree of specificity for oligomerization interface and ligand recognition is intrinsically built into the rbcc trim domain of kap  finally we demonstrate that tif  interacts with tif  and the coiled coil region of tif  is necessary for this interaction the hetero oligomerization between tif  and tif  implies a potential regulatory mechanism for transcriptional regulation
