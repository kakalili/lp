functional characterization of the poly adp ribose polymerase activity of tankyrase  a potential regulator of telomere length
poly adp ribose polymerases parps comprise a growing family of enzymes known to be involved in genotoxic signaling and metabolic regulation one of the latest family members tankyrase  was shown to be involved in maintenance of telomere integrity here we expressed full length tankyrase  and a fragment termed t parp spanning the poly adp ribose polymerase domain and characterized the enzymatic properties of the two proteins both tankyrase  and t parp catalyze an auto poly adp ribosyl ation reaction with comparable catalytic activity in contrast  adp ribosyl ation of trf  a previously described substrate is strongly performed only by the full length enzyme but not by t parp characterization of the poly adp ribose products reveals that tankyrase  synthesizes polymers with an average chain length of  units and no detectable branching of the polymers finally we show that the catalytic efficiency of tankyrase  as expressed by the kcat km value is approximately   fold lower compared to the basal activity of the poly adp ribose polymerase parp
