selection of  lactamases and penicillin binding mutants from a library of phage displayed tem   lactamase randomly mutated in the active site  loop edited by a r fersht
a combinatorial library of mutants of the phage displayed tem  lactamase was generated in the region encompassing residues   to   of the active site  loop two in vitro selection protocols were designed to extract from the library phage enzymes characterised by a fast acylation by benzyl penicillin peng to yield either stable or very unstable acyl enzymes the critical step of the selections was the kinetically controlled labelling of the phages by reaction with either a biotinylated penicillin derivative or a biotinylated penicillin sulfone i e a  lactamase suicide substrate the biotinylated phages were recovered by panning on immobilised streptavidin as labelling with biotinylated suicide substrates tends to select enzymes that do not turnover a counter selection against penicillin binding mutants was introduced to extract the  lactamases the selected phage enzymes were characterised by sequencing to identify conserved residues and by kinetic analysis of the reaction with benzyl penicillin several penicillin binding mutants in which the essential glu  is replaced by asn were shown to be acylated very fast by peng the acylation being characterised by biphasic kinetics these data are interpreted by a kinetic scheme in which the enzymes exist in two interconvertible conformations the rate constant of the conformational change suggests that it involves an isomerisation of the peptide bond between residues   and   and controls a conformation of the  loop compatible with fast acylation of the active site serine residue
