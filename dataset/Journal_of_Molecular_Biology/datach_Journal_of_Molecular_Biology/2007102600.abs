programmed ribosomal frameshifting in siv is induced by a highly structured rna stem  loop
simian immunodeficiency virus siv  like its human homologues hiv  hiv   requires a  translational frameshift event to properly synthesize all of the proteins required for viral replication the frameshift mechanism is dependent upon a seven nucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream rna structure in siv the downstream rna structure has been proposed to be either a stem  loop or a pseudoknot here we report the functional structural and thermodynamic characterization of the siv frameshift site rna translational frameshift assays indicate that a stem  loop structure is sufficient to promote efficient frameshifting in vitro nmr and thermodynamic studies of siv rna constructs of varying length further support the absence of any pseudoknot interaction and indicate the presence of a stable stem  loop structure we determined the structure of the siv frameshift inducing rna by nmr the structure reveals a highly ordered  nucleotide loop containing a sheared g a pair cross strand adenine stacking two g c base pairs and a novel ccc triloop turn the loop structure and its high thermostability preclude pseudoknot formation sequence conservation and modeling studies suggest that hiv  rna forms the same structure we conclude that like the main sub groups of hiv  siv and hiv  utilize stable stem  loop structures to function as a thermodynamic barrier to translation thereby inducing ribosomal pausing and frameshifting
