hiv  nucleocapsid protein switches the pathway of transactivation response element rna dna annealing from loop  loop  kissing  to  zipper
the chaperone activity of hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  nucleocapsid protein nc facilitates multiple nucleic acid rearrangements that are critical for reverse transcription of the single stranded rna genome into double stranded dna annealing of the transactivation response element tar rna hairpin to a complementary tar dna hairpin is an essential step in the minus strand transfer step of reverse transcription previously we used truncated  nt mini tar rna and dna constructs to investigate this annealing reaction pathway in the presence and in the absence of hiv  nc in this work full length  nt tar rna and tar dna constructs were used to systematically study tar hairpin annealing kinetics in the absence of nc full length tar hairpin annealing is    fold slower than mini tar annealing similar to mini tar annealing the reaction pathway for tar in the absence of nc involves the fast formation of an unstable  kissing  loop intermediate followed by a slower conversion to an extended duplex nc facilitates the annealing of tar by    fold by stabilizing the bimolecular intermediate     fold and promoting the subsequent exchange reaction    fold  in contrast to the mini tar annealing pathway wherein nc mediated annealing can initiate through both loop  loop kissing and a distinct  zipper  pathway involving nucleation at the      terminal ends full length tar hairpin annealing switches predominantly to the zipper pathway in the presence of saturated nc
