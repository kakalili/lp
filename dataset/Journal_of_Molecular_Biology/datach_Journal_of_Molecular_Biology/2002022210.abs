architecture of fis activated transcription complexes at the escherichia coli rrnb p and rrne p promoters edited by m gottesman
the transcription factor fis activates the escherichia coli rrna promoters rrnb p and rrne p by binding to sites centered at    and    respectively and interacting with the c terminal domain of the  subunit of rna polymerase rnap  ctd  to understand the mechanism of activation by fis at these promoters we used oriented  heterodimeric rnaps and heterodimers of fis to determine whether one or both subunits of  and fis participate in the  ctd fis interaction our results imply that only one  ctd in the  dimer and only one activation proficient subunit in the fis dimer are required for activation by fis a library of alanine substitutions in  was used to identify the  ctd determinants required for fis dependent transcription at rrnb p and rrne p  we propose that the transcriptional activation region of the promoter proximal subunit of the fis dimer interacts with a determinant that includes e  of one  ctd to activate transcription we further suggest that the fis contact to  ctd results in  ctd interactions with dna that differ somewhat from those that occur at up elements in the absence of fis the accompanying paper shows that the   determinant on  ctd is also targeted by fis at the prop p promoter where the activator binds overlapping the    hexamer thus similar fis  ctd interactions are used for activation of transcription when the activator is bound at very different positions on the dna
