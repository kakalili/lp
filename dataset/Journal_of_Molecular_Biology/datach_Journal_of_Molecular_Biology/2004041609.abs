promate a structure based prediction program to identify the location of protein  protein binding sites
is the whole protein surface available for interaction with other proteins or are specific sites pre assigned according to their biophysical and structural character and if so is it possible to predict the location of the binding site from the surface properties these questions are answered quantitatively by probing the surfaces of proteins using spheres of radius of   on a database db of  unique non homologous proteins involved in heteromeric transient protein  protein interactions for which the structures of both the unbound and bound states were determined in structural terms we found the binding site to have a preference for  sheets and for relatively long non structured chains but not for  helices chemically aromatic side chains show a clear preference for binding sites while the hydrophobic and polar content of the interface is similar to the rest of the surface hydrophobic and polar residues tend to cluster in interfaces in the crystal the binding site has more bound water molecules surrounding it and a lower b factor already in the unbound protein the same biophysical properties were found to hold for the unbound and bound dbs all the significant interface properties were combined into promate an interface prediction program this was followed by an optimization step to choose the best combination of properties as many of them are correlated during optimization and prediction the tested proteins were not used for data collection to avoid over fitting the prediction algorithm is fully automated and is used to predict the location of potential binding sites on unbound proteins with known structures the algorithm is able to successfully predict the location of the interface for about   of the proteins the success rate of the predictor was equal whether applied on the unbound db or on the disjoint bound db a prediction is assumed correct if over half of the predicted continuous interface patch is indeed interface the ability to predict the location of protein  protein interfaces has far reaching implications both towards our understanding of specificity and kinetics of binding as well as in assisting in the analysis of the proteome
