dna synthesis across an abasic lesion by yeast rev dna polymerase
abasic apurinic apyrimidinic sites are among the most abundant dna lesions in humans and they present a strong block to replication they are also highly mutagenic because when replicative dna polymerases manage to insert a nucleotide opposite the lesion they prefer to insert an a rev  a member of y family dna polymerases does not obey the a rule this enzyme inserts a c opposite an abasic lesion with much greater catalytic efficiency than an a g or t we present here the structure of yeast rev in ternary complex with dna containing an abasic lesion and with dctp as the incoming nucleotide the structure reveals a mechanism of synthesis across an abasic lesion that differs from that in other polymerases the lesion is driven to an extrahelical position and the incorporation of a c is mediated by an arginine arg   that is conserved in all known orthologs of rev  including humans the hydrophobic cavity that normally accommodates the unmodified g is instead filled with water molecules since gs are especially prone to depurination through a spontaneous hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond the ability of rev to stabilize an abasic lesion in its active site and employ a surrogate arginine to incorporate a c provides a unique means for the  error free  bypass of this noninstructional lesion
