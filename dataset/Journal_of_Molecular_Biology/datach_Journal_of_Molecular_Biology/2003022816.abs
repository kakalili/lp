crystal structure of geneticin bound to a bacterial  s ribosomal rna a site oligonucleotide
aminoglycosides are antibacterial molecules that decrease translation accuracy by binding to the decoding aminoacyl trna site a site on  s ribosomal rna we have solved the crystal structure of an rna fragment containing the a site bound to geneticin at    resolution geneticin also known as g   is a gentamicin related aminoglycoside it contains three rings that are functionalized by hydroxyl ammonium and methyl groups the detailed comparison of the distinctive behaviour of geneticin binding to pro and eukaryotic a sites with the crystallographic biochemical and microbiological results obtained so far for aminoglycoside a site complexes offers new insights on the system the two sugar rings constituting the neamine part common to most of the aminoglycosides bind to the a site as already observed in the crystal structures solved previously with paromomycin and tobramycin the essential hydrogen bonds involving ring i to a   and ring ii to the phosphate oxygen atoms of the bulged adenine bases   and   and to g   are conserved and additional contacts are observed from ring iii to phosphate oxygen atoms of g   and u    the present work illustrates a molecular basis of the range in sensitiveness exhibited by geneticin towards common point a site mutations associated to resistance phenotypes in addition analysis and comparisons of the structures cast light on the role played by the conserved u   u   pair in the recognition of the a site by aminoglycosides
