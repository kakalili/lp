insights into lou gehrig s disease from the structure and instability of the a v mutant of human cu zn superoxide dismutase
mutations in human superoxide dismutase hsod have been linked to the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis fals  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als or lou gehrig s disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders in humans in als patients selective killing of motor neurons leads to progressive paralysis and death within one to five years of onset the most frequent fals mutation in hsod ala  val is associated with the most rapid disease progression here we identify and characterize key differences in the stability between the a v mutant protein and its thermostable parent hsod as  in which free cysteine residues were mutated to eliminate interferences from cysteine oxidation denaturation studies reveal that a v unfolds at a guanidine  hcl concentration m lower than hsod as revealing that a v is significantly less stable than hsod as determination and analysis of the crystallographic structures of a v and hsod as reveal structural features likely responsible for the loss of architectural stability of a v observed in the denaturation experiments the combined structural and biophysical results presented here argue that architectural destabilization of the hsod protein may underlie the toxic function of the many hsod fals mutations
