promoter of fgf reveals a unique regulation by unliganded rar
we previously reported that retinoids were inducing a complete switch in the expression of two isoforms from the fgf gene in order to gain insight into the transcriptional mechanisms possibly involved in this regulation we cloned and sequenced a fragment of genomic dna encompassing kb of the region   upstream of the fgf coding sequence and investigated its promoter elements a comprehensive series of biochemical and cellular experiments determined two distinct functional regions cis responsive to retinoids and or their receptors  i a canonical rare type dr  which is the cis target of a rar   rxr  liganded heterodimer and ii a completely novel type of response element composed of two half binding sites separated by  nucleotides which we demonstrate to be the target of an unliganded rar  homodimer phosphorylated on the ser  residue combined activities of these cis and trans acting factors support a model of a complex regulation of fgf expression by alternative binding to two distinct promoter elements phosphorylated unliganded rar  homodimer or its liganded form have two distinct and mutually exclusive trans activating activities explaining the expression of two different isoforms of fgf
