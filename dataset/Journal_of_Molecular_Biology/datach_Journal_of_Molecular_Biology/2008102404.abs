specific interdomain synergy in the uapa transporter determines its unique specificity for uric acid among nat carriers
uapa a uric acid  xanthine permease of aspergillus nidulans has been used as a prototype to study structure  function relationships in the ubiquitous nucleobase  ascorbate transporter nat family using novel genetic screens rational mutational design chimeric nat molecules and extensive transport kinetic analyses we show that dynamic synergy between three distinct domains transmembrane segment tms  the tms   loop and tms  defines the function and specificity of uapa the tms   loop includes four residues absolutely essential for substrate binding and transport glu   asp   gln   and asn   whereas tms and tms  seem to control through steric hindrance or electrostatic repulsion the differential access of purines to the tms   domain thus uapa specificity is determined directly by the specific interactions of a given substrate with the tms   loop and indirectly by interactions of this loop with tms and tms  we finally show that intramolecular synergy among uapa domains is highly specific and propose that it forms the basis for the evolution of the unique specificity of uapa for uric acid a property not present in other nat members
