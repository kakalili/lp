nmr structures of  proteobacterial atpase regulating  subunits
nmr structures of  subunits which are recently discovered  proteobacterial f f atpase regulatory proteins representing a pfam protein family of   sequences from   species pf    exhibit a four helix bundle which is different from all other known f f atpase inhibitors chemical shift mapping reveals a conserved adp atp binding site in  subunit which mediates long range conformational changes related to function as revealed by the structure of the paracoccus denitrificans  subunit in complex with adp these structural data suggest a new mechanism of f f atpase regulation in  proteobacteria
