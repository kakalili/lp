rapid odorant release in mammalian odour binding proteins facilitates their temporal coupling to odorant signals
we have measured the effect of rat odorant binding protein  on the rates of ligand uptake and liquid to air transfer rates with a set of defined odorous compounds comparison of observed rate constants kobs with data simulated over a wide range of different kinetic and thermodynamic regimes shows that the data do not agree with the previously held view of a slow off rate regime koff lt     s    we propose that a rapid koff would be a necessary requirement for such a system since slow odorant release rates would result in significant decorrelation between the olfactory world and odour perception
