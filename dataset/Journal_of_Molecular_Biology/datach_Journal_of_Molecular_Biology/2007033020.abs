the three dimensional structure of n succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
inhibitors of the enzymes of the lysine biosynthetic pathway are considered promising lead compounds for the design of new antibacterial drugs because the pathway appears to be indispensable for bacteria and because it is absent in humans as part of our efforts to structurally characterize all enzymes of this pathway in mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb  we have determined the three dimensional structure of n succinyldiaminopimelate aminotransferase dapc dap at rv  c to a resolution of     this structure is the first dap at structure reported to date the orthorhombic crystals of mtb dap at contain one functional dimer exhibiting c symmetry in the asymmetric unit the homodimer displays the typical s shape of class i pyridoxal   phosphate plp binding proteins the two active sites of the dimer both feature an internal aldimine with the co factor plp covalently bound to the lys   although neither substrate nor co factor had been added during protein production purification and crystallization nine water molecules are conserved in the active site and form an intricate hydrogen bonding network with the co factor and the surrounding amino acid residues together with some residual difference electron density in the active site this architecture permitted the building of external aldimine models of the enzyme with the substrates glutamate the amine donor and n succinyl  amino  keto pimelate the amine acceptor based on these models the amino acids relevant for substrate binding and specificity can be postulated furthermore in the external aldimine model of n succinyl  amino  keto pimelate the succinyl group overlaps with a glycerol binding site that has also been identified in both active sites of the mtb dap at dimer a comparison of the structure of mtb dap at with other class i plp binding proteins revealed that some inhibitors utilize the same binding site thus the proposed models also provide an explanation for the mode of inhibition of mtb dap at and they may be of help in the design of compounds which are capable of inhibiting the enzyme last but not least a chloride binding helix exhibiting a peculiar amino acid sequence with a number of exposed hydrophobic side chains was identified which may be hypothesized as a putative docking site
