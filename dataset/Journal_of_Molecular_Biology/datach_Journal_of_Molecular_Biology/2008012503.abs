crystal structure of a complex between the phosphorelay protein ypd and the response regulator domain of sln bound to a phosphoryl analog
the crystal structure of the yeast sln response regulator rr domain bound to both a phosphoryl analog beryllium fluoride bef    and mg  in complex with its downstream phosphorelay signaling partner ypd  has been determined at a resolution of      comparisons between the bef   activated complex and the unliganded or apo complex determined previously reveal modest but important differences the sln r  mg  bef   structure from the complex provides evidence for the first time that the mechanism of phosphorylation induced activation is highly conserved between bacterial rr domains and this example from a eukaryotic organism residues in and around the active site undergo slight rearrangements in order to form bonds with the essential divalent cation and fluorine atoms of bef   two conserved switch like residues thr   and phe   occupy distinctly different positions in the apo versus bef   bound structures consistent with the  y  t  coupling mechanism proposed for the activation of chey and other bacterial rrs several loop regions and the         surface of the sln r domain undergo subtle conformational changes        displacements relative to the apo structure that lead to significant changes in terms of contacts that are formed with ypd  detailed structural comparisons of protein  protein interactions in the apo and bef   bound complexes suggest at least a two state equilibrium model for the formation of a transient encounter complex in which phosphorylation of the rr promotes the formation of a phosphotransfer competent complex in the bef   activated complex the position of his  from ypd needs to be within ideal distance of and in near linear geometry with asp   from the sln r domain for phosphotransfer to occur the ground state structure presented here suggests that phosphoryl transfer will likely proceed through an associative mechanism involving the formation of a pentacoordinate phosphorus intermediate
