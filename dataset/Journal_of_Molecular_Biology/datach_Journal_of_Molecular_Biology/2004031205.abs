protein  dna hydrophobic recognition in the minor groove is facilitated by sugar switching
information readout in the dna minor groove is accompanied by substantial dna deformations such as sugar switching between the two conformational domains b like c   endo and a like c   endo the effect of sugar puckering on the sequence dependent protein  dna interactions has not been studied systematically however here we analyzed the structural role of a like nucleotides in   protein  dna complexes solved by x ray crystallography and nmr to this end a new algorithm was developed to distinguish interactions in the minor groove from those in the major groove and to calculate the solvent accessible surface areas in each groove separately based on this approach we found a striking difference between the sets of amino acids interacting with b like and a like nucleotides in the minor groove polar amino acids mostly interact with b nucleotides while hydrophobic amino acids interact extensively with a nucleotides a hydrophobicity  structure correlation  this tendency is consistent with the larger exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the case of a like sugars overall the a like nucleotides aid in achieving protein induced fit in two major ways first hydrophobic clusters formed by several consecutive a like sugars interact cooperatively with the non polar surfaces in proteins second the sugar switching occurs in large kinks promoted by direct protein contact predominantly at the pyrimidine  purine dimeric steps the sequence preference for the b to a sugar repuckering observed for pyrimidines suggests that the described dna deformations contribute to specificity of the protein  dna recognition in the minor groove
