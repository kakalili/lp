structure of the wilms tumor suppressor protein zinc finger domain bound to dna
the zinc finger domain of the wilms tumor suppressor protein wt  contains four canonical cys his zinc fingers wt binds preferentially to dna sequences that are closely related to the egr  consensus site we report the structure determination by both x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy of the wt zinc finger domain in complex with dna the x ray structure was determined for the complex with a cognate  base pair oligonucleotide and composite x ray nmr structures were determined for complexes with both the  base pair and an extended  base pair dna this combined approach allowed unambiguous determination of the position of the first zinc finger which is influenced by lattice contacts in the crystal structure the crystal structure shows the second third and fourth zinc finger domains inserted deep into the major groove of the dna where they make base specific interactions the dna duplex is distorted in the vicinity of the first zinc finger with a cytidine twisted and tilted out of the base stack to pack against finger  and the tip of finger  by contrast the composite x ray nmr structures show that finger  continues to follow the major groove in the solution complexes however the orientation of the helix is non canonical and the fingertip and the n terminus of the helix project out of the major groove as a consequence the zinc finger side chains that are commonly involved in base recognition make no contact with the dna we conclude that finger  helps to anchor wt to the dna by amplifying the binding affinity although it does not contribute significantly to binding specificity the structures provide molecular level insights into the potential consequences of mutations in zinc fingers  and  that are associated with denys drash syndrome and nephritic syndrome the mutations are of two types and either destabilize the zinc finger structure or replace key base contact residues
