assembly states of flim and flig within the flagellar switch complex
at the base of the bacterial flagella a cytoplasmic rotor the c ring generates torque and reverses rotation sense in response to stimuli the bulk of the c ring forms from many copies of the proteins flig flim and flin which together constitute the switch complex to help resolve outstanding issues regarding c ring architecture we have investigated interactions between flim and flig from thermotoga maritima with x ray crystallography and pulsed dipolar esr spectroscopy pds  a new crystal structure of an  unit flig flim complex produces a large arc with a curvature consistent with the dimensions of the c ring previously determined structures along with this new structure provided a basis to test switch complex assembly models pds combined with mutational studies and targeted cross linking reveal that flim and flig interact through their middle domains to form both parallel and antiparallel arrangements in solution residue substitutions at predicted interfaces disrupt higher order complexes that are primarily mediated by contacts between the c terminal domain of flig and the middle domain of a neighboring flig molecule spin separations among multi labeled components fit a self consistent model that agree well with electron microscopy images of the c ring an activated form of the response regulator chey destabilizes the parallel arrangement of flim molecules to perturb flig alignment in a process that may reflect the onset of rotation switching these data suggest a model of c ring assembly in which intermolecular contacts among flig domains provide a template for flim assembly and cooperative transitions
