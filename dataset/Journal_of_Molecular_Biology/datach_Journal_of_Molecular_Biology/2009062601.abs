microscopic factors that control  sheet registry in amyloid fibrils formed by fragment     of amyloid  peptide insights from computer simulations
short fragments of amyloidogenic proteins are widely used as model systems in studies of amyloid formation fragment     of the amyloid  protein involved in alzheimer s disease a      was recently shown to form amyloid fibrils composed of anti parallel  sheets interestingly fibrils grown under neutral and acidic conditions were seen to possess different registries of their inter  strand hydrogen bonds in an effort to explain the microscopic origin of this ph dependence we studied a     fibrils using methods of theoretical modeling several structural models were built for fibrils at low and neutral ph levels and these were examined in short molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water the models that displayed the lowest free energy as estimated using an implicit solvent model were selected as representative of the true fibrillar structure it was shown that the registry of these models agrees well with the experimental results at neutral ph the main contribution to the free energy difference between the two registries comes from the electrostatic interactions the charge group of the carboxy terminus makes a large contribution to these interactions and thus appears to have a critical role in determining the registry
