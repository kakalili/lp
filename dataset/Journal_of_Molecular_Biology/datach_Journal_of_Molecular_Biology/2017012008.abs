structures of the karyopherins kap  p and kap p bound to the nuclear pore targeting domain of the sumo protease ulp p
the budding yeast small ubiquitin like modifier sumo protease ulp p catalyzes both the processing of newly synthesized sumo to its mature form and the deconjugation of sumo from target proteins thereby regulating a wide range of cellular processes including cell division dna repair dna replication transcription and mrna quality control ulp p is localized primarily at the nuclear pore complex npc through interactions involving the karyopherins kap  p and kap p  kap p heterodimer and a subset of nuclear pore associated proteins the sequestration of ulp p at the nuclear periphery is crucial for the proper control of protein desumoylation to gain insights into the role of the karyopherins in regulating the localization of ulp p we have determined the crystal structures of kap  p and kap p bound to the n terminal non catalytic domain of ulp p that is necessary and sufficient for npc targeting contrary to a previous proposal that ulp p is tethered to the transport channel of the npc through unconventional interactions with the karyopherins our structures reveal that ulp p has canonical nuclear localization signals nlss    an isoleucine lysine nls residues     that binds to the nls binding site of kap  p and   a classical bipartite nls residues      that binds to the major and minor nls binding sites of kap p ulp p also binds kap p directly and the ulp p  kap p binding is enhanced by the importin  binding domain of kap p gtp bound gsp p the yeast ran ortholog and the exportin cse p cooperate to release ulp p from the karyopherins indicating that the stable sequestration of ulp p to the npc would require a karyopherin independent mechanism to anchor ulp p at the npc
