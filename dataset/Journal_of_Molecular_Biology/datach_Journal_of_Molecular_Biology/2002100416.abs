synuclein especially the parkinson s disease associated mutants forms pore like annular and tubular protofibrils
two mutations in the  synuclein gene a p and a t have been linked to autosomal dominant early onset parkinson s disease pd  both mutations promote the formation of transient protofibrils prefibrillar oligomers  suggesting that protofibrils are linked to cytotoxicity in this work the effect of these mutations on the structure of  synuclein oligomers was investigated using electron microscopy and digital image processing the pd linked mutations a p and a t were observed to affect both the morphology and the size distribution of  synuclein protofibrils measured by analytical ultracentrifugation and scanning transmission electron microscopy  the a p variant was observed to promote the formation of annular pore like protofibrils whereas a t promotes formation of annular and tubular protofibrillar structures wild type  synuclein also formed annular protofibrils but only after extended incubation the formation of pore like oligomeric structures may explain the membrane permeabilization activity of  synuclein protofibrils these structures may contribute to the pathogenesis of pd
