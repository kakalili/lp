coronavirus n protein n terminal domain ntd specifically binds the transcriptional regulatory sequence trs and melts trs ctrs rna duplexes
all coronaviruses covs  including the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  encode a nucleocapsid n protein that harbors two independent rna binding domains of known structure but poorly characterized rna binding properties we show here that the n terminal domain ntd of n protein from mouse hepatitis virus mhv  a virus most closely related to sars cov employs aromatic amino acid nucleobase stacking interactions with a triple adenosine motif to mediate high affinity binding to single stranded rnas containing the transcriptional regulatory sequence trs or its complement ctrs  stoichiometric ntd fully unwinds a trs ctrs duplex that mimics a transiently formed transcription intermediate in viral subgenomic rna synthesis mutation of the solvent exposed y   positioned on the  platform surface of our     structure binds the trs far less tightly and is severely crippled in its rna unwinding activity in contrast the c terminal domain ctd exhibits no rna unwinding activity viruses harboring y  a n mutation are strongly selected against and y  a n does not support an accessory function in mhv replication we propose that the helix melting activity of the coronavirus n protein ntd plays a critical accessory role in subgenomic rna synthesis and other processes requiring rna remodeling
