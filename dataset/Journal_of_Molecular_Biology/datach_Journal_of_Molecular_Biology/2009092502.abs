functional study of the p t itpa variant associated with drug sensitivity in humans
sanitization of the cellular nucleotide pools from mutagenic base analogues is necessary for the accuracy of transcription and replication of genetic material and plays a substantial role in cancer prevention the undesirable mutagenic recombinogenic and toxic incorporation of purine base analogues i e  itp ditp xtp dxtp or  hydroxylaminopurine hap deoxynucleoside triphosphate into nucleic acids is prevented by inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase itpa  the itpa gene is a highly conserved moderately expressed gene defects in itpa orthologs in model organisms cause severe sensitivity to hap and chromosome fragmentation a human polymorphic allele  c  a encodes for the enzyme with a p t amino acid change and leads to accumulation of non hydrolyzed itp itpase activity is not detected in erythrocytes of these patients the p t polymorphism has also been associated with adverse sensitivity to purine base analogue drugs we have found that the itpa p t mutant is a dimer in solution as is wild type itpa and has normal itpa activity in vitro but the melting point of itpa p t is   c lower than that of wild type itpa p t is also fully functional in vivo in model organisms as determined by a hap mutagenesis assay and its complementation of a bacterial itpa defect the amount of itpa protein detected by western blot is severely diminished in a human fibroblast cell line with the  c  a change we propose that the p t mutation exerts its effect in certain human tissues by cumulative effects of destabilization of transcripts protein stability and availability
