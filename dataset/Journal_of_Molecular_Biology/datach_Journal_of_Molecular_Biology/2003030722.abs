comparative promoter analysis and its application in analysis of pth regulated gene expression
taking advantage of the  working draft  of the human genome and the mit shotgun assembly of the mouse genome we performed a comparative promoter analysis of human refseq mrna sequences from genbank s refseq database  by combining this analysis with a transcription factor tf binding site analysis using a transfac position weight matrix pwm search   of non specific tf sites were removed using a set of genes that are regulated by parathyroid hormone pth  a statistical analysis was performed on the conserved tf binding sites among a set of eight human and mouse genes from among the eight genes tested we obtained a set of  tfs suggesting possible roles for associated genes in pth mediated pathways all three known pth responsive tfs ap  runx  creb were correctly predicted by this analysis as well as two other potential tfs vdr and cebpdelta  additionally a model was made to describe the tf site characteristic module of pth regulated genes this model was then used to search all human refseq gene promoters with established human  mouse ortholog relationships to identify other pth regulated genes this comparative approach combined with statistical analysis proved to be sufficiently specific to decipher critical tfs involved in pth regulated pathways
