crystal structure of the  s ribosomal subunit from thermus thermophilus structure of the proteins and their interactions with  s rna edited by r huber
we present a detailed analysis of the protein structures in the  s ribosomal subunit from thermus thermophilus and their interactions with  s rna based on a crystal structure at     resolution with  different polypeptide chains the  s subunit adds significantly to our data base of rna structure and protein rna interactions in addition to globular domains many of the proteins have long extended regions either in the termini or in internal loops which make extensive contact to the rna component and are involved in stabilizing rna tertiary structure many ribosomal proteins share similar    sandwich folds but we show that the topology of this domain varies considerably as do the ways in which the proteins interact with rna analysis of the protein rna interactions in the context of ribosomal assembly shows that the primary binders are globular proteins that bind at rna multihelix junctions whereas proteins with long extensions assemble later we attempt to correlate the structure with a large body of biochemical and genetic data on the  s subunit
