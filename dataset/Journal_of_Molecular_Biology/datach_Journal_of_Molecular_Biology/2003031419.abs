nmr structure of the hiv  regulatory protein vpr
the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  genome encodes a highly conserved regulatory gene product vpr   residues  kda  which is incorporated into virions in the infected cells vpr expressed late in the virus cycle is believed to function in the early phases of hiv  replication such as nuclear migration of pre integration complex transcription of the proviral genome viral multiplication by blocking cells in g phase and regulation of apoptosis phenomenon vpr has a critical role in long term aids disease by inducing infection in non dividing cells such as monocytes and macrophages to gain insight into the structure  function relationships of vpr the     vpr protein was synthesized with  labeled amino acids its d structure was analyzed in the presence of cd cn and in pure water at low ph and refined by restrained simulated annealing the structure of the protein is characterized by three well defined  helices          and     surrounded by flexible n and c terminal domains in contrast to the structure obtained in the presence of tfe the three  helices are folded around a hydrophobic core constituted of leu ile val and aromatic residues as illustrated by numerous long range noes this structure accounts for the interaction of vpr with different targets
