visualization of the eef   s ribosome transition state complex by cryo electron microscopy
in an attempt to understand ribosome induced gtp hydrolysis on eef  we determined a     cryo electron microscopy reconstruction of the eef bound  s ribosome in the presence of aluminum tetrafluoride and gdp with aluminum tetrafluoride mimicking the  phosphate during hydrolysis this is the first visualization of a structure representing a transition state complex on the ribosome tight interactions are observed between the factor s g domain and the large ribosomal subunit as well as between domain iv and an intersubunit bridge in contrast some of the domains of eef implicated in small subunit binding display a large degree of flexibility furthermore we find support for a transition state model conformation of the switch i region in this complex where the reoriented switch i region interacts with a conserved rrna region of the  s subunit formed by loops of the  s rna helices  and   this complex is structurally distinct from the eef bound  s ribosome complexes previously reported and analysis of this map sheds light on the gtpase coupled translocation mechanism
