genetic insertions and diversification of the polb type dna polymerase gp  of t related phages
in escherichia coli phage t and many of its phylogenetic relatives gene  consists of a single cistron that encodes a polb family polb type dna polymerase we describe the divergence of this phage gene and its protein product gp   gene product   among  phylogenetic relatives of t and discuss our observations in the context of diversity among the widely distributed polb enzymes in nature in two t relatives that grow in aeromonas salmonicida phages  rr and   gene  is fragmented by different combinations of three distinct types of dna insertion elements  a a short intercistronic untranslated sequence ic uts that splits the polymerase gene into two cistrons  a and  b corresponding to n terminal gp a and c terminal gp b protein products  b a freestanding homing endonuclease gene heg inserted between the ic uts and the  b cistron and c a group i intron in the  b cistron phage  has all three elements whereas phage  rr has only the ic uts we present evidence that a the split gene of phage  rr encodes a split dna polymerase consisting of a complex between gp a and gp b subunits  b the putative heg encodes a double stranded dna endonuclease that specifically cleaves intron free homologues of the intron bearing  b site and c the group i intron is a self splicing rna our results suggest that some freestanding hegs can mediate the homing of introns that do not encode their own homing enzymes the results also suggest that different insertion elements can converge on a polb gene and evolve into a single integrated system for lateral transfer of polb genetic material we discuss the possible pathways for the importation of such insertion elements into the genomes of t related phages
