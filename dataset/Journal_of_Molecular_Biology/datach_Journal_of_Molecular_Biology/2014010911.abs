the cytoplasmic domain of the t cell receptor zeta subunit does not form disordered dimers
intrinsically disordered regions in proteins play active roles in recognition signaling and molecular sorting they often undergo coupled folding and binding giving rise to largely ordered interfaces with their binding partners the cytoplasmic region of the t cell receptor zeta subunit  cyt has been previously proposed to specifically dimerize in the absence of a disorder to order transition suggesting an intriguing dimerization mechanism that may involve multiple transient interfaces we show here using analytical ultracentrifugation nmr size exclusion chromatography sec and multi angle light scattering that neither  cyt nor the cytoplasmic region of cd  significantly populates a dimeric state but that they are mostly monomers in solution up to millimolar concentrations they experience a salt and concentration dependent shift of their elution volume in sec previously interpreted as dimerization our data show that  cyt does not form a highly disordered protein complex and leaves open the question as to whether completely disordered dimers or other oligomers exist in nature
