the escherichia coli multidrug transporter emre is a dimer in the detergent solubilised state
emre is a multidrug transporter that utilises the proton gradient across bacterial cell membranes to pump hydrophobic cationic toxins out of the cell the structure of emre is very unusual because it is an asymmetric homodimer containing eight  helices six of which form the substrate binding chamber and translocation pathway despite this structural information the precise oligomeric order of emre in both the detergent solubilised state and in vivo is unclear although it must contain an even number of subunits to satisfy substrate binding data we have studied the oligomeric state of emre purified in a functional form in dodecylmaltoside by high resolution size exclusion chromatography hrsec and by analytical ultracentrifugation the data from equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation were analysed using a measured density increment for the emre  lipid  detergent complex which showed that the purified emre was predominantly a dimer this value was consistent with the apparent mass for the emre  lipid  detergent complex   kda determined by hrsec emre was purified under different conditions using minimal concentrations of dodecylmaltoside which would have maintained the structure of any putative higher oligomeric states this emre preparation had an apparent mass of   kda by hrsec and equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation showed unequivocally that emre was a dimer although it was associated with a much larger mass of phospholipid in addition the effect of the substrate tetraphenylphosphonium on the oligomeric state was also analysed for both preparations of emre velocity analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the substrate had no effect on the oligomeric state therefore in the detergent dodecylmaltoside and under conditions where the protein is fully competent for substrate binding emre is dimeric and there is no evidence from our data to suggest higher oligomeric states these observations are discussed in relation to the recently published structures of emre from two and three dimensional crystals
