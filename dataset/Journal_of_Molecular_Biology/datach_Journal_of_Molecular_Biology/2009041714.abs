multiple defects in the respiratory chain lead to the repression of genes encoding components of the respiratory chain and tca cycle enzymes
respiratory complexes iii iv and v are formed by components of both nuclear and mitochondrial origin and are embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane their assembly requires the auxiliary factor oxa  and the absence of this protein has severe consequences on these three major respiratory chain enzymes we have studied in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the effect of the loss of oxa function and of other respiratory defects on the expression of nuclear genes encoding components of the respiratory complexes and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes we observed that the concomitant decrease in the level of two respiratory enzymes complexes iii and iv led to their repression these genes are known targets of the transcriptional activator complex hap    that plays a central role in the reprogramming of yeast metabolism when cells switch from a fermenting glucose repressed state to a respiring derepressed state we found that the hap protein the regulatory subunit of the transcriptional complex was present at a lower level in the oxa mutants whereas no change in hap transcript level was observed suggesting a posttranscriptional modulation in addition an altered mitochondrial morphology was observed in mutants with decreased expression of hap    target genes we suggest that the aberrant mitochondrial morphology presumably caused by the severely decreased level of at least two respiratory enzymes might be part of the signalling pathway linking the mitochondrial defect and hap
