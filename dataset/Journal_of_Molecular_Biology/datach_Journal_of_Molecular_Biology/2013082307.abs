metal dependent activity of fe and ni acireductone dioxygenases how two electrons reroute the catalytic pathway
two virtually identical acireductone dioxygenases ard and ard   catalyze completely different oxidation reactions of the same substrate   dihydroxy  keto  methylthio pentene depending exclusively on the nature of the bound metal fe  dependent ard  produces the  keto acid precursor of methionine and formate and allows for the recycling of methionine in cells ni  dependent ard instead produces methylthiopropionate co and formate and exits the methionine salvage cycle this mechanistic difference has not been understood to date but has been speculated to be due to the difference in coordination of the substrate to fe  versus ni  forming a five membered ring versus a six membered ring respectively thus exposing different carbon atoms for the attack by o  here using mixed quantum classical molecular dynamics simulations followed by the density functional theory mechanistic investigation we show that contrary to the old hypothesis both metals preferentially bind the substrate as a six membered ring exposing the exact same sites to the attack by o  it is the electronic properties of the metals that are then responsible for the system following different reaction paths to yield the respective products we fully explain the puzzling metal induced difference in functionality between ard and ard  and in particular propose a new mechanism for ard   all results are in agreement with available isotopic substitution and other experimental data
