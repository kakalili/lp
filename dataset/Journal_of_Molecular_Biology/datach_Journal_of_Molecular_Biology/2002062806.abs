structural and functional studies of an intermediate on the pathway to operator binding by escherichia coli metj
we present the results of in vitro dna binding assays for a mutant protein q k of the e coli methionine repressor metj as well as the crystal structure at    resolution of the apo mutant bound to a  mer oligonucleotide encompassing an bp met box sequence the wild type protein binds natural operators co operatively with respect to protein concentration forming at least a dimer of repressor dimers along operator dnas the minimum operator length is thus  bp each metj dimer interacting with a single met box site in contrast the q k mutant protein can also bind stably as a single dimer to bp target sites in part due to additional contacts made to the phosphodiester backbone outside the bp target via the k  side chains protein  protein co operativity in the mutant is reduced relative to the wild type allowing the properties of an intermediate on the pathway to operator site saturation to be examined for the first time the crystal structure of the decamer complex shows a unique conformation for the protein bound to the single met box site possibly explaining the reduced protein  protein co operativity in both the extended and minimal dna complexes formed the mutant protein makes slightly different contacts to the edges of dna base pairs than the wild type even though the site of amino acid substitution is distal from the dna binding motif quantitative binding assays suggest that this is not due to artefacts caused by the crystallisation conditions but is most likely due to the relatively small contribution of such direct contacts to the overall binding energy of dna  protein complex formation which is dominated by sequence dependent distortions of the dna duplex and by the protein  protein contact between dimers
