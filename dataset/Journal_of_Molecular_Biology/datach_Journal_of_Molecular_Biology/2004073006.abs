structural analyses of peptide release factor  from thermotoga maritima reveal domain flexibility required for its interaction with the ribosome
we have determined the crystal structure of peptide chain release factor  rf  from thermotoga maritima gi     at    resolution by selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion sad techniques rf is a protein that recognizes stop codons and promotes the release of a nascent polypeptide from trna on the ribosome selenomethionine labeled rf crystallized in space group p  with three monomers per asymmetric unit it has approximate dimensions of         and is composed of four domains the overall fold of each rf domain shows almost the same topology with escherichia coli rf  except that the rf n terminal domain is shorter and the c terminal domain is longer than that of rf  the n terminal domain of rf indicates a rigid body movement relative to that of rf with an angle of     including these features rf has a tripeptide anticodon pvt motif instead of the spf motif of rf  which confers the specificity towards the stop codons the analyses of three molecules in the asymmetric unit and comparison with rf revealed the presence of dynamic movement of domains i and iii which are anchored to the central domain by hinge loops the crystal structure of rf elucidates the intrinsic property of this family of having large domain movements for proper function with the ribosome
