a homology model of hiv  integrase and analysis of mutations designed to test the model
although there are structures of the different domains of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  integrase in  there is no structure of the entire protein the recently determined crystal structures of the prototype foamy virus pfv in tetramer in complexes with viral dna led to the generation of models of full length hiv  in these models were generated in part by superimposing the structures of the domains of hiv  in onto the structure of full length pfv in we developed a model for hiv  in  based solely on its sequence alignment with pfv in  that differs in several ways from the previous models specifically in our model the junction between the catalytic core domain and c terminal domain adopts a helix  loop  helix motif that is similar to the corresponding segment of pfv in and differs from the crystal structures of these two hiv  in domains the alignment of residues in the c terminal domain also differs from the previous models our model can be used to explain the phenotype of previously published hiv  in mutants we made additional mutants and the behavior of these new mutants provides additional support for the model
