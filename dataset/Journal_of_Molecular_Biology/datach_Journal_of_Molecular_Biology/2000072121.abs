the structure of reduced tryparedoxin peroxidase reveals a decamer and insight into reactivity of cys peroxiredoxins
tryparedoxin peroxidase tryp is a recently discovered cys peroxiredoxin involved in defence against oxidative stress in parasitic trypanosomatids the crystal structure of recombinant crithidiafasciculata tryp in the reduced state has been determined using multi wavelength anomalous dispersion methods applied to a selenomethionyl derivative the model comprises a decamer with  symmetry ten chloride ions with  water molecules and has been refined using data to    resolution     nm  to an r factor and rfree of   and    respectively secondary structure topology places tryp along with tryparedoxin and glutathione peroxidase in a distinct subgroup of the thioredoxin super family the molecular details at the active site support ideas about the enzyme mechanism and comparisons with an oxidised cys peroxiredoxin reveal structural alterations induced by the change in oxidation state these include a difference in quaternary structure from dimer oxidised form to decamer reduced form  the cys peroxiredoxin assembly may prevent indiscriminate oligomerisation localise ten peroxidase active sites and contribute to both the specificity of reduction by the redox partner tryparedoxin and attraction of peroxides into the active site
