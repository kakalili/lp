cc d a is a regulator of escrt iii chmp b
endosomal sorting complexes required for transport escrts regulate diverse processes ranging from receptor sorting at endosomes to distinct steps in cell division and budding of some enveloped viruses common to all processes is the membrane recruitment of escrt iii that leads to membrane fission here we show that cc d a is a novel regulator of escrt iii chmp b function we demonstrate that chmp b interacts directly with cc d a and cc d b with nanomolar affinity by forming a   complex deletion mapping revealed a minimal cc d a  chmp b binding construct which includes a short linear sequence within the third dm  domain of cc d a the cc d a binding site on chmp b was mapped to the n terminal helical hairpin based on a crystal structure of the chmp b helical hairpin two surface patches were identified that interfere with cc d a interaction as determined by surface plasmon resonance introducing these mutations into a c terminal truncation of chmp b that exerts a potent dominant negative effect on human immunodeficiency virus type  budding revealed that one of the mutants lost this effect completely this suggests that the identified cc d a binding surface might be required for chmp b polymerization which is consistent with the finding that cc d a binding to chmp b prevents chmp b polymerization in vitro thus cc d a might act as a negative regulator of chmp b function
