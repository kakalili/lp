role of conserved nucleotides in building the  s rrna binding site for ribosomal protein s  edited by j karn
ribosomal protein s  recognizes a highly conserved target on  s rrna which consists of two distinct binding regions here we used extensive site directed mutagenesis on a escherichia coli  s rrna fragment containing the s  binding site to investigate the role of conserved nucleotides in protein recognition and to evaluate the relative contribution of the two sites the effect of mutations on s  recognition was studied by measuring the relative binding affinity rna probing and footprinting the crystallographic structure of the thermus thermophilus complex allowed molecular modelling of the e coli complex and facilitated interpretation of biochemical data binding is essentially driven by site  which includes a three way junction constrained by a conserved base triple and cross strand stacking recognition is based mainly on shape complementarity and the role of conserved nucleotides is to maintain a unique backbone geometry the wild type base triple is absolutely required for protein interaction while changes in the conserved surrounding nucleotides are partially tolerated site  which provides functional groups in a conserved g u g c motif contributes only modestly to the stability of the interaction binding to this motif is dependent on binding at site  and is allowed only if the two sites are in the correct relative orientation non conserved bulged nucleotides as well as a conserved purine interior loop although not directly involved in recognition are used to provide an appropriate flexibility between the two sites in addition correct binding at the two sites triggers conformational adjustments in the purine interior loop and in a distal region which are known to be involved for subsequent binding of proteins s and s  thus the role of site  is to anchor s  to the rrna while binding at site  is aimed to induce a cascade of events required for subunit assembly
