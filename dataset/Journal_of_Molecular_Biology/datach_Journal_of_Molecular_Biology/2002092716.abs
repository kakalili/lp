kinetics of site  site interactions in supercoiled dna with bent sequences
a curved dna segment is known to adopt a preferred end loop localization in superhelical sc dna and thus may organize the overall conformation of the molecule through this process it influences the probability of site juxtaposition we addressed the effect of a curvature on site  site interactions quantitatively by measuring the kinetics of cross linking of two biotinylated positions in scdna by streptavidin the dna was biotinylated at either symmetric or asymmetric positions with respect to a curved insert via triplex forming oligonucleotides tfos modified with biotin we used a quench flow device to mix the dna with the protein and scanning force microscopy to quantify the reaction products as a measure of the interaction probability rate constants of cross linking and local concentrations jm of one biotinylated site in the vicinity of the other were determined and compared to monte carlo simulations for corresponding dnas in good agreement with the simulations a jm value of    m between two sites  bp apart was measured for an scdna without curvature when a curvature was centered between the sites the interaction probability increased about twofold over the dna without curvature significantly less than expected from the simulations however the relative differences of the interaction probabilities due to varied biotin positions with respect to the curvature agreed quantitatively with the theory
