crystal structure of the tetr camr family repressor mycobacterium tuberculosis ethr implicated in ethionamide resistance
ethionamide has been used for more than  years as a second line chemotherapeutic to treat tuberculosis patients who have developed resistance to first line drugs such as isoniazid inh and rifampicin activation of the pro drug ethionamide is regulated by the baeyer  villiger monooxygenase etha and the tetr camr family repressor ethr whose open reading frames are separated by  bp on the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome ethr has been shown to repress transcription of the activator gene etha by binding to this intergenic region thus contributing to ethionamide resistance we have determined the crystal structure of ethr to    resolution revealing a dimeric two domain molecule with an overall architecture typical for tetr camr repressor proteins a   long hydrophobic tunnel like cavity in the  drug binding  domain of ethr is occupied by two   dioxane molecules a component of the crystallisation buffer comparing the present structure to those of the homologues staphylococcus aureus qacr and escherichia coli tetr leads to the hypothesis that the hydrophobic cavity constitutes a binding site for an as yet unknown ligand that might regulate dna binding of ethr
