coordinated transcriptional regulation of hspa a gene by multiple transcription factors crucial roles for hsf  nf y nf  b and creb
although the transcript level of inducible heat shock protein    hsp   also known as hspa a is altered in various disease states its transcriptional regulation remains incompletely understood here we systematically analyzed the hspa a promoter to identify major cis elements and transcription factors that may govern the constitutive inducible gene expression computational analyses coupled with extensive in vitro promoter  reporter activity and electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed interaction of several transcription factors with hspa a promoter motifs hsf  heat shock factor  at       bp and       bp nf y nuclear transcription factor y at      bp nf  b nuclear factor kappa b at       bp and creb camp response element binding protein at       bp consistently sirna small interfering rna mediated down regulation of each of these transcription factors caused substantial reduction of endogenous hspa a expression heat shock induced activation of hspa a was coordinately regulated by hsf  and nf y nf  b the hspa a expression was augmented by tnf   tumor necrosis factor alpha and forskolin in nf  b and creb dependent manners respectively nf  b and creb also activated hspa a transcription in cardiac myoblasts upon exposure to ischemia like conditions taken together this study discovered previously unknown roles for nf  b and creb to regulate hspa a expression and a coordinated action by several transcription factors for hspa a transactivation under heat shock ischemia like conditions and thereby provided new insights into the mechanism of hspa a regulation
