the funnel approach to the precrystallization production of membrane proteins
challenges in the production of integral membrane proteins for structural studies include low expression levels incorrect membrane insertion aggregation and instability in this report we describe a  funnel approach  to overcoming these difficulties and demonstrate its efficacy in a case study of  prokaryotic p type transporters a diverse ensemble of modified constructs is generated and tested for expression in escherichia coli membrane localization detergent extraction and homogeneity high throughput methodologies are implemented throughout the process to facilitate identification of promising targets we find that the choice of promoter the choice of source organism providing the cloned gene and most importantly the position of the affinity tag have a great effect on successful production the latter had pronounced effects at all tested levels from expression levels observed in whole cells to the extent of membrane insertion and even on protein function following the initial streamlined screening we were able to fine tune and produce  of the  targets as materials suitable for crystallization or other structural studies
