sequence based prediction of protein solubility
in order to investigate the relationship between the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein aggregation we compared the solubility of proteins with their aggregation rates we found a significant correlation between these two quantities by considering a database of protein solubility values measured using an in vitro reconstituted translation system containing about   of escherichia coli proteins the existence of such correlation suggests that the thermodynamic stability of the native states of proteins relative to the aggregate states is closely linked with the kinetic barriers that separate them in order to create the possibility of conducting computational studies at the proteome level to investigate further this concept we developed a method of predicting the solubility of proteins based on their physicochemical properties
