conservation helps to identify biologically relevant crystal contacts edited by f cohen
some crystal contacts are biologically relevant most are not we assess the utility of combining measures of size and conservation to discriminate between biological and non biological contacts conservation and size information is calculated for crystal contacts in  families of homodimers and  families of monomers biological contacts are shown to be usually conserved and typically the largest contact in the crystal a range of neural networks accepting different combinations and encodings of this information is used to answer the following questions   is a given crystal contact biological and   given all crystal contacts in a homodimer which is the biological one predictions for   are performed on both homodimer and monomer datasets the best performing neural network combined size and conservation inputs for the homodimers it correctly classified  out of  biological contacts and   out of   non biological contacts giving a combined accuracy of     a more robust performance statistic the phi coefficient which accounts for imbalances in the dataset gave a value of    taking all   non biological contacts from the  monomers this predictor made erroneous classifications only    of the time predictions for   were performed on homodimers only the best performing network achieved a prediction accuracy of    using size information alone we conclude that in answering question   size and conservation combined discriminate biological from non biological contacts better than either measure alone for answering question   we conclude that in our dataset size is so powerful a discriminant that conservation adds little predictive benefit
