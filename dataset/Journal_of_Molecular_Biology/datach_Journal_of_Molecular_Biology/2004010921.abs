the herpes simplex virus processivity factor ul  binds dna as a monomer
the processivity subunit of the herpes simplex virus dna polymerase ul  is a monomer in solution however ul  is structurally similar to sliding clamp processivity factors such as pcna which encircle dna as a multimeric ring we used chemical crosslinking and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to investigate whether ul  oligomerizes upon dna binding ul  did not form intermolecular crosslinks upon treatment with glutaraldehyde in the presence of dna whereas proteins that are known to be multimers in solution were successfully crosslinked by this treatment this result suggests that ul  does not form multimers on dna we next analyzed the composition of ul  dna complexes using electrophoretic mobility shift assays ul  was mixed with a maltose binding protein  ul  fusion protein before being added to dna the patterns of electrophoretic mobility of the resultant protein dna complexes were those predicted if each isoform of ul  binds to dna as a monomer from this result and the failure of ul  to form crosslinks we infer that ul  binds dna as a monomer
