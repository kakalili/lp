the supramolecular organization of the c elegans nuclear lamin filament
nuclear lamins are involved in most nuclear activities and are essential for retaining the mechano elastic properties of the nucleus they are nuclear intermediate filament if proteins forming a distinct meshwork like layer adhering to the inner nuclear membrane called the nuclear lamina here we present for the first time the three dimensional supramolecular organization of lamin   nm filaments and paracrystalline fibres we show that caenorhabditis elegans nuclear lamin forms   nm if like filaments which are distinct from their cytoplasmic counterparts the if like lamin filaments are composed of three and four tetrameric protofilaments each of which contains two partially staggered anti parallel head to tail polymers the beaded appearance of the lamin filaments stems from paired globular tail domains which are spaced regularly alternating between   nm and   nm a mutation in an evolutionarily conserved residue that causes hutchison gilford progeria syndrome in humans alters the supramolecular structure of the lamin filaments on the basis of our structural analysis we propose an assembly pathway that yields the observed   nm if like lamin filaments and paracrystalline fibres these results serve also as a platform for understanding the effect of laminopathic mutations on lamin supramolecular organization
