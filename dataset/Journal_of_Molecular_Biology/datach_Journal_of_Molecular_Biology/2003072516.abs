a systematic investigation into the effect of protein destabilisation on beta  microglobulin amyloid formation
beta  microglobulin   m has been shown to form amyloid fibrils with distinct morphologies under acidic conditions in vitro short curved fibrils  lt   nm in length  form rapidly without a lag phase with a maximum rate at ph   by contrast fibrils with a long     m  straight morphology are produced by incubation of the protein at ph    both fibril types display congo red birefringence bind thioflavin t and have x ray fibre diffraction patterns consistent with a cross beta structure in order to investigate the role of different partially folded states in generating fibrils of each type and to probe the effect of protein stability on amyloid formation we have undertaken a detailed mutagenesis study of  m thirteen variants containing point mutations in different regions of the native protein were created and their structure stability and fibril forming propensities were investigated as a function of ph by altering the stability of the native protein in this manner we show that whilst destabilisation of the native state is important in the generation of amyloid fibrils population of specific denatured states is a pre requisite for amyloid formation from this protein moreover we demonstrate that the formation of fibrils with different morphologies in vitro correlates with the relative population of different precursor states
