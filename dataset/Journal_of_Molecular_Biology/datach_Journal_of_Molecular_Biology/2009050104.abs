ngstr m structure of a microtubule bound mitotic motor
kinesin  k  motors are important components of the microtubule mt based cell division machinery and are targets for small molecule inhibitors currently in cancer clinical trials however the nature of the k  mt interaction and the regulatory mechanisms that control it remain unclear using cryo electron microscopy and image processing we calculated the structure of a k motor bound to mts at    resolution providing insight into this important interaction our reconstruction reveals the k motor domain in an atp like conformation in which mt binding induces the conserved nucleotide sensing switch i and ii loops to form a compact subdomain around the bound nucleotide our reconstruction also reveals a novel conformation for the k specific drug binding loop  suggesting a possible role for it in switching k s between force generation and diffusional modes of mt binding our data thus shed light on regulation of the interaction between spindle components important for chromosome segregation
