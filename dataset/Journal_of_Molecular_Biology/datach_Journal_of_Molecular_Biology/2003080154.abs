small structural costs for evolution from rna to rnp based catalysis
typical rna based cellular catalysts achieve their active structures only as complexes with protein cofactors implying that protein binding compensates for some structural deficiencies in the rna an unresolved question was the extent to which protein facilitation imposes additional structural costs by requiring that an rna maintain structures required for protein binding beyond those required for catalysis we used nucleotide analog interference to identify initially  functional group substitutions at phosphate    ribose and adenosine base positions that compromise rna self splicing in the bi group i intron protein facilitated splicing by cbp suppresses  of  interfering substitutions at the rna backbone and a greater fraction   of   at the adenosine base including at structures conserved among group i introns only one substitution directly interferes with protein binding but not with self splicing this substitution plus three adenosine base modifications that interfere more strongly in cbp dependent splicing than in self splicing yield a cost for protein facilitation of only four functional groups as approximated by this set of analogs the small observed structural cost provides a strong physical rationale for the evolutionary drive from rna to rnp based function in biology remarkably the four extra requirements do not appear to report disruption of direct protein  rna contacts and instead likely reflect design against misfolding rather than for maintenance of a protein binding site
