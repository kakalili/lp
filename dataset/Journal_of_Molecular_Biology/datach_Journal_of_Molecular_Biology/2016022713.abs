n methyladenosine modification in a long noncoding rna hairpin predisposes its conformation to protein binding
n methyladenosine m a is a reversible and abundant internal modification of messenger rna mrna and long noncoding rna lncrna with roles in rna processing transport and stability although m a does not preclude watson  crick base pairing the n methyl group alters the stability of rna secondary structure since changes in rna structure can affect diverse cellular processes the influence of m a on mrna and lncrna structure has the potential to be an important mechanism for m a function in the cell indeed an m a site in the lncrna metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript  malat  was recently shown to induce a local change in structure that increases the accessibility of a u tract for recognition and binding by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein c hnrnpc  this m a dependent regulation of protein binding through a change in rna structure termed  m a switch   affects transcriptome wide mrna abundance and alternative splicing to further characterize this first example of an m a switch in a cellular rna we used nuclear magnetic resonance and f rster resonance energy transfer to demonstrate the effect of m a on a  nucleotide rna hairpin derived from the m a switch in malat  the observed imino proton nuclear magnetic resonance resonances and f rster resonance energy transfer efficiencies suggest that m a selectively destabilizes the portion of the hairpin stem where the u tract is located increasing the solvent accessibility of the neighboring bases while maintaining the overall hairpin structure the m a modified hairpin has a predisposed conformation that resembles the hairpin conformation in the rna  hnrnpc complex more closely than the unmodified hairpin the m a induced structural changes in the malat hairpin can serve as a model for a large family of m a switches that mediate the influence of m a on cellular processes
