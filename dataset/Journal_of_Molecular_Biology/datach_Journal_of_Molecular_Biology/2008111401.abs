crystal structure of cyp  a  a para substituted benzoic acid oxidizing cytochrome p  from rhodopseudomonas palustris
cyp  a  a cytochrome p  enzyme from rhodopseudomonas palustris oxidatively demethylates  methoxybenzoic acid to  hydroxybenzoic acid  ethylbenzoic acid is converted to a mixture of predominantly   hydroxyethyl benzoic acid and  vinylbenzoic acid the latter being a rare example of cc bond dehydrogenation of an unbranched alkyl group the crystal structure of cyp  a has been determined at    resolution the enzyme has the common p  fold but the b  helix is missing and the g helix is broken into two g and g   by a kink at pro   helices g and g  are bent back from the extended bc loop and the i helix to open up a clearly defined substrate access channel channel openings in this region of the p  fold are rare in bacterial p  enzymes but more common in eukaryotic p  enzymes the channel is hydrophobic except for the basic residue arg  at the entrance which probably plays a role in the specificity of this enzyme for charged benzoates over neutral phenols and benzenes the substrate binding pocket is hydrophobic with ser  and ser  being the only polar residues computer docking of  ethylbenzoic acid into the active site suggests that the substrate carboxylate oxygens interact with ser  and ser   and the  methyl group is located over the heme iron by phe   the side chain of which is only     above the iron in the native structure this binding orientation is consistent with the observed product profile of exclusive attack at the para substituent putidaredoxin of the cyp  a system from pseudomonas putida supports substrate oxidation by cyp  a at    of the activity of the physiological ferredoxin comparison of the heme proximal faces of cyp  a and cyp  a suggests that charge reversal surrounding the surface residue leu  in cyp  a may be a significant factor in this low cross activity
