leishmania mexicana glycerol  phosphate dehydrogenase showed conformational changes upon binding a bi substrate adduct
certain pathogenic trypanosomatids are highly dependent on glycolysis for atp production and hence their glycolytic enzymes including glycerol  phosphate dehydrogenase gpdh  are considered attractive drug targets the ternary complex structure of leishmania mexicana gpdh lmgpdh with dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap and nad was determined to    resolution as a further step towards understanding this enzyme s mode of action when compared with the apo and binary complex structures the ternary complex structure shows an   hinge bending motion of the c terminal domain with respect to the n terminal domain in addition residues in the c terminal domain involved in catalysis or substrates binding show significant movements and a previously invisible five residue loop region becomes well ordered and participates in nad binding unexpectedly dhap and nad appear to form a covalent bond producing an adduct in the active site of lmgpdh modeling a ternary complex glycerol  phosphate g p and nad with lmgpdh identified ten active site residues that are highly conserved among all gpdhs two lysine residues lys  and lys   that are presumed to be critical in catalysis were mutated resulting in greatly reduced catalytic activity comparison with other structurally related enzymes found by the program dali suggested lys  as a key catalytic residue which is located on a structurally conserved  helix from the results of site directed mutagenesis molecular modeling and comparison with related dehydrogenases a catalytic mechanism of lmgpdh and a possible evolutionary scenario of this group of dehydrogenases are proposed
