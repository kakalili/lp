intramolecular dynamics of low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase in monomer  dimer equilibrium studied by nmr a model for changes in dynamics upon target binding
low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase lmw ptp dimerizes in the phosphate bound state in solution with a dissociation constant of kd      mm and an off rate on the order of  s    h and  n nmr chemical shifts identify the dimer interface which is in excellent agreement with that observed in the crystal structure of the dimeric s a mutant two tyrosine residues of each molecule interact with the active site of the other molecule implying that the dimer may be taken as a model for a complex between lmw ptp and a target protein  n relaxation rates for the monomeric and dimeric states were extrapolated from relaxation data acquired at four different protein concentrations relaxation data of satisfactory precision were extracted for the monomer enabling model free analyses of backbone fluctuations on pico to nanosecond time scales the dimer relaxation data are of lower quality due to extrapolation errors and the possible presence of higher order oligomers at higher concentrations a qualitative comparison of order parameters in the monomeric and apparent dimeric states shows that loops forming the dimer interface become rigidified upon dimerization qualitative information on monomer  dimer exchange and intramolecular conformational exchange was obtained from the concentration dependence of auto and cross correlated relaxation rates the loop containing the catalytically important asp  fluctuates between different conformations in both the monomeric and dimeric target bound states the exchange rate compares rather well with that of the catalyzed reaction step supporting existing hypotheses that catalysis and enzyme dynamics may be coupled the side chain of trp  which is important for substrate specificity exhibits conformational dynamics in the monomer that are largely quenched upon formation of the dimer suggesting that binding is associated with the selection of a single side chain conformer
