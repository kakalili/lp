structure and binding determinants of the recombinant kringle  domain of human plasminogen to an internal peptide from a group a streptococcal surface protein edited by r huber
the x ray crystal structure of a complex of a modified recombinant kringle  domain of human plasminogen k pg c g e d l y  mk pg  containing an upregulated lysine binding site bound to a functional  residue internal peptide vek   from an m type protein of a group a streptococcus surface protein has been determined by molecular replacement methods using k pg as a model and refined at    resolution to a r factor of     the x ray crystal structure shows that vek  exists as a nearly end to end  helix in the complex with mk pg the final structure also revealed that arg  and his  of vek  served as cationic loci for asp  and asp  of the consensus lysine binding site of mk pg while glu  of vek  coordinates with arg  of the cationic binding site of mk pg the hydrophobic ligand binding pocket in mk pg consisting primarily of trp  and trp  situated between the positive and negative centers of the lysine binding site is utilized in a novel manner in stabilizing the interaction with vek  by forming a cation  electron mediated association with the positive side chain of arg  of this peptide additional lysine binding sites as well as exosite electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions involving glu and lys  of vek   were observed in the structural model the importance of these interactions were tested in solution by investigating the binding constants of synthetic variants of vek  to mk pg and it was found that lys  arg  his  and glu  of vek  were the most critical amino acid binding determinants with regard to the solution studies circular dichroism analysis of the titration of vek  with mk pg demonstrated that the peptidic  helical structure increased substantially when bound to the kringle module in agreement with the x ray results this investigation is the first to delineate structurally the mode of interaction of the lysine binding site of a kringle with an internal pseudo lysine residue of a peptide or protein that functionally interacts with a kringle module and serves as a paradigm for this important class of interactions
