sv  large t antigen up regulates the retrotransposition frequency of viral like  elements
the regulation of non autonomous retrotransposition is not known a recombinant bearing a hygromycin gene and a viral like   vl  retrotransposon tagged with an enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp gene based retrotransposition cassette was constructed and used for detection of retrotransposition events transfection of this recombinant produced retrotransposition events detected both by egfp fluorescence and pcr analysis in hygromycin selected clones of two established simian virus   sv  transformed mouse nih t cell lines but not in normal nih t cells the retrotransposition potential of this recombinant as a provirus was studied in stably transfected nih t clones transfection of these clones with either a wild type or a mutant le  t sv  large t antigen gene not expressing small t protein induced retrotransposition events at high frequencies as measured by fluorescence activated cell scanning facs  in addition measuring retrotransposition frequencies over a period of nine days following infection with isolated sv  particles revealed that the frequency of retrotransposition was time dependent and induced as early as   h increasing exponentially to high levels  gt    events per cell per generation up to nine days post infection furthermore ectopic expression of a cloned momlv reverse transcriptase gene also produced retrotransposition events and suggested that the large t antigen most likely acted through induction of expression of endogenous reverse transcriptase genes our results show a direct correlation between sv  cell transformation and vl  retrotransposition and provide for the first time strong evidence that sv  large t antigen up regulates the retrotransposition of vl  elements
