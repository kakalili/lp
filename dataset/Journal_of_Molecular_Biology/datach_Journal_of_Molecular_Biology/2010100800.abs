further insight into substrate recognition by usp  structural and biochemical analysis of the hdmx and hdm interactions with usp
ubiquitin specific protease  usp  catalyzes the deubiquitination of several substrate proteins including p  and hdm  we have previously shown that usp  and more specifically its amino terminal domain usp  ntd  interacts with distinct regions on p  and hdm containing p axxs motifs the ability of usp to also deubiquitinate and control the turnover of hdmx was recently demonstrated we utilized a combination of biochemistry and structural biology to identify which domain of usp interacts with hdmx as well as to identify regions of hdmx that interact with usp  we showed that usp  ntd recognized two of six p axxs motifs of hdmx  aqcs  and  ahss   the crystal structure of the usp  ntd hdmxahss complex was determined providing the molecular basis of complex formation between usp  ntd and the hdmxahss peptide the hdmx peptide interacted within the same residues of usp  ntd as previously demonstrated with p  hdm  and ebna peptides we also identified an additional site on hdm   psts   that interacts with usp  ntd and determined the crystal structure of this complex finally analysis of usp interacting peptides on filter arrays confirmed the importance of the serine residue at the fourth position for the usp  ntd interaction and showed that phosphorylation of serines within the binding sequence prevents this interaction these results lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of substrate recognition by usp  ntd
