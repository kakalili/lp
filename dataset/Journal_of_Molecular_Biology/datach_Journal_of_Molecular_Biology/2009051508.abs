interaction of the i b  c terminal pest sequence with nf  b insights into the inhibition of nf  b dna binding by i b
the transcription factor nf  b p  p  binds either a  b dna element or its inhibitor protein i b  but these two binding events are mutually exclusive the reason for this exclusivity is not obvious from the available crystal structure data the c terminal pest like sequence of i b  appears to be involved in the process but it is located in both of the published x ray structures of the i b  nf  b complex at a significant distance away from the dna contact loop in the nf  b dna binding domain we have used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and differential isotopic labeling to probe the interactions between the p  p  nf  b heterodimer and i b  in solution our measurements are able to resolve a local structural discrepancy between the two crystal structures and we confirm that the primary interaction of the i b  pest domain is with the dna binding domain of the p  subunit mutagenesis of key arginine residues in the dna contact sequence results in the loss of specific interaction of the pest sequence with the p  subdomain we conclude that the local structure of the i b  nf  b complex in the region of the pest sequence is consistent with a direct interaction of this acidic sequence with the basic dna contact sequence in p  thus reducing the affinity of nf  b for dna by a competitive mechanism that is still to be elucidated fully
