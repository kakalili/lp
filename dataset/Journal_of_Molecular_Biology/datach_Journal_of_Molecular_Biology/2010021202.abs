an rna structural switch regulates diploid genome packaging by moloney murine leukemia virus
retroviruses selectively package two copies of their rna genomes via mechanisms that have yet to be fully deciphered recent studies with small fragments of the moloney murine leukemia virus momulv genome suggested that selection may be mediated by an rna switch mechanism in which conserved ucug elements that are sequestered by base pairing in the monomeric rna become exposed upon dimerization to allow binding to the cognate nucleocapsid nc domains of the viral gag proteins here we show that a large fragment of the momulv   untranslated region that contains all residues necessary for efficient rna packaging  wt residues      also exhibits a dimerization dependent affinity for nc with the native dimer   wt  binding    nc molecules with high affinity kd    nm and with the monomer stabilized by substitution of dimer promoting loop residues with hairpin stabilizing sequences  m  binding    nc molecules identical dimer inhibiting mutations in momulv based vectors significantly inhibit genome packaging in vivo     fold decrease  whereas a large deletion of nearly   nucleotides just upstream of the gag start codon has minimal effects our findings support the proposed rna switch mechanism and further suggest that virus assembly may be initiated by a complex comprising as few as  gag molecules bound to a dimeric packaging signal
