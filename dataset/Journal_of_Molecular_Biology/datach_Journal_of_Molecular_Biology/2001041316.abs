directionality of dna replication fork movement strongly affects the generation of spontaneous mutations in escherichia coli edited by m yaniv
using a pair of plasmids carrying the rpsl target sequence in different orientations to the replication origin we analyzed a large number of forward mutations generated in wild type and mismatch repair deficient mmr   escherichia coli cells to assess the effects of directionality of replication fork movement on spontaneous mutagenesis and the generation of replication error all classes of the mutations found in wild type cells but not mmr  cells were strongly affected by the directionality of replication fork movement it also appeared that the directionality of replication fork movement governs the directionality of sequence substitution mutagenesis which occurred in wild type cells at a frequency comparable to base substitutions and single base frameshift mutations a very strong orientation dependent hot spot site for single base frameshift mutations was discovered and demonstrated to be caused by the same process involved in sequence substitution mutagenesis it is surprising that dnae   a potent mutator mutation specific for sequence substitution as well as single base frameshift did not enhance the frequency of the hot spot frameshift mutation furthermore the frequency of the hot spot frameshift mutation was unchanged in the mmr  strain whereas the muthls dependent mismatch repair system efficiently suppressed the generation of single base frameshift mutations these results suggested that the hot spot frameshift mutagenesis might be initiated at a particular location containing a dna lesion and thereby produce a premutagenic replication intermediate resistant to mmr significant numbers of spontaneous single base frameshift mutations are probably caused by similar mechanisms
