Rev is a 116 residue basic protein encoded by the genome of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) that binds to multiple sites in the Rev response element (RRE) of viral mRNA transcripts in nuclei of host cells, leading to transport of incompletely spliced and unspliced viral mRNA to the cytoplasm of host cells in the latter phases of the HIV-1 life cycle. Rev is absolutely required for viral replication. Because Rev aggregates and fibrillizes in solution at concentrations required for crystal growth or liquid state NMR measurements, high-resolution structural characterization of full-length Rev has not been possible. Previously, circular dichroism studies have shown that approximately 50 % of the Rev sequence adopts helical secondary structure, predicted to correspond to a helix-loop-helix structural motif in the N-terminal half of the protein. We describe the application of solid-state NMR techniques to Rev fibrils as a means of obtaining site-specific, atomic-level structural constraints without requiring a high degree of solubility or crystallinity. Solid-state NMR measurements, using the double-quantum chemical shift anisotropy and constant-time double-quantum-filtered dipolar recoupling techniques, provide constraints on the φ and ψ backbone dihedral angles at sites in which consecutive backbone carbonyl groups are labeled with 13C. Quantitative analysis of the solid-state NMR data, by comparison with numerical simulations, indicates helical φ and ψ angles at residues Leu13 and Val16 in the predicted helix 1 segment, and at residues Arg39, Arg 42, Arg43, and Arg44 in the predicted helix 2 segment. These data represent the first site-specific structural constraints from NMR spectroscopy on full-length Rev, and support the helix-loop-helix structural model for its N-terminal half.
