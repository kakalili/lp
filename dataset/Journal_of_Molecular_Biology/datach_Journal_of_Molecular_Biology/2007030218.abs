thermostability infectivity defect caused by deletion of the core protein v gene in human adenovirus type  is rescued by thermo selectable mutations in the core protein x precursor
mastadenoviruses represent one of the four major genera of the adenoviridae family comprising a variety of mammalian pathogens including human adenovirus ad  whose genomes encode a gene for minor core protein v pv  not found in other genera of adenoviridae deletion of other genus specific genes gene ix and e genes from the ad type  ad  genome has been studied experimentally in vitro and the results on biological characterization of the mutants support the phylogenetic evidence of those genes being non essential for ad viability on this basis it seemed logical to suggest that a deletion of gene v from the ad genome could also be tolerated to test this hypothesis we constructed and rescued the first pv deletion mutant of human ad  as compared to ad  this mutant formed small plaques had dramatically reduced thermostability and lower infectivity a subsequent thermoselection screen of the pv deleted ad allowed isolation of a suppressor mutant ad dv tsb with restored biological characteristics since replication and viral assembly of ad dv tsb could still occur in the absence of pv we conclude that pv is a non essential component of the virion the observed rescue of the biological defects appears to be associated with a cluster of point mutations in the gene encoding the precursor for the other core protein x mu this finding thus suggests possible roles of pv and protein x mu precursor in viral assembly it also provides an interesting insight into genetic events that mediate molecular adaptation of viruses to possible changes in the genetic background in the course of their evolutionary divergence the possible mechanism of the observed genetic suppression is discussed
