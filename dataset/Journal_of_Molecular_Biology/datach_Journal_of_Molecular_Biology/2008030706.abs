sequential barriers and an obligatory metastable intermediate define the apparent two state folding pathway of the ubiquitin like pb domain of nbr
the  residue n terminal phox and bem p pb  domain of nbr forms an    ubiquitin like fold kinetic analysis using stopped flow fluorescence reveals two state kinetics however nonlinear effects in the denaturant dependence of the unfolding data demonstrate changes in the position of the rate limiting barrier along the folding coordinate as the folding conditions change the kinetics of wt pb and several mutants show that this curvature is consistent with a single pathway mechanism involving sequential transition states ts and ts  separated by a transiently populated high energy intermediate rather than movement of the transition state on a broad energy plateau we show that the two transition states within the sequential model represent structurally and thermodynamically distinct species ts is a collapsed state  ts    with a large enthalpic barrier to formation that is rate limiting under conditions that strongly favour folding ts is highly native like  ts    and represents a late entropic barrier to formation of the native state in support of the sequential transition state mechanism we show that the g a helix  substitution stabilises ts and the intermediate to such an extent that the latter becomes significantly populated leading to the observation of a fast kinetic phase representing the initial u  i transition with ts   ts    becoming rate limiting the folding rate is not retarded by populating an intermediate which would be expected for a misfold state but is accelerated suggesting that the i state is productive and on pathway the results show that the apparent two state folding of the wt pb domain occurs along a well defined pathway involving structurally and thermodynamically distinct sequential transition states and an obligatory metastable intermediate that represents a productive local minimum in the energy landscape that increases the efficiency of barrier crossing through favourable effects on the entropy of activation
