kinetic control of mg  dependent melting of duplex dna ends by escherichia coli recbc
escherichia coli recbcd is a highly processive dna helicase involved in double strand break repair and recombination that possesses two helicase translocase subunits with opposite translocation directionality recb    to    and recd    to     recbcd has been shown to melt out      bp upon binding to a blunt ended duplex dna in a mg  dependent but atp independent reaction here we examine the binding of e coli recbc helicase minus recd  also a processive helicase to duplex dna ends in the presence and in the absence of mg  in order to determine if recbc can also melt a duplex dna end in the absence of atp equilibrium binding of recbc to dna substrates with ends possessing pre formed   and or   single stranded ss  dt n flanking regions tails  n ranging from zero to   nt was examined by competition with a fluorescently labeled reference dna and by isothermal titration calorimetry the presence of mg  enhances the affinity of recbc for dna ends possessing   or    dt n ssdna tails with n lt  nt with the relative enhancement decreasing as n increases from zero to six nt no effect of mg  was observed for either the binding constant or the enthalpy of binding  hobs for recbc binding to dna with ssdna tail lengths n   nucleotides upon recbc binding to a blunt duplex dna end in the presence of mg  at least  bp at the duplex end become accessible to kmno attack consistent with melting of the duplex end since mg  has no effect on the affinity or binding enthalpy of recbc for a dna end that is fully pre melted this suggests that the role of mg  is to overcome a kinetic barrier to melting of the dna by recbc and presumably also by recbcd these data also provide an accurate estimate  hobs    kcal mol for the average enthalpy change associated with the melting of a dna base pair by recbc
