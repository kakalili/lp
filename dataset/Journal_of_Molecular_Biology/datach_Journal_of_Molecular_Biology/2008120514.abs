atomistic simulations of the effects of polyglutamine chain length and solvent quality on conformational equilibria and spontaneous homodimerization
aggregation of expanded polyglutamine tracts is associated with nine different neurodegenerative diseases including huntington s disease experiments and computer simulations have demonstrated that monomeric forms of polyglutamine molecules sample heterogeneous sets of collapsed structures in water the current work focuses on a mechanistic characterization of polyglutamine homodimerization as a function of chain length and temperature these studies were carried out using molecular simulations based on a recently developed continuum solvation model that was designed for studying conformational and binding equilibria of intrinsically disordered molecules such as polyglutamine systems the main results are as follows polyglutamine molecules form disordered collapsed globules in aqueous solution these molecules spontaneously associate at conditions approaching those of typical in vitro experiments for chains of length n    the spontaneity of these homotypic associations increases with increasing chain length and decreases with increasing temperature similar and generic driving forces govern both collapse and spontaneous homodimerization of polyglutamine in aqueous milieus collapse and dimerization maximize self interactions and reduce the interface between polyglutamine molecules and the surrounding solvent other than these generic considerations there do not appear to be any specific structural requirements for either chain collapse or chain dimerization that is both collapse and dimerization are nonspecific in that disordered globules form disordered dimers in fact it is shown that the driving force for intermolecular associations is governed by spontaneous conformational fluctuations within monomeric polyglutamine these results suggest that polyglutamine aggregation is unlikely to follow a homogeneous nucleation mechanism with the monomer as the critical nucleus instead the results support the formation of disordered non  sheet like soluble molten oligomers as early intermediates  a proposal that is congruent with recent experimental data
