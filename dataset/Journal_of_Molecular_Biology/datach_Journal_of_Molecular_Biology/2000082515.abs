interactions of arg in the mnt n terminal arm with the central and flanking regions of the mnt operator edited by m yaniv
arg  in the n terminal arm of the mnt repressor plays an important role in determining operator binding specificity in the complex of the mnt tetramer with the  base pair mnt operator there are four potential sites for arg interactions two in the central region of the operator and two on the outer flanks of the operator single chain variants of the dimeric n terminal domain of mnt containing one arg residue and one lys or met residue were constructed and interactions with operator dna were probed using fe edta affinity cleavage the results of these orientation studies show that the majority of the energetically significant interactions mediated by arg occur in the central region of the mnt operator the rk  ra  and rm mutations reduce the free energy of operator binding by   kcal mol   kcal mol and   kcal mol respectively double mutant thermodynamic cycle analyses using the ra  rm  and operator variants also reveal interaction free energies between arg and operator base pairs        and   which in aggregate account for most of the arg contribution to operator binding
