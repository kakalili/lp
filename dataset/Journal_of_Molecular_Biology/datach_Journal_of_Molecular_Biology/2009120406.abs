carm but not its enzymatic activity is required for transcriptional coactivation of nf  b dependent gene expression
coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase  carm  belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase family it was reported to methylate histone as well as non histone proteins and thus to be involved in transcriptional activation and mrna degradation stability here we report the genetic complementation of carm     cells with wild type carm or an enzymatic inactive mutant of carm to investigate the requirement of carm and its enzymatic activity for nuclear factor  b nf  b dependent gene expression using custom microarray and quantitative reverse transcription pcr we could define a subset of nf  b target genes that required carm for their proper expression although several tumor necrosis factor   and phorbol  myristate  acetate ionomycin induced nf  b target genes are carm dependent carm enzymatic activity was dispensable for gene expression interestingly carm was not required for the stimulus dependent recruitment of rela p  to chromatin suggesting that carm is rather contributing in protein complex stabilization together our results confirm the importance of carm as transcriptional cofactor without the involvement of its catalytic activity
