a novel lipid binding site formed by the map kinase insert in p
the p  mitogen activated protein map kinases function as signaling molecules essential for many cellular processes particularly mediating stress response the activity of p  map kinases is meticulously regulated to reach the desired cellular phenotype several alternative activation and attenuation mechanisms have been characterized recently which include new phosphorylation sites here we present the crystal structure of p   map kinase in complex with n octyl  glucopyranoside detergent the complex unveils a novel lipid binding site formed by a local conformational change of the map kinase insert this binding is the first attribution for a possible role of the map kinase insert in p  the binding site can accommodate a large selection of lipidic molecules in addition we also show via biophysical methods that arachidonic acid and its derivatives bind p   in vitro based on our analysis we propose that the binding of lipids could fine tune p   catalytic activity towards a preferred phenotype
