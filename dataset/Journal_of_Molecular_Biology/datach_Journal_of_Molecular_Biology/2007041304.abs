modular architecture of the hexameric human mitochondrial dna helicase
we have probed the structure of the human mitochondrial dna helicase an enzyme that uses the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to unwind duplex dna during mitochondrial dna replication this novel helicase shares substantial amino acid sequence and functional similarities with the bacteriophage t primase helicase we show in velocity sedimentation and gel filtration analyses that the mitochondrial dna helicase exists as a hexamer limited proteolysis by trypsin results in the production of several stable fragments and n terminal sequencing reveals distinct n and c terminal polypeptides that represent minimal structural domains physical analysis of the proteolytic products defines the region required to maintain oligomeric structure to reside within amino acid residues        truncations of the n and c termini affect differentially dna dependent atpase activity and whereas a c terminal domain polypeptide is functional an n terminal domain polypeptide lacks atpase activity sequence similarity and secondary structural alignments combined with biochemical data suggest that amino acid residue r  serves as the putative arginine finger that is essential for atpase activity in ring helicases the hexameric conformation and modular architecture revealed in our study document that the mitochondrial dna helicase and bacteriophage t primase helicase share physical features our findings place the mitochondrial dna helicase firmly in the dnab like family of replicative dna helicases
