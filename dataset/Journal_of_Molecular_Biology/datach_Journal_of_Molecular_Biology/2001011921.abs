analysis of gain of function mutants of an atp dependent regulator of tn transposition edited by j karn
the bacterial transposon tn is distinguished by its unusal discrimination among targets being particularly attracted to certain target dna and actively avoiding other dna tn transposition is mediated by the interaction of two alternative transposon encoded target selection proteins tnsd and tnse with a common core transposition machinery composed of the transposase tnsab and an atp dependent dna binding protein tnsc no transposition is observed with wild type tnsabc here we analyze the properties of two gain of function tnsc mutants that allow transposition in the absence of tnsd or tnse we find that these tnsc mutants have altered interactions with atp and dna that can account for their gain of function phenotype we also show that tnsc is an atpase and that it directly interacts with the tnsab transposase this work provides strong support to the view that tnsc and its atp state are central to the control of tn transposition
