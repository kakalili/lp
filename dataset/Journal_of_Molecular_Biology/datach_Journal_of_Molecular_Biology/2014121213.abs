a  fuzzy  logic language for encoding multiple physical traits in biomolecules
to carry out their activities biological macromolecules balance different physical traits such as stability interaction affinity and selectivity how such often opposing traits are encoded in a macromolecular system is critical to our understanding of evolutionary processes and ability to design new molecules with desired functions we present a framework for constraining design simulations to balance different physical characteristics each trait is represented by the equilibrium fractional occupancy of the desired state relative to its alternatives ranging from none to full occupancy and the different traits are combined using boolean operators to effect a  fuzzy  logic language for encoding any combination of traits in another paper we presented a new combinatorial backbone design algorithm abdesign where the fuzzy logic framework was used to optimize protein backbones and sequences for both stability and binding affinity in antibody design simulation we now extend this framework and find that fuzzy logic design simulations reproduce sequence and structure design principles seen in nature to underlie exquisite specificity on the one hand and multispecificity on the other hand the fuzzy logic language is broadly applicable and could help define the space of tolerated and beneficial mutations in natural biomolecular systems and design artificial molecules that encode complex characteristics
