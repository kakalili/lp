requirement of left handed glycine residue for high stability of the tk subtilisin propeptide as revealed by mutational and crystallographic analyses
tk subtilisin the mature domain of pro tk subtilisin in active form gly  gly   from the hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus kodakaraensis is matured from pro tk subtilisin a subtilisin homologue from t kodakaraensis in pro form gly gly   upon autoprocessing and degradation of propeptide pro tk subtilisin is characterized by extremely slow maturation at mild temperatures but this maturation rate is greatly increased by a single gly   ser mutation in the propeptide region to analyze the role of gly  which assumes a left handed conformation pro tk subtilisin variants with complete amino acid substitutions at gly  were constructed a comparison of their halo forming activities suggests that all variants except for pro g w pro g x pro tk subtilisin with gly   x mutation x any amino acid  mature faster than wt pro g w and pro g e with the lowest and highest maturation rates respectively among  variants as well as wt and pro g s were overproduced purified and characterized sds page analyses and tk subtilisin activity assay indicated that their maturation rates increased in the order wt  pro g w lt pro g s lt pro g e the propeptides of these variants were also overproduced purified and characterized the stability and inhibitory potency of these propeptides decreased in the order tk propeptide propeptide of tk subtilisin gly leu    g w propeptide gt g s propeptide gt g e propeptide indicating that they are inversely correlated with the maturation rates of pro tk subtilisin and its derivatives the crystal structures of these propeptides determined in complex with s  a subtilisin indicate that the conformation of the propeptide is altered by the mutation such that nonglycine residues at position  assume a right handed conformation and hydrophobic interactions at the core region decrease these results indicate that gly  is required in stabilizing the propeptide fold stabilization of this fold leads to strong binding of tk propeptide to tk subtilisin high resistance of tk propeptide to proteolytic degradation and slow maturation of pro tk subtilisin
