crystal structure and raman studies of dsfp   a cyan fluorescent protein from discosoma striata
to better understand the diverse mechanisms of spectral tuning operational in fluorescent proteins fps  we determined the    x ray structure of dsfp  from the reef building coral discosoma this protein is a member of the cyan class of anthozoa fps and exhibits broad double humped excitation and absorbance bands with a maximum at      nm and a shoulder at   nm although these features support a heterogeneous ground state for the protein intrinsic chromophore peak fluorescence occurs at   nm for all excitation wavelengths suggesting a common emissive state optical properties are insensitive to changes in ph over the entire range of protein stability the refined crystal structure of the biological tetramer space group c  demonstrates that all protomers bear a cis coplanar chromophore chemically identical with that in green fluorescent protein gfp  to test the roles of specific residues in color modulation we investigated the optical properties of the h  q and k m variants although absorbance bands remain broad peak excitation maxima are red shifted to   and   nm emitting cyan light and green light respectively to probe chromophore ground state features we collected raman spectra using   nm excitation surprisingly the positions of key raman bands of wild type dsfp  are most similar to those of the neutral gfp chromophore whereas the k m spectra are more closely aligned with the anionic form the raman data provide further evidence of a mixed ground state with chromophore populations that are modulated by mutation possible internal protonation equilibria structural heterogeneity in the binding sites and excited state proton transfer mechanisms are discussed structural alignments of dsfp  with the homologs dsred amfp   and zfp  k m suggest that natural selection for cyan is an exquisitely fine tuned and highly cooperative process involving a network of electrostatic interactions that may vary substantially in composition and arrangement
