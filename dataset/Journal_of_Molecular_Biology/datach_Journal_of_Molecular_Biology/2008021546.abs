polymorphic assemblies and crystalline arrays of lens tetraspanin mp
members of the tetraspanin superfamily function as transmembrane scaffold proteins that mediate the assembly of membrane proteins into specific signaling complexes tetraspanins also interact with each other and concentrate membrane proteins into tetraspanin enriched microdomains tems  here we report that lens specific tetraspanin mp  can form multiple types of higher order assemblies and we present crystalline arrays of mp  when isolated in the absence of divalent cations mp  is solubilized predominantly in tetrameric form whereas the presence of divalent cations during solubilization promotes the association of mp  tetramers into higher order species this effect only occurs when divalent cations are present during solubilization but not when divalent cations are added to solubilized tetrameric mp  suggesting that other factors may also be involved when purified mp  tetramers are reconstituted with native lens lipids in the presence of magnesium mp  forms two dimensional  d crystals a projection map at    resolution calculated from negatively stained d crystals showed that the building block of the crystal is an octamer consisting of two tetramers related to each other by  fold symmetry in addition to d crystals reconstitution of mp  with native lipids also produced a variety of large protein  lipid complexes and we present three dimensional  d reconstructions of the four most abundant of these complexes in negative stain the various complexes formed by mp  most likely reflect the many ways in which tetraspanins can interact with each other to allow formation of tems
