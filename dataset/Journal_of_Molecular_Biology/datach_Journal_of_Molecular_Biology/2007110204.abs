a beta sheet interaction interface directs the tetramerisation of the miz  poz domain
the poz btb domain is an evolutionarily conserved motif found in approximately  zinc finger transcription factors poz zf factors  several poz zf factors are implicated in human cancer and poz domain interaction interfaces represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention miz  myc interacting zinc finger protein is a poz zf factor that regulates dna damage induced cell cycle arrest and plays an important role in human cancer by virtue of its interaction with the c myc and bcl oncogene products the miz  poz domain mediates both self association and the recruitment of non poz partners poz zf factors generally function as homodimers although higher order associations and heteromeric interactions are known to be physiologically important crucially the interaction interfaces in such large complexes have not been characterised we report here the crystal structure of the miz  poz domain up to     resolution the tetrameric organisation of miz  poz reveals two types of interaction interface between subunits an interface of alpha helices resembles the dimerisation interface of reported poz domain structures whereas a novel beta sheet interface directs the association of two poz domain dimers we show that the beta sheet interface directs the tetramerisation of the miz  poz domain in solution and therefore represents a newly described candidate interface for the higher order homo and hetero oligomerisation of poz zf proteins in vivo
