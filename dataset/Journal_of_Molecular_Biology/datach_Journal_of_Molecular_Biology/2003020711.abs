structure of a drosophila sigma class glutathione s transferase reveals a novel active site topography suited for lipid peroxidation products
insect glutathione s transferases gsts are grouped in three classes i ii and recently iii class i delta class enzymes together with class iii members are implicated in conferring resistance to insecticides class ii sigma class gsts however are poorly characterized and their exact biological function remains elusive drosophila glutathione s transferase  gst   dmgsts   is a class ii enzyme previously found associated specifically with the insect indirect flight muscle it was recently shown that gst  exhibits considerable conjugation activity for  hydroxynonenal  hne  a lipid peroxidation product raising the possibility that it has a major anti oxidant role in the flight muscle here we report the crystal structure of gst  at    resolution the gst  dimer shows the canonical gst fold with glutathione gsh ordered in only one of the two binding sites while the gsh binding mode is similar to other gst structures a distinct orientation of helix   creates a novel electrophilic substrate binding site h site topography largely flat and without a prominent hydrophobic binding pocket which characterizes the h sites of other gsts the h site displays directionality in the distribution of charged polar and hydrophobic residues creating a binding surface that explains the selectivity for amphipolar peroxidation products with the polar binding region formed by residues y   y  and r  and the hydrophobic binding region by residues v  a  y  and the c terminal v   a structure based model of  hne binding is presented the model suggest that residues y   r  and possibly y  may be key residues involved in catalysis
