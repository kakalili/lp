direct evidence for a glutamate switch necessary for substrate recognition crystal structures of lysine  aminotransferase rv  c from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv
lysine  aminotransferase lat is a plp dependent enzyme that is highly up regulated in nutrient starved tuberculosis models it catalyzes an overall reaction involving the transfer of the  amino group of l lysine to  ketoglutarate to yield l glutamate and  aminoadipate  semialdehyde we have cloned and characterized the enzyme from mycobacterium tuberculosis h rv we report here the crystal structures of the enzyme the first from any source in the unliganded form external aldimine with l lysine with bound pmp and with its c substrate  ketoglutarate in addition to interaction details in the active site the structures reveal a glu    switch  through which the enzyme changes substrate specificities the unique substrate l lysine is recognized specifically when glu  maintains a salt bridge with arg   on the other hand the binding of the common c substrates l glutamate and  ketoglutarate is enabled when glu  switches away and unshields arg   the structures reported here sequence conservation and earlier mutational studies suggest that the  glutamate switch  is an elegant solution devised by a subgroup of fold type i aminotransferases for recognition of structurally diverse substrates in the same binding site and provides for reaction specificity
