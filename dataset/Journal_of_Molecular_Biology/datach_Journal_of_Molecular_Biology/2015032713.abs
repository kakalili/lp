systematic identification of molecular links between core and candidate genes in breast cancer
despite the remarkable progress achieved in the identification of specific genes involved in breast cancer bc  our understanding of their complex functioning is still limited in this manuscript we systematically explore the existence of direct physical interactions between the products of bc core and associated genes our aim is to generate a protein interaction network of bc associated gene products and suggest potential molecular mechanisms to unveil their role in the disease in total we report   novel high confidence interactions among  bc core   bc candidate associated and  newly identified proteins our findings indicate that this network based approach is indeed a robust inference tool to pinpoint new potential players and gain insight into the underlying mechanisms of those proteins with previously unknown roles in bc to illustrate the power of our approach we provide initial validation of two bc associated proteins on the alteration of dna damage response as a result of specific re wiring interactions overall our bc related network may serve as a framework to integrate clinical and molecular data and foster novel global therapeutic strategies
