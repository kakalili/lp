nmr structure of the hiv  nucleocapsid protein bound to stem loop sl of the  rna packaging signal implications for genome recognition  edited by p wright
the rna genome of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  contains a    nucleotide  packaging signal that is recognized by the nucleocapsid nc domain of the gag polyprotein during virus assembly the  site contains four stem loops sl sl  that possess overlapping and possibly redundant functions the present studies demonstrate that the  residue sl stem loop binds nc with affinity kd      nm similar to that observed for nc binding to sl  kd      nm and tighter than expected on the basis of earlier work suggesting that nc sl interactions probably play a direct role in the specific recognition and packaging of the full length unspliced genome the structure of the nc sl complex was determined by heteronuclear nmr methods using  n  c isotopically labeled nc protein and sl rna the n and c terminal  zinc knuckles   cys x cys x his x cys x variable amino acid of hiv  nc bind to exposed guanosine bases g and g  respectively of the g g u  g  tetraloop and residues lys lys  of the n terminal tail forms a   helix that packs against the proximal zinc knuckle and interacts with the rna stem these structural features are similar to those observed previously in the nmr structure of nc bound to sl  other features of the complex are substantially different in particular the n terminal zinc knuckle interacts with an a u a base triple platform in the minor groove of the sl rna stem but binds to the major groove of sl  in addition the relative orientations of the n and c terminal zinc knuckles differ in the nc sl and nc sl complexes and the side chain of phe makes minor groove hydrophobic contacts with g  in the nc sl complex but does not interact with rna in the nc sl complex finally the n terminal helix of nc interacts with the phosphodiester backbone of the sl rna stem mainly via electrostatic interactions but does not bind in the major groove or make specific h bonding contacts as observed in the nc sl structure these findings demonstrate that nc binds in an adaptive manner to sl and sl via different subsets of inter and intra molecular interactions and support a genome recognition packaging mechanism that involves interactions of two or more nc domains of assembling hiv  gag molecules with multiple  site stem loop packaging elements during the early stages of retrovirus assembly
