characterization of a high affinity complex between the bacterial outer membrane protein fhua and the phage t protein pb
binding of bacteriophage t to escherichia coli cells is mediated by specific interactions between the receptor binding protein pb    kda and the outer membrane iron transporter fhua a histidine tagged form of pb was overproduced and purified isolated pb is monomeric and organized mostly as  sheets    pb functionality was attested in vivo by its ability to impair infection of e coli cells by phage t and    and to prevent growth of bacteria on iron ferrichrome as unique iron source pb was functional in vitro since addition of an equimolar concentration of pb to purified fhua prevented dna release from phage t  however pb alone was not sufficient for the conversion of fhua into an open channel direct interaction of pb with fhua was demonstrated by isolating a pb fhua complex using size exclusion chromatography the stoichiometry  mol of pb  mol of fhua was deduced from its molecular mass established by analytical ultracentrifugation after determination of the amount of bound detergent sds page and differential scanning calorimetry experiments highlighted the great stability of the complex  i it was not dissociated by  sds even when the temperature was raised to   c  ii thermal denaturation of the complex occurred at   c while pb and fhua were denatured at   c and   c respectively the stability of the complex renders it suitable for high resolution structural studies allowing future analysis of conformational changes into both fhua and pb upon adsorption of the virus to its host
