phospholamban interacts with hax  a mitochondrial protein with anti apoptotic function
phospholamban pln is a key regulator of ca  homeostasis and contractility in the heart its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase  serca a  resulting in alterations of its ca  affinity to identify additional proteins that may interact with pln we used the yeast two hybrid system to screen an adult human cardiac cdna library hs  associated protein x  hax  was identified as a pln binding partner the minimal binding regions were mapped to amino acid residues      for hax  and residues     for pln the interaction between the two proteins was confirmed using gst hax  bound to the glutathione matrix which specifically adsorbed native pln from human or mouse cardiac homogenates while in reciprocal binding studies recombinant his hax  bound gst pln kinetic studies using surface plasmon resonance yielded a kd of     m as the binding affinity for the pln hax  complex phosphorylation of pln by camp dependent protein kinase reduced binding to hax  while increasing concentrations of ca  diminished the pln hax  interaction in a dose dependent manner hax  concentrated to mitochondria but upon transient co transfection of hek   cells with pln hax  redistributed and co localized with pln at the endoplasmic reticulum analysis of the anti apoptotic function of hax  revealed that the presence of pln enhanced the hax  protective effects from hypoxia reoxygenation induced cell death these findings suggest a possible link between the ca  handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum and cell survival mediated by the pln hax  interaction
