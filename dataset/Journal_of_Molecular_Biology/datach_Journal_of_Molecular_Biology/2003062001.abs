adaptation of the efg p morphogenetic pathway in candida albicans by negative autoregulation and pka dependent repression of the efg gene
the efg p regulator protein permits hyphal morphogenesis in the human fungal pathogen candida albicans we have identified the major promoter of the efg gene as a direct target of efg p resulting in negative autoregulation of efg  enhanced activity of protein kinase a pka isoforms tpk p and tpk p or exogenous overexpression of efg led to efg p dependent down regulation of the endogenous efg promoter serial deletion analyses of the promoter region revealed that the tata box region was required for efg autoregulation by chromatin immunoprecipitation we detected binding of efg p to the efg transcriptional initiation region furthermore sin p a component of a specific histone deacetylase complex was shown to bind to the efg promoter sin mutants grew as budding pseudohyphae and were unable to form true hyphae similar to strains constitutively expressing efg  we propose that the pka signalling pathway in addition to its importance in the initial steps of filament formation is part of a feedback loop that controls efg expression allowing continued hypha formation in inducing conditions this autoregulation of efg expression is probably mediated through the sin p containing histone deacetylation complex
