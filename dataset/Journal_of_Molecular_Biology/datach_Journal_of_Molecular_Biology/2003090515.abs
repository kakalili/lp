the functional binding epitope of a high affinity variant of human growth hormone mapped by shotgun alanine scanning mutagenesis insights into the mechanisms responsible for improved affinity
a high affinity variant of human growth hormone hghv contains  mutations within site  and binds to the hgh receptor hghr     fold tighter than does wild type wt hgh hghwt  we used shotgun scanning combinatorial mutagenesis to dissect the energetic contributions of individual residues within the hghv binding epitope and placed them in context with previously determined structural information in all the effects of alanine substitutions were determined for  hghv residues that are directly contained in or closely border the binding interface we found that the distribution of binding energy in the functional epitope of hghv differs significantly from that of hghwt the residues that contributed the majority of the binding energy in the wt interaction the so called binding  hot spot   remain important but their contributions are attenuated in the hghv interaction and additional binding energy is acquired from residues on the periphery of the original hotspot many interactions that inhibited the binding of hghwt are replaced by interactions that make positive contributions to the binding of hghv these changes produce an expanded and diffused hot spot in which improved affinity results from numerous small contributions distributed broadly over the interface the mutagenesis results are consistent with previous structural studies which revealed widespread structural differences between the wt and variant hormone  receptor interfaces thus it appears that the improved binding affinity of hghv site  was not achieved through minor adjustments to the wt interface but rather results from a wholesale reconfiguration of many of the original binding elements
