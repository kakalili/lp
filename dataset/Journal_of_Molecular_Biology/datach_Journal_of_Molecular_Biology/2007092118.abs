inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state
we discuss basic physical  chemical principles underlying the formation of stable macromolecular complexes which in many cases are likely to be the biological units performing a certain physiological function we also consider available theoretical approaches to the calculation of macromolecular affinity and entropy of complexation the latter is shown to play an important role and make a major effect on complex size and symmetry we develop a new method based on chemical thermodynamics for automatic detection of macromolecular assemblies in the protein data bank pdb entries that are the results of x ray diffraction experiments as found biological units may be recovered at     success rate which makes x ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on macromolecular complexes and protein  protein interactions the method is implemented as a public www service    http  www ebi ac uk msd srv prot int pistart html
