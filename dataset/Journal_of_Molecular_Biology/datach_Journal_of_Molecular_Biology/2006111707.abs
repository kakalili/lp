solution nmr structure of the junction between tropomyosin molecules implications for actin binding and regulation
tropomyosin is a coiled coil protein that binds head to tail along the length of actin filaments in eukaryotic cells stabilizing them and providing protection from severing proteins tropomyosin cooperatively regulates actin s interaction with myosin and mediates the ca  dependent regulation of contraction by troponin in striated muscles the n terminal and c terminal ends are critical functional determinants that form an  overlap complex   here we report the solution nmr structure of an overlap complex formed of model peptides in the complex the chains of the c terminal coiled coil spread apart to allow insertion of  residues of the n terminal coiled coil into the resulting cleft the plane of the n terminal coiled coil is rotated   relative to the plane of the c terminus a consequence of the geometry is that the orientation of postulated periodic actin binding sites on the coiled coil surface is retained from one molecule to the next along the actin filament when the overlap complex is modeled into the x ray structure of tropomyosin determined at    nuclear relaxation nmr data reveal flexibility of the junction which may function to optimize binding along the helical actin filament and to allow mobility of tropomyosin on the filament surface as it switches between regulatory states
