mutational analysis of conserved sequence motifs in the budding yeast cdc protein edited by m yaniv
the cdc protein is required to load a complex of mcm  family members the mcm complex into prereplicative complexes at budding yeast origins of dna replication cdc p is a member of the aaa superfamily of proteins which includes the prokaryotic and eukaryotic clamp loading proteins these proteins share a number of conserved regions of homology and a common three dimensional architecture two of the conserved sequence motifs are the walker a and b motifs that are involved in nucleotide metabolism and are essential for cdc p function in vivo here we analyse mutants in the other conserved sequence motifs several of these mutants are temperature sensitive for growth and are unable to recruit the mcm complex to chromatin at the restrictive temperature in one such temperature sensitive mutant a highly conserved asparagine residue in the sensor i motif was changed to alanine overexpression of this mutant protein is lethal this phenotype is very similar to the phenotype previously described for a mutation in the walker b motif suggesting a common role for sensor i and the walker b motif in cdc function
