the c domains of classical pkcs are specific ptdins   p sensing domains with different affinities for membrane binding
c domains are conserved protein modules in many eukaryotic signaling proteins including the protein kinase pkcs  the c domains of classical pkcs bind to membranes in a ca  dependent manner and thereby act as cellular ca  effectors recent findings suggest that the c domain of pkc  interacts specifically with phosphatidylinositols   bisphosphate ptdins   p  through its lysine rich cluster for which it shows higher affinity than for pops in this work we compared the three c domains of classical pkcs isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the c domains of pkc  and  display a greater capacity to bind to ptdins   p containing vesicles than the c domain of pkc  comparative studies using lipid vesicles containing both pops and ptdins   p as ligands revealed that the domains behave as ptdins   p binding modules rather than as pops binding modules suggesting that the presence of the phosphoinositide in membranes increases the affinity of each domain when the magnitude of ptdins   p binding was compared with that of other polyphosphate phosphatidylinositols it was seen to be greater in both pkc  and pkc  c domains the concentration of ca  required to bind to membranes was seen to be lower in the presence of ptdins   p for all c domains especially pkc  in vivo experiments using differentiated pc  cells transfected with each c domain fused to ecfp and stimulated with atp demonstrated that at limiting intracellular concentration of ca  the three c domains translocate to the plasma membrane at very similar rates however the plasma membrane dissociation event differed in each case pkc  persisting for the longest time in the plasma membrane followed by pkc  and finally pkc  which probably reflects the different levels of ca  needed by each domain and their different affinities for ptdins   p
