neutron diffraction studies of a class a  lactamase toho  e  a r  n r  n triple mutant
lactam antibiotics have been used effectively over several decades against many types of bacterial infectious diseases however the most common cause of resistance to the  lactam antibiotics is the production of  lactamase enzymes that inactivate  lactams by rapidly hydrolyzing the amide group of the  lactam ring specifically the class a extended spectrum  lactamases esbls and inhibitor resistant enzymes arose that were capable of hydrolyzing penicillins and the expanded spectrum cephalosporins and monobactams in resistant bacteria which lead to treatment problems in many clinical settings a more complete understanding of the mechanism of catalysis of these esbl enzymes will impact current antibiotic drug discovery efforts here we describe the neutron structure of the class a ctx m type esbl toho  e  a r  n r  n triple mutant in its apo form which is the first reported neutron structure of a  lactamase enzyme this neutron structure clearly reveals the active site protonation states and hydrogen bonding network of the apo toho  esbl prior to substrate binding and subsequent acylation the protonation states of the active site residues ser  lys  ser   and lys  in this neutron structure are consistent with the prediction of a proton transfer pathway from lys  to ser  that is likely dependent on the conformation of lys  which has been hypothesized to be coupled to the protonation state of glu  during the acylation reaction thus this neutron structure is in agreement with a proposed mechanism for acylation that identifies glu  as the general base for catalysis
