mechanisms of mavs regulation at the mitochondrial membrane
mitochondria have emerged as critical platforms for antiviral innate immune signaling this is due in large part to the mitochondrial localization of the innate immune signaling adaptor mavs mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein  which coordinates signals received from two independent cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors prrs to induce antiviral genes the existence of a shared adaptor for two central prrs presents an ideal target by which the host cell can prevent cellular damage induced by uncontrolled inflammation through alteration of mavs expression and or signaling in this review we focus on the mavs regulome and review the cellular factors that regulate mavs by   protein  protein interactions   alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and or   post translational modifications
