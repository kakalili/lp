compound selectivity and target residence time of kinase inhibitors studied with surface plasmon resonance
target residence time   has been suggested to be a better predictor of the biological activity of kinase inhibitors than inhibitory potency ic  in enzyme assays surface plasmon resonance binding assays for  human protein and lipid kinases were developed the association and dissociation constants of  kinase inhibitor interactions were determined   and equilibrium affinity constants kd were calculated to determine kinetic selectivity comparison of  and kd or ic  values revealed a strikingly different view on the selectivity of several kinase inhibitors including the multi kinase inhibitor ponatinib which was tested on  different kinases in addition known pan aurora inhibitors resided much longer on aurora b than on aurora a despite having comparable affinity for aurora a and b furthermore the    selective pi k inhibitor duvelisib and the  selective drug idelalisib had similar  fold selectivity for   over  isoform but duvelisib resided much longer on both targets
