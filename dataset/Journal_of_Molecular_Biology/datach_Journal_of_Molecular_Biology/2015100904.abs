when the scaffold cannot be ignored the role of the hydrophobic core in ligand binding and specificity
the traditional view of protein  ligand binding treats a protein as comprising distinct binding epitopes on the surface of a degenerate structural scaffold largely ignoring the impact of a protein s energy landscape to determine the robustness of this simplification we compared two small helix  turn  helix transcription factors with different energy landscapes   repressor is stable and well folded while mara appears to be marginally stable with multiple native conformations molten  while  repressor is known to tolerate any hydrophobic mutation in the core we find mara drastically less tolerant to core mutation moreover core mutations in mara distant from the dna binding interface change the relative affinities of its binding partners altering ligand specificity these results can be explained by taking into account the effects of mutations on the entire energy landscape and not just the native state thus for proteins with multiple conformations that are close in energy such as many intrinsically disordered proteins residues distant from the active site can alter both binding affinity and specificity
