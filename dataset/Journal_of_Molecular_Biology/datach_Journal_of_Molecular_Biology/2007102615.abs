x ray structure of a nf  b p  relb dna complex reveals assembly of multiple dimers on tandem  b sites
we describe here the x ray crystal structure of nf  b p  relb heterodimer bound to a  b dna although the global modes of subunit association and  b dna recognition are similar to other nf  b dna complexes this complex reveals distinctive features not observed for non relb complexes for example lys  of relb is removed from the protein  dna interface whereas the corresponding residues in all other subunits make base specific contacts this mode of binding suggests that relb may allow the recognition of more diverse  b sequences complementary surfaces on relb and p  as revealed by the crystal contacts are highly suggestive of assembly of multiple p  relb heterodimers on tandem  b sites in solution consistent with this model our in vitro binding experiments reveal optimal assembly of two wild type p  relb heterodimers on tandem hiv  b dna with  bp spacing but not by a mutant heterodimer where one of the relb packing surface is altered we suggest that multiple nf  b dimers assemble at diverse  b promoters through direct interactions utilizing unique protein  protein interaction surfaces
