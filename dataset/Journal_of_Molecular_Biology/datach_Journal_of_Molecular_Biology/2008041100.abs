subtle changes in peptide conformation profoundly affect recognition of the non classical mhc class i molecule hla e by the cd   nkg natural killer cell receptors
human leukocyte antigen hla e is a non classical major histocompatibility complex class i molecule that binds peptides derived from the leader sequences of other hla class i molecules natural killer cell recognition of these hla e molecules via the cd   nkg natural killer family represents a central innate mechanism for monitoring major histocompatibility complex expression levels within a cell the leader sequence derived peptides bound to hla e exhibit very limited polymorphism yet subtle differences affect the recognition of hla e by the cd   nkg receptors to better understand the basis for this peptide specific recognition we determined the structure of hla e in complex with two leader peptides namely hla cw   vmapralll  which is poorly recognised by cd   nkg receptors and hla g   vmaprtlfl  a high affinity ligand of cd   nkg receptors a comparison of these structures both of which were determined to    resolution revealed that allotypic variations in the bound leader sequences do not result in conformational changes in the hla e heavy chain although subtle changes in the conformation of the peptide within the binding groove of hla e were evident accordingly our data indicate that the cd   nkg receptors interact with hla e in a manner that maximises the ability of the receptors to discriminate between subtle changes in both the sequence and conformation of peptides bound to hla e
