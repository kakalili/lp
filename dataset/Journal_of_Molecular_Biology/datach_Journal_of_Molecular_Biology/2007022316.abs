conformational stability and domain unfolding of the von willebrand factor a domains
von willebrand factor vwf  a multimeric multidomain glycoprotein secreted into the blood from vascular endothelial cells initiates platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury this process requires the binding of platelet glycoprotein ib ix v to the a domain of vwf monomeric subunits under fluid shear stress the a domain of vwf monomers contains a proteolytic site specific for a circulating plasma vwf metalloprotease a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs member   of the adamts enzyme family adamts   that functions to reduce adhesiveness of newly released unusually large ul  hyperactive forms of vwf shear stress assists adamts  proteolysis of ulvwf multimers allowing adamts  cleavage of an exposed peptide bond in the a domain shear stress may induce conformational changes in vwf and even unfold regions of vwf monomeric subunits we used urea as a surrogate for shear to study denaturation of the individual vwf recombinant a domains a  a  and a  and the domain triplet a a a  denaturation was evaluated as a function of the urea concentration and the intrinsic thermodynamic stability of the domains against unfolding was determined the a domain unfolded in a  state manner through a stable intermediate domains a and a unfolded in a  state manner from native to denatured the a a a triple domain unfolded in a  state manner through four partially folded intermediates between the native and denatured states urea denaturation of a a a was characterized by two major unfolding transitions the first corresponding to the simultaneous complete unfolding of a and partial unfolding of a to the intermediate state and the second corresponding to the complete unfolding of a followed by gradual unfolding of the intermediate state of a at high urea concentration the a domain containing the cleavage site for adamts  was the least stable of the three domains and was the most susceptible to unfolding the low stability of the a domain is likely to be important in regulating the exposure of the a domain cleavage site in response to shear stress ulvwf platelet adherence and the attachment of adamts  to ulvwf
