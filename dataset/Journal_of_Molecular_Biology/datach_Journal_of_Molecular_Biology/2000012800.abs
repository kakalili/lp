analysis of jnk mdm and p arf contribution to the regulation of mutant p  stability edited by m yaniv
identification of mdm and jnk as proteins that target degradation of wt p  prompted us to examine their effect on mutant p  which exhibits a prolonged half life of five mutant p  forms studied for association with the targeting molecules two no longer bound to mdm and jnk three mutant forms which exhibit high expression levels showed lower affinity for association with mdm and jnk in concordance with greater affinity to p arf which is among the stabilizing p  molecules monitoring mutant p  stability in vitro confirmed that while certain forms of mutant p  are no longer affected by either jnk or mdm  others are targeted for degradation by jnk mdm  albeit at lower efficiency when compared with wt p  expression of wt p  in tumor cells revealed a short half life suggesting that the targeting molecules are functional forced expression of mutant p  in p  null cells confirmed pattern of association with jnk mdm and prolonged half life as found in the tumor cells over expression of mdm in either tumor which do express endogenous functional mdm  or in p  null cells decreased the stability of mutant p  suggesting that despite its expression mdm jnk are insufficient amount affinity for targeting mutant p  degradation based on both in vitro and in vivo analyses we conclude that the prolonged half life of mutant p  depends on the nature of the mutation which either alters association with targeting molecules ratio between p  and targeting stabilizing molecules or targeting efficiency
