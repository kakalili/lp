effect of serine phosphorylation and ser  phospho mimicking mutations on nuclear localisation and ligand interactions of annexin a
annexin a  anxa  interacts with numerous ligands including calcium lipids mrnas and intracellular and extracellular proteins different post translational modifications participate in the discrimination of the functions of anxa by modulating its ligand interactions here phospho mimicking mutants anxa s e and anxa s d were employed to investigate the effects of ser  phosphorylation on the structure and function of anxa by using anxa s a as a control the overall  helical structure of anxa is not affected by the mutations since the thermal stabilities and aggregation tendencies of the mutants differ only slightly from the wild type wt protein unlike wt anxa  all mutants bind the anxa    untranslated region and    g actin with high affinity in a ca  independent manner anxa s e is not targeted to the nucleus in transfected pc  cells in vitro phosphorylation of anxa by protein kinase c increases its affinity to mrna and inhibits its nuclear localisation in accordance with the data obtained with the phospho mimicking mutants ca  dependent binding of wt anxa to phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol  phosphate phosphatidylinositol  phosphate and phosphatidylinositol  phosphate as well as weaker but still ca  dependent binding to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol   bisphosphate was demonstrated by a protein  lipid overlay assay whereas binding of anxa to these lipids as well as its binding to liposomes is inhibited by the ser  mutations thus introduction of a modification mutation or phosphorylation at ser  appears to induce a conformational change leading to increased accessibility of the mrna and g actin binding sites in domain iv independent of ca  levels while the ca  dependent binding of anxa to phospholipids is attenuated
