predicting large rna like topologies by a knowledge based clustering approach
an analysis and expansion of our resource for classifying predicting and designing rna structures rag rna as graphs  is presented with the goal of understanding features of rna like and non rna like motifs and exploiting this information for rna design rag was first reported in   for cataloging rna secondary structure motifs using graph representations in    the rag resource was updated with the increased availability of rna structures and was improved by utilities for analyzing rna structures including substructuring and search tools we also classified rna structures as graphs up to  vertices    nucleotides into three classes existing rna like and non rna like using clustering approaches here we focus on the tree graphs and evaluate the newly founded rnas since    which also support our refined predictions of rna like motifs we expand the rag resource for large tree graphs up to  vertices    nucleotides  thereby cataloging more than  times as many secondary structures we apply clustering algorithms based on features of rna secondary structures translated from known tertiary structures to suggest which hypothetical large rna motifs can be considered  rna like   the results by the pam partitioning around medoids approach in particular reveal good accuracy with small error for the largest cases the rag update here up to  vertices offers a useful graph based tool for exploring rna motifs and suggesting large rna motifs for design
