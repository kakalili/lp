altered directionality in the cre loxp site specific recombination pathway edited by m yaniv
the site specific recombinase cre must employ control mechanisms to impose directionality on recombination when two recombination sites locus of crossing over in phage p  loxp are placed as direct repeats on the same dna molecule collision between loxp bound cre dimers leads to excision of intervening dna if two sites are placed as inverted repeats the intervening segment is flipped around cre catalyzes these reactions in the absence of protein co factors current models suggest that directionality is controlled at two steps in the recombination pathway the juxtaposition of loxp sites and the single strand transfer reactions within the synaptic complex here we show that in escherichia coli strain   cre directionality for recombination is altered when the expression of cre is increased this leads to deletion instead of inversion on substrates carrying two loxp sites as inverted repeats the nucleotide sequence composition of loxp sites remaining in aberrant products indicates that site alignment and or dna strand transfer in the in vivo cre loxp recombination pathway are not always tightly controlled
