molecular determinants of antibiotic recognition and resistance by aminoglycoside phosphotransferase    iiia a calorimetric and mutational analysis
the growing threat from the emergence of multidrug resistant pathogens highlights a critical need to expand our currently available arsenal of broad spectrum antibiotics in this connection new antibiotics must be developed that exhibit the abilities to circumvent known resistance pathways an important step toward achieving this goal is to define the key molecular interactions that govern antibiotic resistance here we use site specific mutagenesis coupled with calorimetric nmr and enzymological techniques to define the key interactions that govern the binding of the aminoglycoside antibiotics neomycin and kanamycin b to aph    iiia an antibiotic phosphorylating enzyme that confers resistance  our mutational analyses identify the d   e   and c terminal f  residues of the enzyme as being critical for recognition of the two drugs as well as for the manifestation of the resistance phenotype in addition the e  residue is more important for recognition of kanamycin b than neomycin with mutation of this residue partially restoring sensitivity to kanamycin b but not to neomycin by contrast the d  residue partially restores sensitivity to neomycin but not to kanamycin b with the origins of this differential effect being due to the importance of d  for catalyzing the phosphorylation of neomycin these collective mutational results coupled with  n nmr derived pka and calorimetrically derived binding linked drug protonation data identify the     and   amino groups of both neomycin and kanamycin b as being critical functionalities for binding to aph    iiia these drug amino functionalities represent potential sites of modification in the design of next generation compounds that can overcome aph    iiia induced resistance
