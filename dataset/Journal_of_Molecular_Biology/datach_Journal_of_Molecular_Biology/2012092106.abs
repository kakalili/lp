the brace for a growing scaffold mss  protein promotes rna folding by stabilizing an early assembly intermediate
the ai  group ii intron requires a protein cofactor to facilitate native folding in the cell yeast protein mss  greatly accelerates intron folding under near physiological conditions both in vivo and in vitro although the effect of mss  on the kinetics of ai  ribozyme folding and catalysis has been extensively studied the precise structural role and interaction sites of mss  have been elusive using nucleotide analog interference mapping to study the folding of splicing precursor constructs we have identified specific intron functional groups that participate in mss  facilitated folding and we have determined their role in the folding mechanism the data indicate that mss  stabilizes an early obligate folding intermediate within intron domain  thereby laying the foundation for productive folding to the native state in addition the data reveal an important role for the ibs exon sequence and for the terminus of domain  during the folding of self splicing group iib intron constructs
