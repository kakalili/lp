the crystal structure of human   tryptase reveals a blocked substrate binding region
human mast cell tryptases represent a subfamily of trypsin like serine proteinases implicated in asthma unlike  tryptases   tryptases apparently are proteolytically inactive we have solved the    crystal structure of mature human   tryptase it reveals a frame like tetrameric architecture that surprisingly does not require heparin binding for stability in marked contrast to   tryptase the ser  gly  segment which normally provides the template for substrate binding is kinked in  tryptase thereby blocking its non primed subsites this so far unobserved subsite distortion is incompatible with productive substrate binding and processing   tryptase apparently is trapped in this off conformation by repulsions and attractions of the asp  side chain however proteolytic activity could be generated by an induced fit mechanism
