ligand binding induces a conformational change in ifnar that is propagated to its membrane proximal domain
the type i interferon ifn receptor plays a key role in innate immunity against viral and bacterial infections here we show by intramolecular f rster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy that ligand binding induces substantial conformational changes in the ectodomain of ifnar  ifnar ec  binding of ifn  and ifn  induce very similar conformations of ifnar  which were confirmed by single particle electron microscopy analysis of the ternary complexes formed by ifn  or ifn  with the two receptor subunits ifnar ec and ifnar ec photo induced electron transfer based fluorescence quenching and single molecule fluorescence lifetime measurements revealed that the ligand induced conformational change in the membrane distal domains of ifnar ec is propagated to its membrane proximal domain which is not involved in ligand recognition but is essential for signal activation temperature dependent ligand binding studies as well as stopped flow fluorescence experiments corroborated a multistep conformational change in ifnar upon ligand binding our results thus suggest that the relatively intricate architecture of the type i ifn receptor complex is designed to propagate the ligand binding event to and possibly even across the membrane by conformational changes
