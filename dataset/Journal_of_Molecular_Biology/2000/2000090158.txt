The identification of specific amino acid residues involved in protein-protein interaction is fundamental to understanding structure-function relationships. Supported by mathematical calculations, we designed a high-density mutagenesis procedure for the generation of a mutant library of which a limited number of random clones would suffice to exactly localize amino acid residues essential for a particular protein-protein interaction. This goal was achieved experimentally by consecutive cycles of DNA shuffling, under error prone conditions, each followed by exposure of the target protein on the surface of phages to screen and select for correctly folded, functional mutants. To validate the procedure, human plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) was chosen, because its 3D structure is known, many experimental tools are available and it may serve as a model protein for structure-function studies of serine proteinases and their inhibitors (serpins). After five cycles of DNA shuffling and selection for t-PA binding, analysis of 27 randomly picked clones revealed that PAI-1 mutants contained an average of 9.1 amino acid substitutions distributed over 114 different positions, which were preferentially located at the surface of the protein. This limited collection of mutant PAI-1 preparations contained multiple mutants defective in binding to three out of four tested anti-PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies. Alignment of the nucleotide sequence of defective clones permitted assignment of single dominant amino acid residues for binding to each monoclonal antibody. The importance of these residues was confirmed by testing the properties of single point mutants. From the position of these amino acid residues in the 3D structure of PAI-1 and the effects of the corresponding monoclonal antibodies on t-PA-PAI-1 interaction, conclusions can be drawn with respect to this serpin-serine proteinase interaction.
