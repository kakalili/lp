the solution structure and dna binding properties of the cold shock domain of the human y box protein yb  edited by p e wright
the human y box protein  yb  is a member of the y box protein family a class of proteins involved in transcriptional and translational regulation of a wide range of genes here we report the solution structure of the cold shock domain csd of yb  which is thought to be responsible for nucleic acid binding it is the first structure solved of a eukaryotic member of the cold shock protein family and consists of a closed five stranded anti parallel  barrel capped by a long flexible loop the structure of csd is similar to the ob fold and a comparison with bacterial cold shock proteins shows that its structural properties are conserved from bacteria to man our data suggest the presence of a dna binding site consisting of a patch of positively charged and aromatic residues on the surface of the  barrel further it is shown that csd which has a preference for binding single stranded pyrimidine rich sequences binds weakly and hardly specifically to dna binding affinities reported for intact yb  indicate that domains other than the csd play a role in dna binding of yb
