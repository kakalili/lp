biochemical characterization of the structure specific dna binding protein cmb from schizosaccharomyces pombe edited by r huber
cmb  a novel hmg box protein from schizosaccharomyces pombe has been characterized biochemically using glutaraldehyde cross linking gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation it was identified as a monomeric non spherical protein with a tendency to aggregate in solution limited proteolysis with trypsin and chymotrypsin showed that the c terminal hmg box was a compact proteolytically stable domain and the n terminal region of cmb was relatively unstructured and more easily digested as cmb was previously identified as a potential mismatch binding protein the binding constants and stoichiometry for both homoduplex and heteroduplex dna were determined using an iasys resonant mirror biosensor cmb indeed demonstrated a tighter association with mismatched dna especially with the c  mismatch expression constructs of cmb were made to study the sections of the protein involved in dna binding constructs with the n terminal region absent revealed that the c terminal hmg box was the primary dna binding region the presence of the n terminal region did however facilitate tighter binding to both homoduplex and heteroduplex dna the amino acid residues isoleucine  and leucine  were located as putative intercalating residues using structure guided homology modelling the model templates were derived from two distinct hmg dna complexes hmg d bound to homoduplex dna and hmg  bound to cisplatin dna binding studies using the cmb hmg box with point mutations in these residues showed that isoleucine  was important for the binding of cmb to homoduplex dna but affected binding to mismatches to a lesser extent in contrast leucine  appeared to have a more significant function in binding to mismatched dna
