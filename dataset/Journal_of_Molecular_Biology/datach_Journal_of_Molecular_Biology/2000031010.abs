microsecond to minute dynamics revealed by ex type hydrogen exchange at nearly every backbone hydrogen bond in a native protein edited by p e wright
a previous comprehensive analysis of the ph dependence of native state amide hydrogen nh exchange in turkey ovomucoid third domain omtky  yielded apparent opening and closing rate constants kop and kcl at  nh groups involved in global conformational changes this analysis has been extended to  additional slowly exchanging nh groups quench flow experiments were performed to monitor nh exchange in native omtky from neutral to very alkaline ph     conditions above ph  the mechanism of exchange switched from one governed by a rapid equilibrium preceding the chemistry of exchange i e ex exchange  to one where exchange was limited by the rate of opening i e ex exchange  kinetics of solvent exposure are now known for nearly all backbone nh groups in native omtky  yielding rate constants that span five orders of magnitude    to   s
