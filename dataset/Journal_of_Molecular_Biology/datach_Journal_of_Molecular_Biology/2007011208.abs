molecular determination by electron microscopy of the actin filament end structure
in eukaryotic cells actin filaments play various crucial roles by altering their spatial and temporal distributions in the cell the distribution of actin filaments is regulated by the binding of end binding proteins including capping protein capz in muscle  the arp  complex gelsolin formin and tropomodulin to the end of the actin filament in order to determine the nature of these regulations structural elucidations of actin filament  end binding protein complexes are crucially important here we have developed new procedures on the basis of single particle analysis to determine the structure of the end of actin filaments from electron micrographs in these procedures the polarity of the actin filament image as well as the azimuth orientation and the axial position of each actin protomer within a short stretch near the filament end were determined accurately this improved both the stability and accuracy of the structural determination dramatically we tested our procedures by reconstructing structures from simulated filament images which were obtained from  model structures for the actin  capz complex these model structures were generated by random docking of the atomic structure of capz to the barbed end of an atomic model of the actin filament of the  model structures   were recovered correctly by the present procedures we found that our analysis was robust against local aberrations of the helical twist near the end of the actin filament finally the procedures were applied successfully to determine the structure of the actin  capz complex from real cryo electron micrographs of the complex this is the first method for elucidating the detailed d structures at the end of the actin filament
