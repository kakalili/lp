design of peptide based inhibitors of human islet amyloid polypeptide fibrillogenesis
human islet amyloid polypeptide iapp is the major component of amyloid deposits found in the pancreas of over   of all cases of type  diabetes we have generated a series of overlapping hexapeptides to target an amyloidogenic region of iapp residues     and examined their effects on fibril assembly peptide fragments corresponding to snnfga residues     and gailsst residues     were strong inhibitors of the  sheet transition and amyloid aggregation circular dichroism indicated that even at   molar ratios these peptides maintained full length iapp     in a largely random coil conformation negative stain electron microscopy revealed that co incubation of these peptides with iapp resulted in the formation of only semi fibrous aggregates and loss of the typical high density and morphology of iapp fibrils this inhibitory activity particularly for the snnfga sequence also correlated with a reduction in iapp induced cytotoxicity as determined by cell culture studies in contrast the peptide nfgail residues     enhanced iapp fibril formation conversion to the amyloidogenic  sheet was immediate and the accompanying fibrils were more dense and complex than iapp alone the remaining peptide fragments either had no detectable effects or were only weakly inhibitory specificity of peptide activity was illustrated by the fragments ssnnfg and ailsst these differed from the most active inhibitors by only a single amino acid residue but delayed the random to  conformational change only when used at higher molar ratios this study has identified internal iapp peptide fragments which can regulate fibrillogenesis and may be of therapeutic use for the treatment of type  diabetes
