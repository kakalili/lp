evolutionary trace annotation of protein function in the structural proteome
by design structural genomics sg solves many structures that cannot be assigned function based on homology to known proteins alternative function annotation methods are therefore needed and this study focuses on function prediction with three dimensional  d templates small structural motifs built of just a few functionally critical residues although experimentally proven functional residues are scarce we show here that evolutionary trace et rankings of residue importance are sufficient to build d templates match them and then assign gene ontology go functions in enzymes and non enzymes alike in a high specificity mode this evolutionary trace annotation eta method covered half    of the   annotated sg protein controls three quarters    of predictions were both correct and complete the positive predictive value for all go depths all depth ppv was   and it rose to   over go depths    depth  ppv  in a high sensitivity mode coverage rose significantly    while accuracy fell moderately   of predictions were both correct and complete all depth ppv was   and depth  ppv was   these data concur with prior mutational experiments showing that et rank information identifies key functional determinants in proteins in practice eta predicted functions in   of   unannotated sg proteins in   cases  including   non enzymes and  for metal ion ligands  the expected accuracy is   at any go depth and   down to go depth  while for the remaining   the expected accuracies are   and   respectively thus local structural comparisons of evolutionarily important residues can help decipher protein functions to known reliability levels and without prior assumption on functional mechanisms eta is available at http  mammoth bcm tmc edu eta
