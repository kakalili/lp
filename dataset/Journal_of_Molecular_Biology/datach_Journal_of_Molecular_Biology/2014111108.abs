insights into the mechanisms of membrane curvature and vesicle scission by the small gtpase sar in the early secretory pathway
the small gtpase protein sar is known to be involved in both the initiation of copii coated vesicle formation and scission of the nascent vesicle from the endoplasmic reticulum the molecular details for the mechanism of membrane remodeling by sar remain unresolved here we show that sar transforms synthetic liposomes into structures of different morphologies including tubules and detached vesicles we demonstrate that sar alone is competent for vesicle scission in a manner that depends on the concentration of sar molecules occupying the membrane sar molecules align on low curvature membranes to form an extended lattice the continuity of this lattice breaks down as the curvature locally increases the smallest repeating unit constituting the ordered lattice is a sar dimer the three dimensional structure of the sar lattice was reconstructed by substituting spherical liposomes with galactoceramide lipid tubules of homogeneous diameter these data suggest that sar dimerization is responsible for the formation of constrictive membrane curvature we propose a model whereby sar dimers assemble into ordered arrays to promote membrane constriction and copii directed vesicle scission
