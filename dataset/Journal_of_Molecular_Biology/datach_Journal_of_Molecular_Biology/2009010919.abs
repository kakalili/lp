principal component analysis for protein folding dynamics
protein folding is considered here by studying the dynamics of the folding of the triple  strand ww domain from the formin binding protein   starting from the unfolded state and ending either in the native or nonnative conformational states trajectories are generated with the coarse grained united residue unres force field the effectiveness of principal components analysis pca  an already established mathematical technique for finding global correlated motions in atomic simulations of proteins is evaluated here for coarse grained trajectories the problems related to pca and their solutions are discussed the folding and nonfolding of proteins are examined with free energy landscapes detailed analyses of many folding and nonfolding trajectories at different temperatures show that pca is very efficient for characterizing the general folding and nonfolding features of proteins it is shown that the first principal component captures and describes in detail the dynamics of a system anomalous diffusion in the folding nonfolding dynamics is examined by the mean square displacement msd and the fractional diffusion and fractional kinetic equations the collisionless or ballistic behavior of a polypeptide undergoing brownian motion along the first few principal components is accounted for
