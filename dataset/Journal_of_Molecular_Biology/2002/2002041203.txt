Extracellular accumulation of transthyretin (TTR) variants in the form of fibrillar amyloid deposits is the pathological hallmark of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). The TTR Leu55Pro variant occurs in the most aggressive forms of this disease. Inhibition of TTR wild-type (WT) and particularly TTR Leu55Pro fibril formation is of interest as a potential therapeutic strategy and requires a thorough understanding of the fibril assembly mechanism. To this end, we report on the in vitro assembly properties as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) for both TTR WT fibrils produced by acidification, and TTR Leu55Pro fibrils assembled at physiological pH. The morphological features and dimensions of TTR WT and TTR Leu55Pro fibrils were similar, with up to 300 nm long, 8 nm wide fibrils being the most prominent species in both cases. Other species were evident; 4–5 nm wide fibrils, 9–10 nm wide fibrils and oligomers of various sizes. STEM mass-per-length (MPL) measurements revealed discrete fibril types with masses of 9.5 and 14.0(±1.4) KDa/nm for TTR WT fibrils and 13.7, 18.5 and 23.2(±1.5) kDa/nm for TTR Leu55Pro fibrils. These MPL values are consistent with a model in which fibrillar TTR structures are composed of two, three, four or five elementary protofilaments, with each protofilament being a vertical stack of structurally modified TTR monomers assembled with the 2.9 nm axial monomer-monomer spacing indicated by X-ray fibre diffraction data. Ex vivo TTR amyloid fibrils were examined. From their morphological appearance compared to these, the in vitro assembled TTR WT and Leu55Pro fibrils examined may represent immature fibrillar species. The in vitro system operating at physiological pH for TTR Leu55Pro and the model presented for the molecular arrangement of TTR monomers within fibrils may, therefore, describe early fibril assembly events in vivo.
