functional domains of foxj
foxj is a fork head transcriptional activator the expression of which starts very early in embryonic development and it is distributed widely in the adult here we describe the characterization of domains that are important for its function foxj is localized constitutively at the nucleus of the cell two tyrosine residues and a stretch of basic amino acid residues at the n and c terminal ends of the fork head domain respectively are important for its nuclear targeting these residues are conserved strongly among all members of the fork head family suggesting that they could be involved in the nuclear translocation mechanism of all fork head factors in addition to the ab domain we have found at least two other transactivation domains domain i at the n terminus and the h p domain rich in histidine and proline residues although the ab domain shows the strongest transactivation capacity all three domains are required for full foxj transcriptional activity furthermore a fourth region rich in proline and glutamine residues and with no intrinsic transactivation function the p q domain appears to play an important role in the foxj mediated transactivation mechanism although foxj can be phosphorylated in two serine residues this post translational modification did not appear to be essential for transactivation finally we have found that the w wing of the fork head domain of foxj is dispensable for specific dna binding although it could have a weak stabilizing role for the dna  foxj complex
