side chain contributions to membrane protein structure and stability
the molecular forces that stabilize membrane protein structure are poorly understood to investigate these forces we introduced alanine substitutions at  positions in the b helix of bacteriorhodopsin and examined their effects on structure and stability although most of the results can be rationalized in terms of the folded structure there are a number of surprises   we find a remarkably high frequency of stabilizing mutations    indicating that membrane proteins are not highly optimized for stability   helix b is kinked with the kink centered around pro  the p a mutation has no effect on stability however and a crystal structure reveals that the helix remains bent indicating that tertiary contacts dominate in the distortion of this helix   we find that the protein is stabilized by about kcal mol for every    of surface area buried which is quite similar to soluble proteins in spite of their dramatically different environments   we find little energetic difference on average in the burial of apolar surface or polar surface area implying that van der waals packing is the dominant force that drives membrane protein folding
