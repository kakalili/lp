cytochrome p  s and short chain dehydrogenases mediate the toxicogenomic response of pcb  in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans
although non coplanar pcbs are ubiquitous organic chemicals known to induce numerous biological responses and thus are toxic to man and wildlife little is known about the toxic mode of action using pcb  an ortho substituted        tetrachlorobiphenyl it was possible to pinpoint the relationship between induced gene expression and observed toxicity in the model nematode caenorhabditis elegans on the basis of the calculated ec  for brood size   mg l  whole genome dna microarray experiments were performed to identify differentially expressed genes gene knockdown by rnai was used to determine the consequences in reproductive fitness in the presence and in the absence of pcb  on the basis of altered phenotype several gene classes were identified to have a pivotal role in pcb  toxicogenesis most notably cytochrome p  s short chain dehydrogenases and lipases in addition to this four of six selected cytochrome p  s were shown to be involved in fat storage with pcb  exposure increasing the fat content in n wild type as indicated by staining with nile red furthermore exposure to pcb  induces a general detoxification response via small heat shock proteins and caspases our data provide strong evidence of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the toxicity of non coplanar pcbs and confirms that despite the ability to metabolize pcb alterations in lipid metabolism and storage are major factors that drive the toxic effect of pcb
