rhesus monkey trim  spry domain recognizes multiple epitopes that span several capsid monomers on the surface of the hiv  mature viral core
the restriction factor trim  binds to the capsid protein of the retroviral core and blocks retroviral replication the affinity of trim  for the capsid is a major host tropism determinant of hiv and other primate immunodeficiency viruses but the molecular interface involved in this host  pathogen interaction remains poorly characterized here we use nmr spectroscopy to investigate binding of the rhesus trim  spry domain to a selection of hiv capsid constructs the data are consistent with a model in which one spry domain interacts with more than one capsid monomer within the assembled retroviral core the highly mobile spry v loop appears to span the gap between neighboring capsid hexamers making interhexamer contacts critical for restriction the interaction interface is extensive involves mobile loops and multiple epitopes and lacks interaction hot spots these properties which may enhance resistance of trim  to capsid mutations result in relatively low affinity of the individual spry domains for the capsid and the trim  mediated restriction depends on the avidity effect arising from the oligomerization of trim
