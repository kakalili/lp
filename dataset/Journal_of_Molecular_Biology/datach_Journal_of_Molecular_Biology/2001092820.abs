unusual molecular architecture of the yersinia pestis cytotoxin yopm a leucine rich repeat protein with the shortest repeating unit edited by r huber
many gram negative bacterial pathogens employ a contact dependent type iii secretion system to deliver effector proteins into the cytosol of animal or plant cells collectively these effectors enable the bacteria to evade the immune response of the infected organism by modulating host cell functions yopm a member of the leucine rich repeat protein superfamily is an effector produced by the bubonic plague bacterium yersinia pestis that is essential for virulence here we report crystal structures of yopm at   and    resolution among all leucine rich repeat family members whose atomic coordinates have been reported the repeating unit of yopm has the least canonical secondary structure in both crystals four yopm monomers form a hollow cylinder with an inner diameter of    the domain that targets yopm for translocation into eukaryotic cells adopts a well ordered   helical conformation that packs tightly against the proximal leucine rich repeat module a similar  helical domain can be identified in virulence associated leucine rich repeat proteins produced by salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri and in the conceptual translation products of several open reading frames in y pestis
