proline residues in transmembrane  helices affect the folding of bacteriorhodopsin edited by a r fersht
proline residues occur frequently in transmembrane  helices which contrasts with their behaviour as helix breakers in water soluble proteins the three membrane embedded proline residues of bacteriorhodopsin have been replaced individually by alanine and glycine to give p a or p g on helix b p a or p g on helix c and p  a or p  g on helix f and the effect on the protein folding kinetics has been investigated the rate limiting apoprotein folding step which results in formation of a seven transmembrane   helical state was slower than wild type protein for the pro  and pro  mutants regardless of whether they were mutated to ala or gly these proline residues give rise to several inter helix contacts which are therefore important in folding to the seven transmembrane helix state no evidence for cis trans isomerisations of the peptidyl prolyl bonds was found during this rate limiting apoprotein folding step mutations of all three membrane embedded proline residues affected the subsequent retinal binding and final folding to bacteriorhodopsin suggesting that these proline residues contribute to formation of the retinal binding pocket within the helix bundle again via helix helix interactions these results point to proline residues in transmembrane  helices being important in the folding of integral membrane proteins the helix helix interactions and hydrogen bonds that arise from the presence of proline residues in transmembrane  helices can affect the formation of transmembrane  helix bundles as well as cofactor binding pockets
