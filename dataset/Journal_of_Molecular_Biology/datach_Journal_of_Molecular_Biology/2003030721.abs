improving the thermodynamic stability of the leucine zipper of max increases the stability of its b hlh lz e box complex
max is a member of the b hlh lz basic region helix loop helix leucine zipper family of eukaryotic transcription factors it is the obligate partner of the related b hlh lz proteins c myc and mad  with which it forms heterodimers on target dna while c myc and mad require max for dna binding max itself can form a homodimer that recognizes e box dna sequences cacgtg in gene promoters that are targeted by c myc evidence suggests that this mode of binding by max may repress c myc transcriptional activity and this may have applications in the control of the aberrant activity of c myc during certain oncogenic transformations to enhance this repressive potential of max we sought to stabilize max homodimers we have designed a double mutant n v h l located in the coiled coil interface of the leucine zipper domain and we demonstrate that these mutations do indeed increase the stability of the protein the mutations also improve the stability of the complex with cognate dna thermal denaturations monitored by circular dichroism reveal two transitions that are due to intermediate folding states for both the wild type and mutant proteins this is supported by detailed thermodynamic analyses a formalism to characterize the temperature dependence of the unfolding including the effect of intermediates is presented
