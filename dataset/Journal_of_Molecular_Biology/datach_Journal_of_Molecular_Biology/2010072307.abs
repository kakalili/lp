an alternative conformation of the t cell receptor  constant region
t cell receptors tcrs play a central role in cellular immune response they are members of the ig superfamily with extracellular regions of the  and  chains each comprising a v type domain and a c type domain we have determined the ectodomain structure of an   tcr which recognizes the autoantigen myelin basic protein the    resolution structure reveals canonical main chain conformations for the v  v  and c  domains but the c  domain exhibits a main chain conformation remarkably different from those previously reported for tcr crystal structures the global igc like fold is maintained but a piston like rearrangement between bc and de  turns results in  strand slippage this substantial conformational change may represent a signaling intermediate our structure is the first example for the ig fold of the increasingly recognized concept of  metamorphic proteins
