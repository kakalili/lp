structural insights into the lipase esterase behavior in the candida rugosa lipases family crystal structure of the lipase  isoenzyme at    resolution
the yeast candida rugosa produces several closely related extracellular lipases that differ in their substrate specificity here we report the crystal structure of the isoenzyme lipase  at    resolution in its closed conformation lipase  shows a    amino acid sequence identity with lipase  and    with lipase  which makes it relevant to compare these three isoenzymes despite this high level of sequence identity structural comparisons reveal several amino acid changes affecting the flap residue   the substrate binding pocket residues     and   and the mouth of the hydrophobic tunnel residues   and    which may be responsible for the different substrate specificity and catalytic properties of this group of enzymes also these comparisons reveal two distinct regions in the hydrophobic tunnel a phenylalanyl rich region and an aliphatic rich region whereas this last region is essentially identical in the three isoenzymes the phenylalanyl content in the first one is specific for each lipase resulting in a different environment of the catalytic triad residues which probably tunes finely their lipase esterase character the greater structural similarity observed between the monomeric form of lipase  and lipase  concerning the above mentioned key residues led us to propose a significant esterase activity for this last protein this enzymatic activity has been confirmed with biochemical experiments using cholesteryl   c oleate as substrate surprisingly lipase  is a more efficient esterase than lipase  showing a twofold specific activity against cholesteryl   c oleate in our experimental conditions these results show that subtle amino acid changes within a highly conserved protein fold may produce protein variants endowed with new enzymatic properties
