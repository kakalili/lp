enzymatic catalysis in crystals of escherichia coli maltodextrin phosphorylase
the bacterial enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase malp catalyses the phosphorolysis of an    glycosidic bond in maltodextrins removing the non reducing glucosyl residues of linear oligosaccharides as glucose  phosphate glc p  in contrast to the well studied muscle glycogen phosphorylase gp  malp exhibits no allosteric properties and has a higher affinity for linear oligosaccharides than gp we have used malp as a model system to study catalysis in the crystal in the direction of maltodextrin synthesis the    crystal structure of the malp glc p binary complex shows that the glc p substrate adopts a conformation seen previously with both inactive and active forms of mammalian gp with the phosphate group not in close contact with the   phosphate group of the essential pyridoxal phosphate plp cofactor in the active malp enzyme the residue arg  stabilizes the negative charged glc p whereas in the inactive form of gp this key residue is held away from the catalytic site by loop  s and an allosteric transition of the mammalian enzyme is required for activation the comparison between malp structures shows that his   through a hydrogen bond with the  hydroxyl group of glc p substrate triggers a conformational change of the  s loop this mobile region folds over the catalytic site and contributes to the specific recognition of the oligosaccharide and to the synergism between substrates in promoting the formation of the malp ternary complex the structures solved after the diffusion of oligosaccharides either maltotetraose g or maltopentaose g  into malp glc p crystals show the formation of phosphate and elongation of the oligosaccharide chain these structures refined at    and at    confirm that only when an oligosaccharide is bound to the catalytic site will glc p bend its phosphate group down so it can contact the plp   phosphate group and promote catalysis the relatively large oligosaccharide substrates can diffuse quickly into the malp glc p crystals and the enzymatic reaction can occur without significant crystal damage these structures obtained before and after catalysis have been used as frames of a molecular movie this movie reveals the relative positions of substrates in the catalytic channel and shows a minimal movement of the protein involving mainly arg   which tracks the substrate phosphate group
