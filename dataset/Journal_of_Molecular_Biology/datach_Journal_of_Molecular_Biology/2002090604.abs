structural basis for ampa receptor activation and ligand selectivity crystal structures of five agonist complexes with the glur ligand binding core
glutamate is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter within the mammalian cns playing an important role in many different functions in the brain such as learning and memory in this study a combination of molecular biology x ray structure determinations as well as electrophysiology and binding experiments has been used to increase our knowledge concerning the ionotropic glutamate receptor glur at the molecular level five high resolution x ray structures of the ligand binding domain of glur  s s j complexed with the three agonists s  amino   hydroxy   methyl h tetrazol  yl isoxazol  yl propionic acid  me tet ampa  s  amino   carboxy  methylisoxazol  yl propionic acid acpa  and s  amino   bromo  hydroxy isoxazol  yl propionic acid br hibo  as well as of a mutant thereof s s j y  f in complex with acpa and br hibo have been determined the structures reveal that ampa agonists with an isoxazole moiety adopt different binding modes in the receptor dependent on the substituents of the isoxazole br hibo displays selectivity among different ampa receptor subunits and the design and structure determination of the s s j y  f mutant in complex with br hibo and acpa have allowed us to explain the molecular mechanism behind this selectivity and to identify key residues for ligand recognition the agonists induce the same degree of domain closure as ampa except for br hibo which shows a slightly lower degree of domain closure an excellent correlation between domain closure and efficacy has been obtained from electrophysiology experiments undertaken on non desensitising glur i q l  y receptors expressed in oocytes providing strong evidence that receptor activation occurs as a result of domain closure the structural results combined with the functional studies on the full length receptor form a powerful platform for the design of new selective agonists
