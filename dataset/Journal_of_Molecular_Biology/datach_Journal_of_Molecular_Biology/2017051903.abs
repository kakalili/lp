derepression of sapibov is independent of  nm type  dutpase activity and is inhibited by dutp and dump
staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic human pathogen able to transfer virulence genes to other cells through the mobilization of s aureus pathogenicity islands sapis  sapis are derepressed and packaged into phage like transducing particles by helper phages like   or  nm  phages   and  nm encode structurally distinct dutpases dut   type  and dutnm  type   both dutpases can interact with the sapibov stl master repressor leading to derepression and mobilization that two structurally distinct dutpases bind the same repressor led us to speculate that dutpase activity may be important to the derepression process in type  dutpases stl binding is inhibited by dutp the purpose of this study was to assess the involvement of dutp binding and dutpase activity in derepression by dutnm  dutnm activity mutants were created and tested for dutpase activity using a novel nmr based assay we found that all dutnm null activity mutants interacted with the sapibov stl c terminal domain formed dutnm  stl heterodimers and caused the release of the pstr promoter however promoter release was inhibited in the presence of dutp or dump we tested two  nm mutant phages that had null enzyme activity and found that they could still mobilize sapibov  these results show that only the apo form of dutnm is active in stl derepression and that dutpase activity is not necessary for the mobilization of sapibov by dutnm
