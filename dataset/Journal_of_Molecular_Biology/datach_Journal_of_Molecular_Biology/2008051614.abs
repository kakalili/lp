improvement of an antibody neutralizing the anthrax toxin by simultaneous mutagenesis of its six hypervariable loops
the enhancement of antibody affinity by mutagenesis targeting only complementarity determining regions has the advantage of respecting the framework regions which are important for tolerance if clinical use is envisaged here starting from a fab antigen binding fragment  pa  capable of neutralizing the lethal toxin of anthrax and having an affinity of   nm for its antigen a phage displayed library of variants where all six complementarity determining regions   positions were targeted for mutagenesis was built this library contained    variants and each variant carried four mutations on average the library was first panned with adsorbed antigen and washes of increasing stringency it was then screened in parallel with either small concentrations of soluble biotinylated antigen or adsorbed antigen and long elution times in the presence of soluble antigen the stringencies of both selections were pushed as far as possible compared with  pa  the best selected clone had an affinity enhanced  fold to   pm and its   inhibitory concentration was decreased by   the results of the two selection methods were compared and the generality of these methods was considered
