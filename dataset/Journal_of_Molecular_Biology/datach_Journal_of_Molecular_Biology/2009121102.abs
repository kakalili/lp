a conserved unfoldase activity for the p  aaa atpase in proteasomal degradation
the multifunctional aaa atpase p  is one of the most abundant and conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells the p  npl ufd complex dislocates proteins that fail the protein quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol where they are subject to degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome system substrate dislocation depends on the unfoldase activity of p  interestingly p  is also involved in the degradation of specific soluble proteasome substrates but the exact mode of action of p  in this process is unclear here we show that both the central pore and atpase activity of p  are necessary for the degradation of cytosolic ubiquitin fusion substrates addition of a flexible extended c terminal peptide to the substrate relieves the requirement for p  deletion mapping reveals a conserved length dependency of  residues for the peptide which allows p  independent degradation to occur our results suggest that initiation of unfolding may be more complex than previously anticipated and that the  s regulatory complex of the proteasome can require preprocessing of highly folded ubiquitylated substrates by the p ufd npl complex our data provide an explanation for the observation that p  is only essential for a subpopulation of soluble substrates and predict that a common characteristic of soluble p  dependent substrates is the lack of an initiation site to facilitate unfolding by the  s proteasome
