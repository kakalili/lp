the muscle ankyrin repeat proteins carp ankrd arpp and darp as a family of titin filament based stress response molecules
carp ankrd  arpp and darp are three members of a conserved gene family referred to here as marps muscle ankyrin repeat proteins  the expression of marps is induced upon injury and hypertrophy carp  stretch or denervation ankrd arpp  and during recovery following starvation darp  suggesting that they are involved in muscle stress response pathways here we show that marp family members contain within their ankyrin repeat region a binding site for the myofibrillar elastic protein titin within the myofibril marps myopalladin and the calpain protease p  appear to be components of a titin n a based signaling complex ultrastructural studies demonstrated that all three endogenous marp proteins co localize with i band titin n a epitopes in adult heart muscle tissues in cultured fetal rat cardiac myocytes passive stretch induced differential distribution patterns of carp and darp staining for both proteins was increased in the nucleus and at the i band region of myofibrils while darp staining also increased at intercalated discs we speculate that the myofibrillar marps are regulated by stretch and that this links titin n a based myofibrillar stress strain signals to a marp based regulation of muscle gene expression
