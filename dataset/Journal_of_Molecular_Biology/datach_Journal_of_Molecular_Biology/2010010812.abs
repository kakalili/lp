specificity of hexim and hexim complex formation with cyclin t t  importin  and sk snrna
positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb stimulates the transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation by phosphorylation of the c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii p tefb consists of the cyclin dependent kinase cdk and a t type cyclin and is regulated by the small nuclear rna sk and the coupling protein hexim or hexim  in this study we analyzed the tripartite protein  rna complex formation between hexim cyclin t and sk snrna using isothermal titration calorimetry we observed higher affinities for cyclin t hexim and cyclin t hexim complex formations compared with the interactions in reverse importin   which is part of the ran mediated nuclear import pathway bound hexim and hexim with dissociation constants of   and    m respectively furthermore tripartite complex formations between cyclin t hexim and importin  showed the suitability of a collaborative nuclear import pathway for cyclin t electrophoretic mobility shift assays using radioactively labelled full length sk snrna revealed a tight association of the rna to cyclin t  hexim with dissociation constants lower than    m similar binding affinities were recorded for both hexim orthologues to a  mer double stranded   hairpin loop encompassing nucleotides     of sk while a  mer fragment resulting from different rna folding predictions did not bind as tightly these results provide the molecular basis for the generation of a core complex for the inhibition of p tefb
