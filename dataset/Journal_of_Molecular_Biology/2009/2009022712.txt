Experiments dedicated to gaining an understanding of the mechanism underlying the orderly, sequential association of elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and elongation factor G (EF-G) with the ribosome during protein synthesis were undertaken. The binding of one EF is always followed by the binding of the other, despite the two sharing the same—or a largely overlapping—site and despite the two having isosteric structures. Aminoacyl-tRNA, peptidyl-tRNA, and deacylated-tRNA were bound in various combinations to the A-site, P-site, or E-site of ribosomes, and their effect on conformation in the peptidyl transferase center, the GTPase-associated center, and the sarcin/ricin domain (SRD) was determined. In addition, the effect of the ribosome complexes on sensitivity to the ribotoxins sarcin and pokeweed antiviral protein and on the binding of EF-G•GTP were assessed. The results support the following conclusions: the EF-Tu ternary complex binds to the A-site whenever it is vacant and the P-site has peptidyl-tRNA; and association of the EF-Tu ternary complex is prevented, simply by steric hindrance, when the A-site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA. On the other hand, the affinity of the ribosome for EF-G•GTP is increased when peptidyl-tRNA is in the A-site, and the increase is the result of a conformational change in the SRD. We propose that peptidyl-tRNA in the A-site is an effector that initiates a series of changes in tertiary interactions between nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center, the SRD, and the GTPase-associated center of 23S rRNA; and that the signal, transmitted through a transduction pathway, informs the ribosome of the position of peptidyl-tRNA and leads to a conformational change in the SRD that favors binding of EF-G.
