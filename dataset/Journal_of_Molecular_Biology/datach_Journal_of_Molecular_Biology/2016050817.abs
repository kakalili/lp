regulation of autophagy by signaling through the atg ulk complex
autophagy is an intracellular degradation pathway highly conserved in eukaryotic species it is characterized by selective or bulk trafficking of cytosolic structures  ranging from single proteins to cell organelles  to the vacuole or a lysosome in which the autophagic cargo is degraded autophagy fulfils a large set of roles including nutrient mobilization in starvation conditions clearance of protein aggregates and host defence against intracellular pathogens not surprisingly autophagy has been linked to several human diseases among them neurodegenerative disorders and cancer autophagy is coordinated by the action of the atg ulk kinase which is the target of several important stress signaling cascades in this review we will discuss the available information on both upstream regulation and downstream effectors of atg ulk  with special focus on reported and proposed kinase substrates
