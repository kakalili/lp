functional group requirements in the probable active site of the vs ribozyme
the vs ribozyme catalyses the site specific cleavage of a phosphodiester linkage by a transesterification reaction that entails the attack of the neighbouring   oxygen with departure of the   oxygen we have previously suggested that the a  loop is an important component of the active site of the ribozyme and that a  is especially important in the cleavage reaction functional group modification experiments reported here indicate that the base of a  is more important than its ribose for catalysis a number of changes to the base including complete ablation lead to cleavage rates that are reduced   fold while removal of the   hydroxyl group from the ribose results in tenfold slower cleavage  aminopurine fluorescence experiments indicate that this   hydroxyl group is important for the structure of the a  loop catalytic activity is especially sensitive to changes involving the exocyclic amine of a   by contrast the cleavage activity is only weakly sensitive to modification at the  position of the purine nucleus these results suggest that the watson  crick edge of the adenine base is important in ribozyme function we sought to test the possibility of a direct role of the nucleobase in the chemistry of the cleavage reaction addition of imidazole base in the medium failed to restore the activity of a ribozyme from which the nucleobase of a  was removed however no restoration was obtained with exogenous adenine base either indicating that the cavity that might result from ablation of the base was closed
