Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF5A promotes protein synthesis by resolving polyproline-induced ribosomal stalling. Here, we report a 3.25-Å resolution crystal structure of eIF5A bound to the yeast 80S ribosome. The structure reveals a previously unseen conformation of an eIF5A–ribosome complex and highlights a possible functional link between conformational changes of the ribosome during protein synthesis and the eIF5A–ribosome association.
