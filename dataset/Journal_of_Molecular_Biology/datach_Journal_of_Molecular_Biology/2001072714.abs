solution structure of the pseudoknot of srv  rna involved in ribosomal frameshifting edited by i tinoco
rna pseudoknots play important roles in many biological processes in the simian retrovirus type  srv  a pseudoknot together with a heptanucleotide slippery sequence are responsible for programmed ribosomal frameshifting a translational recoding mechanism used to control expression of the gag pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open reading frames here we present the three dimensional structure of the srv  pseudoknot determined by nmr the structure has a classical h type fold and forms a triple helix by interactions between loop  and the minor groove of stem  involving base base and base sugar interactions and a ribose zipper motif not identified in pseudoknots so far further stabilization is provided by a stack of five adenine bases and a uracil in loop  enforcing a cytidine to bulge the two stems of the pseudoknot stack upon each other demonstrating that a pseudoknot without an intercalated base at the junction can induce efficient frameshifting results of mutagenesis data are explained in context with the present three dimensional structure the two base pairs at the junction of stem  and  have a helical twist of approximately    allowing proper alignment and close approach of the three different strands at the junction in addition to the overwound junction the structure is somewhat kinked between stem  and  assisting the single adenosine in spanning the major groove of stem  geometrical models are presented that reveal the importance of the magnitude of the helical twist at the junction in determining the overall architecture of classical pseudoknots in particular related to the opening of the minor groove of stem  and the orientation of stem  which determines the number of loop  nucleotides that span its major groove
