dna stretching and extreme kinking in the nucleosome core
dna stretching in chromatin may facilitate its compaction and influence site recognition by nuclear factors in vivo stretching has been estimated to occur at the equivalent of one to two base pairs bp per nucleosome we have determined the crystal structure of a nucleosome core particle containing   bp of dna ncp   compared to the structure with   bp the ncp  displays two incidences of stretching one to two double helical turns from the particle dyad axis the stretching illustrates clearly a mechanism for shifting dna position by displacement of a single base pair while maintaining nearly identical histone  dna interactions increased dna twist localized to a short section between adjacent histone dna binding sites advances the rotational setting while a translational component involves dna kinking at a flanking region that initiates elongation by unstacking bases furthermore one stretched region of the ncp  displays an extraordinary   kink into the minor groove situated   double helical turns from the particle dyad axis a hot spot for gene insertion by hiv integrase which prefers highly distorted substrate this suggests that nucleosome position and context within chromatin could promote extreme dna kinking that may influence genomic processes
