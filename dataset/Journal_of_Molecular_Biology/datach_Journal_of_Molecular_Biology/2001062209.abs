the alternatively folded state of the antibody ch domain edited by r huber
the ch domain of antibodies is characterized by two antiparallel  sheets forming a disulfide linked sandwich like structure at acidic ph values and low ionic strength ch becomes completely unfolded the addition of salt transforms the acid unfolded protein into an alternatively folded state exhibiting a characteristic secondary structure the transition from native to alternatively folded ch is a fast reaction interestingly this reaction involves the formation of a defined oligomer consisting of    subunits association is completely reversible and the native dimer is quantitatively reformed at neutral ph this alternatively folded protein is remarkably stable against thermal and chemical denaturation and the unfolding transitions are highly cooperative with a tm of   c the stability of the alternatively folded state is comparable to that of the native state of ch  the defined oligomeric structure of ch at ph  seems to be a prerequisite for the cooperative unfolding transitions
