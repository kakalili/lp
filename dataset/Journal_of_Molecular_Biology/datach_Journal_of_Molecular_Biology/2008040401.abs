sea domain autoproteolysis accelerated by conformational strain energetic aspects
a subclass of proteins with the sea sea urchin sperm protein enterokinase and agrin domain fold exists as heterodimers generated by autoproteolytic cleavage within a characteristic g  s vvv sequence autoproteolysis occurs by a nucleophilic attack of the serine hydroxyl on the vicinal glycine carbonyl followed by an n  o acyl shift and hydrolysis of the resulting ester the reaction has been suggested to be accelerated by the straining of the scissile peptide bond upon protein folding in an accompanying article we report the mechanism in this article we provide further key evidence and account for the energetics of coupled protein folding and autoproteolysis cleavage of the gpr  domain and that of the muc sea domain occur with half life t  values of  and   min respectively with lowering of the free energy of the activation barrier by    kcal mol   compared with uncatalyzed hydrolysis the free energies of unfolding of the gpr  and muc sea domains were measured to    and    kcal mol   respectively but    kcal mol   of conformational energy is partitioned as strain over the scissile peptide bond in the precursor to catalyze autoproteolysis by substrate destabilization a straining energy of    kcal mol   was measured by using both a pre equilibrium model to analyze stability and cleavage kinetics data obtained with the gpr  sea domain destabilized by core mutations or urea addition as well as the difference in thermodynamic stabilities of the muc sea precursor mutant s  a with a g  a vvv motif and the wild type protein the results imply that cleavage by n  o acyl shift alone would proceed with a t  of     years which is too slow to be biochemically effective a subsequent review of structural data on other self cleaving proteins suggests that conformational strain of the scissile peptide bond may be a common mechanism of autoproteolysis
