structural and immunological characterisation of heteroclitic peptide analogues corresponding to the      region of the hiv envelope gp  glycoprotein
the conformational and immunological properties of different analogues corresponding to the      disulfide loop of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv gp  glycoprotein envelope were studied fourteen analogues were designed and synthesised namely a series of seven analogues in which the disulfide bond was replaced by a lactam bridge and a series of seven analogues in which one residue of each analogue at a time was replaced by its corresponding homologised  amino acid   amino acid  in the case of the lactam analogues the influence of the two possible co  nh and nh  co orientations of the lactam bridge as well as the size of the lactam ring was explored the analogues were tested in elisa with monoclonal antibodies raised against the      cyclic parent peptide as well as with sera from hiv  infected patients a structural analysis of the parent and analogue peptides was carried out in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso d  using two dimensional nmr techniques and molecular dynamics simulations comparison of the own conformation of the cyclic analogues with their either strong or weak reactivity with the antibodies reveals structural features that may be correlated with the antibody reactivity thus a close structural similarity particularly a characteristic orientation of the side chains of residues lys   leu  and ile  in the loop was found in certain   analogues that were better recognised than the parent peptide by anti peptide mouse monoclonal antibodies and patients antibodies
