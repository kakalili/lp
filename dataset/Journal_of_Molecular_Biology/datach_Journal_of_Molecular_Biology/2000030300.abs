the structural basis for enhanced stability and reduced dna binding seen in engineered second generation cro monomers and dimers edited by t richmond
it was previously shown that the cro repressor from phage   which is a dimer can be converted into a stable monomer by a five amino acid insertion phe  is the key residue involved in this transition switching from interactions which stabilize the dimer to those which stabilize the monomer structural studies however suggested that phe  did not penetrate into the core of the monomer as well as it did into the native dimer this was strongly supported by the finding that certain core repacking mutations including in particular phe   trp increased the stability of the monomer unexpectedly the same substitution also increased the stability of the native dimer at the same time it decreased the affinity of the dimer for operator dna here we describe the crystal structures of the cro f w mutant both as the monomer and as the dimer the f w monomer crystallized in a form different from that of the original monomer in contrast to that structure which resembled the dna bound form of cro the f w monomer is closer in structure to wild type i e non bound cro the f w dimer also crystallizes in a form different from the native dimer but has a remarkably similar overall structure which tends to confirm the large changes in conformation of cro on binding dna introduction of trp  perturbs the position occupied by the side chain of arg  a dna contact residue providing a structural explanation for the reduction in dna binding affinity the improved thermal stability is seen to be due to the enhanced solvent transfer free energy of trp  relative to phe  supplemented in the dimer structure although not the monomer by a reduction in volume of internal cavities
