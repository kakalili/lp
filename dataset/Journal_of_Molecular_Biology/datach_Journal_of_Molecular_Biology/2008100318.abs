structure and dynamics of the p protein from the bacteriophage
cystoviruses are a class of enveloped double stranded rna viruses that use a multiprotein polymerase complex px to replicate and transcribe the viral genome although the structures of the polymerase and atpase components of the cystoviral px are known and their functional behavior is understood to a large extent no atomic resolution structural information is available for the major capsid protein p that defines the overall structure and symmetry of the viral capsid and the essential protein p  toward obtaining a complete structural and functional understanding of the cystoviral px we have obtained the structure of p from the cystovirus   at a resolution of     the n terminal core region      of p forms a novel homodimeric    fold having structural similarities with brct domains implicated in multiple protein  protein interactions in dna repair proteins our results combined with the known role of p in stabilizing the nucleation complex during capsid assembly hint toward its participation in key protein  protein interactions within the cystoviral px additionally we have found through solution nmr studies that the c terminal tail of p       that is essential for virus viability although highly disordered contains a nascent helix we demonstrate for the first time through nmr titrations that p is capable of interacting with rna we find that both the n terminal core and the dynamic c terminal tail of p play a role in rna recognition this interaction leads to a significant reduction of the degree of disorder in the c terminal tail given the requirement of p in maintaining genome packaging efficiency and transcriptional fidelity our data suggest a central biological role for p  rna interactions
