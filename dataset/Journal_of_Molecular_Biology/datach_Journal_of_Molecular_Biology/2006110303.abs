the dna translocating atpase of bacteriophage t packaging motor
in double stranded dna bacteriophages the viral dna is translocated into an empty prohead shell by a powerful atp driven motor assembled at the unique portal vertex terminases consisting of two to three packaging related atpase sites are central to the packaging mechanism but the nature of the key translocating atpase stoichiometry of packaging motor and basic mechanism of dna encapsidation are poorly understood a defined phage t packaging system consisting of only two components proheads and large terminase protein gp    kda  is constructed using the large expanded prohead this system packages any linear double stranded dna including the   kb t dna the small terminase protein gp    kda  is not only not required but also strongly inhibitory an atpase activity is stimulated when proheads gp  and dna are actively engaged in the dna packaging mode no packaging atpase was stimulated by the n terminal gp  atpase mutants k  g walker a  d  e walker b  e  q catalytic carboxylate  d  e e  d and d  e e  q walker b and catalytic carboxylate  nor could these sponsor dna encapsidation experiments with the two gp  domains n terminal atpase domain and c terminal nuclease domain suggest that terminase association with the prohead portal and communication between the domains are essential for atpase stimulation these data for the first time established an energetic linkage between packaging stimulation of n terminal atpase and dna translocation a core pathway for the assembly of functional dna translocating motor is proposed since the catalytic motifs of the n terminal atpase are highly conserved among gt   large terminase sequences analyzed these may represent common themes in phage and herpes viral dna translocation
