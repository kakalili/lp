pulling chromatin fibers computer simulations of direct physical micromanipulations edited by i tinoco
a low resolution molecular model which combines the known mechanical properties of protein free dna with the accumulating picture of chromatosome structure has been developed to account for the stretching of single chromatin fibers by an imposed external force force extension characteristics of sets of chains accumulated by monte carlo sampling are consistent with recently observed findings in the non destructive regime  lt  pn imposed force  where the structure of the chromatosome remains intact the correspondence between simulation and the relaxation phase of the experiment limits the equilibrium entry exit angle of linker dna on the chromatosome to w      and the effective dna linker length to leff     bp the computed force extension characteristics are relatively insensitive to other parameters of the model precluding their accurate estimation the introduction of an attractive potential between closely spaced nucleosomes reproduces the added initial resistance of single fibers to extension at high salt conditions the consideration of elastic linkers also improves the fitting of assorted classical measurements of unstressed chromatin structure in solution the overall picture of chromatin that emerges is an irregular fluctuating three dimensional zig zag structure with intact mechanically stable chromatosome units and deformable linkers the modeled fiber undergoes large scale configurational rearrangements without significant perturbation of the constituent chromatosome beads collapsing into a highly condensed form in response to small  lt kt inter nucleosomal attractions
