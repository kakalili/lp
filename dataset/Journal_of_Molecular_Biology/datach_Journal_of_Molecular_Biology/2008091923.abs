reversible sheet  turn conformational change of a cell penetrating peptide in lipid bilayers studied by solid state nmr
the membrane bound conformation of a cell penetrating peptide penetratin is investigated using solid state nmr spectroscopy the  c chemical shifts of  c  n labeled residues in the peptide indicate a reversible conformational change from  sheet at low temperature to coil like at high temperature this conformational change occurs for all residues examined between positions  and   at peptide lipid molar ratios of   and    in membranes with     anionic lipids and in both saturated dmpc dmpg   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphatidylchloline   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphatidylglycerol membranes and unsaturated popc popg  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphatidylcholine  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphatidylglycerol membranes thus it is an intrinsic property of penetratin the coil state of the peptide has c  h order parameters of       for c  and c  sites indicating that the peptide backbone is unstructured moreover chemical shift anisotropy lineshapes are uniaxially averaged suggesting that the peptide backbone undergoes uniaxial rotation around the bilayer normal these observations suggest that the dynamic state of penetratin at high temperature is a structured turn instead of an isotropic random coil the thermodynamic parameters of this sheet  turn transition are extracted and compared to other membrane peptides reported to exhibit conformational changes we suggest that the function of this turn conformation may be to reduce hydrophobic interactions with the lipid chains and facilitate penetratin translocation across the bilayer without causing permanent membrane damage
