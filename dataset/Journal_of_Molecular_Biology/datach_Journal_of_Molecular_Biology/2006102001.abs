structure of aart a designed six finger zinc finger peptide bound to dna
cys his zinc fingers are one of the most common types of dna binding domains modifications to zinc finger binding specificity have recently enabled custom dna binding proteins to be designed to a wide array of target sequences we present here a     structure of aart a designed six zinc finger protein bound to a consensus dna target site this is the first structure of a designed protein with six fingers and was intended to provide insights into the unusual affinity and specificity characteristics of this protein most protein  dna contacts were found to be consistent with expectations while others were unanticipated or insufficient to explain specificity several were unexpectedly mediated by glycerol water molecules or amino acid  base stacking interactions these results challenge some conventional concepts of recognition particularly the finding that triplets containing   a c or t are typically not specified by direct interaction with the amino acid in position  of the recognition helix
