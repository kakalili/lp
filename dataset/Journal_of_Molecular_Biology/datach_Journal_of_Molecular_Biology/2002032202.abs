contribution of the intrinsic curvature to measured dna persistence length edited by i tinoco
the persistence length of dna a depends both on the intrinsic curvature of the double helix and on the thermal fluctuations of the angles between adjacent base pairs we have evaluated two contributions to the value of a by comparing measured values of a for dna containing a generic sequence and for an  intrinsically straight  dna in each  bp segment of the intrinsically straight dna an initial sequence of five bases is repeated in the sequence of the second five bases so any bends in the first half of the segment are compensated by bends in the opposite direction in the second half the value of a for the latter dna depends to a good approximation on thermal fluctuations only there is no intrinsic curvature the values of a were obtained from measurements of the cyclization efficiency for short dna fragments about   bp in length this method determines the persistence length of dna with exceptional accuracy due to the very strong dependence of the cyclization efficiency of short fragments on the value of a we find that the values of a for the two types of dna fragment are very close and conclude that the contribution of the intrinsic curvature to a is at least  times smaller than the contribution of thermal fluctuations the relationship between this result and the angles between adjacent base pairs which specify the intrinsic curvature is analyzed
