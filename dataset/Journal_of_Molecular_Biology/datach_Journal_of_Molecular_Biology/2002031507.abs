structure of an extended spectrum class a  lactamase from proteus vulgaris k  edited by r huber
the structure of a chromosomal extended spectrum  lactamase esbl having the ability to hydrolyze cephalosporins including cefuroxime and ceftazidime has been determined by x ray crystallography to     resolution the species specific class a  lactamase from proteus vulgaris k was crystallized at ph    and its structure solved by molecular replacement refinement of the model resulted in crystallographic r and rfree of    and    respectively the folding of the k enzyme is broadly similar to that of non esbl tem type  lactamases    rmsd for c  and differs by only     for all atoms of six conserved residues in the catalytic site other residues promoting extended spectrum activity in k include the side chains of atypical residues ser  and lys   these side chains are linked by two water molecules one of which lies in the position normally filled by the guanidinium group of arg   present in most non esbl enzymes but absent from k  the ammonium group of lys   ca    from the virtual arg  guanidinium position may interact with polar r substitutents on the dihydrothiazene ring of cephalosporins
