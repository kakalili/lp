folding rates and low entropy loss routes of two state proteins
we develop a simple model for computing the rates and routes of folding of two state proteins from the contact maps of their native structures the model is based on the graph theoretical concept of effective contact order eco  the model predicts that proteins fold by  zipping up  in a sequence of small loop closure events depending on the native chain fold using a simple equation with a few physical rate parameters we obtain a good correlation with the folding rates of  two state folding proteins the model rationalizes data from  value analysis that have been interpreted in terms of delocalized or polarized transition states this model indicates how much of protein folding may take place in parallel not along a single reaction coordinate or with a single transition state
