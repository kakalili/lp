the c terminal region of the meiosis specific protein kinase ime mediates protein instability and is required for normal spore formation in budding yeast
the cyclin dependent kinase cdk and the related kinase ime act in concert to trigger progression of the meiotic cell cycle in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae these kinases share several functions and substrates during meiosis but their regulation seems to be clearly different in contrast to cdk  no cyclin seems to be involved in the regulation of ime activity ime is a highly unstable protein and we aimed to elucidate the relevance of ime instability we first determined the sequence elements required for ime instability by constructing a set of deletions in the ime gene none of the small deletions in ime affected its instability but deletion of a   amino acid c terminal region resulted in a highly stabilized protein thus the c terminal domain of ime is important for mediating protein instability the stabilized truncated ime protein is highly active in vivo replacement of the ime gene with the truncated ime  c  in diploid strains did not interfere with meiotic nuclear divisions but caused abnormalities in spore formation as manifested by the appearance of many asci with a reduced spore number such as triads and dyads the truncated ime caused a reduction of spore number in a dominant manner we conclude that downregulation of ime kinase activity mediated by the c terminal domain is required for the efficient production of normal four spore asci our data suggest a role for ime in spore number control in s cerevisiae
