distinct structural features of cyclothiazide are responsible for effects on peak current amplitude and desensitization kinetics at iglur
ionotropic glutamate receptors iglurs mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission upon glutamate application  amino   hydroxy  methyl  isoxazolyl propionic acid receptors undergo rapid and almost complete desensitization that can be attenuated by positive allosteric modulators the molecular mechanism of positive allosteric modulation has been elucidated previously by crystal structures of the ligand binding core of iglur in complex with for example cyclothiazide ctz  here we investigate the structure and function of ctz and three closely related analogues ns   ns   and ns   at iglur  by x ray crystallography and fast application patch clamp electrophysiology ctz was the most efficacious and potent modulator of the four compounds on iglur q i emax normalized to response of glutamate    ctz     ns       ns    and    ns   and ec  in micromolar   ctz    ns      ns    and   ns    the four modulators divide into three groups according to efficacy and desensitization kinetics   ctz increases the peak current efficacy twice as much as the three analogues and nearly completely blocks receptor desensitization   ns   and ns   have low efficacy and only attenuate desensitization partially   ns   has low efficacy but nearly completely blocks receptor desensitization a hydrophobic substituent at the  position of the   dioxo   dihydro h benzo e    thiadiazine ring system is important for compound efficacy with the following ranking norbornenyl bicyclo    hept  ene gt cyclopentyl gt methyl the replacement of the norbornenyl moiety with a significantly less hydrophobic cyclopentane ring increases the flexibility of the modulator as the cyclopentane ring adopts various conformations at the iglur allosteric binding site the main structural feature responsible for a nearly complete block of desensitization is the presence of an nh hydrogen bond donor in the  position of the   dioxo   dihydro h benzo e    thiadiazine ring system forming an anchoring hydrogen bond to ser   therefore the atom at the  position of ctz seems to be a major determinant of receptor desensitization kinetics
