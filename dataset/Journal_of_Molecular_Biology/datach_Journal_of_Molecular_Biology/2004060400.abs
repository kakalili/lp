toward consistent assignment of structural domains in proteins
the assignment of protein domains from three dimensional structure is critically important in understanding protein evolution and function yet little quality assurance has been performed here the differences in the assignment of structural domains are evaluated using six common assignment methods three human expert methods authors authors annotation  cath and scop and three fully automated methods dali domainparser and pdp are investigated by analysis of individual methods against the author s assignment as well as analysis based on the consensus among groups of methods only expert only automatic combined  the results demonstrate that caution is recommended in using current domain assignments and indicates where additional work is needed specifically the major factors responsible for conflicting domain assignments between methods both experts and automatic are   the definition of very small domains   splitting secondary structures between domains   the size and number of discontinuous domains   closely packed or convoluted domain  domain interfaces   structures with large and complex architectures and   the level of significance placed upon structural functional and evolutionary concepts in considering structural domain definitions a web based resource that focuses on the results of benchmarking and the analysis of domain assignments is available at http  pdomains sdsc edu
