a cyclic peptide inhibitor of apoc ii peptide fibril formation mechanistic insight from nmr and molecular dynamics analysis
the misfolding and aggregation of proteins to form amyloid fibrils is a characteristic feature of several common age related diseases agents that directly inhibit formation of amyloid fibrils represent one approach to combating these diseases we have investigated the potential of a cyclic peptide to inhibit fibril formation by fibrillogenic peptides from human apolipoprotein c ii apoc ii  cyc     was formed by disulfide cross linking of cysteine residues added to the termini of the fibrillogenic peptide comprising apoc ii residues     this cyclic peptide did not self associate into fibrils however substoichiometric concentrations of cyc     significantly delayed fibril formation by the fibrillogenic linear peptides apoc ii     and apoc ii      reduction of the disulfide bond or scrambling the amino acid sequence within cyc     significantly impaired its inhibitory activity the solution structure of cyc     was solved using nmr spectroscopy revealing a well defined structure comprising a hydrophilic face and a more hydrophobic face containing the met  tyr  ile  and phe  side chains molecular dynamics md studies identified a flexible central region within cyc      while md simulations of  scrambled  cyc     indicated an increased formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and a reduction in the overall flexibility of the peptide our structural studies suggest that the inhibitory activity of cyc     is mediated by an elongated structure with inherent flexibility and distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces enabling cyc     to interact transiently with fibrillogenic peptides and inhibit fibril assembly these results suggest that cyclic peptides based on amyloidogenic core peptides could be useful as specific inhibitors of amyloid fibril formation
