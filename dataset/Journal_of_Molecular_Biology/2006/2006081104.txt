Topoisomerases may unknot by recognizing specific DNA juxtapositions. The physical basis of this hypothesis is investigated by considering single-loop conformations in a coarse-grained polymer model. We determine the statistical relationship between the local geometry of a juxtaposition of two chain segments and whether the loop is knotted globally, and ascertain how the knot/unknot topology is altered by a topoisomerase-like segment passage at the juxtaposition. Segment passages at a “free” juxtaposition tend to increase knot probability. In contrast, segment passages at a “hooked” juxtaposition cause more transitions from knot to unknot than vice versa, resulting in a steady-state knot probability far lower than that at topological equilibrium. The reduction in knot population by passing chain segments through a hooked juxtaposition is more prominent for loops of smaller sizes, n, but remains significant even for larger loops: steady-state knot probability is only ∼2%, and ∼5% of equilibrium, respectively, for n=100 and 500 in the model. An exhaustive analysis of ∼6000 different juxtaposition geometries indicates that the ability of a segment passage to unknot correlates strongly with the juxtaposition's “hookedness”. Remarkably, and consistent with experiments on type-2 topoisomerases from different organisms, the unknotting potential of a juxtaposition geometry in our polymer model correlates almost perfectly with its corresponding decatenation potential. These quantitative findings suggest that it is possible for topoisomerases to disentangle by acting selectively on juxtapositions with “hooked” geometries.
