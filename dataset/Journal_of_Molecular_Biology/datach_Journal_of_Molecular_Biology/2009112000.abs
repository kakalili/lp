modeling of the genetic switch of bacteriophage tp    a heteromer of ci and mor ensures robust bistability
the lytic  lysogenic switch of the temperate lactococcal phage tp   is fundamentally different from that of phage lambda in phage tp    the lytic promoter pl is repressed by ci whereas repression of the lysogenic promoter pr requires the presence of both of the antagonistic regulator proteins mor and ci we model the central part of the switch and compare the two cases for pr repression the one where the two regulators interact only on the dna and the other where the two regulators form a heteromer complex in the cytoplasm prior to dna binding the models are analyzed for bistability and the predicted promoter repression folds are compared to experimental data we conclude that the experimental data are best reproduced the latter case where a heteromer complex forms in solution we further find that ci sequestration by the formation of mor ci complexes in cytoplasm makes the genetic switch robust
