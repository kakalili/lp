probing the sensory rhodopsin ii binding domain of its cognate transducer by calorimetry and electrophysiology
sensory rhodopsin ii a repellent phototaxis receptor from natronobacterium pharaonis npsrii forms a tight complex with its cognate transducer nphtrii  light excitation of the receptor triggers conformational changes in both proteins thereby activating the cellular two component signalling cascade in membranes the two proteins form a   complex which dissociates to a   heterodimer in micelles complexed to the transducer sensory rhodopsin ii is no longer capable of light driven proton pumping in order to elucidate the dimerisation and the size of the receptor binding domain of the transducer isothermal titration calorimetry and electrophysiological experiments have been carried out it is shown that an n terminal sequence of   amino acid residues is sufficient for tight binding kd  nm  h    kjmol   and for inhibiting the proton transfer these data and results obtained from selected site directed mutants indicate a synergistic interplay of transducer transmembrane domain     and cytoplasmic peptide      leading to an optimal and specific interaction between receptor and transducer
