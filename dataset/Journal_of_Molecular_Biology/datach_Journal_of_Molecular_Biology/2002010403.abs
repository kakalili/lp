relation between sequence and structure of hiv  protease inhibitor complexes a model system for the analysis of protein flexibility edited by r huber
the flexibility of different regions of hiv  protease was examined by using a database consisting of  x ray structures that differ in terms of sequence ligands or both the root mean square differences of the backbone for the set of structures were shown to have the same variation with residue number as those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations normal mode analyses and x ray b factors this supports the idea that observed structural changes provide a measure of the inherent flexibility of the protein although specific interactions between the protease and the ligand play a secondary role the results suggest that the potential energy surface of the hiv  protease is characterized by many local minima with small energetic differences some of which are sampled by the different x ray structures of the hiv  protease complexes interdomain correlated motions were calculated from the structural fluctuations and the results were also in agreement with molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses implications of the results for the drug resistance engendered by mutations are discussed briefly
