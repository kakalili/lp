hiv  viral rna is selected in the form of monomers that dimerize in a three step protease dependent process the dis of stem  loop  initiates viral rna dimerization
we have characterized the viral rna conformation in wild type protease inactive pr   and sl defective  dis human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   as a function of the age of the viruses from newly released to grown up     h old  we report evidence for packaging hiv  genomic rna grna in the form of monomers in pr  virions viral rna rearrangement not maturation within pr  hiv  protease dependent formation of thermolabile dimeric viral rnas a new form of immature grna dimer at about  h post virion release and slow acting dimerization signals in sl defective viruses the rates of grna dimer formation were   fold and    fold slower in  dis and pr  viruses than in wild type respectively thus the dis i e the palindrome in the apical loop of sl  is a dimerization initiation signal but its role can be masked by one or several slow acting dimerization site s when grown up sl inactive virions are investigated grown up pr  virions are not flawless models for immature virions because grna dimerization increases with the age of pr  virions indicating that the pr  mutation does not  freeze  grna conformation in a nascent primordial state our study is the first on grna conformation in newly released mutant or primate retroviruses it shows for the first time that the packaged retroviral grna matures in more than one step and that formation of immature dimeric viral rna requires viral protein maturation the monomeric viral rnas isolated from budding hiv  as modeled by newly released pr  virions may be seen as dimers that are much more fragile than thermolabile dimers
