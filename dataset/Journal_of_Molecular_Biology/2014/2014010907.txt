Interdomain interactions of spectrin are critical for maintenance of the erythrocyte cytoskeleton. In particular, “head-to-head” dimerization occurs when the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail of β-spectrin binds the N-terminal tail of α-spectrin, folding to form the “spectrin tetramer domain”. This non-covalent three-helix bundle domain is homologous in structure and sequence to previously studied spectrin domains. We find that this tetramer domain is surprisingly kinetically stable. Using a protein engineering Φ-value analysis to probe the mechanism of formation of this tetramer domain, we infer that the domain folds by the docking of the intrinsically disordered β-spectrin tail onto the more structured α-spectrin tail.
