influence of tyrosine kinase wzc activity on colanic acid production in escherichia coli k  cells
bacterial tyrosine kinases have been demonstrated to participate in the regulation of capsule polysaccharides cps and exopolysaccharides eps production and export however discrepant data have been reported on the molecular mechanism responsible for this regulation depending on the bacterial species analyzed special attention was previously paid to the tyrosine kinase wzcca of escherichia coli k   which is involved in the production of the exopolysaccharide colanic acid and autophosphorylates by using a cooperative two step process in this work we took advantage of these observations to investigate in further detail the effect of wzcca phosphorylation on the colanic acid production first it is shown that expression of the phosphorylated form of wzc prevents production of colanic acid whereas expression of the non phosphorylated form allows biosynthesis of this exopolysaccharide however we provide evidence that in the latter case the size distribution of the colanic acid polymer is less scattered than in the case of the wild type strain expressing both phosphorylated and non phosphorylated forms of wzc it is then demonstrated that colanic acid production is not merely regulated by an on off mechanism and that instead both phosphorylated and non phosphorylated forms of wzc are required to promote colanic acid synthesis moreover a series of data suggests that besides the involvement of phosphorylated and non phosphorylated forms of wzc in the production of colanic acid two particular regions of this kinase play as such an important role in the synthesis of this exopolysaccharide a proline rich domain located in the n terminal part of wzcca and a tyrosine cluster present in the c terminal portion of the enzyme furthermore considering that polysaccharides are known to facilitate bacterial resistance to certain environmental stresses it is shown that the resistance of e coli to desiccation is directly connected with the phosphorylation state of wzcca
