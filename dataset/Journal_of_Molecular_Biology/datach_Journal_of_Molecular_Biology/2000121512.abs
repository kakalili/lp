the sh fold family experimental evidence and prediction of variations in the folding pathways
to investigate the relationships between protein topology amino acid sequence and folding mechanisms the folding transition state of the sso d protein has been characterised both experimentally and theoretically although sso d protein has a similar topology to that of the sh domains the structure of its transition state is different from that of  spectrin and src sh domains previously studied the folding algorithm fold x including an energy function with specific sequence features accounts for these differences and reproduces with a good agreement the set of experimental     uvalues obtained for the three proteins our analysis shows that taking into account sequence features underlying protein topology is critical for an accurate prediction of the folding process
