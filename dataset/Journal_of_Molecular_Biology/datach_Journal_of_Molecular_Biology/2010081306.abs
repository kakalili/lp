architecture of the tn posttransposition complex an elaborate nucleoprotein structure
four transposition proteins encoded by the bacterial transposon tn  tnsa tnsb tnsc and tnsd mediate its site and orientation specific insertion into the chromosomal site atttn  to establish which tns proteins are actually present in the transpososome that executes dna breakage and joining we have determined the proteins present in the nucleoprotein product of transposition the posttransposition complex ptc  using fluorescently labeled tns proteins all four required tns proteins are present in the ptc in which we also find that the tn ends are paired by protein  protein contacts between tns proteins bound to the ends quantification of the relative amounts of the fluorescent tns proteins in the ptc indicates that oligomers of tnsa tnsb and tnsc mediate tn transposition high resolution dna footprinting of the dna product of transposition atttn  tn revealed that about   bp of dna on the transposon ends and on atttn contact the tns proteins all seven binding sites for tnsb the component of the transposase that specifically binds the ends and mediates   end breakage and joining are occupied in the ptc however the protection pattern of the sites closest to the tn ends in the ptc are different from that observed with tnsb alone likely reflecting the pairing of the ends and their interaction with the target nucleoprotein complex necessary for activation of the breakage and joining steps we also observe extensive protection of the atttn sequences in the ptc and that alternative dna structures in substrate atttn that are imposed by tnsd are maintained in the ptc
