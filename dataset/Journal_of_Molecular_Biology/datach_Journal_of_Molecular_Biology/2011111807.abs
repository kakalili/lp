crystal structure of the plant epigenetic protein arginine methyltransferase
protein arginine methyltransferase   prmt  is a type i arginine methyltransferase that is essential for regulating flowering time in arabidopsis thaliana we present a    resolution crystal structure of a thaliana prmt   atprmt  in complex with a reaction product s adenosylhomocysteine the structure reveals a dimerization arm that is     residues longer than prmt structures elucidated previously as a result the essential atprmt  dimer exhibits a large central cavity and a distinctly accessible active site we employ molecular dynamics to examine how dimerization facilitates atprmt  motions necessary for activity and we show that these motions are conserved in other prmt enzymes finally functional data reveal that the  n terminal residues of atprmt  influence substrate specificity and that enzyme activity is dependent on substrate protein sequences distal from the methylation site taken together these data provide insights into the molecular mechanism of atprmt  as well as other members of the prmt family of enzymes they highlight differences between atprmt  and other prmts but also indicate that motions are a conserved element of prmt function
