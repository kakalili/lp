caspase  cleavage of dusp mkp at the interdomain region generates active mkp fragments that regulate erk  subcellular localization and function
mapk map kinase phosphatase  dusp mkp  is a cytosolic mkp mapk phosphatase that regulates negatively erk  downstream to growth factor or apoptotic signaling transcription of dusp gene is activated through the erk  pathway which constitutes a feedback regulatory loop of erk  activation however the regulation of the function of the dusp mkp protein is poorly known mkp possesses a linker region between its n terminal mapk binding domain and its c terminal catalytic domain which is conserved in the related mkps dusp mkpx and dusp mkp  in mkp  the interdomain linker region contains a secondary erk  binding motif and an active nuclear export sequence here we report that mkp protein levels are decreased in cells upon apoptotic stimulation in a caspase dependent manner and we identify a novel mkp regulatory mechanism mediated by the pro apoptotic protease caspase  which involves the mkp interdomain linker region active caspase  targeted the linker region of mkp at several residues rendering n terminal and c terminal mkp fragments that contain specific arrangements of nuclear export sequence and erk  interaction motifs mkp caspase  generated fragments displayed differential properties to regulate erk  nuclear cytosolic localization and activity our results indicate that caspase  cleavage of mkp down regulates mkp full length and renders active mkp fragments which may participate in novel regulatory pathways controlling the subcellular localization and activation of erk  during apoptosis
