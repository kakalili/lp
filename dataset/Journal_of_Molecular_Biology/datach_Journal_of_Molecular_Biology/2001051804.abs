bridging the information gap computational tools for intermediate resolution structure interpretation edited by w baumeister
due to large sizes and complex nature few large macromolecular complexes have been solved to atomic resolution this has lead to an under representation of these structures which are composed of novel and or homologous folds in the library of known structures and folds while it is often difficult to achieve a high resolution model for these structures x ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy are capable of determining structures of large assemblies at low to intermediate resolutions to aid in the interpretation and analysis of such structures we have developed two programs helixhunter and foldhunter helixhunter is capable of reliably identifying helix position orientation and length using a five dimensional cross correlation search of a three dimensional density map followed by feature extraction helixhunter  s results can in turn be used to probe a library of secondary structure elements derived from the structures in the protein data bank pdb  from this analysis it is then possible to identify potential homologous folds or suggest novel folds based on the arrangement of alpha helix elements resulting in a structure based recognition of folds containing alpha helices foldhunter uses a six dimensional cross correlation search allowing a probe structure to be fitted within a region or component of a target structure the structural fitting therefore provides a quantitative means to further examine the architecture and organization of large complex assemblies these two methods have been successfully tested with simulated structures modeled from the pdb at resolutions between  and    with the integration of helixhunter and foldhunter into sequence and structural informatics techniques we have the potential to deduce or confirm known or novel folds in domains or components within large complexes
