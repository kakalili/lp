heteronuclear nmr studies of the interaction of trna lys with hiv  nucleocapsid protein edited by m f summers
reverse transcription of hiv  viral rna uses human trna lys as a primer recombinant trna lys was previously overexpressed in escherichia coli  n labelled and purified for nmr studies it was shown to be functional for priming of hiv  reverse transcription using heteronuclear d and d nmr we have been able to assign almost all the imino groups in the helical regions and involved in the tertiary base interactions of trna lys this crucial step enabled us to address the question of the annealing mechanism of trna lys by the nucleocapsid protein nc using heteronuclear nmr moreover structural aspects of the trna lys      ncp interaction have been characterised the     ncp protein binds preferentially to the inside of the l shape of the trna lys on the acceptor and d stems and at the level of the tertiary interactions between the d and t  c loops      ncp binding does not induce the melting of any single base pair or unwinding of the trna lys helical domains moreover nmr provides a unique means to investigate the base pairs that are destabilised by     ncp binding indeed the measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time t and of the exchange time of the imino protons revealed two major regions sensitive to catalysis by the protein namely the g u  and t  a  pairs it is interesting that for the biological role of the nc protein these pairs could be the starting points of the trna melting required for the hybridisation to the viral rna
