paramyxovirus activation and inhibition of innate immune responses
paramyxoviruses represent a remarkably diverse family of enveloped nonsegmented negative strand rna viruses some of which are the most ubiquitous disease causing viruses of humans and animals this review focuses on paramyxovirus activation of innate immune pathways the mechanisms by which these rna viruses counteract these pathways and the innate response to paramyxovirus infection of dendritic cells dc  paramyxoviruses are potent activators of extracellular complement pathways a first line of defense that viruses must face during natural infections we discuss mechanisms by which these viruses activate and combat complement to delay neutralization once cells are infected virus replication drives type i interferon ifn synthesis that has the potential to induce a large number of antiviral genes here we describe four approaches by which paramyxoviruses limit ifn induction by limiting synthesis of ifn inducing aberrant viral rnas through targeted inhibition of rna sensors by providing viral decoy substrates for cellular kinase complexes and through direct blocking of the ifn promoter in addition paramyxoviruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to disrupt ifn signaling pathways we describe three general mechanisms including targeted proteolysis of signaling factors sequestering cellular factors and upregulation of cellular inhibitors dc are exceptional cells with the capacity to generate adaptive immunity through the coupling of innate immune signals and t cell activation we discuss the importance of innate responses in dc following paramyxovirus infection and their consequences for the ability to mount and maintain antiviral t cells
