prediction of peroxisomal targeting signal  containing proteins from amino acid sequence
peroxisomal matrix proteins have to be imported into their target organelle post translationally the major translocation pathway depends on a c terminal targeting signal termed pts  our previous analysis of sequence variability in the pts motif revealed that in addition to the known c terminal tripeptide at least nine residues directly upstream are important for signal recognition in the pts  pex receptor complex the refined pts motif description was implemented in a prediction tool composed of taxon specific functions metazoa fungi remaining taxa  capable of recognising potential pts s in query sequences the composite score function consists of classical profile terms and additional terms penalising deviations from the derived physical property pattern over sequence segments the prediction algorithm has been validated with a self consistency and three different cross validation tests additionally we tested the tool on a large set of non peroxisomal negatives on mutation data and compared the prediction rate to the pts component of the psort program the sensitivity of our predictor in recognising documented pts signal containing proteins is close to   for reliable prediction the predictor distinguishes even skl appended non peroxisomally targeted proteins such as a mouse dihydrofolate reductase skl construct the corresponding rate of false positives is not worse than    thus the tool can be applied for large scale unsupervised sequence database annotation a scan of public protein databases uncovered a number of yet uncharacterised proteins for which the pts signal might be critical for biological function the predicted presence of a pts signal implies peroxisomal localisation in the absence of n terminal targeting sequences such as the mitochondrial import signal
