cryomicroscopy of human cytomegalovirus virions reveals more densely packed genomic dna than in herpes simplex virus type  edited by a klug
all members of the herpesvirus family have a characteristic virion structure comprising a dna containing icosahedral capsid embedded in a proteinaceous layer tegument and surrounded by a lipid envelope human cytomegalovirus hcmv the prototypic  herpesvirus has a genome that is significantly larger  gt    than that of the  herpesvirus hsv  although the internal volume of the hcmv capsid is approximately   larger than that of hsv  this slight increase in volume does not provide adequate space to encapsidate the full length hcmv genome at the same packing density as hsv  we have investigated the nature of dna packing in hcmv and hsv  virions by electron cryomicroscopy and image processing radial density profiles calculated from projection images of hcmv and hsv  capsids suggest that there is no increase in the volume of the hcmv capsid upon dna packaging packing density of the viral dna was assessed for both hcmv and hsv  by image analysis of both full and empty particles our results for packing density in hsv  are in good agreement with previously published measurements showing an average inter layer spacing of approximately    measurements taken from our hcmv images however suggest that the viral genomic dna is more densely packed with an average inter layer spacing of approximately    we propose therefore that the combination of greater volume in hcmv capsids and increased packing density of viral dna accounts for its ability to encapsidate a large genome
