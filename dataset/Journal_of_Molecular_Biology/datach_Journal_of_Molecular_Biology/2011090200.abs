thermodynamics and kinetics of the hairpin ribozyme from atomistic folding unfolding simulations
we report a set of atomistic folding unfolding simulations for the hairpin ribozyme using a monte carlo algorithm the hairpin ribozyme folds in solution and catalyzes self cleavage or ligation via a specific two domain structure the minimal active ribozyme has been studied extensively showing stabilization of the active structure by cations and dynamic motion of the active structure here we introduce a simple model of tertiary structure formation that leads to a phase diagram for the rna as a function of temperature and tertiary structure strength we then employ this model to capture many folding unfolding events and to examine the transition state ensemble tse of the rna during folding to its active  docked  conformation the tse is compact but with few tertiary interactions formed in agreement with single molecule dynamics experiments to compare with experimental kinetic parameters we introduce a novel method to benchmark monte carlo kinetic parameters to docking undocking rates collected over many single molecular trajectories we find that topology alone as encoded in a biased potential that discriminates between secondary and tertiary interactions is sufficient to predict the thermodynamic behavior and kinetic folding pathway of the hairpin ribozyme this method should be useful in predicting folding transition states for many natural or man made rna tertiary structures
