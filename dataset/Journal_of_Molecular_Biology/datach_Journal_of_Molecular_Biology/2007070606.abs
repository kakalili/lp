change in nutritional status modulates the abundance of critical pre initiation intermediate complexes during translation initiation in vivo
in eukaryotic translation initiation eif gtp  met trnaimet ternary complex tc interacts with eif  eif  eif complex to form the multifactor complex mfc  while eif gdp associates with eif b for guanine nucleotide exchange gcn p phosphorylates eif to inhibit eif b here we evaluate the abundance of eifs and their pre initiation intermediate complexes in gcn deletion mutant grown under different conditions we show that ribosomes are three times as abundant as eif  eif and eif  while eif is half as abundant as the latter three and hence the limiting component in mfc formation by quantitative immunoprecipitation we estimate that    of the cellular eif is found in tc during rapid growth in a complex rich medium most of the tc is found in mfc and important     of the total eif is associated with eif but lacks trnaimet when the gcn  mutant grows less rapidly in a defined complete medium tc abundance increases threefold without altering the abundance of each individual factor interestingly the tc increase is suppressed by eif overexpression and gcn p expression thus eif b catalyzed tc formation appears to be fine tuned by eif phosphorylation and the novel eif eif complex lacking trnaimet
