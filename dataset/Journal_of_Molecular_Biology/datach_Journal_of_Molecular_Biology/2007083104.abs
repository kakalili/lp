solution structure of the brk domains from chd
chd is a member of the chromodomain helicase dna binding domain chd family of atp dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes it is mutated in charge syndrome a multiple congenital anomaly condition chd is one of a subset of chd proteins unique to metazoans that contain the brk domain a protein module also found in the brahma brg family of helicases we describe here the nmr solution structure of the two brk domains of chd  each domain has a compact     fold the second domain has a c terminal extension consisting of two additional helices the structure differs from those of other domains present in chromatin associated proteins
