the crystal structure of human isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase at     resolution reveals its catalytic mechanism in isoprenoid biosynthesis
isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase catalyses a crucial activation step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids one of the most ancient and diverse classes of natural products this enzyme is responsible for an unusual isomerization of the inactive carbon carbon double bond of isopentenyl diphosphate ipp to create its electrophilic allylic isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate dmapp  here we report the crystal structure of human ipp isomerase at     resolution and the complex structure with its native substrate at     resolution these structures reveal a mechanism wherein interconversion is catalyzed by a stereoselective antarafacial    transposition of a proton involving the indispensable residues cys  glu   trp  and tyr   a newly identified alternative conformation of cys  driven by trp  and the selectivity of different metal ions located in the active site provide further insight into the catalytic mechanism comparison with escherichia coli ipp isomerase reveals a novel substrate entrance in human ipp isomerase
