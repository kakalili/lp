a genome wide sequence  structure analysis suggests aggregation gatekeepers constitute an evolutionary constrained functional class
protein aggregation is geared by aggregation prone regions that self associate by  strand interactions charged residues and prolines are enriched at the flanks of aggregation prone regions resulting in decreased aggregation it is still unclear what drives the overrepresentation of these  aggregation gatekeepers   that is whether their presence results from structural constraints determining protein stability or whether they constitute a bona fide functional class selectively maintained to control protein aggregation as functional residues are typically conserved regardless of their cost to protein stability we compared sequence conservation and thermodynamic cost of these residues in   protein families in escherichia coli across protein families we find gatekeepers to be under strong selective conservation while at the same time representing a significant thermodynamic cost to protein structure this finding supports the notion that aggregation gatekeepers are not structurally determined but evolutionary selected to control protein aggregation
