crystal structure of the oligomerization domain of nsp from rotavirus reveals a core metal binding site
during the maturation of rotaviral particles non structural protein  nsp  plays a critical role in the translocation of the immature capsid into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum full length nsp and a  amino acid peptide nsp     derived from this protein have been shown to induce diarrhea in young mice in an age dependent manner and may therefore be the agent responsible for rotavirally induced symptoms we have determined the crystal structure of the oligomerization domain of nsp which spans residues  to   nsp     nsp    self associates into a parallel tetrameric coiled coil with the hydrophobic core interrupted by three polar layers occupying a and d heptad positions side chains from two consecutive polar layers consisting of four gln  and two of the four glu  residues coordinate a divalent cation two independent structures built from mad phased data indicated the presence of a strontium and calcium ion bound at this site respectively this metal binding site appears to play an important role in stabilizing the homo tetramer which has implications for the engagement of nsp as an enterotoxin
