crystal structures of human gephyrin and plant cnx g domains comparative analysis and functional implications edited by d rees
the molybdenum cofactor moco consists of a unique and conserved pterin derivative usually referred to as molybdopterin mpt  which coordinates the essential transition metal molybdenum mo  moco is required for the enzymatic activities of all mo enzymes with the exception of nitrogenase and is synthesized by an evolutionary old multi step pathway that is dependent on the activities of at least six gene products in eukaryotes the final step of moco biosynthesis i e transfer and insertion of mo into mpt is catalyzed by the two domain proteins cnx in plants and gephyrin in mammals gephyrin is ubiquitously expressed and was initially found in the central nervous system where it is essential for clustering of inhibitory neuroreceptors in the postsynaptic membrane gephyrin and cnx contain at least two functional domains e and g that are homologous to the escherichia coli proteins moea and moga the atomic structures of which have been solved recently here we present the crystal structures of the n terminal human gephyrin g domain geph g and the c terminal arabidopsis thaliana cnx g domain cnx g at   and    resolution respectively these structures are highly similar and compared to moga reveal four major differences in their three dimensional structures   in geph g and cnx g an additional  helix is present between the first  strand and  helix of moga   the loop between   and   undergoes conformational changes in all three structures   a  hairpin loop found in moga is absent from geph g and cnx g   the c terminus of geph g follows a different path from that in moga based on the structures of the eukaryotic proteins and their comparisons with e coli moga the predicted binding site for mpt has been further refined in addition the characterized alternative splice variants of gephyrin are analyzed in the context of the three dimensional structure of geph g
