a pentavalent single domain antibody approach to tumor antigen discovery and the development of novel proteomics reagents
proteomics research has delivered many novel tumor targets however due to key limitations it does not specifically identify targets that are most accessible for drug delivery such as cell surface antigens a novel tumor antigen discovery platform based on screening a single domain antibody sdab library against tumor cells and subsequently identifying the corresponding antigens of the isolated antibodies is described an sdab afai specific for non small cell lung carcinoma a  cell line was isolated from a phage library derived from the heavy chain antibody repertoire of a llama the homopentamerization property of a non toxic verotoxin b subunit was exploited to make the es pentabody a pentameric form of afai pentamerization improved the binding of the afai to a  cells dramatically and greatly facilitated antigen identification by a western blotting mass spectrometry approach the antigen of es  which is present only in the hydrophobic not in the hydrophilic fraction of a  cellular proteins was identified as carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule  cea  cea was observed to be acidic and highly glycosylated and to exist in multiple glycoforms the results show that the platform described here should find wide application in antigen discovery and demonstrated that the pentabodies are very useful immunological reagents for proteomics
