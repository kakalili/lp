sds induced fibrillation of  synuclein an alternative fibrillation pathway
a structural investigation of the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds induced fibrillation of  synuclein  sn  a   amino acid protein implicated in parkinson s disease has been performed spectroscopic analysis has been combined with isothermal titration calorimetry small angle x ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy to elucidate a fibrillation pathway that is remarkably different from the fibrillation pathway in the absence of sds fibrillation occurs most extensively and most rapidly starting within   min under conditions where  sds molecules are bound per  sn molecule which is also the range where sds binding is associated with the highest enthalpy fibrillation is only reduced in proportion to the fraction of sds below   mol sds in mixed surfactant mixtures with nonionic surfactants and is inhibited by formation of bulk micelles and induction of  helical structure in this fibrillogenic complex   sn molecules initially associate with     sds molecules to form a shared micelle that gradually grows in size the complex initially exhibits a mixture of random coil and  helix but incubation results in a structural conversion into  sheet structure and concomitant formation of thioflavin t binding fibrils over a period of several hours based on small angle x ray scattering the aggregates elongate as a beads on a string structure in which individual units of ellipsoidal sds   sn are bridged by strings of the protein so that aggregates nucleate around the surface of protein stabilized micelles thus fibrillation in this case occurs by a process of continuous accretion rather than by the rate limiting accumulation of a distinct nucleus the morphology of the sds induced fibrils does not exhibit the classical rod like structures formed by  sn when aggregated by agitation in the absence of sds the sds induced fibrils have a flexible worm like appearance which can be converted into classical straight fibrils by continuous agitation sds induced fibrillation represents an alternative and highly reproducible mechanism for fibrillation where protein association is driven by the formation of shared micelles which subsequently allows the formation of  sheet structures that presumably link individual micelles this illustrates that protein fibrillation may occur by remarkably different mechanisms testifying to the versatility of this process
