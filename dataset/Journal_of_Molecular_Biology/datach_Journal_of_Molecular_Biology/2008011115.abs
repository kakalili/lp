crystal structures and mutational analysis of the arginine  lysine  histidine binding protein artj from geobacillus stearothermophilus implications for interactions of artj with its cognate atp binding cassette transporter art mp
artj is the substrate binding component receptor of the atp binding cassette abc transport system artj mp  from the thermophilic bacterium geobacillus stearothermophilus that is specific for arginine lysine and histidine the highest affinity is found for arginine kd         m  while the affinities for lysine and histidine are about tenfold lower we have determined the x ray structures of artj liganded with each of these substrates at resolutions of      arginine       lysine  and      histidine  respectively as found for other solute receptors the polypeptide chain is folded into two distinct domains lobes connected by a hinge the interface between the lobes forms the substrate binding pocket whose geometry is well preserved in all three artj amino acid complexes structure derived mutational analyses indicated the crucial role of a region in the carboxy terminal lobe of artj in contacting the transport pore art mp  and revealed the functional importance of gln  and trp  while variant gln  leu exhibited lower binding affinity for arginine but no binding of lysine and histidine the variant trp leu had lost binding activity for all three substrates the results are discussed in comparison with known structures of homologous proteins from mesophilic bacteria
