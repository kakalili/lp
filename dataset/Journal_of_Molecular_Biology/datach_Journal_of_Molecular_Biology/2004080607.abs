stopped flow and mutational analysis of base flipping by the escherichia coli dam dna adenine n  methyltransferase
by stopped flow kinetics using  aminopurine as a probe to detect base flipping we show here that base flipping by the escherichia coli dam dna adenine n  methyltransferase mtase is a biphasic process target base flipping is very fast kflip gt   s    but binding of the flipped base into the active site pocket of the enzyme is slow k     s    whereas base flipping occurs in the absence of s adenosyl l methionine adomet  binding of the target base in the active site pocket requires adomet our data suggest that the tyrosine residue in the dppy motif conserved in the active site of dna adenine n  mtases stacks to the flipped target base substitution of the aspartic acid residue of the dppy motif by alanine abolished base flipping suggesting that this residue contacts and stabilizes the flipped base the exchange of ser  located in a loop next to the active center by alanine led to a seven to eightfold reduction of kflip which was also reduced with substrates having altered gatc recognition sites and in the absence of adomet these findings provide evidence that the enzyme actively initiates base flipping by stabilizing the transition state of the process reduced rates of base flipping in substrates containing the target base in a non canonical sequence demonstrate that dna recognition by the mtase starts before base flipping dna recognition cofactor binding and base flipping are correlated and efficient base flipping takes place only if the enzyme has bound to a cognate target site and adomet is available
