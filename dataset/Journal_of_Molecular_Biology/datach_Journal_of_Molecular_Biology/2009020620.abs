crystal structure of a major outer membrane protein from thermus thermophilus hb
the thermophilic eubacterium thermus thermophilus belongs to one of the oldest branches of evolution and has a multilayered cell envelope that differs from that of modern gram negative bacteria its outer membrane contains integral outer membrane proteins omps  of which only a few are characterized ttoa a new  barrel omp was identified by searching the genome sequence of strain hb  for the presence of a c terminal signature sequence the structure of ttoa was determined to a resolution of     representing the first crystal structure of an omp from a thermophilic bacterium ttoa consists of an eight stranded  barrel with a large extracellular part to which a divalent cation is bound a five stranded extracellular  sheet protrudes out of the membrane embedded transmembrane barrel and is stabilized by a disulfide bridge the edge of this  sheet forms crystal contacts that could mimic interactions with other proteins in modern gram negative bacteria the c terminal signature sequence of omps is required for binding to an omp  family protein as a prerequisite for its assembly we present hints that a similar assembly pathway exists in t thermophilus by an in vitro binding assay where unfolded ttoa binds to the thermus omp  family protein ttomp  while a mutant without the signature sequence does not
