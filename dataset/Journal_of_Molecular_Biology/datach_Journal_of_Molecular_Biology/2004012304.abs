microglobulin h y variant d structure highlights the protein natural propensity towards intermolecular aggregation
microglobulin   m is the non covalently bound light chain of the human class i major histocompatibility complex mhc i  the natural turnover of mhc i gives rise to the release of  m into plasmatic fluids and to its catabolism in the kidney   m dissociation from the heavy chain of the complex is a severe complication in patients receiving prolonged hemodialysis as a consequence of renal failure the increasing  m concentrations can lead to deposition of the protein as amyloid fibrils here we characterize the his   tyr human  m mutant a non natural form of  m that is more stable than the wild type protein displaying a ten fold acceleration of the slow phase of folding we report the    resolution crystal structure and the nmr characterization of the mutant  m focussing on selected structural features and on the molecular packing observed in the crystals juxtaposition of the four mutant  m molecules contained in the crystal asymmetric unit and specific hydrogen bonds stabilize a compact protein assembly conformational heterogeneity of the four independent molecules some of their mutual interactions and partial unpairing of the n terminal  strand in one protomer are in keeping with the amyloidogenic properties displayed by the mutant  m
