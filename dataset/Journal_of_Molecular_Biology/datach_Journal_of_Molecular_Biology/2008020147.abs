conserved themes in target recognition by the pah and pah domains of the sin transcriptional corepressor
the recruitment of chromatin modifying coregulator complexes by transcription factors to specific sites of the genome constitutes an important step in many eukaryotic transcriptional regulatory pathways the histone deacetylase associated sin corepressor complex is recruited by a large and diverse array of transcription factors through direct interactions with the n terminal pah domains of sin  here we describe the solution structures of the msin a pah domain in the apo form and when bound to sap  a component of the corepressor complex unlike the apo msin a pah domain the apo pah domain is conformationally pure and is largely but not completely folded portions of the interacting segments of both msin a pah and sap  undergo folding upon complex formation sap  binds through an amphipathic helix to a predominantly hydrophobic cleft on the surface of pah  remarkably the orientation of the helix is reversed compared to that adopted by nrsf a transcription factor unrelated to sap  upon binding to the msin b pah domain the reversal in helical orientations is correlated with a reversal in the underlying pah interaction motifs echoing a theme previously described for the msin a pah domain the definition of these so called type i and type ii pah interaction motifs has allowed us to predict the precise location of these motifs within previously experimentally characterized pah binders finally we explore the specificity determinants of protein  protein interactions involving the pah and pah domains these studies reveal that even conservative replacements of pah residues with equivalent pah residues are sufficient to alter the affinity and specificity of these protein  protein interactions dramatically
