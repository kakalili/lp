crystal structure of human carboxypeptidase m a membrane bound enzyme that regulates peptide hormone activity
carboxypeptidase m cpm  an extracellular glycosylphosphatidyl inositol gpi anchored membrane glycoprotein belonging to the cpn e subfamily of  regulatory  metallo carboxypeptidases specifically removes c terminal basic residues from peptides and proteins due to its wide distribution in human tissues cpm is believed to play important roles in the control of peptide hormone and growth factor activity at the cell surface and in the membrane localized degradation of extracellular proteins we have crystallized human gpi free cpm and have determined and refined its    crystal structure the structure analysis reveals that cpm consists of a   residue n terminal catalytic domain similar to that of duck cpd  but only distantly related to cpa b  an adjacent  residue  sandwich c terminal domain characteristic of the cpn e family but more conically shaped than the equivalent domain in cpd  and a unique partially disordered  residue c terminal extension to which the gpi membrane anchor is post translationally attached through this gpi anchor and presumably via some positively charged side chains of the c terminal domain the cpm molecule may interact with the membrane in such a way that its active centre will face alongside i e well suited to interact with other membrane bound protein substrates or small peptides modelling of the c terminal part of the natural substrate arg met enkephalin into the active site shows that the s   pocket of cpm is particularly well designed to accommodate p   arg residues in agreement with the preference of cpm for cleaving c terminal arg
