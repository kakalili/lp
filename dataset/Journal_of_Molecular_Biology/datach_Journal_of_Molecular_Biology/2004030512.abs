analysis of chemical and enzymatic cleavage frequencies in supercoiled dna
chemical and enzymatic probing methods are powerful techniques for examining details of sequence dependent structure in dna and rna reagents that cleave nucleic acid molecules in a structure specific but relatively sequence non specific manner such as hydroxyl radical or dnase i have been used widely to probe helical geometry in nucleic acid structures nucleic acid  drug complexes and in nucleoprotein assemblies application of cleavage based techniques to structures present in superhelical dna has been hindered by the fact that the cleavage pattern attributable to supercoiling dependent structures is heavily mixed with non specific cleavage signals that are inevitable products of multiple cleavage events we present a rigorous mathematical procedure for extracting the cleavage pattern specific to supercoiled dna and use this method to investigate the hydroxyl radical cleavage pattern in a cruciform dna structure formed by a  bp inverted repeat sequence embedded in a negatively supercoiled plasmid our results support the presence of a stem loop structure in the expected location and suggest that the helical geometry of the cruciform stem differs from that of the normal duplex form
