multiple dna interactions contribute to the initiation of telomerase elongation
telomerase maintains telomere length and chromosome integrity by adding short tandem repeats of single stranded dna to the   ends via reverse transcription of a defined template region of its rna subunit to further understand the telomerase elongation mechanism we studied the primer utilization and extension activity of the telomerase from the budding yeast naumovozyma castellii saccharomyces castellii  which displays a processive nucleotide and repeat addition polymerization for the efficient initiation of canonical elongation telomerase required  nt primer   end complementarity to the template rna this dna  rna hybrid formation was highly important for the stabilization of an initiation competent telomerase  dna complex anchor site interactions with the dna provided additional stabilization to the complex our studies indicate three additional separate interactions along the length of the dna primer each providing different and distinct contributions to the initiation event a sequence independent anchor site interaction acts immediately adjacent to the base pairing   end indicating a protein anchor site positioned very close to the catalytic site two additional anchor regions further   on the dna provide sequence specific contributions to the initiation of elongation remarkably a non telomeric sequence in the distal   to  nt region negatively influences the initiation of telomerase elongation suggesting an anchor site with a regulatory role in the telomerase elongation decision
