metabolic pathfinding using rpair annotation
metabolic databases contain information about thousands of small molecules and reactions which can be represented as networks in the context of metabolic reconstruction pathways can be inferred by searching optimal paths in such networks a recurrent problem is the presence of pool metabolites e g  water energy carriers and cofactors  which are connected to hundreds of reactions thus establishing irrelevant shortcuts between nodes of the network one solution to this problem relies on weighted networks to penalize highly connected compounds a more refined solution takes the chemical structure of reactants into account in order to differentiate between side and main compounds of a reaction thanks to an intensive annotation effort at kegg decompositions of reactions into reactant pairs rpair categorized by their role main trans cofac ligase and leave are now available the goal of this article is to evaluate the impact of rpair data on pathfinding in metabolic networks to this end we measure the impact of different parameters concerning the construction of the metabolic network mapping of reactions and reactant pairs onto a graph use of selected categories of reactant pairs weighting schemes for compounds and reactions removal of highly connected metabolites and reaction directionality in total we tested   combinations of parameters and identified their optimal values for pathfinding on the basis of  reference pathways from three organisms the best performing metabolic network combines the biochemical knowledge encoded by kegg rpair with a weighting scheme penalizing highly connected compounds with this network we could recover reference pathways from escherichia coli with an average accuracy of     pathways  from saccharomyces cerevisiae with an average accuracy of     pathways  and from humans with an average accuracy of     pathways  our pathfinding approach is available as part of the network analysis tools
