inhibition of hiv  entry before gp  folds into its fusion active conformation edited by j karn
hiv  entry into its host cell is modulated by its transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp   the core of the activated conformation of gp  consists of a trimer of heterodimers comprising a leucine isoleucine zipper sequence represented here by the synthetic peptide n  or by the longer n  peptide and a c terminal highly conserved region represented here by c   a correlation was found between the action of dp   which is a potent inhibitor of hiv  entry into its host cell and its ability to interact with the leucine isoleucine zipper sequence this correlation was further tested and confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy we found that whereas dp  perturbs the partial  helix nature of peptides corresponding to the leucine isoleucine zipper sequence n  or n   it cannot perturb the trimer of heterodimers conformation modeled by the complex of n  or n  with c  therefore we suggest that the already formed trimer of heterodimers is not the target of inhibition by dp   our results are consistent with a model in which dp  acquires its inhibitory activity by binding to an earlier intermediate of gp  in which the n and c peptide regions are not yet associated thus allowing dp  to bind to the leucine isoleucine zipper sequence and consequently to inhibit transition to the fusion active conformation
