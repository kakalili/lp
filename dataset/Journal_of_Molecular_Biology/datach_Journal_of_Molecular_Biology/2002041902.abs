an ensemble of theta class glutathione transferases with novel catalytic properties generated by stochastic recombination of fragments of two mammalian enzymes
the correlation between sequence diversity and enzymatic function was studied in a library of theta class glutathione transferases gsts obtained by stochastic recombination of fragments of cdna encoding human gst t  and rat gst t   in all   randomly picked clones were characterized with respect to sequence expression level and catalytic activity in the conjugation reactions between glutathione and six alternative electrophilic substrates out of these six different compounds dichloromethane is a selective substrate for human gst t   whereas  menaphthyl sulfate and  chloro   dinitrobenzene are substrates for rat gst t   the other three substances serve as substrates for both enzymes through this broad characterization we have identified enzyme variants that have acquired novel activity profiles that differ substantially from those of the original gsts in addition the expression levels of many clones were improved in comparison to the parental enzyme a library of mutants can thus display a distribution of properties from which highly divergent evolutionary pathways may emerge resembling natural evolutionary processes from the gst library a clone was identified that by the point mutation n d in the rat gst t  sequence has a    increased activity with  menaphthyl sulfate and a   decreased activity with  nitrophenethyl bromide through the n d mutation the ratio of these activities has thus been altered  fold an extensive characterization of a population of stochastically mutated enzymes can accordingly be used to find variants with novel substrate activity profiles and altered catalytic properties recursive recombination of selected sequences displaying optimized properties is a strategy for the engineering of proteins for medical and biochemical applications such sequential design is combinatorial protein chemistry based on remodeling of existing structural scaffolds and has similarities to evolutionary processes in nature
