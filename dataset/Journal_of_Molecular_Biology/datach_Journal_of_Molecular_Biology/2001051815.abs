unconventional mrna processing in the expression of two calcineurin b isoforms in dictyostelium edited by j karn
the genome of dictyostelium discoideum contains a single gene cnba for the regulatory b subunit of the ca  calmodulin dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin cn  two mrna species and two protein products differing in size were found the apparent molecular masses of the protein isoforms corresponded to translation products starting from the first and second aug codons of the primary transcript respectively the smaller mrna and protein isoforms accumulated during early differentiation of the cells whereas the amount of the higher molecular mass protein isoform remained constant throughout development the larger mrna disappeared to virtually undetectable levels during aggregation   race amplification of the smaller transcript yielded cdnas lacking the   non translated region and the first atg initiator codon expression of truncated cdnas and various chimeric genes encoding cnb green fluorescent protein fusions in dictyostelium indicate that the mature cnba transcript is processed by an unconventional mechanism that leads to truncation of the   untranslated region and at least the first aug initiator codon and to utilization of the second aug codon for translation initiation of the small cnb isoform determinants for this processing mechanism reside within the coding region of the cnba gene
