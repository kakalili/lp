structural characterization of the rlck family member bsk  a pseudokinase with an unprecedented architecture
brassinosteroid signaling kinases bsks are plant specific receptor like cytoplasmic protein kinases involved in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway unlike common protein kinases they possess a naturally occurring alanine residue at the  gatekeeper  position as well as other sequence variations how bsks activate downstream proteins such as bsu  as well as the structural consequences of their unusual sequential features was unclear we crystallized the catalytic domain of bsk and solved its structure by multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods to a resolution of    in addition a co crystal structure of bsk with  adenylyl imidodiphosphate amp pnp revealed unusual conformational arrangements of the nucleotide phosphate groups and catalytic key motifs typically not observed for active protein kinases sequential analysis and comparisons with known pseudokinase structures suggest that bsks represent constitutively inactive protein kinases that regulate brassinosteroid signal transfer through an allosteric mechanism
