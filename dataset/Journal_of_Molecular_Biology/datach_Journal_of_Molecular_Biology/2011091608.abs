conformation effects of base modification on the anticodon stem  loop of bacillus subtilis trnatyr
trna molecules contain  chemically unique nucleotide base modifications that expand the chemical and biophysical diversity of rna and contribute to the overall fitness of the cell nucleotide modifications of trna confer fidelity and efficiency to translation and are important in trna dependent rna mediated regulatory processes the three dimensional structure of the anticodon is crucial to trna  mrna specificity and the diverse modifications of nucleotide bases in the anticodon region modulate this specificity we have determined the solution structures and thermodynamic properties of bacillus subtilis trnatyr anticodon arms containing the natural base modifications n dimethylallyl adenine i a  and pseudouridine     uv melting and differential scanning calorimetry indicate that the modifications stabilize the stem and may enhance base stacking in the loop the i a  modification disrupts the hydrogen bond network of the unmodified anticodon loop including a c   a  base pair and an a   u  base  base interaction although the i a  modification increases the dynamic nature of the loop nucleotides metal ion coordination reestablishes conformational homogeneity interestingly the i a  modification and mg  are sufficient to promote the u turn fold of the anticodon loop of escherichia coli trnaphe but these elements do not result in this signature feature of the anticodon loop in trnatyr
