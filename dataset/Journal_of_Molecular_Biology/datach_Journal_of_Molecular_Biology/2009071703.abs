secondary structures for   regions of r retrotransposon rnas reveal a novel conserved pseudoknot and regions that evolve under different constraints
sequences from the   region of r retrotransposons of four species of silk moth are reported in bombyx mori this region of the r messenger rna contains a binding site for r protein and mediates interactions critical to r element insertion into the host genome a model of secondary structure for a segment of this rna is proposed on the basis of binding to oligonucleotide microarrays chemical mapping and comparative sequence analysis five conserved secondary structures are identified including a novel pseudoknot there is an apparent transition from an entirely rna structure coding function in most of the   segment to a protein coding function near the   end this suggests that local regions evolved under separate functional constraints structural coding or both
