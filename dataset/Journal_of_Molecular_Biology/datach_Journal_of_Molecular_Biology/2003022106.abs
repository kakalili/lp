crystal structure of stefin a in complex with cathepsin h n terminal residues of inhibitors can adapt to the active sites of endo and exopeptidases
binding of cystatin type inhibitors to papain like exopeptidases cannot be explained by the stefin b  papain complex the crystal structure of human stefin a bound to an aminopeptidase porcine cathepsin h has been determined in monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms at    and    resolutions respectively the asymmetric unit of each form contains four complexes the structures are similar to the stefin b  papain complex but with a few distinct differences on binding the n terminal residues of stefin a adopt the form of a hook which pushes away cathepsin h mini chain residues and distorts the structure of the short four residue insertion lys  a  asp  d unique to cathepsin h comparison with the structure of isolated cathepsin h shows that the rims of the cathepsin h structure are slightly displaced up to   from their position in the free enzyme furthermore comparison with the stefin b  papain complex showed that molecules of stefin a bind about    deeper into the active site cleft of cathepsin h than stefin b into papain the approach of stefin a to cathepsin h induces structural changes along the interaction surface of both molecules whereas no such changes were observed in the stefin b  papain complex carboxymethylation of papain seems to have prevented the formation of the genuine binding geometry between a papain like enzyme and a cystatin type inhibitor as we observe it in the structure presented here
