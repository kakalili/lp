short arm region of laminin    chain structure mechanism of processing and binding to heparin and proteins edited by m f moody
laminin  is a typical component of several epithelial tissues and contains a unique   chain which can be proteolytically processed by bmp  this occurs in the n terminal half of the   chain   residues  which consists of two rod like tandem arrays of le modules le  and le   that flank a globular l m module containing the cleavage site recombinant analysis of l m which includes an additional imperfect le module essential for proper folding demonstrated an unusual pattern of disulfide bonding these connectivities prevented the release of  le  l m after bmp  cleavage which required in addition disulfide reshuffling by isomerases the liberated segment bound through its l m module to heparin nidogen  fibulin  and fibulin  a further heparin sulfatide binding site could be attributed to some arginine residues in module le  the  le  segment remaining in processed laminin  showed only a strong binding to fibulin  immunological studies showed a similar partial processing in cell culture and tissues and the persistence of the released fragment in tissues this indicated that both n terminal regions of the   chain may have a function in vivo
