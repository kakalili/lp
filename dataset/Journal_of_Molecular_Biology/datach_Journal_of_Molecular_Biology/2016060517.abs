angstrom zinc free apobec f catalytic domain crystal structure
the apobec family of dna cytosine deaminases is capable of restricting the replication of hiv  and other pathogens here we report a     resolution crystal structure of the vif binding and catalytic domain of apobec f a f  this structure is distinct from the previously published apobec and phylogenetically related deaminase structures as it is the first without zinc in the active site we determined an additional structure containing zinc in the same crystal form that allows direct comparison with the zinc free structure in the absence of zinc the conserved active site residues that normally participate in zinc coordination show unique conformations including a  degree rotation of his  and disulfide bond formation between cys  and cys   we found that zinc coordination is influenced by ph and treating the protein at low ph in crystallization buffer is sufficient to remove zinc zinc coordination and catalytic activity are reconstituted with the addition of zinc only in a reduced environment likely due to the two active site cysteines readily forming a disulfide bond when not coordinating zinc we show that the enzyme is active in the presence of zinc and cobalt but not with other divalent metals these results unexpectedly demonstrate that zinc is not required for the structural integrity of a f and suggest that metal coordination may be a strategy for regulating the activity of a f and related deaminases
