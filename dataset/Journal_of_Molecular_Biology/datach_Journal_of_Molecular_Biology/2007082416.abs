formation of amyloids by a      on ngf differentiated pc  cells roles of gangliosides and cholesterol
the conversion of soluble non toxic amyloid  protein a  to aggregated toxic a  could be the key step in the development of alzheimer s disease liposomal studies have proposed that a      preferentially recognizes a cholesterol dependent cluster of gangliosides and a conformationally altered form of a  promotes the aggregation of the protein cell experiments using fluorescein labeled a      supported this model here the interaction of native a      with unfixed rat pheochromocytoma pc  cells was visualized using the amyloid specific dye congo red a      preferentially bound to ganglioside and cholesterol rich domains of cell membranes and formed amyloids in a time dependent manner these observations corroborate the model involving ganglioside mediated accumulation of a  the ngf induced differentiation of pc  cells into neuron like cells caused a marked increase in both gangliosides and cholesterol and thereby greatly potentiated the accumulation and cytotoxicity of a       ngf differentiated cells exposed to a      had degenerated neurites in which ganglioside and cholesterol rich domains were localized preceding cell death a reduction in the amount of cholesterol by the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor compactin almost nullified the formation of amyloids by a       our system using ngf differentiated pc  cells and congo red is useful for screening inhibitors of the formation of amyloids by and cytotoxicity of a
