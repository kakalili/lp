monomer and dimer of chandipura virus unphosphorylated p protein binds leader rna differently implications for viral rna synthesis
interaction of the leader rna with the unphosphorylated p protein has been proposed to play a key role in the transcription  replication transition of chandipura virus a model rhabdovirus electrophoretic mobility shift assay with the leader rna and the unphosphorylated p protein demonstrated existence of two distinct complexes in vitro measurements of stoichiometry indicate the protein monomer rna ratio to be   and   for faster and slower migrating bands respectively we have also observed a concentration dependent oligomerization of the unphosphorylated p protein in sub micromolar to low micromolar range sedimentation velocity dynamic light scattering and large zone gel filtration experiments suggest a monomer  dimer  tetramer model of association rna binding experiments suggest that the two complexes assembled from one molecule of the leader rna binding to either a protein monomer or a dimer a truncated rna consisting of a   region of the leader transcript exclusively formed the   complex whereas a rna consisting of only the   region forms the   complex exclusively rna binding experiments at different protein concentrations suggest that binding of the rna comprising the   region weakens significantly at higher p concentrations whereas in contrast the binding of the rna comprising the   region becomes modestly tighter implications of two different types of leader rna  p protein complexes in viral rna synthesis are discussed
