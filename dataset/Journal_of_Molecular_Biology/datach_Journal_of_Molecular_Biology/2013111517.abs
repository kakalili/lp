structure dynamics and specificity of endoglucanase d from clostridium cellulovorans
the enzymatic degradation of cellulose is a critical step in the biological conversion of plant biomass into an abundant renewable energy source an understanding of the structural and dynamic features that cellulases utilize to bind a single strand of crystalline cellulose and hydrolyze the    glycosidic bonds of cellulose to produce fermentable sugars would greatly facilitate the engineering of improved cellulases for the large scale conversion of plant biomass endoglucanase d engd from clostridium cellulovorans is a modular enzyme comprising an n terminal catalytic domain and a c terminal carbohydrate binding module which is attached via a flexible linker here we present the    resolution crystal structures of full length engd with and without cellotriose bound solution small angle x ray scattering saxs studies of the full length enzyme the characterization of the active cleft glucose binding subsites and substrate specificity of engd on soluble and insoluble polymeric carbohydrates saxs data support a model in which the linker is flexible allowing engd to adopt an extended conformation in solution the cellotriose bound engd structure revealed an extended active site cleft that contains seven glucose binding subsites but unlike the majority of structurally determined endocellulases the active site cleft of engd is partially enclosed by trp  and tyr   engd variants which lack trp   showed a significant reduction in activity and an alteration in the distribution of cellohexaose degradation products suggesting that trp  plays a direct role in substrate binding
