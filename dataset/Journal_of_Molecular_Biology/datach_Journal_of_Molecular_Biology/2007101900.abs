the rough energy landscape of superfolder gfp is linked to the chromophore
many green fluorescent protein gfp variants have been developed for use as fluorescent tags and recently a superfolder gfp sfgfp has been developed as a robust folding reporter this new variant shows increased stability and improved folding kinetics as well as   recovery of native protein after denaturation here we characterize sfgfp and find that this variant exhibits hysteresis as unfolding and refolding equilibrium titration curves are non coincident even after equilibration for more than eight half lives as estimated from kinetic unfolding and refolding studies this hysteresis is attributed to trapping in a native like intermediate state mutational studies directed towards inhibiting chromophore formation indicate that the novel backbone cyclization is responsible for the hysteresis observed in equilibrium titrations of sfgfp slow equilibration and the presence of intermediates imply a rough landscape however de novo folding in the absence of the chromophore is dominated by a smoother energy landscape than that sampled during unfolding and refolding of the post translationally modified polypeptide
