expression of mitochondrial protein coding genes in tetrahymena pyriformis edited by m yaniv
in the ciliate protozoon tetrahymena pyriformis mitochondrial protein coding genes are highly divergent in sequence and in a number of cases they lack aug initiation codons we asked whether rna editing might be acting to generate protein sequences that are more conventional than those inferred from the corresponding gene sequences and or to create standard aug initiation codons where these are absent however comparison of genomic and cdna sequences the latter generated by reverse transcriptase sequencing of t pyriformis mitochondrial mrnas yielded no evidence of mitochondrial rna editing in this organism to delineate the   ends of mitochondrial protein coding transcripts primer extension experiments were conducted in all cases    termini were found to map within a few nucleotides of potential initiation codons indicating that t pyriformis mitochondrial mrnas have little or no   untranslated leader sequence the pattern of strong primer extension stops suggested that both standard aug and non standard auu aua gug uug initiation codons are utilized by the tetrahymena mitochondrial translation system we also investigated expression of the nad gene which in both t pyriformis and paramecium aurelia is split into two portions that are encoded by and transcribed from different dna strands northern hybridization analysis showed that the corresponding transcripts are not trans spliced implying that separate n terminal and c terminal portions of nad are made in this system finally in a search for primary transcripts we isolated from a t pyriformis mitochondrial fraction several small rnas that were reproducibly labeled by incubation in the presence of    p gtp and guanylyltransferase partial sequence information revealed that none of these cappable rnas is encoded in the t pyriformis mitochondrial genome
