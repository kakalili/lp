mechanisms of ataxin  misfolding and fibril formation kinetic analysis of a disease associated polyglutamine protein
the polyglutamine diseases are a family of nine proteins where intracellular protein misfolding and amyloid like fibril formation are intrinsically coupled to disease previously we identified a complex two step mechanism of fibril formation of pathologically expanded ataxin  the causative protein of spinocerebellar ataxia type  machado joseph disease  strikingly ataxin  lacking a polyglutamine tract also formed fibrils although this occurred only via a single step that was homologous to the first step of expanded ataxin  fibril formation here we present the first kinetic analysis of a disease associated polyglutamine repeat protein we show that ataxin  forms amyloid like fibrils by a nucleation dependent polymerization mechanism we kinetically model the nucleating event in ataxin  fibrillogenesis to the formation of a monomeric thermodynamic nucleus fibril elongation then proceeds by a mechanism of monomer addition the presence of an expanded polyglutamine tract leads subsequently to rapid inter fibril association and formation of large highly stable amyloid like fibrils these results enhance our general understanding of polyglutamine fibrillogenesis and highlights the role of non poly q domains in modulating the kinetics of misfolding in this family
