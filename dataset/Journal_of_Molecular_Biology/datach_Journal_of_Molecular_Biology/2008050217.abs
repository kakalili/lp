assessing side chain perturbations of the protein backbone a knowledge based classification of residue ramachandran space
grouping the  residues is a classic strategy to discover ordered patterns and insights about the fundamental nature of proteins their structure and how they fold usually this categorization is based on the biophysical and or structural properties of a residue s side chain group we extend this approach to understand the effects of side chains on backbone conformation and to perform a knowledge based classification of amino acids by comparing their backbone    distributions in different types of secondary structure at this finer more specific resolution torsion angle data are often sparse and discontinuous especially for nonhelical classes even though a comprehensive set of protein structures is used to ensure the precision of ramachandran plot comparisons we applied a rigorous bayesian density estimation method that produces continuous estimates of the backbone    distributions based on this statistical modeling a robust hierarchical clustering was performed using a divergence score to measure the similarity between plots there were seven general groups based on the clusters from the complete ramachandran data nonpolar  branched ile and val  asx asn and asp  long met gln arg glu lys and leu  aromatic phe tyr his and cys  small ala and ser  bulky thr and trp  and lastly the singletons of gly and pro at the level of secondary structure helix sheet turn and coil  these groups remain somewhat consistent although there are a few significant variations besides the expected uniqueness of the gly and pro distributions the nonpolar  branched and asx clusters were very consistent across all types of secondary structure effectively this consistency across the secondary structure classes implies that side chain steric effects strongly influence a residue s backbone torsion angle conformation these results help to explain the plasticity of amino acid substitutions on protein structure and should help in protein design and structure evaluation
