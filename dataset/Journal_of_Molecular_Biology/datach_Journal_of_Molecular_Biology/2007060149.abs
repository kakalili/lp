fluorescence correlation spectroscopic study of serpin depolymerization by computationally designed peptides
members of the serine proteinase inhibitor serpin family play important roles in the inflammatory and coagulation cascades interaction of a serpin with its target proteinase induces a large conformational change resulting in insertion of its reactive center loop rcl into the main body of the protein as a new strand within  sheet a intermolecular insertion of the rcl of one serpin molecule into the  sheet a of another leads to polymerization a widespread phenomenon associated with a general class of diseases known as serpinopathies small peptides are known to modulate the polymerization process by binding within  sheet a here we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs to probe the mechanism of peptide modulation of   antitrypsin   at polymerization and depolymerization and employ a statistical computationally assisted design strategy scads to identify new tetrapeptides that modulate polymerization our results demonstrate that peptide induced depolymerization takes place via a heterogeneous multi step process that begins with internal fragmentation of the polymer chain one of the designed tetrapeptides is the most potent antitrypsin depolymerizer yet found
