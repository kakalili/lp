a microbeam x ray diffraction study of insulin spherulites
the peptide hormone insulin forms a spherical aggregate called a spherulite at low ph and high temperature a spherulite is composed of a core and many fibrils extending from it these fibrils are thought to be amyloid fibers with a  sheet structure in the present study spherulites with a diameter of       m were examined by x ray fiber diffraction using a   m beam when a spherulite was scanned with the microbeam and the observed diffraction patterns were arranged in a two dimensional array the direction of the scatter was centrosymmetric demonstrating a symmetric growth of fibrils there were diffraction peaks at bragg spacings of   nm    nm and   nm in the direction perpendicular to the fibrils and    nm along the fibrils the    nm reflection shows that the hydrogen bonds between  strands are along the fibril the   nm reflection corresponds to the separation between fibrils the   nm reflection is due to the arrangement of protofilaments and the   nm reflection arises from the arrangement of peptide chains on the basis of these results a model of a fibril with an extended insulin molecule is proposed
