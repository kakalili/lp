mechanism of regulation of transcription initiation by ppgpp i effects of ppgpp on transcription initiation in vivo and in vitro edited by r ebright
to determine the role of ppgpp in both negative and positive regulation of transcription initiation during exponential growth in escherichia coli we examined transcription in vivoand in vitro from the growth rate dependent rrna promoter rrnb p and from the inversely growth rate dependent amino acid biosynthesis transport promoters pargi phisg plysc pphea pthrabc and plivj rrnb p promoter activity was slightly higher at all growth rates in strains unable to synthesize ppgpp  rela spot than in wild type strains consistent with this observation and with the large decrease in rrna transcription during the stringent response when ppgpp levels are much higher  ppgpp inhibited transcription from rrnb p in vitro in contrast amino acid promoter activity was considerably lower in  rela spot strains than in wild type strains but ppgpp had no effect on amino acid promoter activity in vitro detailed kinetic analysis in vitroindicated that open complexes at amino acid promoters formed much more slowly and were much longer lived than rrnb p open complexes ppgpp did not increase the rates of association with or escape from amino acid promoters in vitro consistent with its failure to stimulate transcription directly in contrast ppgpp decreased the half lives of open complexes at all promoters whether the half life was seconds rrnb p  or hours amino acid promoters  the results described here and in the accompanying paper indicate that ppgpp directly inhibits transcription but only from promoters like rrnb p that make short lived open complexes the results indicate that stimulation of amino acid promoters occurs indirectly the accompanying paper evaluates potential models for positive control of amino acid promoters by ppgpp that might explain the requirement of ppgpp for amino acid prototrophy
