mapping the transition state for dna bending by ihf
how dna bending proteins recognize their specific sites on dna remains elusive particularly for proteins that use indirect readout which relies on sequence dependent variations in dna flexibility bendability the question remains as to whether the protein bends the dna protein induced bending or alternatively   prebent  dna conformations are thermally accessible which the protein captures to form the specific complex conformational capture  to distinguish between these mechanisms requires characterization of reaction intermediates and in particular snapshots of the transition state along the recognition pathway we present such a snapshot from measurements of dna bending dynamics in complex with escherichia coli integration host factor ihf  an architectural protein that bends specific sites on  dna in a u turn by creating two sharp kinks in dna fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in response to laser temperature jump perturbation monitor dna bending we find that nicks or mismatches that enhance dna flexibility at the site of the kinks show  to  fold increase in dna bending rates that reflect a  to  fold increase in binding affinities while sequence modifications away from the kink sites as well as mutations in ihf designed to destabilize the complex have negligible effect on dna bending rates despite gt   fold decrease in binding affinities these results support the scenario that the bottleneck in the recognition step for ihf is spontaneous kinking of cognate dna to adopt a partially prebent conformation and point to conformational capture as the underlying mechanism of initial recognition with additional protein induced bending occurring after the transition state
