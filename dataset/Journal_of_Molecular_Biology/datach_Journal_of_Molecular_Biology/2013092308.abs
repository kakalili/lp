thermodynamic and structural determinants of differential pdx binding to elements from the insulin and iapp promoters
in adult mammals the production of insulin and other peptide hormones such as the islet amyloid polypeptide iapp  is limited to  cells due to tissue specific expression of a set of transcription factors the best known of which is pancreatic duodenal homeobox protein  pdx  like many homeodomain transcription factors pdx binds to a core dna recognition sequence containing the tetranucleotide   taat    its consensus recognition element is   ctctaat t g ag    currently a complete thermodynamic profile of pdx binding to near consensus and native promoter sequences has not been established obscuring the mechanism of target site selection by this critical transcription factor strikingly while pdx responsive elements in the human insulin promoter conform to the pentanucleotide   ctaat   sequence the pdx responsive elements in the human iapp promoter all contain a substitution to   ttaat    the crystal structure of pdx bound to the consensus nucleotide sequence does not explain how pdx identifies this natural variation if it does at all here we report a combination of isothermal calorimetric titrations nmr spectroscopy and extensive multi microsecond molecular dynamics calculations of pdx that define its interactions with a panel of natural promoter elements and consensus derived sequences our results show a small preference of pdx for a c base   relative to the core taat promoter element molecular mechanics calculations corroborated by experimental nmr data lead to a rational explanation for sequence discrimination at this position taken together our results suggest a molecular mechanism for differential pdx affinity to elements from the insulin and iapp promoter sequences
