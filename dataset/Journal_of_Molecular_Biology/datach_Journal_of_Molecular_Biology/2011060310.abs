reexamination of the role of interplay between glutathione and protein disulfide isomerase
protein disulfide isomerase pdi has an essential role in the process of disulfide bond formation where it catalyzes disulfide bond formation reduction and isomerization it is thought that the major route for oxidizing dithiols in folding proteins to disulfides is via ero mediated oxidation of pdi since the discovery of ero  the role of glutathione in disulfide bond formation has been downplayed in this study the role of glutathione in disulfide bond formation was reexamined here we have studied in vitro the kinetics of the glutathione mediated oxidation and reduction of the catalytic a domains of human pdi and yeast pdi p the results obtained from stopped flow and quenched flow experiments show that the reactions of pdi and pdi p are faster and more complex than previously thought our results suggest that the kinetics of oxidation of pdi and pdi p by oxidized glutathione are remarkably similar whereas the kinetics of reduction by reduced glutathione shows clear differences the data generated here on the rapid reactivity of pdi towards glutathione suggest that reevaluation is required for several aspects of the field of catalyzed disulfide bond formation including the potential physiological role of glutathione
