an integrated approach to the analysis and modeling of protein sequences and structures ii on the relationship between sequence and structural similarity for proteins that are not obviously related in sequence edited by f cohen
here we discuss the relationship between protein sequence and protein structural similarity it is established that a protein structural distance psd of   is a threshold above which two proteins are unlikely to have a detectable pairwise sequence relationship a precise correlation is established between the level of sequence similarity defined by a normalized smith waterman score and the probability that two proteins will have a similar structure defined by pairwise psd lt   this correlation can be used in evaluating the likelihood for success in a comparative modeling procedure we establish the existence of a correlation between sequence and structural similarity for pairs of proteins that are related in structure but whose sequence relationship is not detectable using standard pairwise sequence alignments although it is well known that there is a close relationship between sequence and structural similarity for pairwise sequence identities greater than about    there has been little discussion as to the possible existence of such a relationship for pairs of proteins in or below the twilight zone of sequence similarity  lt   pairwise sequence identity  possible implications of our results for the evolution of protein structure are discussed
