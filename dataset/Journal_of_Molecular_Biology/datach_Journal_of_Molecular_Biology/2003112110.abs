tetramerization and dna ligase iv interaction of the dna double strand break repair protein xrcc are mutually exclusive
the xrcc protein is of critical importance for the repair of broken chromosomal dna by non homologous end joining nhej  the absence of xrcc abolishes chromosomal nhej almost completely one reason for this severe phenotype is that xrcc binds and modulates the stability and activity of the nhej specific ligase dna ligase iv xrcc in solution is in equilibrium between the dimeric and tetrameric forms previous structural studies have shown that the interface between dimers is located in the same region as that implicated in dna ligase iv interaction with the use of equilibrium sedimentation analysis we show here that only the xrcc dimer can associate with dna ligase iv forming a monodisperse complex of   stoichiometry in solution in addition physical analysis of xrcc dna ligase iv complex formation combined with mutational analysis of xrcc  indicates that tetramerization and dna ligase iv binding are mutually exclusive we propose that the putative function of the xrcc tetramer is distinct from its dna ligase iv associated function
