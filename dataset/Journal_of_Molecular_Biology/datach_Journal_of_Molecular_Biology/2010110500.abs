dhpc strongly affects the structure and oligomerization propensity of alzheimer s a      peptide
alzheimer s disease ad is thought to depend on the deleterious action of amyloid fibrils or oligomers derived from  amyloid a  peptide out of various known a  alloforms the  residue peptide a      occurs at highest concentrations inside the brains of ad patients its aggregation properties critically depend on lipids and it was thus proposed that lipids could play a major role in ad to better understand their possible effects on the structure of a  and on the ability of this peptide to form potentially detrimental amyloid structures we here analyze the interactions between a      and   dihexanoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dhpc  dhpc has served due to its controlled properties as a major model system for studying general lipid properties here we show that dhpc concentrations of  mm or higher exert dramatic effects on the conformation of soluble a      peptide and induce the formation of  sheet structure at high levels by contrast we find that dhpc concentrations well below the critical micelle concentration present no discernible effect on the conformation of soluble a  although they substantially affect the peptide s oligomerization and fibrillation kinetics these data imply that subtle lipid peptide interactions suffice in controlling the overall aggregation properties and drastically accelerate or delay the fibrillation kinetics of a  peptide in near physiological buffer solutions
