Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study how protein solution structure and dynamics are affected by adaptation to high temperature. Simulations were carried out on a para-nitrobenzyl esterase (484 residues) and two thermostable variants that were generated by laboratory evolution. Although these variants display much higher melting temperatures than wild-type (up to 18°C higher) they are both &gt;97% identical in sequence to the wild-type. In simulations at 300K the thermostable variants remain closer to their crystal structures than wild-type. However, they also display increased fluctuations about their time-averaged structures. Additionally, both variants show a small but significant increase in radius of gyration relative to wild-type. The vibrational density of states was calculated for each of the esterases. While the density of states profiles are similar overall, both thermostable mutants show increased populations of the very lowest frequency modes (&lt;10cm−1), with the more stable mutant showing the larger increase. This indicates that the thermally stable variants experience increased concerted motions relative to wild-type. Taken together, these data suggest that adaptation for high temperature stability has resulted in a restriction of large deviations from the native state and a corresponding increase in smaller scale fluctuations about the native state. These fluctuations contribute to entropy and hence to the stability of the native state. The largest changes in localized dynamics occur in surface loops, while other regions, particularly the active site residues, remain essentially unchanged. Several mutations, most notably L313F and H322Y in variant 8G8, are in the region showing the largest increase in fluctuations, suggesting that these mutations confer more flexibility to the loops. As a validation of our simulations, the fluctuations of Trp102 were examined in detail, and compared with Trp102 phosphorescence lifetimes that were previously measured. Consistent with expectations from the theory of phosphorescence, an inverse correlation between out-of-plane fluctuations on the picosecond time scale and phosphorescence lifetime was observed.
