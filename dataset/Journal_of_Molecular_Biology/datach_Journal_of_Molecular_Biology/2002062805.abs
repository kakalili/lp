the projection domain of map suppresses the microtubule bundling activity of the microtubule binding domain
microtubule associated protein  map  a major map expressed in proliferating non neuronal cells consists of an n terminal projection pj domain and a c terminal microtubule binding mtb domain the pj domain of map is divided into three regions the n terminal acidic region the na region  the multiple kdm repeated sequence region the kdm region  and the b region followed by the mtb domain to investigate roles of the pj domain we prepared three truncated forms of human map with different pj domain lengths pj  pj and mtb with deletion of about one third two third and all of the pj domain respectively and examined their effects on bundle formation of microtubules mts  mts polymerized by full length map were singly distributed as observed by both negative staining electron microscopy and dark field microscopy mts with pj were also separated in solution but became pairs when pelleted by centrifugation pj formed planar two dimensional bundles consisting of several mts the d bundle  mtb induced large bundles of many mts tightly packed without space in between termed the d bundle  to study how the pj domain decreases the bundle forming activity of the mtb domain of map  we made three additional deletion mutants of map  called na mtb kdm mtb and na pj  na mtb and kdm mtb in which the kdm b region and both of na and b regions were deleted respectively were prepared by fusing the na region or kdm region to mtb both of na mtb and kdm mtb suppressed the d bundle formation as effectively as pj  mts polymerized with na pj  the kdm deletion mutant made by adding the na region to pj  were singular and did not become bundles these results indicated that the pj domain kept individual mts separated by suppressing the bundle forming ability of the mtb domain the suppressive activity of the pj domain was correlated with the length but not the amino acid sequence of the pj
