x ray structure of full length annexin  and implications for membrane aggregation edited by d rees
annexins comprise a multigene family of ca  and phospholipid binding proteins they consist of a conserved c terminal or core domain that confers ca  dependent phospholipid binding and an n terminal domain that is variable in sequence and length and responsible for the specific properties of each annexin crystal structures of various annexin core domains have revealed a high degree of similarity from these and other studies it is evident that the core domain harbors the calcium binding sites that interact with the phospholipid headgroups however no structure has been reported of an annexin with a complete n terminal domain we have now solved the crystal structure of such a full length annexin annexin  annexin  is active in membrane aggregation and its refined    structure shows an  helical n terminal domain connected to the core domain by a flexible linker it is surprising that the two  helices present in the n terminal domain of  residues interact intimately with the core domain with the amphipathic helix    of the n terminal domain replacing helix d of repeat iii of the core in turn helix d is unwound into a flap now partially covering the n terminal helix implications for membrane aggregation will be discussed and a model of aggregation based on the structure will be presented
