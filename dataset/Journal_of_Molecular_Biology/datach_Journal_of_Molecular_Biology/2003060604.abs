isolation of proteins that interact with the signal transduction molecule dof and identification of a functional domain conserved between dof and vertebrate bcap
dof is a large molecule essential for signal transduction by the two fgf receptors in drosophila it contains two ankyrin repeats and a coiled coil region but has no other recognisable structural motif dof shares these features with its closest vertebrate relatives the b cell signalling molecules bcap and bank in addition this family of proteins shares a region of homology upstream of the ankyrin repeats which we call the dof bcap bank dbb motif we have identified  proteins that interact with dof in a yeast two hybrid screen these include the drosophila fgf receptor heartless and dof itself we show that the integrity of the dbb motif is required both for dof and for bcap to form dimers analysis of the interactions between a set of deletion constructs of dof and the panel of interactors suggests that dof may adopt different conformations with a folded conformation stabilized by interactions between the dbb motif and the c terminal part of the protein
