functional analysis of kv  and paddle chimera kv channels in planar lipid bilayers
voltage dependent k  kv channels play key roles in shaping electrical signaling in both excitable and nonexcitable cells these channels open and close in response to the voltage changes across the cell membrane many studies have been carried out in order to understand the voltage sensing mechanism our laboratory recently determined the atomic structures of a mammalian kv channel kv  and a mutant of kv  named the  paddle chimera  channel in which the voltage sensor paddle was transferred from kv  to kv   these two structures provide atomic descriptions of voltage dependent channels with unprecedented clarity until now the functional integrity of these two channels biosynthesized in yeast cells has not been assessed here we report the electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of kv  and the paddle chimera channels in planar lipid bilayers we demonstrate that pichia yeast produce  normally functioning  mammalian kv channels with qualitatively similar features to the shaker k channel in the absence of the n terminal inactivation gate and that the paddle chimera mutant channel functions as well as kv   we find however that in several respects the kv  channel exhibits functional properties that are distinct from kv  channels reported in the literature
