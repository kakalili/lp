molecular determinants of substrate specificity in plant   methylthioadenosine nucleosidases
methylthioadenosine mta s adenosylhomocysteine sah nucleosidase mtan is essential for cellular metabolism and development in many bacterial species while the enzyme is found in plants plant mtans appear to select for mta preferentially with little or no affinity for sah to understand what determines substrate specificity in this enzyme mtan homologues from arabidopsis thaliana atmtan and atmtan  which are referred to as atmtn and atmtn in the plant literature have been characterized kinetically while both homologues hydrolyze mta with comparable kinetic parameters only atmtan shows activity towards sah atmtan also has higher catalytic activity towards other substrate analogues with longer   substituents the structures of apo atmtan and its complexes with the substrate and transition state analogues    methylthiotubercidin and formycin a respectively have been determined at        resolution a homology model of atmtan was generated using the atmtan structures comparison of the atmtan and atmtan structures reveals that only three residues in the active site differ between the two enzymes our analysis suggests that two of these residues leu  met  and phe  leu  in atmtan atmtan  likely account for the divergence in specificity of the enzymes comparison of the atmtan and available escherichia coli mtan ecmtan structures suggests that a combination of differences in the   alkylthio binding region and reduced conformational flexibility in the atmtan active site likely contribute to its reduced efficiency in binding substrate analogues with longer   substituents in addition in contrast to ecmtan the active site of atmtan remains solvated in its ligand bound forms as the apparent pka of an amino acid depends on its local environment the putative catalytic acid asp  in atmtan may not be protonated at physiological ph and this suggests the transition state of atmtan  like human mta phosphorylase and streptococcus pneumoniae mtan may be different from that found in ecmtan
