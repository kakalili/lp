four loops of the catalytic domain of factor viia mediate the effect of the first egf like domain substitution on factor viia catalytic activity edited by r huber
the presence of tissue factor is essential for factor viia fviia to reach its full catalytic potential the previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that substitution of the egf domain of factor viia with that of factor ix fvii ixegf a results in a substantial decrease in tf binding affinity and catalytic activity supporting simulations of the solution structures of ca  bound factor viia and fvii ixegf a with tissue factor are provided mutants are generated based on the simulation model to study the effect of egf substitution on catalytic activity the simulations show larger gla egf and egf egf inter domain motions for fvii ixegf a than for factor viia the catalytic domain of the chimeric factor viia has been disturbed and several surface loops in the catalytic domain of fvii ixegf a loop  s      loop       and loop    a    manifest larger position fluctuations than wild type the position of loop  s      of fvii ixegf a near the n terminus insertion site of the catalytic domain shifts relative to factor viia resulting in a slight alteration of the active site the results suggest that these four loops mediate the effect of the egf domain substitution on the s site and catalytic residues to test the model we prepared mutations of these surface loops including four fvii mutants d  a k  a l  a and r  a a fvii mutant with multiple mutations mm  l  a  r  a  d  a and a fvii mutant with loop  s partially deleted loop  sdel the catalytic activities towards a small peptidyl substrate decreased     and  fold for loop  sdela a activated  l  aa and d  aa respectively while mm a lost almost all catalytic activity the combined results of the simulations and mutants provide insight into the mechanism by which tissue factor enhances factor viia catalytic activity
