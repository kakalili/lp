systematic analysis of the twin cx c protein family
the mia   erv disulfide relay system is of high importance for mitochondrial biogenesis most so far identified substrates of this machinery contain either two cysteine x cysteine twin cx c or two cysteine x cysteine twin cx c motifs while the first group is composed of well characterized components of the mitochondrial import machinery the molecular function of twin cx c proteins still remains unclear to systematically characterize this protein family we performed a database search to identify the full complement of cx c proteins in yeast thereby we identified  potential family members which with one exception are conserved among plants fungi and animals among these three represent novel proteins which we named cmc to  for cx c motif containing protein and which we demonstrated to be dependent for import on the mia   erv disulfide relay by testing deletion mutants of all  proteins for function of the respiratory chain we found a critical function of most of these proteins for the assembly or stability of respiratory chain complexes our data suggest that already early during the evolution of eukaryotic cells a multitude of twin cx c proteins developed which exhibit largely nonredundant roles critical for the biogenesis of enzymes of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
