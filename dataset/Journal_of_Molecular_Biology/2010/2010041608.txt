Elongation factor G (EF-G) is one of several GTP hydrolytic proteins (GTPases) that cycles repeatedly on and off the ribosome during protein synthesis in bacterial cells. In the functional cycle of EF-G, hydrolysis of guanosine 5′-triphosphate (GTP) is coupled to tRNA–mRNA translocation in ribosomes. GTP hydrolysis induces conformational rearrangements in two switch elements in the G domain of EF-G and other GTPases. These switch elements are thought to initiate the cascade of events that lead to translocation and EF-G cycling between ribosomes. To further define the coupling mechanism, we developed a new fluorescent approach that can detect intramolecular movements in EF-G. We attached a fluorescent probe to the switch I element (sw1) of Escherichia coli EF-G. We monitored the position of the sw1 probe, relative to another fluorescent probe anchored to the GTP substrate or product, by measuring the distance-dependent, Förster resonance energy transfer between the two probes. By analyzing EF-G trapped at five different functional states in its cycle, we could infer the cyclical movements of sw1 within EF-G. Our results provide evidence for conformational changes in sw1, which help to drive the unidirectional EF-G cycle during protein synthesis. More generally, our approach might also serve to define the conformational dynamics of other GTPases with their cellular receptors.
