structure of an archaeal rna polymerase
related multisubunit rna polymerases rnaps carry out gene transcription in all kingdoms of life since structural information is limited to bacterial and eukaryotic rnaps we determined the cryo electron microscopic structure of the rnap from the thermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus at    resolution comparison with eukaryotic rnap ii reveals a conserved architecture no homologues for subunits rpb and rpb  and significant deviation in the polymerase foot jaws pore and protrusion the structural organization of the archaeal rna polymerase serves as a reference for future structure  function analysis of the transcription mechanism and allows for evolutionary comparisons
