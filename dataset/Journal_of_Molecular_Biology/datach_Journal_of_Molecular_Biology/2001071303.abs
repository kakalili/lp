construction of an escherichia coli knockout strain for functional analysis of trnaasp edited by j karn
the specific aminoacylation of trna is critical for translation of the genetic code a molecular description of aminoacylation requires knowledge of the relevant three dimensional structures biochemical parameters and the structure function relationship of the synthetase and its substrate trna extensive structural and biochemical data are available on the aspartic acid system of escherichia coli but there is a paucity of cellular functional data we have developed a system to overcome this deficiency by engineering an e coli knockout trnaasp strain thereby allowing a penetrating analysis of trnaasp structure and function under conditions that prevail in the cell
