characterization of the regions involved in the calcium induced folding of the intrinsically disordered rtx motifs from the bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin
repeat in toxin rtx motifs are nonapeptide sequences found among numerous virulence factors of gram negative bacteria in the presence of calcium these rtx motifs are able to fold into an idiosyncratic structure called the parallel  roll the adenylate cyclase toxin cyaa produced by bordetella pertussis the causative agent of whooping cough is one of the best characterized rtx cytolysins cyaa contains a c terminal receptor domain rd that mediates toxin binding to the eukaryotic cell receptor the receptor binding domain is composed of about forty rtx motifs organized in five successive blocks i to v  the rtx blocks are separated by non rtx flanking regions of variable lengths it has been shown that block v with its n and c terminal flanking regions constitutes an autonomous subdomain required for the toxicity of cyaa here we investigated the calcium induced biophysical changes of this subdomain to identify the respective contributions of the flanking regions to the folding process of the rtx motifs we showed that the rtx polypeptides in the absence of calcium exhibited the hallmarks of intrinsically disordered proteins and that the c terminal flanking region was critical for the calcium dependent folding of the rtx polypeptides while the n terminal flanking region was not involved furthermore the secondary and tertiary structures were acquired concomitantly upon cooperative binding of several calcium ions this suggests that the rtx polypeptide folding is a two state reaction from a calcium free unfolded state to a folded and compact conformation in which the calcium bound rtx motifs adopt a  roll structure the relevance of these results to the toxin physiology in particular to its secretion is discussed
