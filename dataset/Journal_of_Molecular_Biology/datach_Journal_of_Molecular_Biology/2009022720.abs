the rimp protein is important for maturation of the  s ribosomal subunit
the in vivo assembly of ribosomal subunits requires assistance by auxiliary proteins that are not part of mature ribosomes more such assembly proteins have been identified for the assembly of the  s than for the  s ribosomal subunit here we show that the rimp protein formerly yhbc or p a is important for the maturation of the  s subunit a rimp deletion  rimp   mutant in escherichia coli showed a temperature sensitive growth phenotype as demonstrated by a       and   fold lower growth rate at     and    c respectively compared to a wild type strain the mutant had a reduced amount of  s ribosomes engaged in translation and showed a corresponding increase in the amount of free ribosomal subunits in addition the mutant showed a lower ratio of free  s to  s subunits as well as an accumulation of immature  s rrna compared to a wild type strain indicating a deficiency in the maturation of the  s subunit all of these effects were more pronounced at higher temperatures rimp was found to be associated with free  s subunits but not with free  s subunits or with  s ribosomes the slow growth of the rimp deletion mutant was not suppressed by increased expression of any other known  s maturation factor
