identification of the reca protein loading domain of recbcd enzyme edited by m gottesman
genetic recombination in escherichia coli is stimulated by the recombination hotspot chi    a regulatory element that modifies the activities of the recbcd enzyme and leads to loading of the dna strand exchange protein reca onto the  containing dna strand the recbc enzyme which lacks the recd subunit loads reca protein constitutively in a manner that is independent of   using a truncated recbc enzyme lacking the  kda c terminal domain of the recb subunit we show that this domain is necessary for reca protein loading we propose that this domain harbors a site that interacts with reca protein recruiting it to single stranded dna during unwinding this ability of a translocating enzyme to deliver material reca protein to a specific target site the  sequence parallels that of other cellular motor proteins
