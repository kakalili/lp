the crystal structure of the bifunctional deaminase reductase ribd of the riboflavin biosynthetic pathway in escherichia coli implications for the reductive mechanism
we have determined the crystal structure of the bi functional deaminase reductase enzyme from escherichia coli ecribd that catalyzes two consecutive reactions during riboflavin biosynthesis the polypeptide chain of ecribd is folded into two domains where the d structure of the n terminal domain      is similar to cytosine deaminase and the c terminal domain       is similar to dihydrofolate reductase we showed that ecribd is dimeric and compared our structure to tetrameric ribg an ortholog from bacillus subtilis bsribg  we have also determined the structure of ecribd in two binary complexes with the oxidized cofactor nadp  and with the substrate analogue ribose  phosphate rp  and superposed these two in order to mimic the ternary complex based on this superposition we propose that the invariant asp  initiates the reductive reaction by abstracting a proton from the bound substrate and that the pro r proton from c of the cofactor is transferred to c of the substrate a highly flexible loop is found in the reductase active site       that appears to control cofactor and substrate binding to the reductase active site and was therefore compared to the corresponding met  loop of e coli dihydrofolate reductase ecdhfr  lys   identified by comparing substrate analogue rp  coordination in the reductase active site of ecribd with the homologous reductase from methanocaldococcus jannaschii mjared  is invariant among bacterial ribd enzymes and could contribute to the various pathways taken during riboflavin biosynthesis in bacteria and yeast
