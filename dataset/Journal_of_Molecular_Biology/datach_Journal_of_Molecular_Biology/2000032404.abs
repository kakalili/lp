complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of tetrahymena pyriformis and comparison with paramecium aurelia mitochondrial dna edited by m yaniv
we report the complete nucleotide sequence of the tetrahymena pyriformis mitochondrial genome and a comparison of its gene content and organization with that of paramecium aurelia mtdna t pyriformis mtdna is a linear molecule of    bp     a t excluding telomeric sequences identical tandem repeats of  bp at each end of the genome  in addition to genes encoding the previously described bipartite small and large subunit rrnas the t pyriformis mitochondrial genome contains  protein coding genes that are clearly homologous to genes of defined function in other mtdnas including one yejr that specifies a component of a cytochrome c biogenesis pathway as well t pyriformis mtdna contains  open reading frames of unknown function larger than  codons potentially specifying proteins ranging in size from  to   amino acid residues a total of  of these open reading frames   ciliate specific   are found in p aurelia mtdna whereas the remaining nine appear to be unique to t pyriformis however of the latter five are positionally equivalent and of similar size in the two ciliate mitochondrial genomes suggesting they may also be homologous even though this is not evident from sequence comparisons only eight trna genes encoding seven distinct trnas are found in t pyriformis mtdna formally confirming a long standing proposal that most t pyriformis mitochondrial trnas are nucleus encoded species imported from the cytosol atypical features of mitochondrial gene organization and expression in t pyriformis mtdna include split and rearranged large subunit rrna genes as well as a split nad gene encoding subunit  of nadh dehydrogenase of respiratory complex i whose two segments are located on and transcribed from opposite strands as is also the case in p aurelia gene content and arrangement are very similar in t pyriformis and p aurelia mtdnas the two differing by a limited number of duplication inversion and rearrangement events phylogenetic analyses using concatenated sequences of several mtdna encoded proteins provide high bootstrap support for the monophyly of alveolates ciliates dinoflagellates and apicomplexans and slime molds
