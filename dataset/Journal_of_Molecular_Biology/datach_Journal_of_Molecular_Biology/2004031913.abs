a sensitive predictor for potential gpi lipid modification sites in fungal protein sequences and its application to genome wide studies for aspergillus nidulans candida albicans neurospora crassa saccharomyces cerevisiae and schizosaccharomyces pombe
the fungal transamidase complex that executes glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi lipid anchoring of precursor proteins has overlapping but distinct sequence specificity compared with the animal system therefore a taxon specific prediction tool for the recognition of the c terminal signal in fungal sequences is necessary we have collected a learning set of fungal precursor protein sequences from the literature and fungal proteomes although the general four segment scheme of the recognition signal is maintained also in fungal precursors there are taxon specificities in details a fungal big  predictor has been developed for the assessment of query sequence concordance with fungi specific recognition signal requirements the sensitivity of this predictor is close to   the rate of false positive prediction is in the range of    the fungal big  tool successfully predicts the gas mutation series described by c nuoffer and co workers and recognizes that the human plap c terminus is not a target for the fungal transamidase complex lists of potentially gpi lipid anchored proteins for five fungal proteomes have been generated and the hits have been functionally classified the fungal big  prediction www server as well as precursor lists are available at http  mendel imp univie ac at gpi fungi gpi fungi html
