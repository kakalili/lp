structural elements underlying the high binding affinity of human cytomegalovirus ul  to leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor
human cytomegalovirus hcmv encodes ul  a major histocompatibility complex mhc class i homologue that binds to the leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptor lir   also called ilt cd j lilrb  an inhibitory receptor expressed on myeloid and lymphoid immune cells the molecular basis underlying the high affinity binding of ul  to lir  compared to mhc class i molecules mhc i  is unclear based on a comparative structural analysis of a molecular model of ul  with the crystal structure of the hla a lir  complex we identified three regions in ul  influencing interaction with lir  comparison of the relative binding affinities of mutated ul  proteins to lir  demonstrated the importance of specific residues in each region substitution of residues k  a  and q   localized in the   and   domains respectively reduced binding affinity to lir  nearly by half the model also suggested the formation of an additional disulfide bridge in the   domain of ul  between residues c  and c   not present in mhc i substitution of either cysteine residue prevented association of ul  to  m abolishing binding to lir  all observed differences in binding affinities translated directly into functional consequences in terms of inhibition of ifn  production by t cells mediated through the ul  lir  interaction the larger amount of interacting regions combined with an increased stability of the   and  m domains allow a higher recognition affinity of ul  by lir
