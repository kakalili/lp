different requirements for  region  in bvga activation of the bordetella pertussis promoters pfim and pfhab
bordetella pertussis bvga is a global response regulator that activates virulence genes including adhesin encoding fim and fhab at the fhab promoter pfhab a bvga binding site lies immediately upstream of the    promoter element recognized by region  of the  subunit of rna polymerase rnap  we demonstrate that  region  is required for bvga activation of pfhab a hallmark of class ii activation in contrast the promoter proximal bvga binding site at pfim includes the    region which is composed of a tract of cytosines that lacks specific sequence information we demonstrate that  region  is not required for bvga activation at pfim  nonetheless region  mutations that impair its typical interactions with core and with the    dna affect pfim transcription hydroxyl radical cleavage using rnap with  d  c  febabe positions region  near the    region of pfim  cleavage using rnap with   c  febabe or   c  febabe also positions an  subunit c terminal domain within the    region on a different helical face from the promoter proximal bvga p dimer our results suggest that the    region of pfim accommodates a bvga p dimer an  subunit c terminal domain and  region  molecular modeling suggests how bvga   region  and  might coexist within this dna in a conformation that suggests a novel mechanism of activation
