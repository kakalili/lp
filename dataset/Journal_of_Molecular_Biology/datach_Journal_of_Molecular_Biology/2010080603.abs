partially folded aggregation intermediates of human  d   c  and  s crystallin are recognized and bound by human  b crystallin chaperone
human  crystallins are long lived unusually stable proteins of the eye lens exhibiting duplicated double greek key domains the lens also contains high concentrations of the small heat shock chaperone  crystallin which suppresses aggregation of model substrates in vitro mature onset cataract is believed to represent an aggregated state of partially unfolded and covalently damaged crystallins nonetheless the lack of cell or tissue culture for anucleate lens fibers and the insoluble state of cataract proteins have made it difficult to identify the conformation of the human  crystallin substrate species recognized by human  crystallin the three major human lens monomeric  crystallins  d  c and  s all refold in vitro in the absence of chaperones on dilution from denaturant into buffer however off pathway aggregation of the partially folded intermediates competes with productive refolding incubation with human  b crystallin chaperone during refolding suppressed the aggregation pathways of the three human  crystallin proteins the chaperone did not dissociate or refold the aggregated chains under these conditions the  b crystallin oligomers formed long lived stable complexes with their  d crystallin substrates using  crystallin chaperone variants lacking tryptophans we obtained fluorescence spectra of the chaperone  substrate complex binding of substrate  crystallins with two or three of the four buried tryptophans replaced by phenylalanines showed that the bound substrate remained in a partially folded state with neither domain native like these in vitro results provide support for protein unfolding protein aggregation models for cataract with  crystallin suppressing aggregation of damaged or unfolded proteins through early adulthood but becoming saturated with advancing age
