homology between o linked glcnac transferases and proteins of the glycogen phosphorylase superfamily edited by j thornton
the o linked glcnac transferases ogts are a recently characterized group of largely eukaryotic enzymes that add a single  n acetylglucosamine moiety to specific serine or threonine hydroxyls in humans this process may be part of a sugar regulation mechanism or cellular signaling pathway that is involved in many important diseases such as diabetes cancer and neurodegeneration however no structural information about the human ogt exists except for the identification of tetratricopeptide repeats tpr at the n terminus the locations of substrate binding sites are unknown and the structural basis for this enzyme  s function is not clear here remote homology is reported between the ogts and a large group of diverse sugar processing enzymes including proteins with known structure such as glycogen phosphorylase udp glcnac  epimerase and the glycosyl transferase murg this relationship in conjunction with amino acid similarity spanning the entire length of the sequence implies that the fold of the human ogt consists of two rossmann like domains c terminal to the tpr region a conserved motif in the second rossmann domain points to the udp glcnac donor binding site this conclusion is supported by a combination of statistically significant psi blast hits consensus secondary structure predictions and a fold recognition hit to murg additionally iterative psi blast database searches reveal that proteins homologous to the ogts form a large and diverse superfamily that is termed gpgtf glycogen phosphorylase glycosyl transferase  up to one third of the  functional families in the cazy database a glycosyl transferase classification scheme based on catalytic residue and sequence homology considerations can be unified through this common predicted fold gpgtf homologs constitute a substantial fraction of known proteins    of all non redundant sequences and about   of proteins in the escherichia coli genome are found to belong to the gpgtf superfamily
