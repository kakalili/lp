evolution of the rab family of small gtp binding proteins edited by j thornton
rab proteins are small gtp binding proteins that form the largest family within the ras superfamily rab proteins regulate vesicular trafficking pathways behaving as membrane associated molecular switches here we have identified the complete rab families in the caenorhabditis elegans   members  drosophila melanogaster    homo sapiens   and arabidopsis thaliana    and we defined criteria for annotation of this protein family in each organism we studied sequence conservation patterns and observed that the rabf motifs and the rabsf regions previously described in mammalian rabs are conserved across species this is consistent with conserved recognition mechanisms by general regulators and specific effectors we used phylogenetic analysis and other approaches to reconstruct the multiplication of the rab family and observed that this family shows a strict phylogeny of function as opposed to a phylogeny of species furthermore we observed that rabs co segregating in phylogenetic trees show a pattern of similar cellular localisation and or function therefore animal and fungi rab proteins can be grouped in  rab functional groups  according to their segregating patterns in phylogenetic trees these functional groups reflect similarity of sequence localisation and or function and may also represent shared ancestry rab functional groups can help the understanding of the functional evolution of the rab family in particular and vesicular transport in general and may be used to predict general functions for novel rab sequences
