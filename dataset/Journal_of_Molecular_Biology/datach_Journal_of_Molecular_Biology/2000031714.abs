conformation of the rna polymerase ii c terminal domain circular dichroism of long and short fragments edited by p e wright
the c terminal domain ctd of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii consists of tandemly repeated copies of a heptapeptide with the y s p t s p s consensus sequence this repeat contains two overlapping spxx motifs that can adopt a  turn conformation in addition each ctd repeat contains the pxxp sequence characteristic of the left handed helix of polyproline ii pii found in sh domain ligands and the pxy sequence that is the target for ww domains we have studied ctd fragments using circular dichroism cd to characterize the conformation of the ctd in water and in the hydrogen bond promoting solvent trifluoroethanol tfe  in water an eight repeat fragment is predominantly unordered but at   c has pii and  turn contents estimated to be about   and less than    respectively in   tfe the  turn fraction is estimated to be about    the remainder being unordered and pii conformations the tyr side chains are ordered to a significant extent in   tfe replacement of the fully conserved pro residues by  aminoisobutyric acid leads to a large increase in  turn replacement of ser by ala does not substantially alter the ctd conformation in water or tfe ser replacement by ala increases the pii content in water and affects the conformation in tfe rich solutions phosphorylation of ser and ser has little effect in water but ser affects the conformation in tfe rich solution in much the same way as ser  ala substitution the cd of the full length murine ctd in water is similar to that of the eight repeat fragment indicating little difference in conformation with increasing chain length beyond eight repeats the roles of pii and  turn in the interaction of ctd with its target proteins mediator and rna processing components are discussed the most likely interactions are between pii and ww or sh domains or with some unknown pii binding motif
