dimer formation of a stabilized g  variant a structural and energetic analysis
in previous work a strongly stabilized variant of the   domain of streptococcal protein g g   was obtained by an in vitro selection method this variant termed g  m  contains the four substitutions e v t l t i and n l here we elucidated the molecular basis of the observed strong stabilizations the contributions of these four residues were analyzed individually and in various combinations additional selections with focused g  gene libraries were performed and the crystal structure of g  m was determined all single substitutions e v t l t i and n l stabilize wild type g  by contributions of between   and   kj mol   at    c  hydrophobic residues at positions  and  provide the major contribution to stabilization by enlarging the hydrophobic core of g   they also increase the tendency to form dimers as shown by dependence on the concentration of apparent molecular mass in analytical ultracentrifugation by concentration dependent stability and by a strongly increased van t hoff enthalpy of unfolding the     crystal structure of g  m and nmr measurements in solution provide the explanation for the observed dimer formation it involves a head to head arrangement of two g  m molecules via six intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the two  strands  and   and an adjacent self complementary hydrophobic surface area which is created by the t l and n l substitutions and a large    rotation of the tyr  side chain this removal of hydrophilic groups and the malleability of the created hydrophobic surface provide the basis for the dimer formation of stabilized g  variants
