inhibiting  secretase activity in alzheimer s disease cell models with single chain antibodies specifically targeting app
the amyloid   a  peptide is produced from the amyloid precursor protein app by sequential proteolytic cleavage of app first by  secretase and then by  secretase   site app cleaving enzyme  bace  is the predominant enzyme involved in  secretase processing of app and is a primary therapeutic target for treatment of alzheimer s disease while inhibiting bace  activity has obvious therapeutic advantages bace  also cleaves numerous other substrates with important physiological activity thus blanket inhibition of bace  function may have adverse side effects we isolated a single chain variable fragment scfv from a human based scfv yeast display library that selectively inhibits bace  activity toward app by binding the app substrate at the proteolytic site we selected the ibsec scfv since it recognizes the bace  cleavage site on app but does not bind the adjacent highly antigenic n terminal of a  and thus it will target app but not soluble a  when added to pa cells a mammalian cell line that overexpresses app the ibsec scfv binds app on the cell surface reduces toxicity induced by app overexpression and reduces both intracellular and extracellular a  levels by around   since the ibsec scfv does not contain the antibody fc region this construct does not pose the risk of exacerbating inflammation in the brain as faced with full length monoclonal antibodies for potential therapeutic applications
