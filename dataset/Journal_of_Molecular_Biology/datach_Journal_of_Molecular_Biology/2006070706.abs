the crystal structure of the carboxy terminal domain of human translation initiation factor eif
the carboxy terminal domain ctd of eukaryotic initiation factor  eif  plays a central role in the formation of the multifactor complex mfc  an important intermediate for the  s preinitiation complex assembly the if ctd interacts directly with the translation initiation factors eif  eif   and eif c thus forming together with eif bound met trnaimet the mfc in this work we present the high resolution crystal structure of eif ctd this domain of the protein is exclusively composed out of alpha helices and is homologous to the carboxy terminal domain of eif b   eif b  ctd  the most striking difference in the two structures is an additional carboxy terminal helix in eif  the binding sites of eif   eif and eif were mapped onto the structure eif   and eif bind to non overlapping patches of negative and positive electrostatic potential respectively
