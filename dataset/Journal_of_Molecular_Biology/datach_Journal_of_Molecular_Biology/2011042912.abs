preparation of fully synthetic histone h reveals that acetyl lysine  facilitates protein binding within nucleosomes
posttranslational modification ptm of histones plays a central role in genome regulation engineering histones with defined ptms on one residue or on multiple residues is crucial for understanding their function within nucleosomes and chromatin we introduce a sequential native chemical ligation strategy that is suitable for the preparation of fully synthetic histone proteins allowing for site specific incorporation of varied ptms throughout the sequence we demonstrate this method with the generation of histone h acetylated at lysine   h k ac  h k ac is essential for transcription replication and repair we examined the influence of h k ac on the targeting of a model dna binding factor lexa to a site    bp within the nucleosome we find that h k ac increases lexa binding to its dna target site by  fold at physiological ionic strength we then demonstrate that h k ac facilitates lexa binding by increasing dna unwrapping not by nucleosome repositioning furthermore we find that h k q quantitatively imitates h k ac function together these studies introduce powerful tools for the analysis of histone ptm functions
