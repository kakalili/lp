blocking transcription through a nucleosome with synthetic dna ligands
pyrrole imidazole py im polyamides are synthetic ligands that bind in the minor groove of dna previous studies have established that sites on nucleosomal dna facing away from the histone octamer or even partially facing the histone octamer are fully accessible for molecular recognition by py im polyamides and that nucleosomes remain fully folded upon ligand binding two polyamides that bind within the sea urchin s gene nucleosome positioning sequence inhibit both heat induced nucleosome sliding and transcription by bacteriophage t rna polymerase from the nucleosomal template but not from histone free dna these polyamides prevent repositioning of the histone octamer by rna polymerase and thereby inhibit passage of the elongating polymerase through nucleosomal dna these results establish unambiguously the requirement for octamer mobility for transcription of nucleosomal templates by t rna polymerase
