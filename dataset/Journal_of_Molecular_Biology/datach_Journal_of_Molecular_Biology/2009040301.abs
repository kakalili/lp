insights into how rnase r degrades structured rna analysis of the nuclease domain
rnase r readily degrades highly structured rna whereas its paralogue rnase ii is unable to do so furthermore the nuclease domain of rnase r devoid of all canonical rna binding domains is sufficient for this activity rnase r also binds rna more tightly within its catalytic channel than does rnase ii which is thought to be important for its unique catalytic properties to investigate this idea further certain residues within the nuclease domain channel of rnase r were changed to those found in rnase ii among the many examined we identified one amino acid residue r   that has a significant role in the properties of rnase r conversion of this residue to lysine as found in rnase ii results in weaker substrate binding within the nuclease domain channel longer limit products increased activity against a variety of substrates and a faster substrate on rate most importantly the mutant encounters difficulty in degrading structured rna pausing within a double stranded region additional studies show that degradation of structured substrates is dependent upon temperature suggesting a role for thermal breathing in the mechanism of action of rnase r on the basis of these data we propose a model in which tight binding within the nuclease domain allows rnase r to capitalize on the natural thermal breathing of an rna duplex to degrade structured rnas
