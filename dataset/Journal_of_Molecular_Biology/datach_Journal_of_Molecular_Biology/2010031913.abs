a tag at the carboxy terminus prevents membrane integration of vdac in mammalian mitochondria
barrel proteins are found in the outer membranes of bacteria chloroplasts and mitochondria the evolutionary conserved sorting and assembly machinery sam complex assembles mitochondrial  barrel proteins such as voltage dependent anion selective channel  vdac  into complexes in the outer membrane by recognizing a sorting  signal in the carboxy terminal part of the protein here we show that in mammalian mitochondria masking of the c terminus of  barrel proteins by a tag leads to accumulation of soluble misassembled protein in the intermembrane space which causes mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of membrane potential a similar phenotype is observed if the  signal is shortened removed or when the conserved hydrophobic residues in the  signal are mutated the length of the tag at the c terminus is critical for the assembly of vdac  as well as the amino acid residues at positions        and   of the protein we propose that if the recognition of the  signal or the folding of the  barrel proteins is inhibited the nonassembled protein will accumulate in the intermembrane space aggregate and damage mitochondria this effect offers easy tools for studying the requirements for the membrane assembly of  barrel proteins but also advises caution when interpreting the outcome of the  barrel protein overexpression experiments
