the energetics of the interaction of bamhi endonuclease with its recognition site ggatcc edited by r ebright
the interaction of bamhi endonuclease with dna has been studied crystallographically but has not been characterized rigorously in solution the enzyme binds in solution as a homodimer to its recognition site ggatcc only six base pairs are directly recognized but binding affinity in the absence of the catalytic cofactor mg  increases   fold as oligonucleotide length increases from  to  bp binding is modulated by sequence context outside the recognition site varying about  fold from the bes t gtg or tat to the worst cgg flanking triplets bamhi ecori and ecorv endonucleases all have different context preferences suggesting that context affects binding by influencing the free energy levels of the complexes rather than that of the free dna ethylation interference footprinting in the absence of divalent metal shows a localized and symmetrical pattern of phosphate contacts with strong contacts at npnpnpggaptcc in the presence of mg  first order cleavage rate constants are identical in the two gga half sites are the same for the two nicked intermediates and are unaffected by substrate length in the range    bp dna binding is strongly enhanced by mutations d n e  a or e  k by binding of ca  at the active site or by deletion of the scissile phosphate gpgatcc indicating that a cluster of negative charges at the catalytic site contributes at least   kcal mol of unfavorable binding free energy this electrostatic repulsion destabilizes the enzyme dna complex and favors metal ion binding and progression to the transition state for cleavage
