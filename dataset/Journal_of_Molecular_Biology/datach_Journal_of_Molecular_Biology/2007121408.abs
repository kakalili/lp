opsin stability and folding the role of cys  and abnormal disulfide bond formation in the intradiscal domain
the structure in the extracellular intradiscal domain of rhodopsin surrounding the cys   cys  disulfide bond has been shown to be important for correct folding of this receptor in vivo retinitis pigmentosa misfolding mutants of the apoprotein opsin such as p h misfold as defined by a deficiency in ability to bind  cis retinal and form rhodopsin these mutants also possess an abnormal cys   cys  disulfide bond in the intradiscal domain here by mutating cys  to alanine we eliminate the possibility of forming this abnormal disulfide bond and investigate the effect of combining the c  a mutation with the retinitis pigmentosa mutation p h both the p h and p h c  a double mutant suffer from low expression and poor  cis retinal binding our data suggest that misfolding events occur that do not have an absolute requirement for abnormal cys   cys  disulfide bond formation in the detergent solubilised purified state the c  a mutation allows formation of rhodopsin at wild type wt levels but has interesting effects on protein stability c  a rhodopsin is less thermally stable than wt whereas c  a opsin shows the same ability to regenerate rhodopsin in detergent as wt purified c  a and wt opsins however have contrasting  cis retinal binding kinetics a high proportion of c  a opsin binds  cis retinal with a slow rate that reflects a denatured state of opsin reverting to a fast binding open pocket conformation this slower rate is not observed in a stabilising lipid detergent system   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine chaps in which c  a exhibits wt fast retinal binding we propose that the c  a mutation destabilises the open pocket conformation of opsin in detergent resulting in an equilibrium between correctly folded and denatured states of the protein this equilibrium can be driven towards the correctly folded rhodopsin state by the binding of  cis retinal
