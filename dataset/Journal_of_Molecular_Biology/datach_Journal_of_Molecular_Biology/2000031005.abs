conformational changes preceding decapsidation of bromegrass mosaic virus under hydrostatic pressure a small angle neutron scattering study edited by d rees
the stability of bromegrass mosaic virus bmv and empty shells reassembled in vitro from purified bmv coat protein was investigated under hydrostatic pressure using solution small angle neutron scattering this technique allowed us to monitor directly the dissociation of the particles and to detect conformational changes preceding dissociation significant dissociation rates were observed only if virions swelled upon increase of pressure and pressure effects became irreversible at very high pressure in such conditions at ph   in buffers containing   m nacl and  mm mgcl  bmv remained compact radius   nm  dissociation was limited to    at   mpa and pressure effects were totally reversible at ph   bmv particles were slightly swollen under normal pressure and swelling increased with pressure the dissociation was reversible to   for pressures up to   mpa where its rate reached   but became totally irreversible at   mpa pressure induced swelling and dissociation increased further at ph   but were essentially irreversible the presence of h o in the buffer strongly stabilized bmv against pressure effects at ph   but not at ph   furthermore the reversible changes of the scattered intensity observed at ph   and   provide evidence that pressure could induce the release of coat protein subunits or small aggregates of these subunits from the virions and that the dissociated components reassociated again upon return to low pressure empty shells were stable at ph   at pressures up to   mpa they became ill shaped at high pressure however and precipitated slowly after return to normal conditions providing the first example of a pressure induced conformational drift in an assembled system
