n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk from oxygenic phototrophs pii signal transduction across domains of life reveals novel insights in nagk control
n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk catalyzes the first committed step in arginine biosynthesis in organisms that perform the cyclic pathway of ornithine synthesis in eukaryotic and bacterial oxygenic phototrophs the activity of nagk is controlled by the pii signal transduction protein recent x ray analysis of nagk  pii complexes from a higher plant arabidopsis thaliana and a cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus revealed that despite several differences the overall structure of the complex is highly similar the present study analyzes the functional conservation of pii mediated nagk regulation in plants and cyanobacteria to distinguish between universal properties and those that are specific for the different phylogenetic lineages this study shows that plant and cyanobacterial pii proteins can mutually regulate the nagk enzymes across the domains of life implying a high selective pressure to conserve pii  nagk interaction over more than   billion years of separate evolution the non conserved c terminus of s elongatus nagk was identified as an element which strongly enhances arginine inhibition and is responsible for most of the differences between s elongatus and a thaliana nagk with respect to arginine sensitivity both pii proteins relieve arginine inhibition of nagk and in both lineages pii mediated relief from arginine inhibition is antagonized by  oxoglutarate together these properties highlight the conserved role of pii as a signal integrator of the c n balance sensed as  oxoglutarate to regulate arginine synthesis in oxygenic phototrophs
