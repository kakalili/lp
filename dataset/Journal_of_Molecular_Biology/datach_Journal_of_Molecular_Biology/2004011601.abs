studies of the escherichia coli rsd    complex
escherichia coli rsd protein was previously identified on the basis of its binding to the rna polymerase   subunit the rsd    complex has been studied using different methods our data show that rsd associates with   to form a complex with a stoichiometry of   alanine scanning and deletion mutagenesis were used to locate regions of   that are required for the formation of the rsd    complex
