counterion association with native and denatured nucleic acids an experimental approach edited by i tinoco
the melting temperature of the poly da  poly dt double helix is exquisitely sensitive to salt concentration and the helix to coil transition is sharp modern calorimetric instrumentation allows this transition to be detected and characterized with high precision at extremely low duplex concentrations we have taken advantage of these properties to show that this duplex can be used as a sensitive probe to detect and to characterize the influence of other solutes on solution properties we demonstrate how the temperature associated with poly da  poly dt melting can be used to define the change in bulk solution cation concentration imparted by the presence of other duplex and triplex solutes in both their native and denatured states we use this information to critically evaluate features of counterion condensation theory as well as to illustrate  crosstalk  between different non contacting solute molecules specifically we probe the melting of a synthetic homopolymer poly da  poly dt  in the presence of excess genomic salmon sperm dna or in the presence of one of two synthetic rna polymers the poly ra  poly ru duplex or the poly ru  poly ra  poly ru triplex  we find that these additions cause a shift in the melting temperature of poly da  poly dt  which is proportional to the concentration of the added polymer and dependent on its conformational state b versus a native versus denatured and triplex versus duplex  to a first approximation the magnitude of the observed tm shift does not depend significantly on whether the added polymer is rna or dna but it does depend on the number of strands making up the helix of the added polymer we ascribe the observed changes in melting temperature of poly da  poly dt to the increase in ionic strength of the bulk solution brought about by the presence of the added nucleic acid and its associated counterions we refer to this communication between non contacting biopolymers in solution as solvent mediated crosstalk by comparison with a known standard curve of tmversus log na  for poly da  poly dt  we estimate the magnitude of the apparent change in ionic strength resulting from the presence of the bulk nucleic acid and we compare these results with predictions from theory we find that current theoretical considerations correctly predict the direction of the tm shift the melting temperature increases  while overestimating its magnitude specifically we observe an apparent increase in ionic strength equal to   of the concentration of the added duplex dna or rna in mol phosphate  and an additional apparent increase of about    of the nucleic acid concentration mol phosphate upon denaturation of the added dna or rna yielding a total apparent increase of     for the poly ru  poly ra  poly ru triplex the total apparent increase in ionic strength corresponds to about    of the amount of added triplex moles phosphate  the effect we observe is due to coupled equilibria between the solute molecules mediated by modulations in cation concentration induced by the presence and or the transition of one of the solute molecules we note that our results are general so one can use a different solute probe sensitive to proton binding to characterize subtle changes in solution ph induced by the presence of another solute in solution we discuss some of the broader implications of these measurements results in terms of nucleic acid melting in multicomponent systems in terms of probing counterion environments and in terms of potential regulatory mechanisms
