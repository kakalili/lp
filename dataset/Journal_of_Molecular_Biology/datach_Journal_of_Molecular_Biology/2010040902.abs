crystal structure of prostate secretory protein psp  shows an edge to edge association of two monomers to form a homodimer
several recent genome wide association studies have linked the human msmb gene encoding prostate secretory protein of  residues psp   with prostate cancer susceptibility psp  is one of the most abundant proteins from prostatic secretions and a primary constituent of human semen psp  suppresses tumor growth and metastasis and its expression gradually decreases during progression of the prostate cancer it is a rapidly evolving protein with homologues present in several species with  conserved cysteine residues psp  homologues show high affinity binding with different proteins from the cysteine rich secretory protein family some of which have been shown to be ion channel blockers here we report the crystal structure of human psp  at     resolution the structure shows that the amino and the carboxyl ends of the polypeptide chain are held in close proximity facing each other a strong hydrogen bond between these ends which are located respectively on the first and the last  strands leads to formation of an almost straight edge in psp  structure crystal structure shows that these edges from two psp  monomers associate in antiparallel fashion leading to formation of a dimer our studies further show that dimers dissociate into monomers at acidic ph possibly through distortion of the straight edge further based on several observations we propose that psp  binds to cysteine rich secretory proteins and immunoglobulin g through the same edge which is involved in the formation of psp  dimeric interface
