restoration of nbd thermal stability is necessary and sufficient to correct  f  cftr folding and assembly
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr  abcc  unique among abc exporters as an ion channel regulates ion and fluid transport in epithelial tissues loss of function due to mutations in the cftr gene causes cystic fibrosis the most common cystic fibrosis causing mutation the deletion of f    f   from the first nucleotide binding domain nbd  of cftr results in misfolding of the protein and clearance by cellular quality control systems the  f  mutation has two major impacts on cftr reduced thermal stability of nbd and disruption of its interface with membrane spanning domains msds  it is unknown if these two defects are independent and need to be targeted separately to address this question we varied the extent of stabilization of nbd using different second site mutations and nbd binding small molecules with or without nbd msd interface mutation combinations of different nbd changes had additive corrective effects on  f  maturation that correlated with their ability to increase nbd thermostability these effects were much larger than those caused by interface modification alone and accounted for most of the correction achieved by modifying both the domain and the interface thus nbd stabilization plays a dominant role in overcoming the  f  defect furthermore the dual target approach resulted in a locked open ion channel that was constitutively active in the absence of the normally obligatory dependence on phosphorylation by protein kinase a thus simultaneous targeting of both the domain and the interface as well as being non essential for correction of biogenesis may disrupt normal regulation of channel function
