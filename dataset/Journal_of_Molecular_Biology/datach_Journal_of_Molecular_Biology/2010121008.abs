preformed protein binding motifs in sk snrna structural and thermodynamic comparisons with retroviral tar
the sk small nuclear rna is a highly conserved non coding rna that regulates transcriptional elongation  sk utilizes the hexim proteins to sequester the transcription factor p tefb by a mechanism similar to that used by retroviral tar rna to engage tat and p tefb tat has also recently been shown to bind sk directly and recruit p tefb to tar we report here the solution structures of the free and arginine bound forms of stem loop  of sk  sk sl  comparison of the sk sl and tar structures demonstrates the presence of a common arginine sandwich motif however arginine binding to sk sl is mechanistically distinct and occurs via docking into a pre organized pocket resulting in a   fold increased affinity furthermore whereas formation of the binding pocket in tar requires a critical base triple hydrogen bond formation between the equivalent bases in sk sl is not essential and the pocket is stabilized solely by a pseudo base triple platform in addition this theme of preformed protein binding motifs also extends into the pentaloop the configuration of the loop suggests that sk sl is poised to make ternary contacts with p tefb and hexim or tat these key differences between sk sl and tar present an opportunity to understand rna structural adaptation and have implications for understanding differential interactions with tat
