structural and functional impact of cancer related missense somatic mutations
a number of large scale cancer somatic genome sequencing projects are now identifying genetic alterations in cancers evaluation of the effects of these mutations is essential for understanding their contribution to tumorigenesis we have used snps d a software suite originally developed for analyzing nonsynonymous germ line variants to identify single base mutations with a high impact on protein structure and function two machine learning methods are used one identifying mutations that destabilize protein three dimensional structure and the other utilizing sequence conservation and detecting all types of effects on in vivo protein function incorporation of detailed structure information into the analysis allows detailed interpretation of the functional effects of mutations in specific cases  data from a set of breast and colorectal tumors were analyzed in known cancer genes mutations approaching   of mutations are found to impact protein function supporting the view that these methods are appropriate for identifying driver mutations overall      of all somatic missense mutations are predicted to have a high impact on structural stability or to more generally affect the function of the corresponding proteins this value is similar to the fraction of all possible missense mutations that have a high impact and is much higher than the corresponding one for human population single nucleotide polymorphisms at about   the majority of mutations in tumor suppressors destabilize protein structure while mutations in oncogenes operate in more varied ways including destabilization of less active conformational states the set of high impact mutations encompasses the possible drivers
