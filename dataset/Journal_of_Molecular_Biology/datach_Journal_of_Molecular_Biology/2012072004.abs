plasmodium falciparum ssb tetramer wraps single stranded dna with similar topology but opposite polarity to e coli ssb
single stranded dna binding ssb proteins play central roles in genome maintenance in all organisms plasmodium falciparum the causative agent of malaria encodes an ssb protein that localizes to the apicoplast and likely functions in the replication and maintenance of its genome p falciparum ssb pf ssb shares a high degree of sequence homology with bacterial ssb proteins but differs in the composition of its c terminus which interacts with more than a dozen other proteins in escherichia coli ssb ec ssb  using sedimentation methods we show that pf ssb forms a stable homo tetramer alone and when bound to single stranded dna ssdna  we also present a crystal structure at     resolution of the pf ssb tetramer bound to two dt  molecules the pf ssb tetramer is structurally similar to the ec ssb tetramer and ssdna wraps completely around the tetramer with a  baseball seam  topology that is similar to ec ssb in its    binding mode   however the polarity of the ssdna wrapping around pf ssb is opposite to that observed for ec ssb the interactions between the bases in the dna and the amino acid side chains also differ from those observed in the ec ssb  dna structure suggesting that other differences may exist in the dna binding properties of these structurally similar proteins
