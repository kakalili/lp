denaturational stress induces formation of zinc deficient monomers of cu zn superoxide dismutase implications for pathogenesis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
mutations in the cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  cause a subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases sod is a homodimer in which each monomer binds one copper atom and one zinc atom mutation is believed to increase the conformational flexibility of sod  giving rise to a misfolded sod population with novel cytotoxic properties while sod s metal ligands affect its stability greatly little is known about the role these metals play in the folding unfolding and misfolding processes here we present a method by which we were able to measure the rates of metal release during sod unfolding in guanidine hydrochloride rates of dimer dissociation measured by a time resolved cross linking assay and conformational changes in sod s  barrel core monitored by tryptophan fluorescence intensity were compared with the rates of copper release and zinc release correlations were observed across a range of denaturant concentrations giving rise to a more detailed model of the sod unfolding process than was previously available according to this model the major unfolding pathway involves simultaneous dimer dissociation and zinc release as an early step that is followed by a slow conformational change in the protein s core which in turn is followed by rapid copper release this model establishes a zinc deficient copper loaded sod monomer as a well populated sod unfolding intermediate and a species likely to be populated under conditions of denaturational stress because the cytotoxicity of zinc deficient sod has been demonstrated previously this species is a good candidate for the cytotoxic species in sod associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
