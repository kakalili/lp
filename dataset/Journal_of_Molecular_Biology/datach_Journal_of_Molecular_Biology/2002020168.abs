the structure of porcine parvovirus comparison with related viruses edited by d rees
the structure of baculovirus expressed porcine parvovirus ppv capsids was solved using x ray crystallography and was found to be similar to the related canine parvovirus cpv and minute virus of mice mvm  the ppv capsid protein has   and   amino acid sequence identity with cpv and mvm respectively but the degree of conservation of surface exposed residues is lower than average consequently most of the structural differences are on the surface and are the probable cause of the known variability in antigenicity and host range the nadl  and kresse strains of ppv have distinct tissue tropisms and pathogenicity which are mediated by one or more of the amino acid residues      and   these residues are on or near the surface of the virus capsid where they are likely to be associated with virus cell interactions
