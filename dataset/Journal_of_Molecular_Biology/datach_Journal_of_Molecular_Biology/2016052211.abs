nuclear reformation at the end of mitosis
cells have developed highly sophisticated ways to accurately pass on their genetic information to the daughter cells in animal cells which undergo open mitosis the nuclear envelope breaks down at the beginning of mitosis and the chromatin massively condenses to be captured and segregated by the mitotic spindle these events have to be reverted in order to allow the reformation of a nucleus competent for dna transcription and replication as well as all other nuclear processes occurring in interphase here we summarize our current knowledge of how in animal cells the highly compacted mitotic chromosomes are decondensed at the end of mitosis and how a nuclear envelope including functional nuclear pore complexes reassembles around these decondensing chromosomes
