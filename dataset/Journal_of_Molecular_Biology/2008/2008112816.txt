Gene orf18, which is situated within the intercellular transposition region of the conjugative transposon Tn916 from the bacterial pathogen Enterococcus faecalis, encodes a putative ArdA (alleviation of restriction of DNA A) protein. Conjugative transposons are generally resistant to DNA restriction upon transfer to a new host. ArdA from Tn916 may be responsible for the apparent immunity of the transposon to DNA restriction and modification (R/M) systems and for ensuring that the transposon has a broad host range. The orf18 gene was engineered for overexpression in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant ArdA protein was purified to homogeneity. The protein appears to exist as a dimer at nanomolar concentrations but can form larger assemblies at micromolar concentrations. R/M assays revealed that ArdA can efficiently inhibit R/M by all four major classes of Type I R/M enzymes both in vivo and in vitro. These R/M systems are present in over 50% of sequenced prokaryotic genomes. Our results suggest that ArdA can overcome the restriction barrier following conjugation and so helps increase the spread of antibiotic resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer.
