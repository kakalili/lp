mechanism of gtpase activity induced self assembly of human guanylate binding protein
human guanylate binding protein  hgbp  belongs to the dynamin superfamily of large gtpases lgs  in the course of gtp hydrolysis the protein undergoes structural changes leading to self assembly of the protein which is a characteristic property of all family members for self assembly the protein employs two distinct interaction sites one of which is located within the lg domain of the protein located at the n terminus and the second is located in the c terminal  helical domain here we identify intramolecular contacts between the lg domain and the helical part of hgbp  which relay nucleotide dependent structural changes from the n terminus to the c terminus and thereby mediate tetramer formation of the protein through a second contact site at the c terminus furthermore we demonstrate the impact of this intramolecular communication on the enzymatic activity of hgbp and on its cellular localization
