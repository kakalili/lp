very fast folding and association of a trimerization domain from bacteriophage t fibritin
the foldon domain constitutes the c terminal  amino acid residues of the trimeric protein fibritin from bacteriophage t  its function is to promote folding and trimerization of fibritin we investigated structure stability and folding mechanism of the isolated foldon domain the domain folds into the same trimeric  propeller structure as in fibritin and undergoes a two state unfolding transition from folded trimer to unfolded monomers the folding kinetics involve several consecutive reactions structure formation in the region of the single  hairpin of each monomer occurs on the submillisecond timescale this reaction is followed by two consecutive association steps with rate constants of        m  s   and        m  s   at   m gdmcl respectively this is similar to the fastest reported bimolecular association reactions for folding of dimeric proteins at low concentrations of protein folding shows apparent third order kinetics at high concentrations of protein the reaction becomes almost independent of protein concentrations with a half time of about  ms indicating that a first order folding step from a partially folded trimer to the native protein k     s   becomes rate limiting our results suggest that all steps on the folding trimerization pathway of the foldon domain are evolutionarily optimized for rapid and specific initiation of trimer formation during fibritin assembly the results further show that  hairpins allow efficient and rapid protein  protein interactions during folding
