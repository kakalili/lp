salt effects on the thermodynamics of a frameshifting rna pseudoknot under tension
because of the potential link between   programmed ribosomal frameshifting and response of a pseudoknot pk rna to force a number of single molecule pulling experiments have been performed on pks to decipher the mechanism of programmed ribosomal frameshifting motivated in part by these experiments we performed simulations using a coarse grained model of rna to describe the response of a pk over a range of mechanical forces fs and monovalent salt concentrations cs  the coarse grained simulations quantitatively reproduce the multistep thermal melting observed in experiments thus validating our model the free energy changes obtained in simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments by varying f and c we calculated the phase diagram that shows a sequence of structural transitions populating distinct intermediate states as f and c are changed the stem  loop tertiary interactions rupture first followed by unfolding of the   end hairpin i  f  finally the   end hairpin unravels producing an extended state e  i  a theoretical analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the critical force for rupture scales as logcm  with      for e  i i  f transition this relation is used to obtain the preferential ion  rna interaction coefficient which can be quantitatively measured in single molecule experiments as done previously for dna hairpins a by product of our work is the suggestion that the frameshift efficiency is likely determined by the stability of the   end hairpin that the ribosome first encounters during translation
