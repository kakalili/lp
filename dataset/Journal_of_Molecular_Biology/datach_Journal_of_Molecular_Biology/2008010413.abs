mapping of rna polymerase residues that interact with bacteriophage xp  transcription antitermination factor p
bacteriophage xp  encoded transcription factor p interacts with host xanthomonas oryzae rna polymerase    subunit and prevents both promoter recognition by the rna polymerase holoenzyme and transcription termination by the rna polymerase core p does not bind to and has no effect on rna polymerase from escherichia coli here we use a combination of biochemical and genetic methods to map the p interaction site to within four    amino acid residues at the n terminus of x oryzae rnap    the interaction site is located in an area that is close to the promoter spacer in the open complex and to the upstream boundary of the transcription bubble in the elongation complex providing a possible explanation of how a small protein can affect both transcription initiation and termination by binding to the same rna polymerase site
