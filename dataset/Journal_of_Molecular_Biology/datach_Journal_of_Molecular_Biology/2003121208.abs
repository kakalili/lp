computational design and characterization of a monomeric helical dinuclear metalloprotein
the de novo design of di iron proteins is an important step towards understanding the diversity of function among this complex family of metalloenzymes previous designs of due ferro df proteins have resulted in tetrameric and dimeric four helix bundles having crystallographically well defined structures and active site geometries here the design and characterization of dfsc a   residue monomeric four helix bundle is presented the backbone was modeled using previous oligomeric structures and appropriate inter helical turns the identities of  residues were predetermined including the primary and secondary ligands in the active site residues involved in active site accessibility and the     turn between helices  and  the remaining  amino acid residues were determined using statistical computer aided design which is based upon a recent statistical theory of protein sequences rather than sampling sequences the theory directly provides the site specific amino acid probabilities which are then used to guide sequence design the resulting sequence dfsc expresses well in escherichia coli and is highly soluble sedimentation studies confirm that the protein is monomeric in solution circular dichroism spectra are consistent with the helical content of the target structure the protein is structured in both the apo and the holo forms with the metal bound form exhibiting increased stability dfsc stoichiometrically binds a variety of divalent metal ions including zn ii  co ii  fe ii  and mn ii  with micromolar affinities  n hsqc nmr spectra of both the apo and zn ii proteins reveal excellent dispersion with evidence of a significant structural change upon metal binding dfsc is then a realization of complete de novo design where backbone structure activity and sequence are specified in the design process
