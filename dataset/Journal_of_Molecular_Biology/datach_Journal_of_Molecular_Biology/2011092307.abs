hiv  reverse transcriptase dissociates during strand transfer
steps in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  occurring in the virus but not in the host are preferred targets of antiretroviral therapy strand transfer is unique the dna strand being made by viral reverse transcriptase rt is moved from one rna template position to another understanding the mechanism requires knowing whether the rt directly mediates the template exchange or dissociates during the exchange so that it occurs by polymer dynamics earlier work in vitro showed that the presence of an rt trapping polymer would allow synthesis on the original or donor template but completely block transfer and subsequent synthesis on the second or acceptor template one interpretation is that the rt must dissociate during transfer but an alternative is that sequestration of non polymerizing rts prevents polymerization independent ribonuclease h rnase h cleavages of the donor template necessary for strand exchange to resolve this ambiguity we designed a primer  template system that allows strand transfer without rnase h activity using an rnase h negative mutant rt we showed that a polymer trap still prevented strand transfer this confirms that rt dissociates during strand transfer the presence of hiv  nucleocapsid protein which promotes strand exchange had little effect on this outcome additional assays showed that both the wild type rt and a multiple nucleoside rt inhibitor resistant hiv  rt containing an extended fingers domain which is characterized by its enhanced primer  template binding affinity were unable to transfer with the trapping polymer this implies that common sequence variations among rts are unlikely to alter dissociation feature
