crystallographic analysis reveals common modes of binding of medium and long chain fatty acids to human serum albumin edited by r huber
human serum albumin hsa is an abundant plasma protein that is responsible for the transport of fatty acids hsa also binds and perturbs the pharmacokinetics of a wide range of drug compounds binding studies have revealed significant interactions between fatty acid and drug binding sites on albumin but high resolution structural information on ligand binding to the protein has been lacking we report here a crystallographic study of five hsa fatty acid complexes formed using saturated medium chain and long chain fatty acids c   c   c   c   and c    a total of seven binding sites that are occupied by all medium chain and long chain fatty acids have been identified although medium chain fatty acids are found to bind at additional sites on the protein yielding a total of  distinct binding locations comparison of the different complexes reveals key similarities and significant differences in the modes of binding and serves to rationalise much of the biochemical data on fatty acid interactions with albumin the two principal drug binding sites in sub domains iia and iiia are observed to be occupied by fatty acids and one of them in iiia appears to coincide with a high affinity long chain fatty acid binding site
