a structural basis for the ph dependent increase in fluorescence efficiency of chromoproteins
within the fluorescent protein and chromoprotein family the phenomenon of photoswitching is both intriguing and biotechnologically useful illumination of particular chromoproteins with intense light results in dramatic increases in fluorescence efficiency termed kindling and involves cis  trans isomerization of the chromophore here we report that chromophore isomerization can also be driven via alteration in ph specifically we demonstrate that a number of naturally occurring chromoproteins and their engineered variants undergo a dramatic     fold increase in fluorescence efficiency at alkaline ph  gt ph   we have determined to     resolution the structure of one such chromoprotein rtms h  s in its highly far red fluorescent form  f    at ph    and compared it to the structure of the non fluorescent form  f    at ph    at high ph the cyclic tri peptide chromophore was observed to be mobile and distributed between a trans non coplanar and a cis coplanar conformation whereas at the lower ph only a trans non coplanar chromophore was observed calculation of pka values suggested that titration of the side chain of the conserved glu  close to the chromophore is involved in promoting the cis coplanar conformation collectively our data establish that isomerization to form a coplanar chromophore is a basis of the increased fluorescence efficiency at high ph the phenomenon of ph induced fluorescence gain has similarities with photoswitching thereby providing a model to study the mechanism of kindling
