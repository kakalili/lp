micelle like architecture of the monomer ensemble of alzheimer  s amyloid  peptide in aqueous solution and its implications for a  aggregation
aggregation of amyloid   a  peptide a   to  residue fragment of the amyloid precursor protein is associated with alzheimer s disease the most common form of dementia in the elderly population several experimental studies have tried to characterize the atomic details of amyloid fibrils which are the final product of a  aggregation much less is known about species forming during the early stages of aggregation in particular about the monomeric state of the a  peptide that may be viewed as the product of the very first step in the hypothesized amyloid cascade here the equilibrium ensembles of monomeric a  alloforms a     and a     are investigated by monte carlo simulations using an atomistic force field and implicit solvent model that have been shown previously to correctly reproduce the ensemble properties of other intrinsically disordered polypeptides our simulation results indicate that at physiological temperatures both alloforms of a  assume a largely collapsed globular structure conformations feature a fluid hydrophobic core formed on average by contacts both within and between the two segments comprising residues     and       respectively furthermore the  n terminal residues are completely unstructured and all charged side chains in particular those of glu  and asp  remain exposed to solvent taken together these observations indicate a micelle like   the terms  micelle like architecture  and  micelle like  used throughout this article refer to the average conformation of an individual polypeptide chain and do not imply the assembly of several molecules unless otherwise noted architecture at the monomer level whose implications for oligomerization as well as fibril formation and elongation are discussed we establish quantitatively the intrinsic disorder of a  and find the propensity to form regular secondary structure to be low but sequence specific in the presence of a global and unspecific bias for backbone conformations to populate the  basin the  sheet propensity along the sequence is consistent with the arrangement of the monomer within the fibril as derived from solid state nmr data these observations indicate that the primary sequence partially encodes fibril structure but that fibril elongation must be thought of as a templated assembly step
