four crystal structures of the  kda flavoprotein monomer of the sulfite reductase indicate a disordered flavodoxin like module edited by r huber
escherichia coli nadph sulfite reductase sir is a   kda multimeric hemoflavoprotein composed of eight  subunits sir fp and four  subunits sir hp that catalyses the six electron reduction of sulfite to sulfide each  subunit contains a fe s cluster and a siroheme and each  subunit binds one fad and one fmn as prosthetic groups the fad gets electrons from nadph and the fmn transfers the electrons to the metal centers of the  subunit for sulfite reduction we report here the     x ray structure of sir fp  a recombinant monomeric fragment of sir fp that binds both fad and fmn and retains the catalytic properties of the native protein the structure can be divided into three domains the carboxy terminal part of the enzyme is composed of an antiparallel  barrel which binds the fad and a variant of the classical pyridine dinucleotide binding fold which binds nadph these two domains form the canonic fnr like module typical of the ferredoxin nadp reductase family by analogy with the structure of the cytochrome p  reductase the third domain composed of seven  helices is supposed to connect the fnr like module to the n terminal flavodoxine like module in four different crystal forms the fmn binding module is absent from electron density maps although mass spectroscopy amino acid sequencing and activity experiments carried out on dissolved crystals indicate that a functional module is present in the protein our results clearly indicate that the interaction between the fnr like and the fmn like modules displays lower affinity than in the case of cytochrome p  reductase the flexibility of the fmn binding domain may be related as observed in the case of cytochrome bc  to a domain reorganisation in the course of electron transfer thus a movement of the fmn binding domain relative to the rest of the enzyme may be a requirement for its optimal positioning relative to both the fnr like module and the  subunit
