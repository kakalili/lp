the role of muty homolog myh  in controlling the histone deacetylase hst in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe
the dna glycosylase muty homolog myh  excises adenines misincorporated opposite guanines or   dihydro  oxo guanines on dna by base excision repair thereby preventing g c to t a mutations schizosaccharomyces pombe sp hst is an nad dependent histone protein deacetylase involved in gene silencing and maintaining genomic integrity hst regulates deacetylation of histone  lys  at the entry and exit points of the nucleosome core particle here we demonstrate that the hst mutant is more sensitive to h o than wild type cells h o treatment results in an spmyh dependent decrease in sphst protein level and hyperacetylation of histone  lys  furthermore sphst interacts with spmyh and the cell cycle checkpoint rad rad hus     complex sphst  spmyh  and sphus are physically bound to telomeres following oxidative stress there is an increase in the telomeric association of spmyh  conversely the telomeric association of sphst is decreased deletion of spmyh strongly abrogated telomeric association of sphst and sphus  however telomeric association of spmyh is enhanced in hst  cells in the presence of chronic dna damage these results suggest that spmyh repair regulates the functions of sphst and the    complex in maintaining genomic stability
