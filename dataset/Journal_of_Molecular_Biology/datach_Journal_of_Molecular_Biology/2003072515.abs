related protein  protein interaction modules present drastically different surface topographies despite a conserved helical platform
the subcellular localization of camp dependent protein kinase pka occurs through interaction with a kinase anchoring proteins akaps  akaps bind to the pka regulatory subunit dimer of both type i  and type ii  ri  and rii   ri  and rii  display characteristic localization within different cell types which is maintained by interaction of akaps with the n terminal dimerization and docking domain d d of the respective regulatory subunit previously we reported the solution structure of riia d d module both free and bound to akaps we have now solved the solution structure of the dimerization and docking domain of the type i  regulatory dimer subunit ri  d d  ri  d d is a compact docking module with unusual interchain disulfide bonds that help maintain the akap interaction surface in contrast to the shallow hydrophobic groove for akap binding across the surface of the rii  d d dimeric interface the ri  d d module presents a deep cleft for proposed akap binding ri  and rii  d d interaction modules present drastically differing dimeric topographies despite a conserved x type four helix bundle structure
