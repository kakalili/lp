coupled kinetic traps in cytochrome c folding his heme misligation and proline isomerization edited by c r matthews
the effect of his heme misligation on folding has been investigated for a triple mutant of yeast iso  cytochrome c n h h n h k iso   the variant contains a single misligating his residue at position   a location at which his residues are found in several cytochrome c homologues including horse tuna and yeast iso  the amplitude for fast phase folding exhibits a strong initial ph dependence for gdnhcl unfolded protein at an initial ph lt   the observed refolding at final ph  is dominated by a fast phase   f   ms   f     that represents folding in the absence of misligation for unfolded protein at initial ph  folding at final ph  occurs in a fast phase of reduced amplitude   f      but the same rate   f   ms  and in two slower phases  m    seconds  m      and  b     seconds   b      double jump experiments show that the initial ph dependence of the folding amplitudes results from a slow ph dependent equilibrium between fast and slow folding species present in the unfolded protein the slow equilibrium arises from coupling of the his protonation equilibrium to his heme misligation and proline isomerization specifically pro  is predominantly in trans in the unligated low ph unfolded protein but is constrained in a non native cis isomerization state by his  heme misligation near neutral ph refolding from the misligated unfolded form proceeds slowly due to the large energetic barrier required for proline isomerization and displacement of the misligated his  heme ligand
