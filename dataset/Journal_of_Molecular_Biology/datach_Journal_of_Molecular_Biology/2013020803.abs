transcription regulation of a yeast gene from a downstream location
mechanisms for coregulation of transcription of tandem genes in yeast remain largely speculative this study focused on inositol mediated regulation of the tandem gene pair sna  ino  while the pattern of regulation of these two genes was similar results showed that intermediate levels of inositol repressed ino and induced sna  results also showed that inositol mediated regulation of the sna gene was not a function of its promoter but occurred from factors within the sna  ino intergenic region the basic helix  loop  helix proteins ino p and ino p mediated this regulation through the upstream activation sequence uas ino e box sequences in the intergenic region these results provide a model for studying coregulation of yeast tandem genes this is especially significant given that many tandem gene pairs in yeast are coregulated even though context specific uas sequences are known only for one gene in the pair
