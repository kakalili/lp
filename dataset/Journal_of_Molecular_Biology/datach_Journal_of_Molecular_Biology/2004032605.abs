nuclear control of cloverleaf structure of human mitochondrial trnalys
the evolutionary loss in eukaryotic cells of mitochondrial mt trna genes and of trna structural information in the surviving genes has led to the appearance of mt trnas with highly unusual structural features one such mt trna is the human mt trnalys which relies on post transcriptional base modification to achieve correct three dimensional structure it has been shown that the in vitro transcript of human mt trnalys adopts a particular non cloverleaf structure when devoid of modified bases while the native fully modified trna shows the expected cloverleaf structure furthermore a methyl group at position a n  introduced chemically in an otherwise unmodified mt trnalys transcript was found to induce a stable cloverleaf conformation raising the question of how the specific methyltransferase recognizes the unmodified transcript in order to shed light on this unusual case of trna maturation the trna modification enzymes contained in protein extracts from either highly purified hela cell mitochondria or hela cell cytosol were first identified and compared and then used to analyze the mt trnalys an initial screening for modification activities using as substrates unmodified in vitro transcripts of trna genes with well characterized structures namely yeast cytosolic trnaphe human cytosolic trnalys  and human mt trnaile revealed the presence of nine and  modification activities in the mitochondrial and cytosolic protein extracts respectively the mitochondrial extract including a trna adenine  n  methyltransferase activity the comparison of the level and kinetics of a n methylation and other secondary modifications in the unmodified misfolded mt trnalys and in a cloverleaf shaped structural mutant engineered to adopt the trnalys cloverleaf structure without post transcriptional modifications suggested strongly that the methylation of a n in trnalys proceeds via a cloverleaf shaped intermediate therefore it is proposed that this intermediate is present in the in vitro transcript as part of a dynamic equilibrium and that the mitochondrial protein extract contains an activity that stabilizes by secondary modification such a transient cloverleaf shaped intermediate thus countering the evolutionary loss of structural information in mt trna genes the mt trna structure is maintained by a modification enzyme encoded in nuclear dna
