electron microscopy and d reconstruction reveals filamin ig domain binding to f actin
filamin a flna is an actin binding protein that cross links f actin into networks of orthogonally branched filaments flna also directs the networks to integrins while responding to mechanochemical signaling pathways flexible   nm long flna molecules are tail to tail dimers each subunit of which contains an n terminal calponin homology ch actin binding domain connected by a series of  immunoglobulin ig repeats to a dimerization site at their c terminal end whereas the contribution of the ch domains to f actin affinity is weak apparent ka    the binding of the intact protein to f actin is strong apparent ka    suggesting involvement of additional parts of the molecule in this association indeed previous results indicate that ig repeats along flna contribute significantly to the strength of the actin filament interaction in the current study we used electron microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction to elucidate the structural basis of the ig repeat  f actin binding we find that flna density is clearly delineated in reconstructions of f actin complexed either with a four ig repeat segment of flna containing ig repeat  or with immunoglobulin like filamin a repeat igflna  alone the mass attributable to igflna  lies peripherally along the actin helix over the n terminus of actin subdomain  the igflna  interaction appears to be specific since no other individual ig repeat or fragment of the flna molecule examined besides ones with igflna  or ch domains decorated f actin filaments or were detected in reconstructions we conclude that the combined interactions of ch domains and the igflna  repeat provide the binding strength of the whole flna molecule and propose a model for the association of igflna  on actin filaments
