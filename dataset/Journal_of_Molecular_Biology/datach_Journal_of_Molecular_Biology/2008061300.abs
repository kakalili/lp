structural studies on the co chaperone hop and its complexes with hsp
the tetratricopeptide repeat domain tpr containing co chaperone hsp organising protein hop plays a critical role in mediating interactions between heat shock protein hsp  and hsp  as part of the cellular assembly machine it also modulates the atpase activity of both hsp  and hsp  thus facilitating client protein transfer between the two despite structural work on the individual domains of hop no structure for the full length protein exists nor is it clear exactly how hop interacts with hsp  although it is known that its primary binding site is the c terminal meevd motif here we have undertaken a biophysical analysis of the structure and binding of hop to hsp  using a variety of truncation mutants of both hop and hsp  in addition to mutants of hsp  that are thought to modulate the conformation in particular the n terminal dimerisation of the chaperone the results establish that whilst the primary binding site of hop is the c terminal meevd peptide of hsp  binding also occurs at additional sites in the c terminal and middle domain in contrast we show that another tpr containing co chaperone cyp  binds solely to the c terminus of hsp  truncation mutants of hop were generated and used to investigate the dimerisation interface of the protein in good agreement with recently published data we find that the tpr a domain that contains the hsp  binding site is also the primary site for dimerisation however our results suggest that residues within the tpr b may play a role together these data along with shape reconstruction analysis from small angle x ray scattering measurements are used to generate a solution structure for full length hop which we show has an overall butterfly like quaternary structure studies on the nucleotide dependence of hop binding to hsp  establish that hop binds to the nucleotide free   open  state of hsp  however the hsp   hop complex is weakened by the conformational changes that occur in hsp  upon atp binding together the data are used to propose a detailed model of how hop may help present the client protein to hsp  by aligning the bound client on hsp  with the middle domain of hsp  it is likely that hop binds to both monomers of hsp  in the form of a clamp interacting with residues in the middle domain of hsp  thus preventing atp hydrolysis possibly by the prevention of association of n terminal and middle domains in individual hsp  monomers
