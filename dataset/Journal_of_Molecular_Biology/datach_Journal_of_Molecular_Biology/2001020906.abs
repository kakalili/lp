structural basis of diverse sequence dependent target recognition by the  kda dynein light chain edited by p e wright
dyneins are multi subunit molecular motors that translocate molecular cargoes along microtubules otherthan acting as an essential component of the dynein motor complex the  residue subunit of dynein light chain dlc  alsoregulates a number of other biological events by binding to various proteins and enzymes currently known dlc targets includeneuronal nitric oxide synthase the proapoptotic bcl  family member protein designated bim a drosophila rna localizationprotein swallow myosin v neuronal scaffolding protein gkap and i b  an inhibitor of the nf b transcription factor the dlc binding domains of the various targets are confined within a short continuous stretch of amino acid residues however these domains do not share any obvious sequence homology with each other here the three dimensional structures of dlc complexedwith two peptides corresponding to the dlc binding domains of neuronal nitric oxide synthase and bim respectively weredetermined by nmr spectroscopy although the two dlc binding peptides have entirely different amino acid sequences both peptidesbind to the protein with a remarkable similar conformation by engaging the symmetric dlc dimer through antiparallel  sheetaugmentation via the   strand of the protein structural comparison indicates that the two target peptides usedifferent regions within the conformational flexible peptide binding channels to achieve binding specificity we have alsore determined the apo form solution structure of dlc in this work the structures of the dlc target peptide complexes together with the dynamic properties of the protein provide a molecular basis of dlc  s diverse amino acid sequence dependenttarget recognition
