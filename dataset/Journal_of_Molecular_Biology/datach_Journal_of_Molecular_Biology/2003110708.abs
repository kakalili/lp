insights into catalysis by a knotted trmd trna methyltransferase
the crystal structure of escherichia coli trna guanosine  methyltransferase trmd complexed with s adenosyl homocysteine adohcy has been determined at    resolution trmd which methylates g  of trnas containing the sequence g pg  is a homo dimer each monomer consists of a c terminal domain connected by a flexible linker to an n terminal adomet binding domain the two bound adohcy moieties are buried at the bottom of deep clefts the dimer structure appears integral to the formation of the catalytic center of the enzyme and this arrangement strongly suggests that the anticodon loop of trna fits into one of these clefts for methyl transfer to occur in addition adjacent hydrophobic sites in the cleft delineate a defined pocket which may accommodate the gpg sequence during catalysis the dimer contains two deep trefoil peptide knots and a peptide loop extending from each knot embraces the adohcy adenine ring mutational analyses demonstrate that the knot is important for adomet binding and catalytic activity and that the c terminal domain is not only required for trna binding but plays a functional role in catalytic activity
