comparison of sars and nl  papain like protease binding sites and binding site dynamics inhibitor design implications
the human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and the nl  coronaviruses are human respiratory pathogens for which no effective antiviral treatment exists the papain like cysteine proteases encoded by the coronavirus sars cov plpro nl  plp and plp  represent potential targets for antiviral drug development three recent inhibitor bound plpro structures highlight the role of an extremely flexible six residue loop in inhibitor binding the high binding site plasticity is a major challenge in computational drug discovery design efforts from conventional molecular dynamics and accelerated molecular dynamics amd simulations we find that with conventional molecular dynamics simulation plpro translationally samples the open and closed conformation of bl loop on a picosecond  nanosecond timescale but does not reproduce the peptide bond inversion between loop residues tyr  and gln  that is observed on inhibitor grl   binding only amd simulation starting from the closed loop conformation reproduced the        dihedral rotation back to the open loop state the tyr  gln peptide bond inversion appears to involve a progressive conformational change of the full loop starting at one side and progressing to the other we used the sars cov apo x ray structure to develop a model of the nl  plp catalytic site superimposition of the plp model on the plpro x ray structure identifies binding site residues in plp that contribute to the distinct substrate cleavage site specificities between the two proteases the topological and electrostatic differences between the two protease binding sites also help explain the selectivity of non covalent plpro inhibitors
