acetohydroxyacid synthase a proposed structure for regulatory subunits supported by evidence from mutagenesis edited by a r fersht
valine inhibition of acetohydroxyacid synthase ahas plays an important role in regulation of biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids in bacteria bacterial ahass are composed of separate catalytic and regulatory subunits while the catalytic subunits appear to be homologous with several other thiamin diphosphate dependent enzymes there has been no model for the structure of the small regulatory subunits ssus  ahas iii is one of three isozymes in escherichia coli its large subunit encoded by ilvi by itself has     activity of the holoenzyme and is not sensitive to inhibition by valine the ssu encoded by ilvh associates with the large subunit and is required for full catalytic activity and valine sensitivity the isolated ssu binds valine the properties of several mutant ssus shed light on the relation between their structure and regulatory function three mutant ssus were obtained from spontaneous valr bacterial mutants and three more were designed on the basis of an alignment of ssu sequences from valine sensitive and resistant isozymes or consideration of the molecular model developed here mutant ssus n a g d n h and a v when reconstituted with wild type large subunit lead to a holoenzyme with drastically reduced valine sensitivity but with a specific activity similar to that of the wild type the isolated g d and n h subunits do not bind valine mutant q l leads to a valine sensitive holoenzyme and isolated q l binds valine t i has an intermediate valine sensitivity the effects of mutations on the affinity of the large subunits for ssus also vary d fischer  s hybrid fold prediction method suggested a fold similarity between the n terminus of the ilvh product and the c terminal regulatory domain of  phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase on the basis of this prediction together with the properties of the mutants a model for the structure of the ahas ssus and the location of the valine binding sites can be proposed
