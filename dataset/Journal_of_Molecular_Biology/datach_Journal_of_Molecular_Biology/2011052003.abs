structural insights for mpp chromodomain interaction with histone h lysine  potential effect of phosphorylation on methyl lysine binding
m phase phosphoprotein  mpp  harbors an n terminal chromodomain and a c terminal ankyrin repeat domain mpp  via its chromodomain binds histone h peptide tri or di methylated at lysine  h k me h k me  in submicromolar affinity we determined the crystal structure of mpp chromodomain in complex with h k me peptide mpp interacts with at least six histone h residues from glutamine  to serine   enabling its ability to distinguish lysine  containing peptide qtarks from that of lysine   kaarks  both sharing the arks sequence a partial hydrophobic cage with three aromatic residues phe  trp  and tyr  and one aspartate asp  encloses the methylated lysine  mpp has been reported to be phosphorylated in vivo including the cage residue tyr  and the succeeding thr  and ser  modeling a phosphate group onto the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of tyr  suggests that the negatively charged phosphate group could enhance the binding of positively charged methyl lysine or create a regulatory signal by allowing or inhibiting binding of other protein s
