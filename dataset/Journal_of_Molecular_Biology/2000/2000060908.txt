The REG homologs, α, β and γ, activate mammalian proteasomes in distinct ways. REGα and REGβ activate the trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl-preferring active sites, whereas REGγ only activates the proteasome’s trypsin-like subunit. The three REG homologs differ in carboxyl-terminal sequences that are located next to activation loops on their proteasome binding surface. To assess the importance of these carboxyl-terminal sequences in the activation of specific proteasome β catalytic subunits, we characterized chimeras in which 8 or 12 residues were exchanged among the three proteins. Like the wild-type molecule, REGα chimeras activated all three proteasome catalytic subunits regardless of the carboxyl-terminal sequence. However, REGα-β chimeras activated the proteasome at lower concentrations than wild-type REGα and higher levels of REGα-γ chimeras were needed for maximal activation because exchanged carboxyl-terminal sequences can stabilize (REGα-β) or destabilize (REGα-γ) the REGα heptamer. REGγ chimeras were equivalent to REGγ in their activation properties, but they bound the proteasome less tightly than the wild-type molecule. REGβ chimeras also bound the proteasome more weakly than wild-type REGβ and were virtually unable to activate it. Our findings demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal sequences of REG subunits can affect heptamer stability and proteasome affinity, but they do not determine which proteasome β subunits become activated.
