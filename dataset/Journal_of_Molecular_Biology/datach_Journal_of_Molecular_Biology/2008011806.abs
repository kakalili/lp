a competition mechanism regulates the translation of the escherichia coli operon encoding ribosomal proteins l  and l
escherichia coli ribosomal protein r protein l  is essential for the assembly of the  s ribosomal subunit and is also a translational regulator of its own rpmi  rplt operon encoding r proteins l  and l  in that order l  directly represses the translation of the first cistron and through translational coupling that of its own gene the translational operator of the operon is   nt in length and includes a long range pseudoknot interaction between two rna sequences separated by   nt l  has the potential to bind both to this pseudoknot and to an irregular hairpin although only one site is occupied at a time during regulation this work shows that the rpmi  rplt operon is regulated by competition between l  and the ribosome for binding to mrna in vitro and in vivo detailed studies on the regulatory mechanisms of r protein synthesis have only been performed on the rpso gene regulated by r protein s  and on the alpha operon regulated by s  both are thought to be controlled by a trapping mechanism whereby the  s ribosomal subunit the mrna and the initiator trna are blocked as a nonfunctional preternary complex this alternative mode of regulation of the rpmi  rplt operon raises the possibility that control is kinetically and not thermodynamically limited in this case we show that the pseudoknot which is known to be essential for l  binding and regulation also enhances  s binding to mrna as if this structure is specifically recognised by the ribosome
