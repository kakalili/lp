electron and scanning force microscopy studies of alterations in supercoiled dna tertiary structure edited by i tinoco
the configuration of supercoiled dna scdna was investigated by electron microscopy and scanning force microscopy changes in configuration were induced by varying monovalent divalent salt concentrations and manifested by variation in the number of nodes crossings of double helical segments  a decrease in the concentration of monovalent cations from  mm to   mm resulted in a significant change of apparent configuration of negatively supercoiled dna from a plectonemic form with virtually    nodes the value expected for molecules of     bp to one or two nodes this result was in good agreement with values calculated using an elastic rod model of dna and salt concentration in the range of   mm the effect did not depend on the identity of the monovalent cation na  k  or the nature of the support used for electron microscopy imaging glow discharged carbon film polylysine film  at very low salt concentrations a single denatured region several hundred base pairs in length was often detected similarly at low concentrations of divalent cations mg  ca  zn   scdna was apparently relaxed although the effect was slightly dependent on the nature of the cation positively supercoiled dna behaved in a manner different from that of its negative counterpart when the ion concentration was varied as expected for these molecules an increase in salt concentration resulted in an apparent relaxation however a decrease in salt concentration also led to an apparent relaxation manifested by a slight decrease in the number of nodes scanning force microscopy imaging of negatively scdna molecules deposited onto a mica surface under various salt conditions also revealed an apparent relaxation of scdna molecules however due to weak interactions with the mica surface in the presence of a mixture of mono divalent cations the effect occurred under conditions differing from those used for electron microscopy we conclude that the observed changes in scdna configuration are inherent to the dna structure and do not reflect artifacts arising from the method s of sample preparation
