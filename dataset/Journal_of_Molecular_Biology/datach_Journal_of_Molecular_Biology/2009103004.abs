structure of the mature streptococcal cysteine protease exotoxin mspeb in its active dimeric form
invasive infections of streptococcus pyogenes are dependent on the cysteine protease streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin b previous structures of the enzyme have not disclosed the proper active site configuration here the crystal structure of the mature enzyme is presented to      disclosing a homodimer a serine from one subunit inserts into the active site of the other to donate to the oxyanion hole and coordinates the ligand proximal to the active site cysteine dimerization is unique to the mature form and is clearly a prerequisite for catalysis the present structure supports a tripartite switch system that is triggered upon dimerization and substrate binding   liberation of the active site histidine from an inactive configuration   relocation of residues blocking the substrate binding pockets and   repositioning of two active site tryptophans to settle in the active configuration based on the present structure the active site of clan ca cysteine proteases is expanded and a detailed mechanism of the deacylation mechanism is proposed the results may have applications for the development of protease inhibitors specific to bacterial cysteine proteases
