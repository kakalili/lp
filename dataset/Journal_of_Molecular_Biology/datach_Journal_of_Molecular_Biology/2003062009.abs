mg  induced variations in the conformation and dynamics of hiv  tar rna probed using nmr residual dipolar couplings
the effects of divalent mg  on the conformation and dynamics of the stem loop transactivation response element tar rna from hiv  have been characterized using nmr residual dipolar couplings rdcs  order matrix analysis of one bond  c  h rdcs measured in tar at mg   tar stoichiometric ratios of     tar  mg  and      tar  mg  revealed that mg  reduces the average inter helical angle from      in tar free to     in tar  mg  in contrast to the tar free state the generalized degree of order for the two stems in tar  mg is found to be identical within experimental uncertainty indicating that binding of mg  leads to an arrest of inter helical motions in tar free  results demonstrate that rdc nmr methodology can provide new insight into the effects of mg  on both the conformation and dynamics of rna
