interrelationship between cytoplasmic retroviral gag concentration and gag  membrane association
the early events in the retrovirus assembly pathway particularly the timing and nature of gag translocation from the site of protein translation to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane are poorly understood we have investigated the interrelationship between cytoplasmic gag concentration and plasma membrane association using complementary live cell biophysical fluorescence techniques in real time with both human t cell leukemia virus type  htlv  and human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  gag proteins in particular dual color z scan fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy in conjunction with total internal reflection fluorescence and conventional epi illumination imaging were utilized our results demonstrate that htlv  gag is capable of membrane targeting and particle assembly at low i e  nanomolar cytoplasmic concentrations and that there is a critical threshold concentration approaching micromolar prior to the observation of hiv  gag associated with the plasma membrane these observations imply fundamental differences between hiv  and htlv  gag trafficking and membrane association
