effects of mutation truncation and temperature on the folding kinetics of a ww domain
the purpose of this work is to show how mutation truncation and change of temperature can influence the folding kinetics of a protein this is accomplished by principal component analysis of molecular dynamics generated folding trajectories of the triple  strand ww domain from formin binding protein   fbp   protein data bank id  e l and its full size and singly and doubly truncated mutants at temperatures below and very close to the melting point the reasons for biphasic folding kinetics i e  coexistence of slow three state and fast two state phases  including the involvement of a solvent exposed hydrophobic cluster and another delocalized hydrophobic core in the folding kinetics are discussed new folding pathways are identified in free energy landscapes determined in terms of principal components for full size mutants three state folding is found to be a main mechanism for folding the fbp  ww domain and most of the full size and truncated mutants the results from the theoretical analysis are compared to those from experiment agreements and discrepancies between the theoretical and experimental results are discussed because of its importance in understanding protein kinetics and function the diffusive mechanism by which the fbp  ww domain and its full size and truncated mutants explore their conformational space is examined in terms of the mean square displacement and principal component analysis eigenvalue spectrum analyses subdiffusive behavior is observed for all studied systems
