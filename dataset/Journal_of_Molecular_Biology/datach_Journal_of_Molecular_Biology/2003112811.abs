crystal structure of an acyl acp dehydrogenase from the fk  polyketide biosynthetic pathway insights into extender unit biosynthesis
polyketide synthases pkss synthesize the polyketide cores of pharmacologically important natural products such as the immunosuppressants fk  and fk   understanding polyketide biosynthesis at atomic resolution could present new opportunities for chemo enzymatic synthesis of complex molecules the crystal structure of fkbi an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the methoxymalonyl extender unit of fk   was solved to    with an rcrys of    fkbi has a similar fold to acyl coa dehydrogenases notwithstanding this similarity the surface and substrate binding site of fkbi reveal key differences from other acyl coa dehydrogenases suggesting that fkbi may recognize an acyl acp substrate rather than an acyl coa substrate this structural observation coincided the genetic experiment done by carroll et al j am chem soc          although an in vitro assay for fkbi remains elusive the structural basis for the substrate specificity of fkbi is analyzed by a combination of sequence comparison docking simulations and structural analysis a biochemical mechanism for the role of fkbi in the biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl acp is proposed
