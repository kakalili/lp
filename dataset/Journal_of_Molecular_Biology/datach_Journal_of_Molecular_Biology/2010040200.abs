trials travails and triumphs an account of rna catalysis in rnase p
last december marked the  th anniversary of the nobel prize in chemistry to sidney altman and thomas cech for their discovery of rna catalysts in bacterial ribonuclease p an enzyme catalyzing   maturation of trnas and a self splicing rrna of tetrahymena respectively coinciding with the publication of a treatise on rnase p  this review provides a historical narrative a brief report on our current knowledge and a discussion of some research prospects on rnase p    the great thing about science is that you can actually solve a problem you can take something which is confused a mess and not only find a solution but prove it s the right one   sydney brenner  in research the front line is almost always in a fog   francis crick
