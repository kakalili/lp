structural basis of the honey bee pbp pheromone and ph induced conformational change
the behavior of insects and their perception of their surroundings are driven in a large part by odorants and pheromones this is especially true for social insects such as the honey bee where the queen controls the development and the caste status of the other individuals pheromone perception is a complex phenomenon relying on a cascade of recognition events initiated in antennae by pheromone recognition by a pheromone binding protein and finishing with signal transduction at the axon membrane level with to the objective of deciphering this initial step we have determined the structures of the bee antennal pheromone binding protein asp  in the apo form and in complex with the main component of the queen mandibular pheromonal mixture  keto  e decenoic acid  oda and with nonpheromonal components in the apo protein the c terminus obstructs the binding site in contrast asp complexes have different open conformations depending on the ligand shape leading to different volumes of the binding cavity the binding site integrity depends on the c terminus       conformation which involves the interplay of two factors i e the presence of a ligand and a low ph ligand binding to asp is favored by low ph opposite to what is observed with other pheromone binding proteins such as those of bombyx mori and anopheles gambiae
