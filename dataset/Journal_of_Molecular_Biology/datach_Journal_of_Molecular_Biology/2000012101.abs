structural effects of dna sequence on t a recognition by hydroxypyrrole pyrrole pairs in the minor groove edited by i tinoco
synthetic polyamides composed of three types of aromatic amino acids n methylimidazole im  n methylpyrrole py and n methyl  hydroxypyrrole hp bind specific dna sequences as antiparallel dimers in the minor groove the side by side pairings of aromatic rings in the dimer afford a general recognition code that allows all four base pairs to be distinguished to examine the structural consequences of changing the dna sequence context on t a recognition by hp py pairs in the minor groove crystal structures of polyamide dimers impyhppy  and the pyrrole counterpart impypypy  bound to the six base pair target site   agatct   in a ten base pair oligonucleotide have been determined to a resolution of   and     respectively the structures demonstrate that the principles of hp py recognition of t a are consistent between different sequence contexts however a general structural explanation for the non additive reduction in binding affinity due to introduction of the hydroxyl group is less clear comparison with other polyamide dna cocrystal structures reveals structural themes and differences that may relate to sequence preference
