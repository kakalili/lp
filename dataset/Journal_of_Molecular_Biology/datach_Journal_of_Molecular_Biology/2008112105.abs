determination of the topology of the hydrophobic segment of mammalian diacylglycerol kinase epsilon in a cell membrane and its relationship to predictions from modeling
the epsilon isoform of diacylglycerol kinase dgk  is unique among mammalian dgks in having a segment of hydrophobic amino acids comprising approximately residues  to   several algorithms predict this segment to be a transmembrane tm helix using peplook we have performed an in silico analysis of the conformational preference of the segment in a hydrophobic environment comprising residues  to  of dgk  we find that there are two distinct groups of stable conformations one corresponding to a straight helix that would traverse the membrane and the second corresponding to a bent helix that would enter and leave the same side of the membrane furthermore the calculations predict that substituting the pro  residue in the hydrophobic segment with an ala will cause the hydrophobic segment to favor a tm orientation we have expressed the p a mutant of dgk  with a flag tag an n terminal  flag epitope tag at the amino terminus in cos  cells we find that this mutation causes a large reduction in both kcat and km while maintaining kcat km constant specificity of the p a mutant for substrates with polyunsaturated acyl chains is retained the p a mutant also has higher affinity for membranes since it is more difficult to extract from the membrane with high salt concentration or high ph compared with the wild type dgk  we also evaluated the topology of the proteins with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using nih t cells we find that the flag tag at the amino terminus of the wild type enzyme is not reactive with antibodies unless the cell membrane is permeabilized with detergent we also demonstrate that at least a fraction of the wild type dgk  is present in the plasma membrane and that comparable amounts of the wild type and p a mutant proteins are in the plasma membrane fraction this indicates that in these cells the hydrophobic segment of the wild type dgk  is not tm but takes up a bent conformation in contrast the flag tag at the amino terminus of the p a mutant is exposed to antibody both before and after membrane permeabilization this modeling approach thus provides an explanation not provided by simple predictive algorithms for the observed topology of this protein in cell membranes the work also demonstrates that the wild type dgk  is a monotopic protein
