The X-ray crystallographic structure of N-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) from porcine kidney, which has been identified to be a renin-binding protein (RnBP), was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method and refined at 2.0 Å resolution with a final R-factor of 16.9 % for 15 to 2.0 Å resolution data. The refined structure of AGE comprised 804 amino acid residues (one dimer) and 145 water molecules. The dimer of AGE had an asymmetric unit with approximate dimensions 46 Å×48 Å×96 Å. The AGE monomer is composed of an α6/α6-barrel, the structure of which is found in glucoamylase and cellulase. One side of the AGE α6/α6-barrel structure comprises long loops containing five short β-sheets, and contributes to the formation of a deep cleft shaped like a funnel. The putative active-site pocket and a possible binding site for the substrate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) were found in the cleft. The other side of the α6/α6-barrel comprises short loops and contributes to the dimer formation. At the dimer interface, which is composed of the short loops and α-helices of the subunits, five strong ion-pair interactions were observed, which play a major role in the dimer assembly. This completely ruled out the previously accepted hypothesis that the formation of the RnBP homodimer and RnBP-renin heterodimer requires the leucine zipper motif present in RnBP.
