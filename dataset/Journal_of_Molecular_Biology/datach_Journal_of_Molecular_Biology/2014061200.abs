the crystal structure of the anti  factor cnry in complex with the  factor cnrh shows a new structural class of anti  factors targeting extracytoplasmic function  factors
gene expression in bacteria is regulated at the level of transcription initiation a process driven by  factors the regulation of  factor activity proceeds from the regulation of their cytoplasmic availability which relies on specific inhibitory proteins called anti  factors with anti  factors regulating their availability according to diverse cues extracytoplasmic function  factors  ecf form a major signal transduction system in bacteria here structure function relationships have been characterized in an emerging class of minimal size transmembrane anti  factors using cnry from cupriavidus metallidurans ch  as a model this study reports the     resolution structure of cnry cytosolic domain in complex with cnrh its cognate  ecf and identifies a small hydrophobic knob in cnry as the major determinant of this interaction in vivo unsuspected structural similarity with the molecular switch regulating the general stress response in  proteobacteria unravels a new class of anti  factors targeting  ecf members of this class carry out their function via a  residue stretch that displays helical propensity but no canonical structure on its own
