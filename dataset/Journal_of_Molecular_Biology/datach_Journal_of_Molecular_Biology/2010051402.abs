structure and conformational dynamics of the metalloregulator merr upon binding of hg ii
the bacterial metalloregulator merr is the index case of an eponymous family of regulatory proteins which controls the transcription of a set of genes the mer operon conferring mercury resistance in many bacteria homodimeric merr represses transcription in the absence of mercury and activates transcription upon hg ii binding here the average structures of the apo and hg ii bound forms of merr in aqueous solution are examined using small angle x ray scattering indicating an extended conformation of the metal bound protein and revealing the existence of a novel compact conformation in the absence of hg ii  molecular dynamics md simulations are performed to characterize the conformational dynamics of the hg ii bound form in both small angle x ray scattering and md the average torsional angle between dna binding domains is     furthermore in md interdomain motions on a timescale of    ns involving large amplitude       domain opening and closing coupled to     variations of interdomain torsional angle are revealed this correlated domain motion may propagate allosteric changes from the metal binding site to the dna binding site while maintaining dna contacts required to initiate dna underwinding
