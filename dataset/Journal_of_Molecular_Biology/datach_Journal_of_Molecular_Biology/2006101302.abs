t cell receptor recognition via cooperative conformational plasticity
although t cell receptor cross reactivity is a fundamental property of the immune system and is implicated in numerous autoimmune pathologies the molecular mechanisms by which t cell receptors can recognize and respond to diverse ligands are incompletely understood in the current study we examined the response of the human t cell lymphotropic virus  htlv  tax specific t cell receptor tcr a to a panel of structurally distinct haptens coupled to the tax    peptide with a lysine substitution at position  tax k llfg k hapten pvyv  the a tcr could cross reactively recognize one of these haptenated peptides tax k   indolyl butyric acid iba  presented by hla a    the crystal structures of tax k iba hla a free and in complex with a reveal that binding is mediated by a mechanism of cooperative conformational plasticity involving conformational changes on both sides of the protein  protein interface including the tcr complementarity determining region cdr loops v  v  domain orientation and the hapten modified peptide our findings illustrate the complex role that protein dynamics can play in tcr cross reactivity and highlight that t cell receptor recognition of ligand can be achieved through diverse and complex molecular mechanisms that can occur simultaneously in the interface not limited to molecular mimicry and cdr loop shifts
