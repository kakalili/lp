early protein evolution building domains from ligand binding polypeptide segments
it has been suggested that in the early evolution of proteins segments of polypeptide unable to fold in isolation may have collapsed together to form folded proto domains we wondered whether the incorporation of segments with a pre existing binding activity into a folded domain could by fixing the ligand binding conformation and or providing additional contacts lead to large affinity improvements and provide an evolutionary advantage as a model we took a segment of polypeptide from hen egg lysozyme that in the native protein forms the binding interface with the monoclonal antibodies hyhel and f  kd  pm  when expressed in bacteria the isolated segment was unfolded readily proteolysed and only bound weakly to the antibodies kd gt   m  we then combined the segment with random genomic segments to create a repertoire of chimaeric polypeptides displayed on filamentous bacteriophage by use of proteolysis to select folded polypeptide and anti lysozyme antibodies to select an active conformation we isolated a folded dimeric protein with an enhanced antibody affinity kd   pm  unexpectedly the dimer also incorporated a single heme molecule kd   nm that stabilised the dimer tm    c with heme    c without heme  these results show that the binding affinities of flexible polypeptide segments can be greatly enhanced on protein folding and that the folding can be stabilised by prosthetic groups this supports the hypothesis that sub domain polypeptide segments with functional activities may have contributed to domain creation in early evolution
