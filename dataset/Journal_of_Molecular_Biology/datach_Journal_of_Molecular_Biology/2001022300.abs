interplay between hydrophobic cluster and loop propensity in  hairpin formation edited by p e wright
autonomously folding  hairpins have recently emerged as powerful tools for elucidating the origins of antiparallel  sheet folding preferences analysis of such model systems has suggested four potential sources of  sheet stability   the conformational propensity of the loop segment that connects adjacent strands   favorable contacts between side chains on adjacent strands   interstrand hydrogen bonds and   the intrinsic  sheet propensities of the strand residues we describe the design and analysis of a series of isomeric  residue peptides in which factors     are identical differences in  hairpin formation within this series demonstrate that these four factors individually are not sufficient to explain  sheet stability in agreement with the prediction of a simple statistical mechanical model for  hairpin formation our results show that the separation between the loop segment and an interstrand cluster of hydrophobic side chains strongly influences  hairpin size and stability with a smaller separation leading to greater stability
