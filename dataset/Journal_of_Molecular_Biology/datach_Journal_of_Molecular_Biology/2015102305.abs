studying cellular signal transduction with omic technologies
in the gulf between genotype and phenotype exists proteins and in particular protein signal transduction systems these systems use a relatively limited parts list to respond to a much longer list of extracellular environmental and or mechanical cues with rapidity and specificity most signaling networks function in a highly non linear and often contextual manner furthermore these processes occur dynamically across space and time because of these complexities systems and  omic  approaches are essential for the study of signal transduction one challenge in using omic scale approaches to study signaling is that the  signal  can take different forms in different situations signals are encoded in diverse ways such as protein  protein interactions enzyme activities localizations or post translational modifications to proteins furthermore in some cases signals may be encoded only in the dynamics duration or rates of change of these features accordingly systems level analyses of signaling may need to integrate multiple experimental and or computational approaches as the field has progressed the non triviality of integrating experimental and computational analyses has become apparent successful use of omic methods to study signaling will require the  right  experiments and the  right  modeling approaches and it is critical to consider both in the design phase of the project in this review we discuss common omic and modeling approaches for studying signaling emphasizing the philosophical and practical considerations for effectively merging these two types of approaches to maximize the probability of obtaining reliable and novel insights into signaling biology
