the crystal structure of tetrameric methionine adenosyltransferase from rat liver reveals the methionine binding site edited by r huber
most of the transmethylation reactions use the same methyl donor s adenosylmethionine sam  that is synthesised from methionine and atp by methionine adenosyltransferase mat  in mammals two mat enzymes have been detected one ubiquitous and another liver specific the liver enzyme exists in two oligomeric forms a tetramer mat i and a dimer mat iii  mat i being the one that shows a higher level of affinity for methionine but a lower sam synthesis capacity we have solved the crystal structure of rat liver mat i at    resolution complexed with a methionine analogue l  amino  methoxy cis but  enoic acid l cisamb  the enzyme consists of four identical subunits arranged in two tight dimers that are related by crystallographic  fold symmetry the crystal structure shows the positions of the relevant cysteine residues in the chain and that cys  and cys  are perfectly oriented for forming a disulphide link this result leads us to propose a hypothesis to explain the control of mat i iii exchange and hence the effects observed on activity we have identified the methionine binding site into the active site cavity for the first time the l cisamb inhibitor is stacked against phe  aromatic ring in a rather planar conformation and its carboxylate group coordinates a mg  which in turn is linked to asp   the essential role of the involved residues in mat activity has been confirmed by site directed mutagenesis phe  is exposed to solvent and is located in the beginning of the flexible loop phe  ala  that is connecting the n terminal domain to the central domain we postulate that a conformational change may take place during the enzymatic reaction and this is possibly the reason of the unusual two step mechanism involving tripolyphosphate hydrolysis other important mechanistic implications are discussed on the light of the results moreover the critical role that certain residues identified in this study may have in methionine recognition opens further possibilities for rational drug design
