a  hairpin comprising the nuclear localization sequence sustains the self associated states of nucleosome assembly protein
the histone chaperone nucleosome assembly protein  nap  is implicated in histone shuttling as well as nucleosome assembly and disassembly under physiological conditions nap dimers exist in a mixture of various high molecular weight oligomers whose size may be regulated by the cell cycle dependent concentration of nap  both the functional and structural significance of the observed oligomers are unknown we have resolved the molecular mechanism by which yeast nap  ynap  dimers oligomerize by applying x ray crystallographic hydrodynamic and functional approaches we found that an extended  hairpin that protrudes from the compact core of the ynap dimer forms a stable  sheet with  hairpins of neighboring ynap dimers disruption of the  hairpin whose sequence is conserved among nap proteins in various species by the replacement of one or more amino acids with proline results in complete loss of ynap dimer oligomerization the in vitro functions of ynap remain unaffected by the mutations we have thus identified a conserved structural feature of nap whose function in addition to presenting the nuclear localization sequence appears to be the formation of higher order oligomers
