structural insights into the recognition of peroxisomal targeting signal  by trypanosoma brucei peroxin
glycosomes are peroxisome like organelles essential for trypanosomatid parasites glycosome biogenesis is mediated by proteins called  peroxins   which are considered to be promising drug targets in pathogenic trypanosomatidae the first step during protein translocation across the glycosomal membrane of peroxisomal targeting signal  pts  harboring proteins is signal recognition by the cytosolic receptor peroxin  pex  the c terminal pts motifs interact with the pts binding domain p bd of pex  which is made up of seven tetratricopeptide repeats obtaining diffraction quality crystals of the p bd of trypanosoma brucei pex  tbpex  required surface entropy reduction mutagenesis each of the seven tetratricopeptide repeats appears to have a residue in the  l conformation in the loop connecting helices a and b five crystal structures of the p bd of tbpex were determined each in complex with a hepta or decapeptide corresponding to a natural or nonnatural pts sequence the pts peptides are bound between the two subdomains of the p bd these structures indicate precise recognition of the c terminal leu of the pts motif and important interactions between the pts peptide main chain and up to five invariant asn side chains of pex  the tbpex structures reported here reveal a unique hydrophobic pocket in the subdomain interface that might be explored to obtain compounds that prevent relative motions of the subdomains and interfere selectively with pts motif binding or release in trypanosomatids and would therefore disrupt glycosome biogenesis and prevent parasite growth
