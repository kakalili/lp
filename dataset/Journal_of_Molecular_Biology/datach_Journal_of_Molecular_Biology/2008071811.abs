backrub like backbone simulation recapitulates natural protein conformational variability and improves mutant side chain prediction
incorporation of effective backbone sampling into protein simulation and design is an important step in increasing the accuracy of computational protein modeling recent analysis of high resolution crystal structures has suggested a new model termed backrub to describe localized hinge like alternative backbone and side chain conformations observed in the crystal lattice the model involves internal backbone rotations about axes between c alpha atoms based on this observation we have implemented a backrub inspired sampling method in the rosetta structure prediction and design program we evaluate this model of backbone flexibility using three different tests first we show that rosetta backrub simulations recapitulate the correlation between backbone and side chain conformations in the high resolution crystal structures upon which the model was based as a second test of backrub sampling we show that backbone flexibility improves the accuracy of predicting point mutant side chain conformations over fixed backbone rotameric sampling alone finally we show that backrub sampling of triosephosphate isomerase loop  can capture the millisecond microsecond oscillation between the open and closed states observed in solution our results suggest that backrub sampling captures a sizable fraction of localized conformational changes that occur in natural proteins application of this simple model of backbone motions may significantly improve both protein design and atomistic simulations of localized protein flexibility
