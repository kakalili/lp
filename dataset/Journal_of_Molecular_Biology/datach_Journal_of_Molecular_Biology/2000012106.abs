contributions of basic residues to ribosomal protein l  recognition of rna edited by i tinoco
the c terminal domain of ribosomal protein l  l  c  binds in the distorted minor groove of a helix within a  nucleotide domain of  s rrna to study the electrostatic component of rna recognition in this protein arginine and lysine residues have been individually mutated to alanine or methionine residues at the nine sequence positions that are conserved as basic residues among bacterial l  homologs in measurements of the salt dependence of rna binding five of these mutants have a reduced value of    log kobs   log kcl as compared to the parent l  c  sequence indicating that these residues interact with the rna electrostatic field these five residues are located at the perimeter of the rna binding surface of the protein all five of them form salt bridges with phosphates in the crystal structure of the complex a sixth residue lys  was found to make an electrostatic contribution to binding when measurements were made at ph   but not at ph   its pk in the free protein must be lt   the unusual behavior of lys  is explained by its burial in the hydrophobic core of the free protein and unburial in the rna bound protein where it forms a salt bridge with a phosphate the contributions of these six residues to the electrostatic component of binding are not additive thus the magnitude of the salt dependence cannot be used to count the number of ionic interactions in this complex by interacting with irregular features of the rna backbone including an s turn these basic residues contribute to the specificity of l  for its target site
