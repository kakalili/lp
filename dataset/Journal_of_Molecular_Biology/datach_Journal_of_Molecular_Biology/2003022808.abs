line  preta elements in the human genome
the preta subfamily of long interspersed elements lines is characterized by a three base pair  acg  sequence in the   untranslated region contains approximately   members in the human genome and has low level of nucleotide divergence with an estimated average age of   million years old suggesting that expansion of the l preta subfamily occurred just after the divergence of humans and african apes we have identified   preta l elements from the draft human genomic sequence investigated the genomic characteristics of preta l insertions and screened individual elements across diverse human populations and various non human primate species using polymerase chain reaction pcr assays to determine the phylogenetic origin and levels of human genomic diversity associated with the l elements all of the preta l elements analyzed by pcr were absent from the orthologous positions in non human primate genomes with     of the l elements being polymorphic with respect to insertion presence or absence in the human genome the newly identified l insertion polymorphisms will prove useful as identical by descent genetic markers for the study of human population genetics we provide evidence that preta l elements show an integration site preference for genomic regions with low gc content computational analysis of the preta l elements revealed that   of the elements amenable to complete sequence analysis have apparently escaped   truncation and are essentially full length approximately kb  in all   have two intact open reading frames and may be capable of retrotransposition
