conversion of a   into a folded soluble native like protein using a semi random library of amphipathic helices
the amyloid cascade model hypothesizes that neurotoxic oligomers or aggregates formed by the alzheimer amyloid peptide a  cause disease pathology in alzheimer s disease attempted treatment strategies for alzheimer s disease have involved either inhibiting a  oligomerization or aggregation or dissolving existing aggregates blocking such downhill processes however has proved daunting we have used a different approach that targets a  before the oligomerization cascade begins we predicted that an amphipathic helix could convert a  into a native like protein and inhibit initiation of oligomerization and aggregation this idea was tested with a designed library and genetic screen we exhaustively screened a library of semi randomized amphipathic helical sequences each expressed as a fusion protein with an a   yellow fluorescent protein sequence serving as a reporter for folding and solubilization this yielded an amphipathic helix capable of initiating native like folding in a   and preventing aggregation this amphipathic helix has direct application to alzheimer s disease therapy development
