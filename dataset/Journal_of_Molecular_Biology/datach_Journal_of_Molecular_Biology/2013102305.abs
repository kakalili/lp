in human pseudouridine synthase  hpus  a c terminal helical insert blocks trna from binding in the same orientation as in the pus bacterial homologue trua consistent with their different target selectivities
human pseudouridine   synthase pus  hpus  modifies specific uridine residues in several non coding rnas trna u spliceosomal rna and steroid receptor activator rna we report three structures of the catalytic core domain of hpus from two crystal forms at    resolution the structures are the first of a mammalian  synthase from the set of five  synthase families common to all kingdoms of life hpus adopts a fold similar to bacterial  synthases with a central antiparallel  sheet flanked by helices and loops a flexible hinge at the base of the sheet allows the enzyme to open and close around an electropositive active site cleft in one crystal form a molecule of mes   n morpholino ethane sulfonic acid mimics the target uridine of an rna substrate a positively charged electrostatic surface extends from the active site towards the n terminus of the catalytic domain suggesting an extensive binding site specific for target rnas two  helices c terminal to the core domain but unique to hpus  extend along the back and top of the central  sheet and form the walls of the rna binding surface docking of trna to hpus in a productive orientation requires only minor conformational changes to enzyme and trna the docked trna is bound by the electropositive surface of the protein employing a completely different binding mode than that seen for the trna complex of the escherichia coli homologue trua
