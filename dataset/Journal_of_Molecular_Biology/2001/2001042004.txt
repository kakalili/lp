The major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b complex (LHCIIb) of photosystem II in higher plants can be reconstituted with pigments in lipid-detergent micelles. The pigment-protein complexes formed are functional in that they perform efficient internal energy transfer from chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a. LHCIIb formation in vitro, can be monitored by the appearance of energy transfer from chlorophyll b to chlorophyll a in time-resolved fluorescence measurements. LHCIIb is found to form in two apparent kinetic steps with time constants of about 30 and 200 seconds. Here we report on the dependence of the LHCIIb formation kinetics on the composition of the pigment mixture used in the reconstitution. Both kinetic steps slow down when the concentration of either chlorophylls or carotenoids is reduced. This suggests that the slower 200 seconds formation of functional LHCIIb still includes binding of both chlorophylls and carotenoids. LHCIIb formation is accelerated when the chlorophylls in the reconstitution mixture consist predominantly of chlorophyll a although the complexes formed are thermally less stable than those reconstituted with a chlorophyll a:b ratio â©½1. This indicates that although chlorophyll a binding is more dominant in the observed rate of LHCIIb formation, the occupation of (some) chlorophyll binding sites with chlorophyll b is essential for complex stability. The accelerating effect of various carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, neoxanthin) on LHCIIb formation correlates with their affinity to two lutein-specific binding sites. We conclude that the occupation of these two carotenoid binding sites but not of the third (neoxanthin-specific) binding site is an essential step in the assembly of LHCIIb in vitro.
