the  open  and  closed  structures of the type c inorganic pyrophosphatases from bacillus subtilis and streptococcus gordonii edited by d rees
recently a new class of soluble inorganic pyrophosphatase type c ppase has been described that is not homologous in amino acid sequence or kinetic properties to the well studied ppases types a and b found in many organisms from bacteria to humans and thought to be essential to the cell structural studies of the type c ppases from streptococcus gordonii and bacillus subtilis reveal a homodimeric structure with each polypeptide folding into two domains joined by a flexible hinge the active site formed at the interface between the n and c terminal domains binds two manganese ions approximately    apart in a conformation resembling binuclear metal centres found in other hydrolytic enzymes an activated water molecule bridging the two metal ions is likely poised for nucleophilic attack of the substrate importantly the s gordonii and b subtilis enzymes have crystallised in strikingly different conformations in both subunits of the s gordonii crystal structure     resolution the c terminal domain is positioned such that the active site is occluded with a sulphate ion bound in the active site in contrast in the b subtilis structure     resolution the c terminal domain is rotated by about    leaving the active site wide open and accessible for substrate binding
