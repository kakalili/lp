on the interaction between gp  and membranes the immunodominant loop stabilizes gp  helical hairpin conformation
gp  is the protein responsible for the process of membrane fusion that allows primate lentiviruses hiv and siv to enter into their host cells gp  ectodomain contains an n terminal and a c terminal heptad repeat region nhr and chr connected by an immunodominant loop in the absence of membranes the nhr and chr segments fold into a protease resistant core with a trimeric helical hairpin structure however when the immunodominant loop is not present either in a complex formed by hiv  gp  derived nhr and chr peptides or by mild treatment with protease of recombinant constructs of hiv  gp  ectodomain which also lack the n terminal fusion peptide and the c terminal trp rich region membrane binding induces a conformational change in the gp  core structure here we further investigated whether covalently linking the nhr and chr segments by the immunodominant loop affects this conformational change specifically we analyzed a construct corresponding to a fragment of sivmac  gp ectodomain residues      named e gp  by means of surface plasmon resonance trp and rhodamine fluorescence atr ftir spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry our results suggest that the presence of the loop stabilizes the trimeric helical hairpin both when e gp  is in aqueous solution and when it is bound to the membrane surface bearing in mind possible differences between hiv  and siv gp  and considering that the gp  ectodomain constructs analyzed to date lack the n terminal fusion peptide and the c terminal trp rich region we discuss our observations in relation to the mechanism of virus induced membrane fusion
