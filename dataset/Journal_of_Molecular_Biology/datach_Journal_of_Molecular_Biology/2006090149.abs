functional and structural characterization of a thiol peroxidase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
a thiol peroxidase tpx from mycobacterium tuberculosis was functionally analyzed the enzyme shows nadph linked peroxidase activity using a thioredoxin thioredoxin reductase system as electron donor and anti oxidant activity in a thiol dependent metal catalyzed oxidation system it reduces h o  t butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide and is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents mutational studies revealed that the peroxidatic cys  and resolving cys  cysteine residues are critical amino acids for catalytic activity the x ray structure determined to a resolution of     shows a thioredoxin fold similar to that of other peroxiredoxin family members superposition with structural homologues in oxidized and reduced forms indicates that the m tuberculosis tpx is a member of the atypical two cys peroxiredoxin family in addition the short distance that separates the c  atoms of cys  and cys  and the location of these cysteine residues in unstructured regions may indicate that the m tuberculosis enzyme is oxidized though the side chain of cys  is poorly visible it is solely in the reduced streptococcus pneumoniae tpx structure that both residues are part of two distinct helical segments the m tuberculosis tpx is dimeric both in solution and in the crystal structure amino acid residues from both monomers delineate the active site pocket
