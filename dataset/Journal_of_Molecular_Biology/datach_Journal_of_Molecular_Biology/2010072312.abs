backbone dynamics and global effects of an activating mutation in minimized mtu reca inteins
inteins mediate protein splicing which has found many applications in biotechnology and protein engineering a single valine to leucine mutation v l can globally enhance splicing and related cleavage reactions in minimized mycobacterium tuberculosis reca inteins however v l mutation causes little change in crystal structures to test whether protein dynamics contribute to activity enhancement in the v l mutation we have studied the conformations and dynamics of the minimized and engineered intein   ihh v cm and a single v l mutant   ihh l cm by solution nmr chemical shift perturbations established that the v l mutation causes global changes including changes at the n terminus and c terminus of the intein which are active sites for protein splicing the single v l mutation significantly slows hydrogen exchange rates globally indicating a shift to more stable conformations and reduction in ensemble distribution whereas the v l mutation causes little change for motions on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale motions on the microsecond to millisecond timescale affect a region involving the conserved f block histidine and c terminal asparagine which are residues important for c terminal cleavage the v l mutation is proposed to activate splicing by reducing the ensemble distribution of the intein structure and by modifying the active sites
