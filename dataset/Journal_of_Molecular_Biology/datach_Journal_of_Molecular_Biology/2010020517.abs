single molecule and fret fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analyses of phage dna packaging colocalization of packaged phage t dna ends within the capsid
linear dnas of any sequence can be packaged into empty viral procapsids by the phage t terminase with high efficiency in vitro packaging substrates of  kbp and   kbp terminated by energy transfer dye pairs were constructed from plasmid and  phage dnas nuclease and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs assays showed that    of the substrate dna was packaged and that the dna dye ends of the packaged dna were protected from nuclease digestion upon packaging both  kbp and   kbp dnas produced comparable fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret between cy and cy  double dye terminated dnas single molecule fret sm fret and photobleaching analysis shows that fret is intramolecular rather than intermolecular upon packaging of most procapsids and demonstrates that single molecule detection allows mechanistic analysis of packaging in vitro fret fcs and sm fret measurements are comparable and show that both the  kbp and the   kbp packaged dna ends are held within    nm of each other within the dimensions of the long axis of the procapsid portal the calculated distribution of fret distances is relatively narrow for both fret fcs and sm fret suggesting that the two packaged dna ends are held at the same fixed distance relative to each other in most capsids because one dna end is known to be positioned for ejection through the portal it can be inferred that both dnas ends are held in proximity to the portal entrance and ejection channel the analysis suggests that a dna loop rather than a dna end is translocated by the packaging motor to fill the procapsid
