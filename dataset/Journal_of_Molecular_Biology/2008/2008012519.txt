Phosphorylation appears to be one of the modulators of chaperone functions of small heat shock proteins. However, the role of phosphorylation is not completely understood. We have investigated the structural and functional consequences of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutation in αB-crystallin, a small heat shock protein with chaperone activity. We have used a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, 3DαB-crystallin, in which all the three phosphorylatable serine residues are replaced with aspartic acid. 3DαB-Crystallin showed enhanced chaperone-like activity towards DTT-induced aggregation of insulin, heat-induced aggregation of citrate synthase and SDS-induced amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein. Fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic studies showed that 3DαB-crystallin exhibits lower stability towards urea-induced denaturation compared to αB-crystallin. Subunit exchange studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer showed that 3DαB-crystallin exhibits an observable increase in subunit exchange compared to αB-crystallin. Since only part of αB-crystallin is phosphorylated in vivo, our subunit exchange studies indicate that formation of mixed oligomers between the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated subunits are likely to play a role in vivo. Our study shows that mixed-oligomer formation modulates the chaperone-like activity. We propose that the degree of phosphorylation of the αB-crystallin oligomers and temperature are key modulators to achieve a wide range of chaperone capabilities of the small heat shock protein, αB-crystallin.
