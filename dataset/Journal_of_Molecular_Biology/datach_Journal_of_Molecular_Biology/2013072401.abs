ligand induced dynamic changes in extended pdz domains from nherf
the multi domain scaffolding protein nherf modulates the assembly and intracellular trafficking of various transmembrane receptors and ion transport proteins the two pdz postsynaptic density  disk large zonula occluden  domains of nherf possess very different ligand binding capabilities pdz recognizes a variety of membrane proteins with high affinity while pdz only binds limited number of target proteins here using nmr we have determined the structural and dynamic mechanisms that differentiate the binding affinities of the two pdz domains for the type  pdz binding motif qdtrl in the carboxyl terminus of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator similar to pdz  we have identified a helix  loop  helix subdomain coupled to the canonical pdz domain the extended pdz domain is highly flexible with correlated backbone motions on fast and slow timescales while the extended pdz domain is relatively rigid the malleability of the extended pdz structure facilitates the transmission of conformational changes at the ligand binding site to the remote helix  loop  helix extension by contrast ligand binding has only modest effects on the conformation and dynamics of the extended pdz domain the study shows that ligand induced structural and dynamic changes coupled with sequence variation at the putative pdz binding site dictate ligand selectivity and binding affinity of the two pdz domains of nherf
