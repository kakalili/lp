crystal structure of dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase drag reveals conservation in the adp ribosylhydrolase fold and specific features in the adp ribose binding pocket
protein reversible adp ribosylation is emerging as an important post translational modification used to control enzymatic and protein activity in different biological systems this modification regulates nitrogenase activity in several nitrogen fixing bacterial species adp ribosylation is catalyzed by adp ribosyltransferases and is reversed by adp ribosylhydrolases the structure of the adp ribosylhydrolase that acts on azospirillum brasilense nitrogenase dinitrogenase reductase activating glycohydrolase drag has been solved at a resolution of     this bacterial member of the adp ribosylhydrolase family acts specifically towards a mono adp ribosylated substrate the protein shows an all  helix structure with two magnesium ions located in the active site comparison of the drag structure with orthologues deposited in the protein data bank from archaea and mammals indicates that the adp ribosylhydrolase fold is conserved in all domains of life modeling of the binding of the substrate adp ribosyl moiety to drag is in excellent agreement with biochemical data
