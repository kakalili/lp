TMEFF2 is a novel transmembrane protein, containing two follistatin domains and an epidermal growth factor-like motif that is mainly expressed in the prostate and brain. Recently, we showed that expression of TMEFF2 could inhibit prostate cancer cell growth. In addition, the TMEFF2 gene is frequently hypermethylated in human tumor cells, suggesting that it might be a tumor suppressor gene. We cloned the 5â€²-flanking region of the human TMEFF2 gene and using a luciferase reporter assay showed that it contains a functional promoter. The 0.7kb region upstream to the TMEFF2 transcription start site encompasses the minimal promoter required for TMEFF2 expression. Sequence analysis of the TMEFF2 promoter revealed potential binding sites for several transcription factors including Sp1 and an E-box that could be recognized by c-Myc. An inverse correlation between TMEFF2 and c-Myc expression was found in CWR22 prostate xenografts. Reporter gene and mobility shift assays demonstrated that c-Myc could repress TMEFF2 gene expression through its cognate site. In light of the probable role of TMEFF2 in inhibiting cell growth, its suppression may contribute to the oncogenic properties of c-Myc.
