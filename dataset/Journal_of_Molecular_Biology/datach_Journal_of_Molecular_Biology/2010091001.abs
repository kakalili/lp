relative affinity of calcium pump isoforms for phospholamban quantified by fluorescence resonance energy transfer
to investigate the regulation of serca a sarco endo plasmic reticulum calcium atpase and serca a calcium pump isoforms by phospholamban plb  we quantified plb serca interactions by fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret in live cells for both serca a and serca a fret to plb increased with increasing protein expression level to a maximum value corresponding to a probe separation distance of     the data indicate that the respective regulatory complexes assume the same overall quaternary conformation however fret measurements also revealed that plb has a   higher apparent affinity for serca a relative to serca a the results suggest that despite the structural similarities of the respective regulatory complexes there is preferential binding of plb to serca a over serca a this apparent selectivity may have implications for biochemical studies in which serca a is used as a substitute for serca a it may also be an important strategic consideration for therapeutic overexpression of serca isoforms in cardiac muscle
