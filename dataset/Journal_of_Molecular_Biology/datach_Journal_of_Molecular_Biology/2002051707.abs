recognition of trna backbone for aminoacylation with cysteine evolution from escherichia coli to human
the underlying basis of the genetic code is specific aminoacylation of trnas by aminoacyl trna synthetases although the code is conserved bases in trna that establish aminoacylation are not necessarily conserved even when the bases are conserved positions of backbone groups that contribute to aminoacylation may vary we show here that although the escherichia coli and human cysteinyl trna synthetases both recognize the same bases u  and the gca anticodon of trna for aminoacylation they have different emphasis on the trna backbone the e coli enzyme recognizes two clusters of phosphate groups one is at a  in the anticodon and the other is in the core of the trna structure and includes phosphate groups at positions      and   metal ion rescue experiments show that those at positions    and  are involved with binding divalent metal ions that are important for aminoacylation the e coli enzyme also recognizes   hydroxyl groups within the same two clusters at positions     and  in the anticodon loop and at positions     and  in the core the human enzyme by contrast recognizes few phosphate or   hydroxy groups for aminoacylation the evolution from the backbone dependent recognition by the e coli enzyme to the backbone independent recognition by the human enzyme demonstrates a previously unrecognized shift that nonetheless has preserved the specificity for aminoacylation with cysteine
