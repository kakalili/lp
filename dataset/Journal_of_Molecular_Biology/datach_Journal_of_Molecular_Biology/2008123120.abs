mechanism of substrate recognition and plp induced conformational changes in ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase from arabidopsis thaliana
ll diaminopimelate aminotransferase ll dap at  a pyridoxal phosphate plp dependent enzyme in the lysine biosynthetic pathways of plants and chlamydia is a potential target for the development of herbicides or antibiotics this homodimeric enzyme converts l tetrahydrodipicolinic acid thdp directly to ll dap using l glutamate as the source of the amino group earlier we described the d structures of native and malate bound ll dap at from arabidopsis thaliana atdap at  seven additional crystal structures of atdap at and its variants are reported here as part of an investigation into the mechanism of substrate recognition and catalysis two structures are of atdap at with reduced external aldimine analogues n    phosphopyridoxyl l glutamate plp glu and n    phosphopyridoxyl  ll diaminopimelate plp dap bound in the active site surprisingly they reveal that both l glutamate and ll dap are recognized in a very similar fashion by the same sets of amino acid residues both molecules adopt twisted v shaped conformations with both substrates the  carboxylates are bound in a salt bridge with arg   whereas the distal carboxylates are recognized via hydrogen bonds to the well conserved side chains of tyr  tyr  and lys   the distal c  amino group of ll dap is specifically recognized by several non covalent interactions with residues from the other subunit asn    tyr    gly    and glu    amino acid designators followed by an asterisk    indicate that the residues originate in the other subunit of the dimer  and by three bound water molecules two catalytically inactive variants of atdap at were created via site directed mutagenesis of the active site lysine k  n and k  q  the structures of these variants permitted the observation of the unreduced external aldimines of plp with l glutamate and with ll dap in the active site and revealed differences in the torsion angle about the plp substrate bond lastly an apo atdap at structure missing plp revealed details of conformational changes induced by plp binding and substrate entry into the active site
