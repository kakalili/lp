crystal structure of the polyextremophilic  amylase amyb from halothermothrix orenii details of a productive enzyme  substrate complex and an n domain with a role in binding raw starch
the gene for a membrane bound halophilic and thermostable  amylase amyb from halothermothrix orenii was cloned and sequenced the crystal structure shows that in addition to the typical domain organization of family  glycoside hydrolases amyb carries an additional n terminal domain n domain that forms a large groove  the n  c groove  some    away from the active site the structure of amyb with the inhibitor acarbose at     resolution shows that a nonasaccharide has been synthesized through successive transglycosylation reactions of acarbose unexpectedly in a complex of wild type amyb with  cyclodextrin and maltoheptaose at     resolution a maltotetraose molecule is bound in subsites   to   spanning the cleavage point at     with the   glucosyl residue present as a so skew boat this wild type amyb complex was obtained in the presence of a large excess of substrate a condition under which it is possible to capture michaelis complexes which may explain the observed binding across     and ring distortion we observe three methionine side chains that serve as  binding platforms  for glucosyl rings in amyb a seemingly rare occurrence in carbohydrate binding proteins the structures and results from the biochemical characterization of amyb and amyb lacking the n domain show that the n domain increases binding of the enzyme to raw starch furthermore theoretical modeling suggests that the n  c groove can accommodate spatially and chemically large substrates such as a starch
