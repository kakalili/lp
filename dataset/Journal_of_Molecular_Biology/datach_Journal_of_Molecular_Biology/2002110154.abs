crp p a new cruciform dna binding protein in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae
a synthetic cruciform dna x dna was used for screening cellular extracts of saccharomyces cerevisiae for x dna binding activity three x dna binding proteins with apparent molecular mass of  kda  kda and  kda estimated by sds page were partially purified they were identified as n terminal fragments originating from the same putative protein encoded by the open reading frame yhr  w which we named crp  cruciform dna recognising protein   expression of crp in escherichia coli showed that crp p is subject to efficient proteolysis at one specific site cleavage leads to an n terminal subpeptide of approximately   amino acid residues that is capable of binding specifically x dna with an estimated dissociation constant kd of  nm and a c terminal subpeptide of approximately   residues without intrinsic x dna binding activity the n terminal subpeptide is of a size similarly to that of the fragments identified in yeast suggesting that the same cleavage process occurs in the yeast and the e coli background this makes the action of a site specific protease unlikely and favours the possibility of an autoproteolytic activity of crp p the dna binding domain of crp p was mapped to positions      this domain can act autonomously as an x dna binding peptide and provides a new lysine rich dna binding domain different from those of known cruciform dna binding proteins cbps  as reported earlier for several other cbps crp p exerts an enhancing effect on the cleavage of x dna by endonuclease vii from bacteriophage t
