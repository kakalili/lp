hiv  envelope glycoprotein biosynthesis trafficking and incorporation
the hiv  envelope env glycoproteins play an essential role in the virus replication cycle by mediating the fusion between viral and cellular membranes during the entry process the env glycoproteins are synthesized as a polyprotein precursor gp   that is cleaved by cellular proteases to the mature surface glycoprotein gp  and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp  during virus assembly the gp  gp  complex is incorporated as heterotrimeric spikes into the lipid bilayer of nascent virions these gp  gp  complexes then initiate the infection process by binding receptor and coreceptor on the surface of target cells much is currently known about the hiv  env glycoprotein trafficking pathway and the structure of gp  and the extracellular domain of gp  however the mechanism by which the env glycoprotein complex is incorporated into virus particles remains incompletely understood genetic data support a major role for the cytoplasmic tail of gp  and the matrix domain of gag in env glycoprotein incorporation still to be defined are the identities of host cell factors that may promote env incorporation and the role of specific membrane microdomains in this process here we review our current understanding of hiv  env glycoprotein trafficking and incorporation into virions
