metastable polymerization of sickle hemoglobin in droplets
sickle cell disease arises from a genetic mutation of one amino acid in each of the two hemoglobin  chains leading to the polymerization of hemoglobin in the red cell upon deoxygenation and is characterized by vascular crises and tissue damage due to the obstruction of small vessels by sickled cells it has been an untested assumption that in red cells that sickle the growing polymer mass would consume monomers until the thermodynamically well described monomer solubility was reached by photolysing droplets of sickle hemoglobin suspended in oil we find that polymerization does not exhaust the available store of monomers but stops prematurely leaving the solutions in a supersaturated metastable state typically   above solubility at    c though the particular values depend on the details of the experiment we propose that polymer growth stops because the growing ends reach the droplet edge whereas new polymer formation is thwarted by long nucleation times since the concentration of hemoglobin is lowered by depletion of monomers into the polymers that have formed this finding suggests a new aspect to the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease namely that cells deoxygenated in the microcirculation are not merely undeformable but will actively wedge themselves tightly against the walls of the microvasculature by a ratchet like mechanism driven by the supersaturated solution
