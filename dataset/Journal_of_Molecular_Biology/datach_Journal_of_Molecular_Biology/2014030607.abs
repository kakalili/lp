solid state nmr spectroscopy of the hiv gp  membrane fusion protein supports intermolecular antiparallel  sheet fusion peptide structure in the final six helix bundle state
the hiv gp  protein catalyzes fusion between viral and target cell membranes although the   residue n terminal fusion peptide fp region is critical for fusion the structure of this region is not well characterized in large gp  constructs that model the gp  state at different times during fusion this paper describes solid state nmr ssnmr studies of fp structure in a membrane associated construct fp hairpin  which likely models the final fusion state thought to be thermostable trimers with six helix bundle structure in the region c terminal of the fp the ssnmr data show that there are populations of fp hairpin with either  helical or  sheet fp conformation for the  sheet population measurements of intermolecular  c  c proximities in the fp are consistent with a significant fraction of intermolecular antiparallel  sheet fp structure with adjacent strand crossing near l and f  there appears to be negligible in register parallel structure these findings support assembly of membrane associated gp  trimers through interleaving of n terminal fps from different trimers similar ssnmr data are obtained for fp hairpin and a construct containing the  n terminal residues of gp  n   which is a model for part of the putative pre hairpin intermediate state of gp  fp assembly may therefore occur at an early fusion stage on a more fundamental level similar ssnmr data are obtained for fp hairpin and a construct containing the  n terminal gp  residues fp  and support the hypothesis that the fp is an autonomous folding domain
