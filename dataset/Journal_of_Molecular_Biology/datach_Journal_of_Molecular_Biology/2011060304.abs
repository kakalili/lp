the crystal structure of death receptor  dr  a potential receptor of the amyloid precursor protein app
death receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor tnfr super family and are intimately involved in the signal transduction during apoptosis stress response and cellular survival here we present the crystal structure of recombinantly expressed death receptor six dr  one family member that was recently shown to bind to the amyloid precursor protein app and hence to be probably involved in the development of alzheimer s disease the extracellular cysteine rich region of dr  the typical ligand binding region of all tnfrs was refined to     resolution and shows that its four constituting cysteine rich domains crds are arranged in a rod like overall structure which presents dr specific surface patches responsible for the exclusive recognition of its ligand s  based on the structural data the general ligand binding modes of tnfrs and molecular modeling experiments we were able to elucidate structural features of the potential dr app signaling complex
