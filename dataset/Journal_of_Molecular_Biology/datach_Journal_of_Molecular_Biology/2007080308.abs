cooperative unfolding of a metastable serpin to a molten globule suggests a link between functional and folding energy landscapes
alpha  antitrypsin   at is a member of the serpin class of protease inhibitors and folds to a metastable state rather than its thermodynamically most stable native state upon cleavage by a target protease   at undergoes a dramatic conformational change to a stable form translocating the bound protease more than    to form an inhibitory protease  serpin complex numerous mutagenesis studies on serpins have demonstrated the trade off between the stability of the metastable state on the one hand and the inhibitory efficiency on the other studies of the equilibrium unfolding of serpins provide insight into this connection between structural plasticity and metastability we studied equilibrium unfolding of wild type   at using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to characterize the structure and the stability of an equilibrium intermediate that was observed in low concentrations of denaturant in earlier studies our results show that the intermediate observed at low concentrations of denaturant has no protection from hydrogen deuterium exchange indicating a lack of stable structure further differential scanning calorimetry of   at at low concentrations of denaturant shows no heat capacity peak during thermal denaturation indicating that the transition from the intermediate to the unfolded state is not a cooperative first order like phase transition  our results show that the unfolding of   at involves a cooperative transition to a molten globule form followed by a non cooperative transition to a random coil form as more guanidine is added thus the entire   at molecule consists of one cooperative structural unit rather than multiple structural domains with different stabilities furthermore our results together with previous mutagenesis studies suggest a possible link between an equilibrium molten globule and a functional intermediate that may be populated during the protease inhibition
