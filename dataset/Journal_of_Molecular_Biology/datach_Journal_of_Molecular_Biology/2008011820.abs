partially folded bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor analogues attain fully native structures when co crystallized with s  a rat trypsin
crystal structures at     resolution were solved for complexes between each of two chemically synthesized partially folded analogues of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti with the proteolytically inactive rat trypsin mutant s  a the bpti analogue termed     abu retains only the disulfide bond between cys  and cys  while cys  cys  cys  and cys  are replaced by isosteric  amino n butyric acid residues the analogue k p a d     abu contains two further replacements by statistically favored residues in the type i  turn that has been suggested to be a main site for initiation of bpti folding as a control the structure of the complex between s  a trypsin and wild type bpti was also solved despite significant differences in the degree of structure detected among these three bptis in solution by several biophysical techniques their tertiary folds once bound to s  a trypsin in a crystalline lattice are essentially superimposable
