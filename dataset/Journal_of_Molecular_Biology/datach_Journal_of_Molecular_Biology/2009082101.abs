crystal structure and putative mechanism of  methylitaconate  isomerase from eubacterium barkeri
methylitaconate  isomerase mii participates in the nicotinate fermentation pathway of the anaerobic soil bacterium eubacterium barkeri order clostridiales by catalyzing the reversible conversion of r  methylitaconate  methylene  methylsuccinate to   dimethylmaleate the enzyme is also able to catalyze the isomerization of itaconate methylenesuccinate to citraconate methylmaleate with ca  fold higher km but gt   fold lower kcat the gene mii from e barkeri was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli the protein produced with a c terminal strep tag exhibited the same specific activity as the wild type enzyme the crystal structure of mii from e barkeri has been solved at a resolution of      the asymmetric unit of the p    unit cell with parameters a      b      and c      contains four molecules of mii the enzyme belongs to a group of isomerases with a common structural feature the so called diaminopimelate epimerase fold the monomer of   amino acid residues has two topologically similar domains exhibiting an    fold the active site is situated in a cleft between these domains the four mii molecules are arranged as a tetramer with   symmetry for the n terminal domains the c terminal domains have different relative positions with respect to the n terminal domains resulting in a closed conformation for molecule a and two distinct open conformations for molecules b and d the c terminal domain of molecule c is disordered the mii active site contains the putative catalytic residues lys  and cys  for which mechanistic roles are proposed based on a docking experiment of the mii substrate complex the active sites of mii and the closely related prpf most likely a methylaconitate  isomerase have been compared the overall architecture including the active site lys  cys  his   and ser  mii numbering is similar this positioning of r  methylitaconate allows cys  as thiolate to deprotonate c  and as thiol to donate a proton to the methylene carbon atom of the resulting allylic carbanion interestingly the active site of isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase type i also contains a cysteine that cooperates with glutamate rather than lysine it has been proposed that the initial step in this enzyme is a protonation generating a tertiary carbocation intermediate
