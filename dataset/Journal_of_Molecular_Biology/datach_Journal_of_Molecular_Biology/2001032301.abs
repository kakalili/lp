the high resolution x ray crystallographic structure of the ferritin ecftna of escherichia coli comparison with human h ferritin huhf and the structures of the fe  and zn  derivatives edited by r huber
the high resolution structure of the non haem ferritin from escherichia coli ecftna is presented together with those of its fe  and zn  derivatives this being the first high resolution x ray analysis of the iron centres in any ferritin the binding of both metals is accompanied by small changes in the amino acid ligand positions mean fea  feb  and zna  znb  distances are     and     respectively in both derivatives metal ions at sites a and b are bridged by a glutamate side chain glu  in a syn syn conformation the fe  derivative alone shows a third metal site fec  joined to feb  by a long anti anti bidentate bridge through glu   mean feb  fec  distance      the third metal site is unique to the non haem bacterial ferritins the dinuclear site lies at the inner end of a hydrophobic channel connecting it to the outside surface of the protein shell which may provide access for dioxygen and possibly for metal ions shielded by water models representing the possible binding mode of dioxygen to the dinuclear fe  pair suggest that a gauche    mode may be preferred stereochemically like those of other ferritins the  subunits of ecftna are folded as four helix bundles that assemble into hollow shells and both metals bind at dinuclear centres in the middle of the bundles the structural similarity of ecftna to the human h chain ferritin huhf is remarkable r m s deviation of main chain atoms     given the low amino acid sequence identity     many of the conserved residues are clustered at the dinuclear centre but there is very little conservation of residues making inter subunit interactions
