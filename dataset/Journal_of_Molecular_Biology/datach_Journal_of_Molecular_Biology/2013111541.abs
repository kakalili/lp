structural basis for the interaction of human  defensin  and its putative chemokine receptor ccr and breast cancer microvesicles
human  defensins hbds are believed to function as alarm molecules that stimulate the adaptive immune system when a threat is present in addition to its antimicrobial activity defensins present other activities such as chemoattraction of a range of different cell types to the sites of inflammation we have solved the structure of the hbd by nmr spectroscopy that contains a conserved  defensin domain followed by an extended c terminus we use nmr to monitor the interaction of hbd with microvesicles shed by breast cancer cell lines and with peptides derived from the extracellular domain of cc chemokine receptor  nt ccr  possessing or not possessing sulfation on tyr  and tyr  the nmr derived model of the hbd ccr complex reveals a contiguous binding surface on hbd  which comprises amino acid residues of the  helix and      loop the microvesicle binding surface partially overlaps with the chemokine receptor interface nmr spin relaxation suggests that free hbd and the hbd ccr complex exhibit microsecond to millisecond conformational dynamics encompassing the ccr binding site which might facilitate selection of the molecular configuration optimal for binding these data offer new insights into the structure  function relation of the hbd  ccr interaction which is a promising target for the design of novel anticancer agents
