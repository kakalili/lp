human    hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase crystallographic and site directed mutagenesis studies lead to the identification of an alternative binding site for c  steroids
human    hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase h    hsd akr c  catalyzes the transformation of progesterone prog into    hydroxy progesterone     ohprog  although h    hsd shares   sequence identity with human type     hsd h   hsd  akr c  these two enzymes differ greatly in their activities in order to explain these differences we have solved the crystal structure of h    hsd in a ternary complex with nadp and    ohprog at    resolution the steroid is stabilized by numerous hydrophobic interactions and a hydrogen bond between its o  and the n  atom of his   this new interaction prevents the formation of a hydrogen bond with the cofactor as seen in h   hsd ternary complexes by combining structural direct mutagenesis and kinetic studies we found that the h  i substitution decreases the km value for the cofactor  fold with these results we hypothesize that the rotation of the lateral chain of his  could be a mediating step between the transformation of prog and the release of the cofactor moreover crystal structure analysis and direct mutagenesis experiments lead us to identify a new residue involved in the binding of prog indeed the r  l substitution leads to a  fold decrease in the km value for prog reduction we thus propose that prog is maintained in a new steroid binding site composed mainly of residues found in the carboxy terminal region of the protein
