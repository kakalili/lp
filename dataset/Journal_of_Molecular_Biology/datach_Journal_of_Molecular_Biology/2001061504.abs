protein surface amino acid compositions distinctively differ between thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria edited by f e cohen
one of the well known observations of proteins from thermophilic bacteria is the bias of the amino acid composition in which charged residues are present in large numbers and polar residues are scarce on the other hand it has been reported that the molecular surfaces of proteins are adapted to their subcellular locations in terms of the amino acid composition thus it would be reasonable to expect that the differences in the amino acid compositions between proteins of thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria would be much greater on the protein surface than in the interior we performed systematic comparisons between proteins from thermophilic bacteria and mesophilic bacteria in terms of the amino acid composition of the protein surface and the interior as well as the entire amino acid chains by using sequence information from the genome projects the biased amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins was confirmed and the differences from those of mesophilic proteins were most obvious in the compositions of the protein surface in contrast to the surface composition the interior composition was not distinctive between the thermophilic and mesophilic proteins the frequency of the amino acid pairs that are closely located in the space was also analyzed to show the same trend of the single amino acid compositions interestingly extracellular proteins from mesophilic bacteria showed an inverse trend against thermophilic proteins i e a reduced number of charged residues and rich in polar residues  nuclear proteins from eukaryotes which are known to be abundant in positive charges showed different compositions as a whole from the thermophiles these results suggest that the bias of the amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins is due to the residues on the protein surfaces which may be constrained by the extreme environment
