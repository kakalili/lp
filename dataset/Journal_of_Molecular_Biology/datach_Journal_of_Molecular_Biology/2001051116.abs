a ph controlled conformational switch in the cleavage site of the vs ribozyme substrate rna edited by i tinoco
the vs ribozyme is a   nucleotide sequence found in certain natural strains of neurospora the rna can be divided into a substrate and a catalytic domain here we present the solution structure of the substrate rna that is cleaved in a trans reaction by the catalytic domain in the presence of mg  the  nucleotide substrate rna forms a compact helix capped by a flexible loop the cleavage site bulge contains three non canonical base pairs including an a  c pair with a protonated adenine this adenine a   is a ph controlled conformational switch that opens up the internal loop at higher ph the possible significance of this switch for substrate recognition and cleavage is discussed
