folding and association of an extremely stable dimeric protein from sulfolobus islandicus
orf  is a plasmid encoded protein from sulfolobus islandicus which probably controls the copy number of the prn plasmid by binding to its own promotor the protein showed an extremely high stability in denaturant heat and ph induced unfolding transitions which can be well described by a two state reaction between native dimers and unfolded monomers the homodimeric character of native orf  was confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation far uv circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy gave superimposable denaturant induced unfolding transitions and the midpoints of both heat as well as denaturant induced unfolding depend on the protein concentration supporting the two state model this model was confirmed by gdmscn induced unfolding monitored by heteronuclear d nmr spectroscopy chemical denaturation was accomplished by gdmcl and gdmscn revealing a gibbs free energy of stabilization of     kj mol at   c thermal unfolding was possible only above  m gdmcl which shifted the melting temperature tm below the boiling point of water linear extrapolation of tm to  m gdmcl yielded a tm of     c   m monomer concentration  additionally orf  remains natively structured over a remarkable ph range from ph  to ph   folding kinetics were followed by far uv cd and fluorescence after either stopped flow or manual mixing all kinetic traces showed only a single phase and the two probes revealed coincident folding rates kf ku  indicating the absence of intermediates apparent first order refolding rates depend linearly on the protein concentration whereas the unfolding rates do not both lnkf and lnku depend linearly on the gdmcl concentration together folding and association of homodimeric orf  are concurrent events in the absence of denaturant orf  refolds fast     m  s   and unfolds extremely slowly   year    therefore high stability is coupled to a slow unfolding rate which is often observed for proteins of extremophilic organisms
