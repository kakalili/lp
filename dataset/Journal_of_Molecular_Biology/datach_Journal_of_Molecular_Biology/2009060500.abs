stimulation of mrna export by an f box protein mdm p in vivo
mdm p a nucleus encoded f box protein which binds to the substrate for ubiquitin mediated proteolysis is involved in maintenance of fusion competent mitochondria for various cellular functions recently mdm p has been implicated in regulation of gene expression however its mode of action in gene regulation is not clearly known in vivo with this view we have systematically analyzed here the role of mdm p in regulation of transcriptional initiation elongation mrna processing and export in saccharomyces cerevisiae using a formaldehyde based in vivo cross linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in conjunction with rt pcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization we show that mdm p is dispensable for formation of the preinitiation complex assembly association of elongating rna polymerase ii and recruitment of mrna capping enzyme cap binding complex and   end formation machinery at the transcriptionally active genes such as adh  pho  and rps  intriguingly we find that mdm p facilitates the recruitment of the transcription  export complex at these genes consistently the export of mrnas of these genes is significantly impaired in the absence of mdm p as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and rt pcr analysis of cytoplasmic mrna however such an impaired mrna export is not dependent on mitochondrial fusion as the deletion of fzo  an essential gene for mitochondrial fusion does not alter the export of adh  pho  and rps mrnas together our data demonstrate that mdm p selectively controls mrna export independently of mitochondrial fusion revealing a novel function of an f box protein in mrna export
