scrapie prion protein structural constraints obtained by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry
elucidation of the structure of scrapie prion protein prpsc  essential to understand the molecular mechanism of prion transmission continues to be one of the major challenges in prion research and is hampered by the insolubility and polymeric character of prpsc limited proteolysis is a useful tool to obtain insight on structural features of proteins proteolytic enzymes cleave proteins more readily at exposed sites preferentially within loops and rarely in  strands we treated prpsc isolated from brains of hamsters infected with  k and drowsy prions with varying concentrations of proteinase k pk  after pk deactivation prpsc was denatured reduced and cleaved at cys  with  nitro  thiocyanatobenzoic acid fragments were analyzed by nano hplc mass spectrometry and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization besides the known cleavages at positions     and  for  k prions and at positions         and   for drowsy prions our data clearly demonstrate the existence of additional cleavage sites at more internal positions including             and   in both strains pk concentration dependence analysis and limited proteolysis after partial unfolding of prpsc confirmed that only the mentioned cleavage sites at the n terminal side of the prpsc are susceptible to pk our results indicate that besides the  classic  amino terminal pk cleavage points prpsc contains in its middle core regions that show some degree of susceptibility to proteases and must therefore correspond to subdomains with some degree of structural flexibility interspersed with stretches of amino acids of high resistance to proteases these results are compatible with a structure consisting of short  sheet stretches connected by loops and turns
