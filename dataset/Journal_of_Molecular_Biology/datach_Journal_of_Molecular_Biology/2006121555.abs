early events in the binding of the pps  replication protein repa to single iteron and operator dna sequences
repa protein encoded in the pseudomonas pps  replicon is a stable dimer in solution drepa  acting as a self repressor of repa transcription through binding to an inverted repeat operator however repa monomers mrepa are required to initiate plasmid replication upon binding to four directly repeated dna sequences iterons  repa is composed of two winged helix wh domains c terminal wh is the main dna binding domain dbd for both target sequences whereas n terminal wh acts as dimerization interface in drepa but becomes a second dbd in mrepa on the basis of cd spectroscopy hydrodynamics x ray crystallography and model building studies we proposed previously that the activation of repa initiator implies a large structural change in wh  coupled to protein monomerization and interdomain compaction here we report novel features in the process binding curves of repa to an iteron followed by fluorescence anisotropy in solution and by surface plasmon resonance on immobilized dna exhibit the profiles characteristic of transitions between three states in contrast repa r c a monomeric activated mutant exhibits a single binding transition this suggests the presence of an intermediate species in the iteron induced dissociation and structural transformation of repa high concentrations of bovine serum albumin or ovalbumin macromolecular crowding enhance repa affinity for an iteron in solution and in gel mobility shift assays result in the visualization of novel protein  dna complexes repa induced dna bending requires the binding of two wh domains either both wh in dimers operator or wh plus wh in monomers iteron
