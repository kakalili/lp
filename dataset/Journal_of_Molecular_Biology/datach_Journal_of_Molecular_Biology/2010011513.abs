local rather than global folding enables the lead dependent activity of the   deoxyribozyme evidence from contact photo crosslinking
the   deoxyribozyme is an in vitro selected enzyme capable of sequence specific cleavage of rna while selected to be a magnesium and zinc utilizing enzyme the   dnazyme has been shown to utilize lead for its catalysis fluorescence based experiments have indicated that the magnesium and zinc utilizing versions of the dnazyme  substrate complex need to form a defined tertiary structure to be active but no such global folding is required for the lead mediated activity here we have investigated this phenomenon including the use of contact photo crosslinking to map the tertiary fold of the lead dependent dnazyme while our results recapitulate that global folding is not required for the lead activity they reveal strikingly distinct lead mediated modes of activity under conditions of low versus moderate solution ionic strength even in very low salt buffers where no global folding of the   dnazyme occurs the active site of the enzyme appears to form a distinct local fold one that cannot be modelled easily by dna rna constructs that preserve key sequence and secondary structure features of the active site
