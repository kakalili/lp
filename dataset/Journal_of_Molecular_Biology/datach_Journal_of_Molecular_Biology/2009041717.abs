a systematic in vitro study of nucleoprotein complexes formed by bacterial nucleoid associated proteins revealing novel types of dna organization
bacterial nucleoid is a dynamic entity that changes its three dimensional shape and compaction depending on cellular physiology while these changes are tightly associated with compositional alterations of abundant nucleoid associated proteins implicated in reshaping the nucleoid their cooperation in regular long range dna organization is poorly understood in this study we reconstitute a novel nucleoprotein structure in vitro which is stabilized by cooperative effects of major bacterial dna architectural proteins while individually these proteins stabilize alternative dna architectures consistent with either plectonemic or toroidal coiling of dna the combination of histone like protein histone like nucleoid structuring protein and integration host factor produces a conspicuous semiperiodic structure by employing a bottom  up in vitro approach we thus characterize a minimum set of bacterial proteins cooperating in organizing a regular dna structure visualized structures suggest a mechanism for nucleation of topological transitions underlying the reshaping of dna by bacterial nucleoid associated proteins
