model guided mutagenesis drives functional studies of human nha  implicated in hypertension
human nha is a poorly characterized na h antiporter recently implicated in essential hypertension we used a range of computational tools and evolutionary conservation analysis to build and validate a three dimensional model of nha based on the crystal structure of a distantly related bacterial transporter nhaa the model guided mutagenic evaluation of transport function ion selectivity and ph dependence of nha by phenotype screening in yeast we describe a cluster of essential highly conserved titratable residues located in an assembly region made of two discontinuous helices of inverted topology each interrupted by an extended chain whereas in nhaa oppositely charged residues compensate for partial dipoles generated within this assembly in nha  polar but uncharged residues suffice our findings led to a model for transport mechanism that was compared to the well known electroneutral nhe and electrogenic nhaa subtypes this study establishes nha as a prototype for the poorly understood yet ubiquitous cpa antiporter family recently recognized in plants and metazoans and illustrates a structure driven approach to derive functional information on a newly discovered transporter
