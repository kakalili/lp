Mutant tRNAs containing an extra nucleotide in the anticodon loop are known to suppress +1 frameshift mutations, but in no case has the molecular mechanism been clarified. It has been proposed that the expanded anticodon pairs with a complementary mRNA sequence (the frameshift sequence) in the A site, and this quadruplet “codon-anticodon” helix is translocated to the P site to restore the correct reading frame. Here, we analyze the ability of tRNA analogs containing expanded anticodons to recognize and position mRNA in ribosomal complexes in vitro. In all cases tested, 8 nt anticodon loops position the 3′ three-quarters of the frameshift sequence in the P site, indicating that the 5′ bases of the expanded anticodon (nucleotides 33.5, 34, and 35) pair with mRNA in the P site. We also provide evidence that four base-pairs can form between the P-site tRNA and mRNA, and the fourth base-pair involves nucleotide 36 of the tRNA and lies toward (or in) the 30 S E site. In the A site, tRNA analogs with the expanded anticodon ACCG are able to recognize either CGG or GGU. These data imply a flexibility of the expanded anticodon in the A site. Recognition of the 5′ three-quarters of the frameshift sequence in the A site and subsequent translocation of the expanded anticodon to the P site results in movement of mRNA by four nucleotides, explaining how these tRNAs can change the mRNA register in the ribosome to restore the correct reading frame.
