a quantitative kinetic scheme for   s translation initiation complex formation
association of the   s initiation complex  sic and the   s ribosomal subunit leading to formation of the   s initiation complex  sic  is a critical step of the translation initiation pathway the  sic contains initiator trna fmet trnafmet bound in the p peptidyl site in response to the aug start codon we have formulated a quantitative kinetic scheme for the formation of an active  sic from  sic and   s subunits on the basis of parallel rapid kinetics measurements of gtp hydrolysis pi release light scattering and changes in fluorescence intensities of fluorophore labeled if and fmet trnafmet according to this scheme an initially formed labile   s complex which promotes rapid if dependent gtp hydrolysis either dissociates reversibly into   s and   s subunits or is converted to a more stable form leading to  sic formation the latter process takes place with intervening conformational changes of ribosome bound if and fmet trnafmet which are monitored by spectral changes of fluorescent derivatives of if and fmet trnafmet the availability of such a scheme provides a useful framework for precisely elucidating the mechanisms by which substituting the non hydrolyzable analog gdpcp for gtp or adding thiostrepton inhibit formation of a productive  sic gdpcp does not affect stable   s formation but perturbs fmet trnafmet positioning in the p site in contrast thiostrepton severely retards stable   s formation but allows normal binding of fmet trnafmet prf  to the p site
