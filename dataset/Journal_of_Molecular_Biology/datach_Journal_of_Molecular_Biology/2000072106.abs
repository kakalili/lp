catalysis of the oxidative folding of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a by protein disulfide isomerase
the major oxidative folding pathways of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a at ph   and   c involve a pre equilibrium steady state among ensembles of intermediates with zero one two three and four disulfide bonds the rate determining steps are the reshuffling of the unstructured three disulfide ensemble to two native like three disulfide species des     and des     that convert to the native structure during oxidative formation of the fourth disulfide bond under the same regeneration conditions with oxidized and reduced dtt used previously for kinetic oxidative folding studies of this protein the addition of  m protein disulfide isomerase pdi was found to lead to catalysis of each disulfide formation step including the rate limiting rearrangement steps in which the native like intermediates des     and des     are formed the changes in the distribution of intermediates were also determined in the presence and absence of pdi at three different temperatures with the dtt redox system as well as at   c with the glutathione redox system  the results indicate that the acceleration of the formation of native protein by pdi which we observed earlier is due to pdi catalysis of each of the intermediate steps without changing the overall pathways or folding mechanism
