mic  a core subunit of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system interacts with the dimeric f fo atp synthase
the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system micos is crucial for maintaining the architecture of the mitochondrial inner membrane micos is enriched at crista junctions that connect the two inner membrane domains inner boundary membrane and cristae membrane micos promotes the formation of crista junctions whereas the oligomeric f fo atp synthase is crucial for shaping cristae rims indicating antagonistic functions of these machineries in organizing inner membrane architecture we report that the micos core subunit mic  but not mic  binds to the f fo atp synthase mic  selectively associates with the dimeric form of the atp synthase and supports the formation of atp synthase oligomers our results suggest that mic  plays a dual role in mitochondrial inner membrane architecture in addition to its central function in sculpting crista junctions a fraction of mic  molecules interact with the cristae rim forming f fo atp synthase
