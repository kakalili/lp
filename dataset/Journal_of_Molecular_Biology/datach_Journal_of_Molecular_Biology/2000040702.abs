crystallization of the yeast mat  mcm dna ternary complex general methods and principles for protein dna cocrystallization edited by k nagai
we describe our efforts to crystallize binary mcm dna and ternary mat  mcm dna complexes including the unsuccessful attempts to crystallize mcm dna complexes and the successful design of dna crystal packing that resulted in high resolution crystals of the mat  mcm dna complex we detail general procedures useful for preparing protein dna cocrystals including improved methods for producing and purifying dna binding proteins and dna fragments for purifying protein dna complexes and for controlling ph conditions during crystallization we also describe the rational design of dna for protein dna cocrystallization attempts based on our analysis of how straight and bent dna with single base pair overhangs can pack end to end in a crystal
