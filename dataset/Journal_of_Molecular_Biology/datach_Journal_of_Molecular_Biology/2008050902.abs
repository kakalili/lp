crystal structure of ca  free s  a at    resolution
s  a is an ef hand containing ca  binding protein of the family of s  proteins the protein is localized exclusively in the nucleus and is involved in cell cycle regulation it attracted most interest by its function as a tumor suppressor via p  interaction we determined the crystal structure of homodimeric s  a in the ca  free state at    resolution the structure revealed structural differences between subunits a and b especially in the conformation of a loop that connects the n and c terminal ef hands and represents a part of the target binding site in s  proteins analysis of the hydrogen bonding network and molecular dynamics calculations indicate that one of the two observed conformations is more stable the structure revealed na bound to each n terminal ef hand of both subunits coordinated by oxygen atoms of the backbone carbonyl and water molecules comparison with the structures of ca  free s  a and s  a suggests that na might occupy the s  specific ef hand in the ca  free state
