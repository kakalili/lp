crystal structures of shikimate dehydrogenase aroe from thermus thermophilus hb and its cofactor and substrate complexes insights into the enzymatic mechanism
shikimate dehydrogenase ec      catalyses the fourth step of the shikimate pathway which is required for the synthesis of the aromatic amino acids and other aromatic compounds in bacteria microbial eukaryotes and plants the crystal structures of the shikimate dehydrogenase aroe from thermus thermophilus hb in its ligand free form binary complexes with cofactor nadp or substrate shikimate and the ternary complex with both nadp h and shikimate were determined by x ray diffraction method at atomic resolutions the crystals are nearly isomorphous with the asymmetric unit containing a dimer each subunit of which has a bi domain structure of compact    sandwich folds the two subunits of the enzyme display asymmetry in the crystals due to different relative orientations between the n and c terminal domains resulting in a slightly different closure of the interdomain clefts nadp h is bound to the more closed form only this closed conformation with apparent higher affinity to the cofactor is also observed in the unliganded crystal form indicating that the nadp h binding to ttaroe may follow the selection mode where the cofactor binds to the subunit that happens to be in the closed conformation in solution crystal structures of the closed subunits with and without nadp h show no significant structural difference suggesting that the cofactor binding to the closed subunit corresponds to the lock and key model in ttaroe on the other hand shikimate binds to both open and closed subunit conformers of both apo and nadp h liganded holo enzyme forms the ternary complex ttaroe nadp h shikimate allows unambiguous visualization of the sdh permitting elucidation of the roles of conserved residues lys  and asp  in the hydride ion transfer between nadp h and shikimate
