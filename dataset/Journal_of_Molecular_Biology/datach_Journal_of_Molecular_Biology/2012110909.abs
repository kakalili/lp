tandem adaptation with a common design in escherichia coli chemotaxis
we analyze a model for motor level adaptation in escherichia coli based upon the premise that clockwise cw and counter clockwise ccw states have different preferred numbers of flim subunits we show that this model provides a simple mechanism for the recently observed motor level adaptation and it also explains the long lasting puzzle on the thresholds observed when tethered cells are used to monitor responses to temporal ramps we note that the motor level adaptation has the same negative feedback network design as the upstream receptor level adaptation and the tandem architecture of one control circuit followed by the other mitigates the effects of cell to cell variation and broadens the range of stimuli over which cells optimally respond
