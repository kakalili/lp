conformational properties of  synuclein in its free and lipid associated states edited by p e wright
synuclein  s is a presynaptic terminal protein that is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of parkinson  s disease pd  we have used nmr spectroscopy to characterize the conformational properties of  s in solution as a free monomer and when bound to lipid vesicles and lipid mimetic detergent micelles free wild type  s is largely unfolded in solution but exhibits a region with a preference for helical conformations that may be important in the aggregation of  s into fibrils the n terminal region of  s binds to synthetic lipid vesicles and detergent micelles in vitro and adopts a highly helical conformation consistent with predictions based on sequence analysis the c terminal part of the protein does not associate with either vesicles or micelles remaining free and unfolded these results suggest that one function of  s may be to tether as of yet unidentified partners to lipid surfaces via interactions with its c terminal tail
