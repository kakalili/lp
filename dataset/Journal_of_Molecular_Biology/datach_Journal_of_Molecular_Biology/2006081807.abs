simulations of the myosin ii motor reveal a nucleotide state sensing element that controls the recovery stroke
during the recovery stroke the myosin motor is primed for the next power stroke by a   rotation of its lever arm this reversible motion is coupled to the activation of the atpase function of myosin through conformational changes along the relay helix which runs from the switch  loop near the atp to the converter domain carrying the lever arm via a hydrogen bond between the side chain of asn  on the relay helix and the gly  ser  peptide group on the switch  the rotation of the converter domain is coupled to the formation of a hydrogen bond between gly  and  phosphate that is essential for atp hydrolysis here molecular dynamics simulations of dictyostelium discoideum myosin ii in the two end conformations of the recovery stroke with different nucleotide states atp adp pi adp reveal that the side chain of asn  breaks away from switch  upon atp hydrolysis to make a hydrogen bond with tyr   this sensing of the nucleotide state is achieved by a small displacement of the cleaved  phosphate towards gly  which in turn pushes asn  away the sensing plays a dual role by i preventing the wasteful reversal of the recovery stroke while the nucleotide is in the adp pi state and ii decoupling the relay helix from switch  thus allowing the power stroke to start upon initial binding to actin while gly  of switch  keeps interacting with the pi known to be released only later after tight actin binding  a catalytically important salt bridge between arg   on switch  and glu   on switch   which covers the hydrolysis site is seen to form rapidly when atp is added to the pre recovery stroke conformer and remains stable after the recovery stroke indicating that it has a role in shaping the atp binding site by induced fit
