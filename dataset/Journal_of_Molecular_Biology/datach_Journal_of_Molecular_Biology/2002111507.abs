the disulphide mapping folding and characterisation of recombinant ber e  an allergenic protein and sfa  two sulphur rich s plant albumins
we have cloned and expressed genes encoding the allergenic brazil nut s albumin ber e  and the sunflower albumin  sfa  in the methylotrophic yeast pichia pastoris we show that both proteins were secreted at high levels and that the purified proteins were properly folded we also showed that ber e  is glycosylated during secretion and that the glycan does not interfere with the folding or immunoreactivity the disulphide map of the ber e  protein was experimentally established and is in agreement with the conserved disulphide structure of other members of the s albumin family a model three dimensional structure of the allergen was generated during the expression studies and through mutation we have also shown that alteration of the sequences around the kex endoproteolytic processing site in the expressed fusion protein can compromise the secretion by targeting part of the protein for possible degradation the secreted production of these properly folded sulphur rich plant albumins presents an opportunity to delineate the attributes that make an allergen and to facilitate the diagnosis and therapy of type i allergy
