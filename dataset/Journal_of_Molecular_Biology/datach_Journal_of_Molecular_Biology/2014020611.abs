exploring the minimally frustrated energy landscape of unfolded acbp
the unfolded state of globular proteins is not well described by a simple statistical coil due to residual structural features such as secondary structure or transiently formed long range contacts the principle of minimal frustration predicts that the unfolded ensemble is biased toward productive regions in the conformational space determined by the native structure transient long range contacts both native like and non native like have previously been shown to be present in the unfolded state of the four helix bundle protein acyl co enzyme binding protein acbp as seen from both perturbations in nuclear magnetic resonance nmr chemical shifts and structural ensembles generated from nmr paramagnetic relaxation data to study the nature of the contacts in detail we used paramagnetic nmr relaxation enhancements in combination with single point mutations to obtain distance constraints for the acid unfolded ensemble of acbp we show that even in the acid unfolded state long range contacts are specific in nature and single point mutations affect the free energy landscape of the unfolded protein using this approach we were able to map out concerted interconnected and productive long range contacts the correlation between the native state stability and compactness of the denatured state provides further evidence for native like contact formation in the denatured state overall these results imply that even in the earliest stages of folding acbp dynamics are governed by native like contacts on a minimally frustrated energy landscape
