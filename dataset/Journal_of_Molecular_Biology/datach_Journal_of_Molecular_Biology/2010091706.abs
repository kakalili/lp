structure of the rna binding domain of a dead box helicase bound to its ribosomal rna target reveals a novel mode of recognition by an rna recognition motif
dead box rna helicases of the bacterial dbpa subfamily are localized to their biological substrate when a carboxy terminal rna recognition motif domain binds tightly and specifically to a segment of  s ribosomal rna rrna that includes hairpin  of the peptidyl transferase center a complex between a fragment of  s rrna and the rna binding domain rbd of the bacillus subtilis dbpa protein yxin was crystallized and its structure was determined to     resolution revealing an rna recognition mode that differs from those observed with other rna recognition motifs the rbd is bound between two rna strands at a three way junction multiple phosphates of the rna backbone interact with an electropositive band generated by lysines of the rbd nucleotides of the single stranded loop of hairpin  interact with the rbd including the guanosine base of g   which forms three hydrogen bonds with the peptide backbone a g  u mutation reduces the rna binding affinity by  orders of magnitude confirming that g   is a sequence specificity determinant in rna binding binding of the rbd to  s rrna in the late stages of ribosome subunit maturation would position the atp binding duplex destabilization fragment of the protein for interaction with rrna in the peptidyl transferase cleft of the subunit allowing it to  melt out  unstable secondary structures and allow proper folding
