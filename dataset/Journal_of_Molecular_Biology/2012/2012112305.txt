The R3H domain is a conserved sequence motif in nucleic acid binding proteins. Previously, we reported the solution structure of the R3H domain and identified a putative nucleic acid binding site composed of three conserved basic residues [Liepinsh, E., Leonchiks, A., Sharipo, A., Guignard, L. &amp; Otting, G. (2003). Solution structure of the R3H domain from human Sμbp‐2. J. Mol. Biol. 326, 217–223]. Here, we determine the binding affinities of mononucleotides and dinucleotides for the R3H domain from human Sμbp-2 (Sμbp2-R3H) and map their binding sites on the protein's surface. Although the binding affinities show up to 260-fold selectivity between different nucleotides, their binding sites and conformations seem very similar. Further, we report the NMR structure of the Sμbp2-R3H in complex with deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate (dGMP) mimicking the 5′-end of single-stranded DNA. Pseudocontact shifts from a paramagnetic lanthanide tag attached to residue 731 in the mutant A731C confirmed that binding of dGMP brings a loop of the protein into closer proximity. The structure provides the first structural insight into single-stranded nucleic acid recognition by the R3H domain and shows that the R3H domain specifically binds the phosphorylated 5′-end through electrostatic interactions with the two conserved arginines and stacking interactions with the highly conserved histidine.
