the shuttling protein npl promotes translation termination accuracy in saccharomyces cerevisiae
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins are multifunctional proteins that bind to newly synthesized mrnas in the nucleus and participate in many subsequent steps of gene expression a well studied saccharomyces cerevisiae heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein that has several nuclear functions is npl p here we provide evidence that npl p also has a cytoplasmic role it functions in translation termination fidelity yeast harboring the npl   mutant allele have an impaired ability to translate lacz enhanced sensitivity to cycloheximide and paromomycin and increased ability to read through translation termination codons most of these defects are enhanced in yeast that also lack upf p an rna surveillance factor crucial for translation termination we show that the npl   mutant allele encodes a form of npl p that is part of high molecular weight complexes that cofractionate with the poly a binding protein pab p together these results lead us to propose a model in which npl p engenders translational fidelity by promoting the remodeling of mrnps during translation termination
