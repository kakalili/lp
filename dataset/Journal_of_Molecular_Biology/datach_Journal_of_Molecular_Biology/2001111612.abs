the phosphoryl transfer mechanism of escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from the use of alf  edited by r huber
the mechanism of reversible transfer of the  phosphate group of atp by escherichia coli phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pck on to its substrate is of great interest it is known that metallofluorides are accurate analogs of the transition state in the context of kinase mechanisms therefore two complexes of pck one with alf  mg  and adp complex i  the other with alf  mg  adp and pyruvate complex ii were crystallized the x ray crystal structures of these two complexes were determined at    resolution the al atom has trigonal bipyramidal geometry that mimics the transition state of phosphoryl transfer the al atom is at a distance of    and    from an oxygen atom of the  phosphoryl group of adp in complex i and ii respectively a water molecule in complex i and an oxygen atom of the pyruvate in complex ii are located along the axis of the trigonal bipyramid on the side opposite to the  phosphoryl oxygen with respect to the equatorial plane suggesting that the complexes are close mimics of the transition state along with the presence of positively charged species around the alf moiety these results indicate that phosphoryl transfer occurs via a direct displacement mechanism with associative qualities
