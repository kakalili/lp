Filamentous bacteriophage assemble at the host membrane in a non-lytic process; the gene-3 minor coat protein (P3) is required for release from the membrane and subsequently, for recognition and infection of a new host. P3 contains at least three distinct domains: two N-terminal domains that mediate host recognition and infection, and a C-terminal domain (P3-C) that is required for release from the host cell following phage assembly and contributes to the structural stability of the phage particle. A comprehensive mutational analysis of the 150 residue P3-C revealed that only 24 side-chains, located within the last 70 residues of sequence, were necessary for efficient incorporation into a wild-type coat. The results reveal that the requirements for the assembly of P3 into the phage particle are quite lax and involve only a few key side-chains. These findings shed light on the functional and structural requirements for filamentous phage assembly, and they may provide guidelines for the engineering of improved coat proteins as scaffolds for phage display technology.
