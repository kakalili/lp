reversible adenylylation of glutamine synthetase is dynamically counterbalanced during steady state growth of escherichia coli
glutamine synthetase gs is the central enzyme for nitrogen assimilation in escherichia coli and is subject to reversible adenylylation inactivation by a bifunctional gs adenylyltransferase adenylyl removing enzyme atase  in vitro both of the opposing activities of atase are regulated by small effectors most notably glutamine and  oxoglutarate in vivo adenylyltransferase at activity is critical for growth adaptation when cells are shifted from nitrogen limiting to nitrogen excess conditions and a rapid decrease of gs activity by adenylylation is needed here we show that the adenylyl removing ar activity of atase is required to counterbalance its at activity during steady state growth under both nitrogen excess and nitrogen limiting conditions this conclusion was established by studying ar  at mutants which surprisingly displayed steady state growth defects in nitrogen excess conditions due to excessive gs adenylylation moreover gs was abnormally adenylylated in the ar  mutants even under nitrogen limiting conditions whereas there was little gs adenylylation in wild type strains despite the importance of ar activity we establish that at activity is significantly regulated in vivo mainly by the cellular glutamine concentration there is good general agreement between quantitative estimates of at regulation in vivo and results derived from previous in vitro studies except at very low at activities we propose additional mechanisms for the low at activities in vivo the results suggest that dynamic counterbalance by reversible covalent modification may be a general strategy for controlling the activity of enzymes such as gs whose physiological output allows adaptation to environmental fluctuations
