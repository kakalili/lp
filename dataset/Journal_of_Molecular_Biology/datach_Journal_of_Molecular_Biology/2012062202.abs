the structure of the conserved type six secretion protein tssl dotu from francisella novicida
type six secretion systems t sss are found in many gram negative bacteria and are important for their virulence or their ecological competitiveness the multicomponent t sss are responsible for the translocation of effector molecules into target eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells the francisella pathogenicity island encodes a putative t ss that francisella novicida requires for intramacrophage growth and virulence during infection of rodents here we present the x ray crystal structure of the conserved type six secretion component tssl dotu from f novicida the structure of this protein which is referred to as ftn tssl revealed an all  helical fold that is a unique fusion of two  helix bundles the sequence of ftn tssl shows low identity to presumed homologs that are found in most t sss the structure of ftn tssl however has allowed us to provide bioinformatics evidence that the f novicida tssl has a fold that is very likely representative for tssl forms from both t sss and from the distantly related b subclass of type four secretion systems a map of sequence conservation on the tssl structure revealed a surface exposed groove that may represent a functional site on the protein
