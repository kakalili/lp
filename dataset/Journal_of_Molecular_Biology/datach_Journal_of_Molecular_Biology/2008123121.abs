specificity and reactivity in menaquinone biosynthesis the structure of escherichia coli mend  succinyl  enolpyruvyl  hydroxy  cyclohexadiene  carboxylate synthase
the thiamine diphosphate thdp and metal ion dependent enzyme  succinyl  enolpyruvyl  hydroxy  cyclohexadiene  carboxylate synthase or mend catalyze the stetter like conjugate addition of  ketoglutarate with isochorismate to release  succinyl  enolpyruvyl  hydroxy  cyclohexadiene  carboxylate and carbon dioxide this reaction represents the first committed step for biosynthesis of menaquinone or vitamin k  a key cofactor for electron transport in bacteria and a metabolite for posttranslational modification of proteins in mammals the medium resolution structure of mend from escherichia coli ecmend in complex with its cofactor and mn  has been determined in two related hexagonal crystal forms the subunit displays the typical three domain structure observed for thdp dependent enzymes in which two of the domains bind and force the cofactor into a configuration that supports formation of a reactive ylide the structures reveal a stable dimer of dimers association in agreement with gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation studies and confirm the classification of mend in the pyruvate oxidase family of thdp dependent enzymes the active site created by contributions from a pair of subunits is highly basic with a pronounced hydrophobic patch these features formed by highly conserved amino acids match well to the chemical properties of the substrates a model of the covalent intermediate formed after reaction with the first substrate  ketoglutarate and with the second substrate isochorismate positioned to accept nucleophilic attack has been prepared this in addition to structural and sequence comparisons with putative mend orthologues provides insight into the specificity and reactivity of mend and allows a two stage reaction mechanism to be proposed
