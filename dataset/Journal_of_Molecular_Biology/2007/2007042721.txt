Arrestins regulate the activity and subcellular localization of G protein-coupled receptors and other signaling molecules. Here, we demonstrate that arrestins bind microtubules (MTs) in vitro and in vivo. The MT-binding site on arrestins overlaps significantly with the receptor-binding site, but the conformations of MT-bound and receptor-bound arrestin are different. Arrestins recruit ERK1/2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 to MTs in cells, similar to the arrestin-dependent mobilization of these proteins to the receptor. Arrestin-mediated sequestration of ERK to MTs reduces the level of ERK activation. In contrast, recruitment of Mdm2 to MTs by arrestin channels Mdm2 activity toward cytoskeleton-associated proteins, increasing their ubiquitination dramatically. The mobilization of signaling molecules to MTs is a novel biological function of arrestin proteins.
