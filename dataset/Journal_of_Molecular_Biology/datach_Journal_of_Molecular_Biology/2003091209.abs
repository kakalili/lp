efficient repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at mutational hot spots is restored in complemented xeroderma pigmentosum group c and trichothiodystrophy xeroderma pigmentosum group d cells
xeroderma pigmentosum xp and trichothiodystrophy ttd are rare heritable diseases patients suffering from xp and   of ttd afflicted individuals are photosensitive and have a high susceptibility to develop skin tumors one solution to alleviating symptoms of these diseases is to express the deficient cdnas in patient cells as a form of gene therapy xpc and ttd xpd cell lines were complemented using retroviral transfer expressed wild type xpc or xpd cdnas in these cells restored the survival to uvc radiation to wild type levels in the respective complementation groups although complemented xp cell lines have been studied for years data on cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer cpd repair in these cells at different levels are sparse we demonstrate that cpd repair is faster in the complemented lines at the global gene strand specific and nucleotide specific levels than in the original lines in both xpc and ttd xpd complemented lines cpd repair on the non transcribed strand is faster than that for the mrc sv line however global repair in the complemented cell lines and mrc sv is still slower than in normal human fibroblasts despite the slower global repair rate in the complemented xpc and ttd xpd cells almost all of the cpds at  hotspots  for mutation in the p  tumor database are repaired as rapidly as in normal human fibroblasts such evaluation of repair at nucleotide resolution in complemented nucleotide excision repair deficient cells presents a crucial way to determine the efficient re establishment of function needed for successful gene therapy even when full repair capacity is not restored
