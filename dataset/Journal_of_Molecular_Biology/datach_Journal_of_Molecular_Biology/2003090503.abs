potential for dramatic improvement in sequence alignment against structures of remote homologous proteins by extracting structural information from multiple structure alignment
a novel method has been developed for acquiring the correct alignment of a query sequence against remotely homologous proteins by extracting structural information from profiles of multiple structure alignment a systematic search algorithm combined with a group of score functions based on sequence information and structural information has been introduced in this procedure a limited number of top solutions     with high scores were selected as candidates for further examination on a test set comprising   proteins from  protein families with sequence identity less than   the proportion of proteins with completely correct alignment as first candidate was improved to    by our method whereas the typical performance of existing sequence based alignment methods was only between    and    furthermore multiple candidates for possible alignment were provided in our approach which dramatically increased the possibility of finding correct alignment such that completely correct alignments were found amongst the top ranked   candidates in    of the proteins with the assistance of a sequence database completely correct alignment solutions were achieved amongst the top   candidates in    of the proteins from such a limited number of candidates it would become possible to identify more correct alignment using a more time consuming but more powerful method with more detailed structural information such as side chain packing and energy minimization etc the results indicate that the novel alignment strategy could be helpful for extending the application of highly reliable methods for fold identification and homology modeling to a huge number of homologous proteins of low sequence similarity details of the methods together with the results and implications for future development are presented
