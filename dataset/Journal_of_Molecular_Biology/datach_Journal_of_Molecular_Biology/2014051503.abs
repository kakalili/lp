a new crystal structure of the bifunctional antibiotic simocyclinone d bound to dna gyrase gives fresh insight into the mechanism of inhibition
simocyclinone d  sd  is an antibiotic produced by streptomyces antibioticus that targets dna gyrase a previous structure of sd complexed with the n terminal domain of the dna gyrase a protein gyra suggested that four sd molecules stabilized a tetramer of the protein subsequent mass spectrometry experiments suggested that a protein dimer with two symmetry related sd s was more likely this work describes the structures of a further truncated form of the gyra n terminal domain fragment with and without sd bound the structure with sd has the two sd molecules bound within the same gyra dimer this new structure is entirely consistent with the mutations in gyra that confer sd resistance and by comparison with a new apo structure of the gyra n terminal domain reveals the likely conformation changes that occur upon sd binding and the detailed mechanism of sd inhibition of gyrase isothermal titration calorimetry experiments are consistent with the crystallography results and further suggest that a previously observed complex between sd and gyrb is    fold weaker than the interaction with gyra
