crystal structure of a natural circularly permuted jellyroll protein       d glucanase from fibrobacter succinogenes
the      d glucanase from fibrobacter succinogenes fs  glucanase is classified as one of the family  glycosyl hydrolases it hydrolyzes the glycosidic bond in the mixed linked glucans containing     and    glycosidic linkages we constructed a truncated form of recombinant fs  glucanase containing the catalytic domain from amino acid residues     which exhibited a higher thermal stability and enzymatic activity than the full length enzyme the crystal structure of the truncated fs  glucanase was solved at a resolution of    by the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion mad method using the anomalous signals from the seleno methionine labeled protein the overall topology of the truncated fs  glucanase consists mainly of two eight stranded anti parallel  sheets arranged in a jellyroll  sandwich similar to the fold of many glycosyl hydrolases and carbohydrate binding modules sequence comparison with other bacterial glucanases showed that fs  glucanase is the only naturally occurring circularly permuted  glucanase with reversed sequences structural comparison shows that the engineered circular permuted bacillus enzymes are more similar to their parent enzymes with which they share    sequence identity than to the naturally occurring fs  glucanase of similar topology with   identity this result suggests that protein structure relies more on sequence identity than topology the high resolution structure of fs  glucanase provides a structural rationale for the different activities obtained from a series of mutant glucanases and a basis for the development of engineered enzymes with increased activity and structural stability
