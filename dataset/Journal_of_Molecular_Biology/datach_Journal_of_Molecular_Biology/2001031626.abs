crystal structure of unligated guanylate kinase from yeast reveals gmp induced conformational changes edited by i wilson
the crystal structure of guanylate kinase gk from yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae with a non acetylated n terminus has been determined in its unligated form apo gk as well as in complex with gmp gk gmp  the structure of apo gk was solved with multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data and refined to an r factor of    rfree     at    resolution the structure of gk gmp was determined using the crystal structure of gk with an acetylated n terminus as the search model and refined to an r factor of    rfree     at     gk belongs to the family of nucleoside monophosphate nmp kinases and catalyzes the reversible phosphoryl transfer from atp to gmp like other nmp kinases gk consists of three dynamic domains the core lid and nmp binding domains dramatic movements of the gmp binding domain and smaller but significant movements of the lid domain have been revealed by comparing the structures of apo gk and gk gmp apo gk has a much more open conformation than the gk gmp complex systematic analysis of the domain movements using the program dyndom shows that the large movements of the gmp binding domain involve a rotation around an effective hinge axis approximately parallel with helix  which connects the gmp binding and core domains the c terminal portion of helix  which connects to the core domain has strikingly higher temperature factors in gk gmp than in apo gk indicating that these residues become more mobile upon gmp binding the results suggest that helix  plays an important role in domain movement unlike the gmp binding domain which moves toward the active center of the enzyme upon gmp binding the lid domain moves away from the active center and makes the presumed atp binding site more open therefore the lid domain movement may facilitate the binding of mgatp the structure of the recombinant gk gmp complex superimposes very well with that of the native gk gmp complex indicating that n terminal acetylation does not have significant impact on the three dimensional structure of gk
