crystal structure of a cellulosomal family  carbohydrate esterase from clostridium thermocellum provides insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition
the microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is of increasing industrial significance exemplified by the interest in generating biofuels from plant cell walls the majority of plant cell wall polysaccharides are acetylated and removal of the acetyl groups through the action of carbohydrate esterases greatly increases the efficiency of polysaccharide saccharification enzymes in carbohydrate esterase family  ce  are common in plant cell wall degrading microorganisms but there is a paucity of structural and biochemical information on these biocatalysts clostridium thermocellum contains a single ce enzyme ctces  which comprises two highly homologous   sequence identity catalytic modules appended to a c terminal type i dockerin that targets the esterase into the cellulosome a large protein complex that catalyses plant cell wall degradation here we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of the n terminal catalytic module ctces   of ctces  the enzyme is a thermostable acetyl specific esterase that exhibits a strong preference for acetylated xylan ctces  displays an    hydrolase fold that contains a central five stranded parallel twisted  sheet flanked by six  helices in addition the enzyme contains a canonical catalytic triad in which ser  is the nucleophile his  is the acid base and asp  modulates the basic nature of the histidine the acetate moiety is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket and the negative charge of the tetrahedral transition state is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the backbone n of ser  and gly  and the side chain amide of asn
