structural and functional conservation of mycobacterium tuberculosis groel paralogs suggests that groel is a chaperonin
groel is a group i chaperonin that facilitates protein folding and prevents protein aggregation in the bacterial cytosol mycobacteria are unusual in encoding two or more copies of groel in their genome while groel is essential for viability and likely functions as the general housekeeping chaperonin groel is dispensable but its structure and function remain unclear here we present the    resolution crystal structure of a  kda fragment of mycobacterium tuberculosis groel consisting of an extended apical domain our x ray structure of the groel apical domain closely resembles those of escherichia coli groel and m tuberculosis groel  thus highlighting the remarkable structural conservation of bacterial chaperonins notably in our structure the proposed substrate binding site of groel interacts with the n terminal region of a symmetry related neighboring groel molecule the latter is consistent with the known groel apical domain function in substrate binding and is supported by results obtained from using peptide array technology taken together these data show that the apical domains of m tuberculosis groel paralogs are conserved in three dimensional structure suggesting that groel  like groel  is a chaperonin
