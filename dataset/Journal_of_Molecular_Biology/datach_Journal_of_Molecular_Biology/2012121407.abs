orientation of internal signal anchor sequences at the sec  translocon
translocation and insertion of secretory and membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum are mediated by the sec  translocon evidence from in vivo as well as in vitro experiments indicates that n terminal signal anchor sequences initially insert n first before they invert their orientation to translocate the c terminus inversion is driven by flanking charges according to the positive inside rule and inhibited by increased signal hydrophobicity here we show that upon extending the n terminal hydrophilic domain preceding the signal core to more than   residues the insertion behavior changes apparent signal inversion and the effect of hydrophobicity are largely lost suggesting that n first insertion is limited to n terminal signal anchors extended n domains sterically hinder n translocation in a length dependent manner also for reverse signal anchors with inverted flanking charges the results indicate a mechanistic difference in the insertion process of n terminal and internal signal sequences
