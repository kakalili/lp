regulation of the interferon  inducible       oligoadenylate synthetases by adenovirus vai rna
foreign double stranded rna dsrna generated during the normal course of the viral life cycle serves as a key infection recognition element by proteins of the innate immune response to circumvent this response all adenoviruses synthesize at least one highly structured rna vai  which after processing by the rna silencing machinery inhibits the innate immune response via a series of interactions with specific protein partners surprisingly vai positively regulates the activity of the interferon induced       oligoadenylate synthetase oas enzymes which typically represent a key mechanism whereby host cell protein translation is attenuated in response to foreign dsrna we present data investigating the regulation of the oas isoform by vai derivatives and demonstrate that a processed version of vai lacking the terminal stem behaves as a pseudo inhibitor of oas  a combination of electrophoretic mobility shift assays dynamic light scattering and non denaturing mass spectrometry was used to quantitate binding affinity and characterize oas vai complex stoichiometry enzyme assays characterized the ability of vai derivatives to activate oas  finally the importance of rna   end phosphorylation state is investigated and it emphasizes its potential importance in the activation or inhibition of oas enzymes taken together these data suggest a plausible strategy whereby the virus produces a single rna transcript capable of inhibiting a variety of members of the innate immune response
