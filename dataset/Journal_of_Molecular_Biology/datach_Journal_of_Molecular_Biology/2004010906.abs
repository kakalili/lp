inhibition of a mitotic motor protein where how and conformational consequences
we report here the first inhibitor bound structure of a mitotic motor protein the    resolution structure of the motor domain of ksp bound with the small molecule monastrol and mg  adp reveals that monastrol confers inhibition by  induced fitting  onto the protein some   away from the catalytic center of the enzyme resulting in the creation of a previously non existing binding pocket the structure provides new insights into the biochemical and mechanical mechanisms of the mitotic motor domain inhibition of ksp provides a novel mechanism to arrest mitotic spindle formation a target of several approved and investigative anti cancer agents the structural information gleaned from this novel pocket offers a new angle for the design of anti mitotic agents
