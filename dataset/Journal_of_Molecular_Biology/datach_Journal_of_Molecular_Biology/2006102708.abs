mapping of interaction domains mediating binding between bace and rtn nogo proteins
bace is a membrane bound aspartyl protease that specifically cleaves amyloid precursor protein app at the  secretase site membrane bound reticulon rtn family proteins interact with bace and negatively modulate bace activity through preventing access of bace to its cellular app substrate here we focused our study on rtn and further show that a c terminal qid triplet conserved among mammalian rtn members is required for the binding of rtn to bace  although rtn can form homo or heterodimers in cells bace mainly binds to the rtn monomer and disruption of the qid triplet does not interfere with the dimerization correspondingly the c terminal region of bace is required for the binding of bace to rtns furthermore we show that the negative modulation of bace by rtn relies on the binding of rtn to bace  the knowledge from this study may potentially guide discovery of small molecules that can mimic the effect of rtn on the inhibition of bace activity
