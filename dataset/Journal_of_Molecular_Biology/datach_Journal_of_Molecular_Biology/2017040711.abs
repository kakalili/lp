the intersubunit bridge b b of the bacterial ribosome facilitates initiation of protein synthesis and maintenance of translational fidelity
in bacteria ribosomal subunits are connected via  intersubunit bridges involving rna  rna rna  protein and protein  protein interactions the only protein  protein bridge in the ribosome is ribosomal intersubunit bridge b b b  which is mainly formed by the bacterial protein l  bl  and connects the head domain of  s subunit and the central protuberance of the  s subunit it is known to be the most dynamic intersubunit bridge here we have evaluated the role of bl  and thereby the bridge b b in the working cycle of the ribosome first bl  deficient ribosomes are severely compromised in their ability to ensure translational fidelity particularly in reading frame maintenance in vivo second in the absence of bl  the rate of initiation is significantly reduced both in vivo and in vitro third polysome profile and subunit reassociation assays demonstrate that bl  is important for stabilizing subunit joining in vivo and in vitro together our results demonstrate that bl  is important for determining translational fidelity and stabilizing subunit association we conclude that the only protein  protein intersubunit bridge of the bacterial ribosome facilitates translation initiation and is essential for maintaining the reading frame of mrna translation
