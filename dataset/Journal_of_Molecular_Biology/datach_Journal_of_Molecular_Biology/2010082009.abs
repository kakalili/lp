structure  function analysis of the short splicing variant carboxypeptidase encoded by drosophila melanogaster silver
drosophila melanogaster silver gene is the ortholog of the coding gene of mammalian carboxypeptidase d cpd  the silver gene gives rise to eight different splicing variants of differing length that can contain up to three homologous repeats among the protein variants encoded the short form b alias dmcpd bs d melanogaster cpd variant b short is necessary and sufficient for viability of the fruit fly it has one single repeat it is active against standard peptide substrates and it is localized to the secretory pathway in this work the enzyme was found as a monomer in solution and as a homodimer in the crystal structure which features a protomer with an n terminal   residue catalytic domain of    hydrolase fold and a c terminal  residue all  transthyretin like domain overall dmcpd bs conforms to the structure of n e type funnelins m b metallopeptidases but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity  i two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes thus providing control through localization and ii a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent n e type funnelins found in higher vertebrates dmcpd bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian cps
