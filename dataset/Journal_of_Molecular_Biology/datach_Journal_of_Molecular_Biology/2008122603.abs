repetitive architecture of the haemophilus influenzae hia trimeric autotransporter
the hia autotransporter of haemophilus influenzae belongs to the trimeric autotransporter subfamily and mediates bacterial adherence to the respiratory epithelium in this report we show that the structure of hia is characterized by a modular architecture containing repeats of structurally distinct domains comparison of the structures of hiabd and hiabd adhesive repeats and a nonadhesive repeat a novel fold shed light on the structural determinants of hia adhesive function examination of the structure of an extended version of the hia translocator domain revealed the structural transition between the c terminal translocator domain and the n terminal passenger domain highlighting a highly intertwined domain that is ubiquitous among trimeric autotransporters overall this study provides important insights into the mechanism of hia adhesive activity and the overall structure of trimeric autotransporters
