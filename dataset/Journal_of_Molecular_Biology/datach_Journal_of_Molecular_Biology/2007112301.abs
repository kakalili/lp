crystal structure of glycoside hydrolase family    l rhamnosidase from bacillus sp gl
l rhamnosidase ec      catalyzes the hydrolytic release of rhamnose from polysaccharides and glycosides bacillus sp gl   l rhamnosidase rhab  a member of glycoside hydrolase gh family   is responsible for degrading the bacterial biofilm gellan and also functions as a debittering agent for citrus fruit in the food and beverage industries through the release of rhamnose from plant glycoside naringin the x ray crystal structure of rhab was determined by single wavelength anomalous diffraction using a selenomethionine derivative and refined at     resolution with a final r factor of    as is seen in the homodimeric form of the active enzyme the structure of rhab in crystal packing is a homodimer containing   amino acids residues       glycerol molecules four calcium ions and   water molecules the overall structure consists of five domains four of which are  sandwich structures designated as domains n d  d  and c and an     barrel structure designated as domain a structural comparison by dali showed that rhab shares its highest level of structural similarity with chitobiose phosphorylase z score of    the structure of rhab in complex with the reaction product rhamnose inhibitor constant ki   mm was also determined and refined at     with a final r factor of    rhamnose is bound to the deep cleft of the     barrel domain as is seen in the clan l ghs several negatively charged residues such as asp   glu   asp   and glu   conserved in gh family  enzymes interact with rhamnose and rhab mutants of these residues have drastically reduced enzyme activity indicating that the residues are crucial for enzyme catalysis and or substrate binding to our knowledge this is the first report on the determination of the crystal structure of  l rhamnosidase and identification of its clan l     barrel as a catalytic domain
