computational design and experimental testing of the fastest folding  sheet protein
one of the most important and elusive goals of molecular biology is the formulation of a detailed atomic level understanding of the process of protein folding fast folding proteins with low free energy barriers have proved to be particularly productive objects of investigation in this context but the design of fast folding proteins was previously driven largely by experiment dramatic advances in the attainable length of molecular dynamics simulations have allowed us to characterize in atomic level detail the folding mechanism of the fast folding all  ww domain fip  in the work reported here we applied the biophysical insights gained from these studies to computationally design an even faster folding variant of fip  containing only naturally occurring amino acids the increased stability and high folding rate predicted by our simulations were subsequently validated by temperature jump experiments the experimentally measured folding time was    s at    c  about three times faster than the fastest previously known protein with  sheet content and in good agreement with our prediction these results provide a compelling demonstration of the potential utility of very long molecular dynamics simulations in redesigning proteins well beyond their evolved stability and folding speed
