molecular determinants for atp binding in proteins a data mining and quantum chemical analysis
adenosine   triphosphate atp plays an essential role in all forms of life molecular recognition of atp in proteins is a subject of great importance for understanding enzymatic mechanism and for drug design we have carried out a large scale data mining of the protein data bank pdb to analyze molecular determinants for recognition of the adenine moiety of atp by proteins non bonded intermolecular interactions hydrogen bonding     stacking interactions and cation   interactions between adenine base and surrounding residues in its binding pockets are systematically analyzed for  non redundant high resolution crystal structures of adenylate binding proteins in addition to confirming the importance of the widely known hydrogen bonding we found out that cation   interactions between adenine base and positively charged residues lys and arg and     stacking interactions between adenine base and surrounding aromatic residues phe tyr trp are also crucial for adenine binding in proteins on average there exist   hydrogen bonding interactions       stacking interactions and   cation   interactions in each adenylate binding protein complex furthermore a high level quantum chemical analysis was performed to analyze contributions of each of the three forms of intermolecular interactions i e hydrogen bonding     stacking interactions and cation   interactions to the overall binding force of the adenine moiety of atp in proteins intermolecular interaction energies for representative configurations of intermolecular complexes were analyzed using the supermolecular approach at the mp    g  level which resulted in substantial interaction strengths for all the three forms of intermolecular interactions this work represents a timely undertaking at a historical moment when a large number of x ray crystallographic structures of proteins with bound atp ligands have become available and when high level quantum chemical analysis of intermolecular interactions of large biomolecular systems becomes computationally feasible the establishment of the molecular basis for recognition of the adenine moiety of atp in proteins will directly impact molecular design of atp binding site targeted enzyme inhibitors such as kinase inhibitors
