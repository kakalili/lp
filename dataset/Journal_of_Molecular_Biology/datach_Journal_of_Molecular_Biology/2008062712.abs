coils in the membrane core are conserved and functionally important
with the increasing number of available  helical transmembrane tm protein structures the traditional picture of membrane proteins has been challenged for example reentrant regions which enter and exit the membrane at the same side and interface helices which lie parallel with the membrane in the membrane  water interface are common furthermore tm helices are frequently kinked and their length and tilt angle vary here we systematically analyze  of all residues within the deep membrane core that are in coil state these coils can be found in tm helix kinks as major breaks in tm helices and as parts of reentrant regions coil residues are significantly more conserved than other residues due to the polar character of the coil backbone they are either buried or located near aqueous channels coil residues are frequently found within channels and transporters where they introduce the flexibility and polarity required for transport across the membrane therefore we believe that coil residues in the membrane core while constituting a structural anomaly are essential for the function of proteins
