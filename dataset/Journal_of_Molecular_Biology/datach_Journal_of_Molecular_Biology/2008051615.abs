protein  protein interaction regulates proteins  mechanical stability
elastomeric proteins are molecular springs found not only in a variety of biological machines and tissues but also in biomaterials of superb mechanical properties regulating the mechanical stability of elastomeric proteins is not only important for a range of biological processes but also critical for the use of engineered elastomeric proteins as building blocks to construct nanomechanical devices and novel materials of well defined mechanical properties here we demonstrate that protein  protein interactions can potentially serve as an effective means to regulate the mechanical properties of elastomeric proteins we show that the binding of fragments of igg antibody to a small protein gb  can significantly enhance the mechanical stability of gb  the regulation of the mechanical stability of gb by igg fragments is not through direct modification of the interactions in the mechanically key region of gb  instead it is accomplished via the long range coupling between the igg binding site and the mechanically key region of gb  although fc and fab bind gb at different regions of gb  their binding to gb can increase the mechanical stability of gb significantly using alanine point mutants of gb  we show that the amplitude of mechanical stability enhancement of gb by fc does not correlate with the binding affinity suggesting that binding affinity only affects the population of gb human fc hfc complex at a given concentration of hfc but does not affect the intrinsic mechanical stability of the gb hfc complex furthermore our results indicate that the mechanical stability enhancement by igg fragments is robust and can tolerate sequence structural perturbation to gb  our results demonstrate that the protein  protein interaction is an efficient approach to regulate the mechanical stability of gb like proteins and we anticipate that this new methodology will help to develop novel elastomeric proteins with tunable mechanical stability and compliance
