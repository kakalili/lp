ph induced structural changes regulate histidine decarboxylase activity in lactobacillus  a edited by r huber
histidine decarboxylase hdc from lactobacillus  a produces histamine that is essential to counter waste acids and to optimize cell growth the hdc trimer is active at low ph and inactive at neutral to alkaline ph we have solved the x ray structure of hdc at ph  and revealed the novel mechanism of ph regulation at high ph helix b is unwound destroying the substrate binding pocket at acid ph the helix is stabilized partly through protonation of asp  and asp  on either side of the molecular interface acting as a proton trap in contrast to hemoglobin regulation ph has a large effect on the tertiary structure of hdc monomers and relatively little or no effect on quaternary structure
