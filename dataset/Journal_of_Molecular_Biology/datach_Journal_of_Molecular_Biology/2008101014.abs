molecular characterization of a dual inhibitory and mutagenic activity of  fluorouridine triphosphate on viral rna synthesis implications for lethal mutagenesis
the basis for a dual inhibitory and mutagenic activity of  fluorouracil  fu on foot and mouth disease virus fmdv rna replication has been investigated with purified viral rna dependent rna polymerase  d in vitro  fluorouridine triphosphate acted as a potent competitive inhibitor of vpg uridylylation the initial step of viral replication peptide analysis by mass spectrometry has identified a vpg fragment containing  fluorouridine monophosphate fump covalently attached to tyr  the amino acid target of the uridylylation reaction during rna elongation fump was incorporated in the place of ump or cmp by fmdv d using homopolymeric and heteropolymeric templates incorporation of fump did not prevent chain elongation and in some sequence contexts it favored misincorporations at downstream positions when present in the template fump directed the incorporation of amp and gmp with atp being a more effective substrate than gtp the misincorporation of gmp was  fold faster opposite fu than opposite u in the template these results in vitro are consistent with the mutational bias observed in the mutant spectra of  fu treated fmdv populations the dual mutagenic and inhibitory activity of  fluorouridine triphosphate may contribute to the effective extinction of fmdv by  fu through virus entry into error catastrophe
