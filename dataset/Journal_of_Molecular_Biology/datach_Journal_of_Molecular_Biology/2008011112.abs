crosstalk between the protein surface and hydrophobic core in a core swapped fibronectin type iii domain
two homologous fibronectin type iii fniii domains fnfn  the  th fniii domain of human fibronectin and tnfn  the third fniii domain of human tenascin  have essentially the same backbone structure although they share only    sequence identity while they share a similar folding mechanism with a common core of key residues in the folding transition state they differ in many other physical properties we use a chimeric protein fnotnc to investigate the molecular basis for these differences fnotnc is a core swapped protein containing the  outside   surface and loops of fnfn  and the hydrophobic core of tnfn  remarkably fnotnc retains the structure of the parent proteins despite the extent of redesign allowing us to gain insight into which components of each parent protein are responsible for different aspects of its behaviour naively one would expect properties that appear to depend principally on the core to be similar to tnfn  for example the response to mutations folding kinetics and side chain dynamics while properties apparently determined by differences in the surface and loops such as backbone dynamics would be more like fnfn  while this is broadly true it is clear that there are also unexpected crosstalk effects between the core and the surface for example the anomalous response of fnfn  to mutation is not solely a property of the core as we had previously suggested
