cleavage mediated by the catalytic domain of bacterial rnase p rna
like other rna molecules rnase p rna rpr is composed of domains and these have different functions here we provide data demonstrating that the catalytic c domain of escherichia coli eco rpr when separated from the specificity s domain mediates cleavage using various model rna hairpin loop substrates compared to full length eco rpr the rate constant kobs of cleavage for the truncated rpr cp rpr was reduced   to    fold depending on substrate specifically the structural architecture of the     played a significant role where a c   g  pair had the most dramatic effect on kobs substitution of a   e coli numbering  positioned near the cleavage site in the rnase p  substrate complex with g in the cp rpr resulted in  fold improvement in rate in contrast strengthening the interaction between the rpr and the   end of the substrate only had a modest effect interestingly although deleting the s domain gave a reduction in the rate it resulted in a less erroneous rpr with respect to cleavage site selection these data support and extend our understanding of the coupling between the distal interaction between the s domain and events at the active site our findings will also be discussed with respect to the structure of rpr derived from different organisms
