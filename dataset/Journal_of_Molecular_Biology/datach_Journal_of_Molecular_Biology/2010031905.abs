crystal structure of escherichia coli enterobactin specific isochorismate synthase entc bound to its reaction product isochorismate implications for the enzyme mechanism and differential activity of chorismate utilizing enzymes
entc one of two isochorismate synthases in escherichia coli is specific to the biosynthesis of the siderophore enterobactin here we report the crystal structure of entc in complex with isochorismate and mg at     resolution the first structure of a chorismate utilizing enzyme with a non aromatic reaction product entc exhibits a complex    fold like the other chorismate utilizing enzymes such as salicylate synthase and anthranilate synthase comparison of active site structures allowed the identification of several residues not discussed previously that might be important for the isochorismate activity of the entc although entc menf and irp all convert chorismate to isochorismate only irp subsequently exhibits isochorismate pyruvate lyase activity resulting in the formation of salicylate and pyruvate as the reaction products with a view to understanding the roles of these amino acid residues in the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate and to obtaining clues about the pyruvate lyase activity of irp  several mutants of entc were generated in which the selected residues in entc were substituted for those of irp  these included a  t l  a f  y i  l and f  q mutations biochemical analysis of these mutants indicated that the side chain of a  in entc may be crucial in the orientation of the carbonyl to allow formation of a hydrogen bond with isochorismate some mutations such as l  a and f  q give rise to a loss of catalytic activity whereas others such as f  y and i  l show that subtle changes in the otherwise closely similar active sites influence activity we did not find a combination of these residues that conferred pyruvate lyase activity
