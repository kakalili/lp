dissection of the energetic coupling across the src sh domain tyrosyl phosphopeptide interface edited by p e wright
src homology sh  domains play critical roles in signaling pathways by binding to phosphotyrosine ptyr containing sequences thereby recruiting sh domain containing proteins to tyrosine phosphorylated sites on receptor molecules investigations of the peptide binding specificity of the sh domain of the src kinase src sh domain have defined the eei motif c terminal to the phosphotyrosine as the preferential binding sequence a subsequent study that probed the importance of eight specificity determining residues of the src sh domain found two residues which when mutated to ala had significant effects on binding tyr d and lys d  the mutation of lys d to ala was particularly intriguing since a glu to ala mutation at the first   position of the eei motif the residue interacting with lys d  did not significantly affect binding hence the interaction between lys d and  glu is energetically coupled this study is focused on the dissection of the energetic coupling observed across the sh domain phosphopeptide interface at and around the  position of the peptide it was found that three residues of the sh domain lys d  asp c and aspcd  altogether forming the so called  binding region contribute to the selection of glu at the  position of the ligand a double asp c ala aspcd ala mutant does not exhibit energetic coupling between lys d and  glu and binds to the pyeei sequence   kcal mol tighter than the wild type src sh domain these results suggest that lys d in the double mutant is now free to interact with the  glu and that the role of lys d in the wild type is to neutralize the acidic patch formed by asp c and aspcd rather than specifically select for a glu at the  position as it had been hypothesized previously a triple mutant lys d ala asp c ala aspcd ala has reduced binding affinity compared to the double asp c ala aspcd ala mutant yet binds the pyeei peptide as well as the wild type src sh domain the structural basis for such high affinity interaction was investigated crystallographically by determining the structure of the triple lys d ala asp c ala aspcd ala mutant bound to the octapeptide pqpyeeipi where py indicates a phosphotyrosine  this structure reveals for the first time contacts between the sh domain and the   and   positions of the peptide i e the two residues n terminal to py  thus unexpectedly mutations in the  binding region affect binding of other regions of the peptide such additional contacts may account for the high affinity interaction of the triple mutant for the pyeei containing peptide
