the characterization of saccharomyces cerevisiae mre  rad  xrs complex reveals that rad  negatively regulates mre  endonucleolytic but not the exonucleolytic activity
the evolutionarily conserved heterotrimeric mre  rad  xrs  nbs  mrx n complex plays a central role in an array of cellular responses involving dna damage telomere length homeostasis cell cycle checkpoint control and meiotic recombination the underlying biochemical functions of mrx n complex or each of its individual subunits at telomeres and the importance of complex formation are poorly understood here we show that the saccharomyces cerevisiae mrx complex or its subunits display an overwhelming preference for g quadruplex dna than for telomeric single stranded or double stranded dna implicating the possible existence of this dna structure in vivo although these alternative dna substrates failed to affect rad  atpase activity kinetic analyses revealed that interaction of rad  with xrs and or mre  led to a twofold increase in the rates of atp hydrolysis significantly we show that mre  displays sequence specific double stranded dna endonuclease activity and rad  but not xrs  abrogated endonucleolytic but not the exonucleolytic activity this repression was alleviated upon atp hydrolysis by rad  suggesting that complex formation between rad  and mre  might be important for blocking the inappropriate cleavage of genomic dna mre  alone or in the presence of atp mrx mr or mx sub complexes cleaved at the   end of an array of g residues in single stranded dna at g quartets in g dna and at the center of tgtg repeats in duplex dna we propose that negative regulation of mre  endonuclease activity by rad  might be important for native as well as de novo telomere length homeostasis
