correct folding of the  barrel of the human membrane protein vdac requires a lipid bilayer
spontaneous membrane insertion and folding of  barrel membrane proteins from an unfolded state into lipid bilayers has been shown previously only for few outer membrane proteins of gram negative bacteria here we investigated membrane insertion and folding of a human membrane protein the isoform  of the voltage dependent anion selective channel hvdac  of mitochondrial outer membranes two classes of transmembrane proteins with either  helical or  barrel membrane domains are known from the solved high resolution structures vdac forms a transmembrane  barrel with an additional n terminal  helix we demonstrate that similar to bacterial ompa urea unfolded hvdac spontaneously inserts and folds into lipid bilayers upon denaturant dilution in the absence of folding assistants or energy sources like atp recordings of the voltage dependence of the single channel conductance confirmed folding of hvdac to its active form hvdac developed first  sheet secondary structure in aqueous solution while the  helical structure was formed in the presence of lipid or detergent in stark contrast to bacterial  barrel membrane proteins hvdac formed different structures in detergent micelles and phospholipid bilayers with higher content of  sheet and lower content of  helix when inserted and folded into lipid bilayers experiments with mixtures of lipid and detergent indicated that the content of  sheet secondary structure in hvdac decreased at increased detergent content unlike bacterial  barrel membrane proteins hvdac was not stable even in mild detergents such as ldao or dodecylmaltoside spontaneous folding of outer membrane proteins into lipid bilayers indicates that in cells the main purpose of membrane inserted or associated assembly factors may be to select and target  barrel membrane proteins towards the outer membrane instead of actively assembling them under consumption of energy as described for the translocons of cytoplasmic membranes
