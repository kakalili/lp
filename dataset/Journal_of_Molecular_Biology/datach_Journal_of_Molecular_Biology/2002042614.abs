identification of four gyra residues involved in the dna breakage  reunion reaction of dna gyrase
dna supercoiling by dna gyrase involves the cleavage of a dna helix the passage of another helix through the break and the religation of the first helix the cleavage  religation reaction involves the formation of a   phosphotyrosine intermediate with the gyra subunit of the gyrase a b  complex we report the characterization of mutations near the active site tyrosine residue in gyra predicted to affect the cleavage  religation reaction of gyrase we find that mutations at arg  arg  his  and his  inhibit dna supercoiling and other reactions of gyrase these effects are caused by the involvement of these residues in the dna cleavage reaction religation is largely unaffected by these mutations we show that these residues cooperate with the active site tyrosine residue on the opposite subunit of the gyra dimer during the cleavage  religation reaction
