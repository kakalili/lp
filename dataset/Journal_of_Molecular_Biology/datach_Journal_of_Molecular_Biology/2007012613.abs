structure based analysis of hu  dna binding
hu and ihf are prokaryotic proteins that induce very large bends in dna they are present in high concentrations in the bacterial nucleoid and aid in chromosomal compaction they also function as regulatory cofactors in many processes such as site specific recombination and the initiation of replication and transcription hu and ihf have become paradigms for understanding dna bending and indirect readout of sequence while ihf shows significant sequence specificity hu binds preferentially to certain damaged or distorted dnas however none of the structurally diverse hu substrates previously studied in vitro is identical with the distorted substrates in the recently published anabaena hu ahu  dna cocrystal structures here we report binding affinities for ahu and the dna in the cocrystal structures the binding free energies for formation of these ahu  dna complexes range from        kcal mol representing kd values in the nanomolar to low picomolar range and a maximum stabilization of at least     kcal mol relative to complexes with undistorted non specific dna we investigated ihf binding and found that appropriate structural distortions can greatly enhance its affinity on the basis of the coupling of structural and relevant binding data we estimate the amount of conformational strain in an ihf mediated dna kink that is relieved by a nick at least    kcal mol and pinpoint the location of the strain we show that ahu has a sequence preference for an a t rich region in the center of its dna binding site correlating with an unusually narrow minor groove this is similar to sequence preferences shown by the eukaryotic nucleosome
