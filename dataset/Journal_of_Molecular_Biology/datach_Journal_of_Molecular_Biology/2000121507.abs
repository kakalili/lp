structure activity relationships in a peptidic   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
conotoxins are small disulfide constrained peptide toxins which act as antagonists at specific subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nach receptors  in this study we analyzed the structures and activities of three mutants of  conotoxin imi a  amino acid peptide active at   nach receptors in order to gain insight into the primary and tertiary structural requirements of neuronal  conotoxin specificity nmr solution structures were determined for mutants r e r l and d n resulting in representative ensembles of  conformers with average pairwise rmsd values of       and    from their mean structures respectively for the backbone atoms n c  and c  of residues    the r e mutant was found to have activity near that of wild type imi while r l and d n demonstrated activities reduced by at least two orders of magnitude comparison of the structures reveals a common two loop architecture with variations observed in backbone and side chain dihedral angles as well as surface electrostatic potentials upon mutation correlation of these structures and activities with those from previously published studies emphasizes that existing hypotheses regarding the molecular determinants of  conotoxin specificity are not adequate for explaining peptide activity and suggests that more subtle features visualized here at the atomic level are important for receptor binding these data in conjunction with reported characterizations of the acetylcholine binding site support a model of toxin activity in which a single solvent accessible toxin side chain anchors the complex with supporting weak interactions determining both the efficacy and the subtype specificity of the inhibitory activity
