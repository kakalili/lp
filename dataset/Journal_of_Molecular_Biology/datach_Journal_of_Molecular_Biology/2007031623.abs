structural analysis of cassiicolin a host selective protein toxin from corynespora cassiicola
cassiicolin is a host selective toxin hst produced by the fungus corynespora cassiicola strain ccp  it is responsible for the corynespora leaf fall clf disease which is among the main pathologies affecting rubber tree hevea brasiliensis  working on purified cassiicolin and using electron microscopy we have demonstrated that this  residue o glycosylated protein is able to induce cellular damages identical to those induced by the fungus on rubber tree leaves and displays the same host selectivity the solution structure and disulfide pairing of cassiicolin have been determined using nmr spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations cassiicolin appears to have an original structure with a prolate ellipsoid shape it adopts an over all fold consisting of three strands arranged in a right handed twisted antiparallel  sheet knitted by three disulfide bonds its conformation resembles that found in small trypsine like inhibitors isolated from the brain the fat body and the hemolymph of locust grasshoppers but cassiicolin has no sequence homology with these protease inhibitors and lacks their characteristic substrate binding loop probably this motif represents one of the few highly stabilized  minimal  scaffolds with a high sequence permissiveness that nature has selected to evolve over different phyla and to support different functions the knowledge of the d structure opens the way to the delineation of the mechanism of action of the toxin using site directed mutagenesis
