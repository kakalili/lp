sugar binding in lactose permease anomeric state of a disaccharide influences binding structure
lactose permease in escherichia coli lacy transports both anomeric states of disaccharides but has greater affinity for  sugars molecular dynamics md simulations are used to probe the protein  sugar interactions binding structures and global protein motions in response to sugar binding by investigating lacy the experimental mutant and wild type embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer a total of  md simulations of     ns each with    d galactopyranosyl     d galactopyranoside    galp  and    galp  result in binding conformational families that depend on the anomeric state of the sugar both sugars strongly interact with glu  and    galp  has a greater affinity to this residue binding conformations are also seen that involve protein residues not observed in the crystal structure as well as those involved in the proton translocation phe   asn   asn   his   glu   and tyr   common to nearly all protein  sugar structures water acts as a hydrogen bond bridge between the disaccharide and protein the average binding energy is more attractive for    galp  than    galp  i e         and        kcal mol respectively of the  helices in lacy helix iv is the least stable with    galp  binding resulting in larger distortion than    galp
