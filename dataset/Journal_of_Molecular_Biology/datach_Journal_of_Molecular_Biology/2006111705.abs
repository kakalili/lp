identification of escherichia coli m g methyltransferases ii the ygjo gene encodes a methyltransferase specific for g   of the   s rrna
escherichia coli ribosomal rna contains five guanosine residues methylated at n  the ygjo gene was previously predicted to methylate   s rrna residue g  due to its high sequence homology with the protein rsmc responsible for g   methylation we have identified the target of ygjo as being m g   of the   s rrna and not m g  of the   s rrna as expected knock out of the ygjo gene leads to loss of modification at g   as revealed by reverse transcription moreover the modification could be restored by in vivo complementation of the ygjo knock out strain with a plasmid expressing ygjo recombinant ygjo protein is able to methylate in vitro protein free   s rrna but not assembled   s subunits purified from the ygjo knock out strain the nucleotide m g   is located in a functionally extremely important region of the ribosome being located within intersubunit bridges of group b  growth competition assays reveal that the lack of the g   methylation causes growth retardation especially at temperatures higher than optimal and in poor media based on these results we suggest that ygjo be renamed to rlmg in accordance with the accepted nomenclature for rrna methyltransferases
