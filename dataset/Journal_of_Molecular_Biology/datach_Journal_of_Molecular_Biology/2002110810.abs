a new zinc  protein coordination site in intracellular metal trafficking solution structure of the apo and zn ii forms of znta
zinc a metal ion that functions in a wide variety of catalytic and structural sites in metalloproteins is shown here to adopt a novel coordination environment in the escherichia coli transport protein znta the znta protein is a p type atpase that pumps zinc out of the cytoplasm and into the periplasm it is physiologically selective for zn ii and functions with metalloregulatory proteins in the cell to keep the zinc quota within strict limits yet the n terminal cytoplasmic domain contains a region that is highly homologous to the yeast cu i metallochaperone atx  to investigate how the structure of this region may influence its function this fragment containing residues      has been cloned out of the gene and overexpressed we report here the solution structure of this fragment as determined by nmr both the apo and zn ii znta      structures have been determined it contains a previously unknown protein coordination site for zinc that includes two cysteine residues cys  and cys  and a carboxylate residue asp  the solvent accessibility of this site is also remarkably high a feature that increasingly appears to be a characteristic of domains of heavy metal ion transport proteins the participation of asp  in this znta metal ion binding site may play an important role in modulating the relative affinities and metal exchange rates for zn ii pb ii cd ii as compared with other p type atpases which are selective for cu i or ag i
