hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometric analysis of conformational changes accompanying the assembly of the yeast prion ure p into protein fibrils
the ure protein from baker s yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae has prion properties in vitro at neutral ph soluble ure p forms long twisted fibrils two models have been proposed to account for ure p polymerization the first postulates that a segment of  amino acid residues in the flexible n terminal domain from different ure p molecules forms a parallel superpleated  structure running along the fibrils the second hypothesizes that assembly of full length ure p is driven by limited conformational rearrangements and non native inter and intramolecular interactions the knowledge of the three dimensional structure of the fibrillar form of ure p is critical for understanding the molecular events leading to the polymerization of soluble ure p into fibrils and hence for the design of inhibitors that might have therapeutic potential as yeast prions possessing domains rich in n and q residues similar to huntingtin solvent accessibility studies using hydrogen deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry hxms can provide insights into the structure of the fibrillar form of ure p and characterize at the molecular level the conformational rearrangements that occur upon assembly in particular through the identification of protected regions and their localization in the overall structure of the protein we have analyzed the changes in ure p structure associated with its assembly into fibrils using hxms the deuterium incorporation profile along the sequence allows the identification of the regions that exhibit the most important conformational change our data reveal that ure p undergoes minor structural changes upon assembly while polypeptides     and     exhibit significant increased and decreased exposure to the solvent respectively no marked change was observed for the rest of the protein upon assembly our results afford new insights into the conformational rearrangements that lead to the assembly of ure p into fibrils and the propagation of the ure  element in yeast
