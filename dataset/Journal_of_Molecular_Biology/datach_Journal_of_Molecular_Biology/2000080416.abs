crystal structure of the amino terminal coiled coil domain of the apc tumor suppressor edited by i a wilson
coiled coils serve as dimerization domains for a wide variety of proteins including the medically important oligomeric tumor suppressor protein apc mutations in the apc gene are associated with an inherited susceptibility to colon cancer and with     of sporadic colorectal tumors to define the basis for apc pairing and to explore the anatomy of dimeric coiled coils we determined the    resolution x ray crystal structure of the n terminal dimerization domain of apc the peptide apc   encompassing the heptad repeats in apc residues     primarily forms an  helical coiled coil dimer with newly observed core packing features correlated asymmetric packing of four core residues in distinct standard rotamers is associated with a small shift in the helix register at the c terminus the helices splay apart and interact with a symmetry related dimer in the crystal to form a short anti parallel four helix bundle n terminal fraying and c terminal splaying of the helices as well as the asymmetry and helix register shift describe unprecedented dynamic excursions of coiled coils the low stability of apc  and divergence from the expected coiled coil fold support the suggestion that the apc dimerization domain may extend beyond the first  residues
