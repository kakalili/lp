the crystal structure of the penicillin binding protein x from streptococcus pneumoniae and its acyl enzyme form implication in drug resistance edited by r huber
penicillin binding proteins pbps  the primary targets for  lactam antibiotics are periplasmic membrane attached proteins responsible for the construction and maintenance of the bacterial cell wall bacteria have developed several mechanisms of resistance one of which is the mutation of the target enzymes to reduce their affinity for  lactam antibiotics here we describe the structure of pbp x from streptococcus pneumoniae determined to     in addition we also describe the pbp x structure in complex with cefuroxime a therapeutically relevant antibiotic at     surprisingly two antibiotic molecules are observed one as a covalent complex with the active site serine residue and a second one between the c terminal and the transpeptidase domains the structure of pbp x reveals an active site similar to those of the class a  lactamases albeit with an absence of unambiguous deacylation machinery the structure highlights a few amino acid residues namely thr   thr  and gln   which are directly related to the resistance phenomenon
