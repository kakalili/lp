solution structure of the n terminal domain of a potential copper translocating p type atpase from bacillus subtilis in the apo and cu i loaded states edited by m f summers
a putative partner of the already characterized copz from bacillus subtilis was found both proteins being encoded by genes located in the same operon this new protein is highly homologous to eukaryotic and prokaryotic p type atpases such as copa ccc and menkes proteins the n terminal region of this protein contains two soluble domains constituted by amino acid residues  to  and  to   respectively which were expressed both separately and together in both cases only the     domain is folded and is stable both in the copper i free and in the copper i bound forms the folded and unfolded state is monitored through the chemical shift dispersion of  n hsqc spectra in the absence of any structural characterization of copa type proteins we determined the structure of the     domain in the     construct in the apo state through h  n and  c nmr spectroscopies the structure of the cu i loaded     domain has been also determined in the construct      about   meaningful noes and  dihedral angles were used to obtain structures at high resolution both for the cu i bound and the cu i free states backbone rmsd to the mean         and         respectively  the structural assessment shows that the structures are accurate the protein has the typical       folding with a cysteine in the c terminal part of helix   and the other cysteine in loop  the structures are similar to other proteins involved in copper homeostasis particularly between bscopa and bscopz only the charges located around loop  are reversed for bscopa and bscopz thus suggesting that the two proteins could interact one with the other the variability in conformation displayed by the n terminal cysteine of the cxxc motif in a number of structures of copper transporting proteins suggests that this may be the cysteine which binds first to the copper i carried by the partner protein
