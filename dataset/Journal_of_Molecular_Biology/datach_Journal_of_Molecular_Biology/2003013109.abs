self association equilibria of escherichia coli uvrd helicase studied by analytical ultracentrifugation
the escherichia coli uvrd protein helicase ii is an sf superfamily helicase required for methyl directed mismatch repair and nucleotide excision repair of dna we have characterized quantitatively the self assembly equilibria of the uvrd protein as a function of nacl  glycerol  and temperature     c ph   using analytical sedimentation velocity and equilibrium techniques and find that uvrd self associates into dimeric and tetrameric species over a range of solution conditions t    c  increasing nacl from  mm to  mm decreases the dimerization equilibrium constant l  from        m   to         m   ph      v v glycerol   c  the overall tetramerization equilibrium constant l  is        m   at  mm nacl but decreases so that it is not measurable at  mm nacl at  mm nacl only uvrd monomers are detectable increasing glycerol over the range from   to   v v decreases both l  and l  we find no evidence for hexamer formation although a species consistent in size with an octamer is detected at   c inclusion of either adp or atp s does not affect either l  or l  significantly and does not induce the formation of additional assembly states we also investigated the stoichiometry of uvrd binding to a    dt   bp dna substrate by sedimentation equilibrium at saturating concentrations of uvrd three uvrd monomers can bind to the dna substrate although only two uvrd monomers are required to form a processive helicase complex when the total dna substrate concentration is about twofold greater than the total uvrd concentration the vast majority of the dna is bound by a single uvrd monomer
