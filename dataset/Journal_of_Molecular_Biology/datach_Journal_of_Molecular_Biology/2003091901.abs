repacking the core of t lysozyme by automated design
automated protein redesign as implemented in the program orbit was used to redesign the core of phage t lysozyme a total of  buried or partially buried sites in the c terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side chain conformation while the backbone and non selected side chains remained fixed a variant with seven substitutions   core    was identified as having the most favorable energy the redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues in this case the redesigned protein   core    had ten amino acid changes the two designed proteins as well as the constituent single mutants and several single site revertants were over expressed in escherichia coli purified and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses the thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild type protein the use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective several of the side chain rotamers in the predicted structure of core  differ from those observed rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process side chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule in contrast parts of the backbone change by up to    relative to both the designed structure and wild type water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process in the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were to some degree re occupied by side chain atoms in the observed structure however water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites this suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure the results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein while point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability likewise combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein experience with t lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone
