structural analysis of hmgd  dna complexes reveals influence of intercalation on sequence selectivity and dna bending
the ubiquitous eukaryotic high mobility group box hmgb chromosomal proteins promote many chromatin mediated cellular activities through their non sequence specific binding and bending of dna minor groove dna binding by the hmg box results in substantial dna bending toward the major groove owing to electrostatic interactions shape complementarity and dna intercalation that occurs at two sites here the structures of the complexes formed with dna by a partially dna intercalation deficient mutant of drosophila melanogaster hmgd have been determined by x ray crystallography at a resolution of      the six proteins and   bp of dna in the crystal structure revealed a variety of bound conformations all of the proteins bound in the minor groove bridging dna molecules presumably because these dna regions are easily deformed the loss of the primary site of dna intercalation decreased overall dna bending and shape complementarity however dna bending at the secondary site of intercalation was retained and most protein  dna contacts were preserved the mode of binding resembles the hmgb box a  cisplatin  dna complex which also lacks a primary intercalating residue this study provides new insights into the binding mechanisms used by hmg boxes to recognize varied dna structures and sequences as well as modulate dna structure and dna bending
