characterization of activating region  from escherichia coli fnr edited by r ebright
transcription activation of anaerobically induced genes in escherichia coli is mediated through the action of the global anaerobic regulator fnr although regions of fnr involved in fnr dependent transcription activation have been identified the side chains critical to the function of these regions are not known in this study alanine scanning of amino acid residues    of fnr activating region  fnr ar  was used to determine which amino acid side chains are required for transcription activation of class ii fnr dependent promoters in vivo  galactosidase assays and in vitro transcription activation assays showed that ala substitution of ile  gly  and asp  had the largest transcription activation defects while comparison of the activity of single and double mutants indicated that thr  glu  glu  and gln  may contribute in a minor way to fnr ar function site directed mutagenesis of positions  and  showed that the hydrophobicity of ile  and the negative charge of asp  were important to fnr ar  s function lastly substitution of residues of e coli fnr ar with those more basic residues found in a subset of fnr homologs such as rhodobacter sphaeroides fnrl resulted in a mutant strain that was unable to activate transcription from e coli class ii fnr dependent promoters in conclusion this study demonstrates a requirement for negatively charged and hydrophobic side chain residues in e coli fnr ar function although there is likely to be some variability in the characteristics of this region in other members of the fnr family
