on the relationship between protein stability and folding kinetics a comparative study of the n terminal domains of rnase hi e coli and bacillus stearothermophilus l
there is currently a great deal of interest in proteins that fold in a single highly cooperative step particular attention has been focused on elucidating the factors that govern folding rates of simple proteins recently the topology of the native state has been proposed to be the most important determinant of their folding rates here we report a comparative study of the folding of three topologically equivalent proteins that adapt a particularly simple    fold the folding kinetics of the n terminal domain of rnase hi and the n terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l from escherichia coli entl  were compared to the previously characterized n terminal domain of l from bacillus stearothermophilus bntl  this  kda protein which is one of simplest examples of the abc d motif folds via a two state mechanism on the millisecond to submillisecond time scale the rnase hi domain and bntl have very similar tertiary structures but there is little similarity in primary sequence bntl and entl share the same biological function and a similar primary sequence but differ significantly in stability fluorescence detected stopped flow experiments showed that the three proteins fold in a two state fashion the folding rates in the absence of denaturant were found to be very different ranging form  s   to  s   at   c the diverse folding rates appear to reflect large differences in the stability of the proteins when compared at an isostability point the folding rates converged to a similar value and there is a strong linear correlation between the log of the folding rate and stability for this set of proteins these observations are consistent with the idea that stability can play an important role in dictating relative folding rates among topologically equivalent proteins
