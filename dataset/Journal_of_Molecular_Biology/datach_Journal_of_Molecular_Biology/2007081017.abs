directional loading and stimulation of pcra helicase by the replication initiator protein repd
the replication initiator protein repd recruits the bacillus pcra helicase directly onto the    strand of the plasmid replication origin orid the   phosphate group at the nick is essential for loading suggesting that it is the repd covalently linked to the   phosphate group at the nick that loads the helicase onto the orid the products of the unwinding reaction were visualised by atomic force microscopy afm and monitored in real time by fluorescence spectroscopy repd remains associated with pcra and stimulates processive directional unwinding of the plasmid at    bp s   in the absence of repd pcra retains the ability to bind to a pre nicked orid but engages the   end of the nick and translocates      along the   strand in a poorly processive fashion our data provide a unique insight into the recruitment of pcra like helicases to dna nick sites and the processive translocation of the pcra motor as a component of the plasmid replication apparatus
