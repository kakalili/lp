molecular dynamics in the endgame of protein structure prediction edited by b honig
in order adequately to sample conformational space methods for protein structure prediction make necessary simplifications that also prevent them from being as accurate as desired thus the idea of feeding them hierarchically into a more accurate method that samples less effectively was introduced a decade ago but has not met with more than limited success in a few isolated instances ideally the final stages should be able to identify the native state show a good correlation with native similarity in order to add value to the selection process and refine the structures even further in this work we explore the possibility of using state of the art explicit solvent molecular dynamics and implicit solvent free energy calculations to accomplish all three of those objectives on  small single domain proteins four each of alpha beta and mixed topologies we find that this approach is very successful in ranking the native and also enhances the structure selection of predictions generated from the rosetta method
