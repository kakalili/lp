dynamics may significantly influence the estimation of interatomic distances in biomolecular x ray structures
atomic positions obtained by x ray crystallography are time and space averages over many molecules in the crystal importantly interatomic distances calculated between such average positions and frequently used in structural and mechanistic analyses can be substantially different from the more appropriate time average and ensemble average interatomic distances using crystallographic b factors one can deduce corrections which have so far been applied exclusively to small molecules to obtain correct average distances as a function of the type of atomic motion here using   high quality protein x ray structures we study the significance of such corrections for different types of atomic motion importantly we show that for distances shorter than    corrections greater than     may apply especially for noncorrelated or anticorrelated motion for example   of the studied structures have at least one pair of atoms with a correction of      in the case of noncorrelated motion using molecular dynamics simulations of villin headpiece ubiquitin and sh domain unit cells we demonstrate that the majority of average interatomic distances in these proteins agree with noncorrelated corrections suggesting that such deviations may be truly relevant importantly we demonstrate that the corrections do not significantly affect stereochemistry and the overall quality of final refined x ray structures but can provide marked improvements in starting unrefined models obtained from low resolution x ray data finally we illustrate the potential mechanistic and biological significance of the calculated corrections for kcsa ion channel and show that they provide indirect evidence that motions in its selectivity filter are highly correlated
