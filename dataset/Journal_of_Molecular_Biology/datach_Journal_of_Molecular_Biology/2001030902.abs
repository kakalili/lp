sp and sp physically interact and co operate with gabp for the activation of the utrophin promoter edited by m yaniv
the utrophin gene codes for a large cytoskeletal protein closely related to dystrophin which in the absence of dystrophin can functionally substitute it utrophin is transcribed by two independently regulated promoters about  kb apart the upstream promoter is tata less and contains a functional gabp binding site which in muscle restricts the promoter activity to post synaptic nuclei transient transfections analysis of mutant promoters in rhabdomyosarcoma cells showed that the upstream promoter contains three functional gc elements that are recognised by sp and sp factors in vitro co transfections of the promoter with sp  sp and gabp factors in drosophila sl schneider cells which lack of endogenous sp factors demonstrated that both sp and sp are positive regulators of the utrophin promoter and that they activate transcription synergistically with gabp consistent with this result we observed physical interaction of both sp factors with the gabp  subunit in vitro functional domain interaction analysis of sp and sp revealed that both factors interact with gabp  through their dna binding zinc finger domain the modulation and correct interaction between sp  sp and gabp in muscle cells may be critical for the regulation of the utrophin promoter and provide new targets for therapies of duchenne muscular dystrophy
