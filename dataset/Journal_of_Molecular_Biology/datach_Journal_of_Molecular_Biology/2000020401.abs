hydration of d cgc r aaa d tttgcg   edited by i tinoco
we have studied the hydration and dynamics of rna c   oh in a dna rna hybrid chimeric duplex d cgc r aaa d tttgcg   long lived water molecules with correlation time  c larger than   ns were found close to the rna adenine h and h   protons in the hybrid segment a possible long lived water molecule was also detected close to the methyl group of t in the rna dna junction but not to the other two thymine bases  t and t  this result correlates with the structural studies that only dna residue t in the rna dna junction adopts an o   endo sugar conformation intermediate between b form and a form  while the other dna residues including c in the dna rna junction adopt c   exo or c   endo conformations in the b form domain  based on the noe cross peak patterns we have found that rna c   oh tends to orient toward the o   direction forming a possible hydrogen bond with the   phosphate group the exchange rates for rna c   oh were found to be around    s   compared to       s   reported previously for the other dna rna hybrid duplex this slow exchange rate may be due to the narrow minor groove width of d cgc r aaa d tttgcg   which may trap the water molecules and restrict the dynamic motion of hydroxyl protons the distinct hydration patterns of the rna adenine h and h   protons and the dna t methyl group in the hybrid segment as well as the orientation and dynamics of the rna c   oh protons may provide a molecular basis for further understanding the structure and recognition of dna rna hybrid and chimeric duplexes
