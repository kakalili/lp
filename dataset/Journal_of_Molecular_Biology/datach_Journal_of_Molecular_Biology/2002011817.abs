why are proteins so robust to site mutations  edited by j thornton
there have been repeated observations that proteins are surprisingly robust to site mutations enduring significant numbers of substitutions with little change in structure stability or function these results are almost paradoxical in light of what is known about random heteropolymers and the sensitivity of their properties to seemingly trivial mutations to address this discrepancy the preservation of biological protein properties in the presence of mutation has been interpreted as indicating the independence of selective pressure on such properties such results also lead to the prediction that de novo protein design should be relatively easy in contrast to what is observed here we use a computational model with lattice proteins to demonstrate how this robustness can result from population dynamics during the evolutionary process as a result sequence plasticity may be a characteristic of evolutionarily derived proteins and not necessarily a property of designed proteins this suggests that this robustness must be re interpreted in evolutionary terms and has consequences for our understanding of both in vivo and in vitro protein evolution
