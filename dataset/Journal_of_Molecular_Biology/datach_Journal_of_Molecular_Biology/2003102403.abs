functional recycling of c domains throughout evolution a comparative study of synaptotagmin protein kinase c and phospholipase c by sequence structural and modelling approaches
the c domain is one of the most frequent and widely distributed calcium binding motifs its structure comprises an eight stranded  sandwich with two structural types as if the result of a circular permutation combining sequence structural and modelling information we have explored at different levels of granularity the functional characteristics of several families of c domains at the coarsest level the similarity correlates with key structural determinants of the c domain fold and at the finest level with the domain architecture of the proteins containing them highlighting the functional diversity between the various sub families the functional diversity appears as different conserved surface patches throughout this common fold in some cases these patches are related to substrate binding sites whereas in others they correspond to interfaces of presumably permanent interaction between other domains within the same polypeptide chain for those related to substrate binding sites the predictions overlap with biochemical data in addition to providing some novel observations for those acting as protein  protein interfaces our modelling analysis suggests that slight variations between families are a result of not only complementary adaptations in the interfaces involved but also different domain architecture in the light of the sequence and structural genomic projects the work presented here shows that modelling approaches along with careful sub typing of protein families will be a powerful combination for a broader coverage in proteomics
