the x ray structure of yeast  aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase complexed with substrate and three inhibitors edited by r huber
the structures of  aminolaevulinic acid dehydratase alad complexed with substrate  aminolaevulinic acid and three inhibitors laevulinic acid succinylacetone and  keto  aminolaevulinic acid have been solved at high resolution the ligands all bind by forming a covalent link with lys  at the active site the structures define the interactions made by one of the two substrate moieties that bind to the enzyme during catalysis all of the inhibitors induce a significant ordering of the flap covering the active site succinylacetone appears to be unique by inducing a number of conformational changes in loops covering the active site which may be important for understanding the co operative properties of alad enzymes succinylacetone is produced in large amounts by patients suffering from the hereditary disease type i tyrosinaemia and its potent inhibition of alad also has implications for the pathology of this disease the most intriguing result is that obtained with  keto  amino hexanoic acid which seems to form a stable carbinolamine intermediate with lys   it appears that we have defined the structure of an intermediate of schiff base formation that the substrate forms upon binding to the p site of the enzyme
