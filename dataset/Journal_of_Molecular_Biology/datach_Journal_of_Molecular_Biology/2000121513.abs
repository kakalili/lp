structure of the fha domain of yeast rad  and identification of binding sites for both fha and its target protein rad
forkhead associated fha domains have been shown to recognize both pthr and ptyr peptides the solution structures of the fha domain of rad  from saccharomyces cerevisiae and its complex with a ptyr peptide have been reported recently we now report the solution structure of the other fha domain of rad  fha  residues     and identification of binding sites of fha and its target protein rad  the fha structure consists of    strands which form two large twisted anti parallel  sheets folding into a  sandwich three short  helices were also identified the  strands are linked by several loops and turns these structural features of free fha are similar to those of free fha  but there are significant differences in the loops screening of a peptide library xxx pt xxx against fha revealed an absolute requirement for asp at the  position and a preference for ala at the  position these two criteria are met by a pthr motif  tead  in rad  surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that a pthr peptide containing this motif   slev pt eadatfvq  from rad  binds to fha with a kd value of    m other peptides containing ptxxd sequences also bound to fha  but less tightly kd    m  these results suggest that thr  of rad is the likely phosphorylation site recognized by the fha domain of rad  the tight binding peptide was then used to identify residues of fha involved in the interaction with the pthr peptide the results are compared with the interactions between the fha domain and a ptyr peptide derived from rad reported previously
