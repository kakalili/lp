packaging signals in two single stranded rna viruses imply a conserved assembly mechanism and geometry of the packaged genome
the current paradigm for assembly of single stranded rna viruses is based on a mechanism involving non sequence specific packaging of genomic rna driven by electrostatic interactions recent experiments however provide compelling evidence for sequence specificity in this process both in vitro and in vivo the existence of multiple rna packaging signals pss within viral genomes has been proposed which facilitates assembly by binding coat proteins in such a way that they promote the protein  protein contacts needed to build the capsid the binding energy from these interactions enables the confinement or compaction of the genomic rnas identifying the nature of such pss is crucial for a full understanding of assembly which is an as yet untapped potential drug target for this important class of pathogens here for two related bacterial viruses we determine the sequences and locations of their pss using hamiltonian paths a concept from graph theory in combination with bioinformatics and structural studies their pss have a common secondary structure motif but distinct consensus sequences and positions within the respective genomes despite these differences the distributions of pss in both viruses imply defined conformations for the packaged rna genomes in contact with the protein shell in the capsid consistent with a recent asymmetric structure determination of the ms virion the ps distributions identified moreover imply a preferred evolutionarily conserved assembly pathway with respect to the rna sequence with potentially profound implications for other single stranded rna viruses known to have rna pss including many animal and human pathogens
