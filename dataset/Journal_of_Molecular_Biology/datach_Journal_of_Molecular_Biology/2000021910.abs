crystal structures of toxoplasma gondii adenosine kinase reveal a novel catalytic mechanism and prodrug binding edited by i a wilson
adenosine kinase ak is a key purine metabolic enzyme from the opportunistic parasitic protozoan toxoplasma gondii and belongs to the family of carbohydrate kinases that includes ribokinase to understand the catalytic mechanism of ak we determined the structures of the t gondii apo ak ak adenosine complex and the ak adenosine amp pcp complex to         and     resolution respectively these structures reveal a novel catalytic mechanism that involves an adenosine induced domain rotation of    and a newly described anion hole dtxgagd  requiring a helix to coil conformational change that is induced by atp binding nucleotide binding also evokes a coil to helix transition that completes the formation of the atp binding pocket a conserved dipeptide gly  gly  which is located at the bottom of the adenosine binding site functions as the switch for domain rotation the synergistic structural changes that occur upon substrate binding sequester the adenosine and the atp gi phosphate from solvent and optimally position the substrates for catalysis finally the     resolution structure of an ak  iodotubercidin amp pcp complex reveals the basis for the higher affinity binding of this prodrug over adenosine and thus provides a scaffold for the design of new inhibitors and subversive substrates that target the t gondii ak
