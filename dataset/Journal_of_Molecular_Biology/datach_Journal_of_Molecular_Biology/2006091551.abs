insights into protein  protein interfaces using a bayesian network prediction method
identifying the interface between two interacting proteins provides important clues to the function of a protein and is becoming increasing relevant to drug discovery here surface patch analysis was combined with a bayesian network to predict protein  protein binding sites with a success rate of   on a benchmark dataset of   proteins improving by  on previous work and well above the   that would be achieved by a random method a comparable success rate was achieved even when evolutionary information was missing a further improvement on our previous method which was unable to handle incomplete data automatically in a case study of the mog p family we showed that our bayesian network method can aid the prediction of previously uncharacterised binding sites and provide important clues to protein function on mog p itself a putative binding site involved in the sln skn signal transduction pathway was detected as was a ran binding site previously characterized solely by conservation studies even though our automated method operated without using homologous proteins on the remaining members of the family two structural genomics targets and a protein involved in the photosystem ii complex in higher plants we identified novel binding sites with little correspondence to those on mog p these results suggest that members of the mog p family bind to different proteins and probably have different functions despite sharing the same overall fold we also demonstrated the applicability of our method to drug discovery efforts by successfully locating a number of binding sites involved in the protein  protein interaction network of papilloma virus infection in a separate study we attempted to distinguish between the two types of binding site obligate and non obligate within our dataset using a second bayesian network this proved difficult although some separation was achieved on the basis of patch size electrostatic potential and conservation such was the similarity between the two interacting patch types we were able to use obligate binding site properties to predict the location of non obligate binding sites and vice versa
