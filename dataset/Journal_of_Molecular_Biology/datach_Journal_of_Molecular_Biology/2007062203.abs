the stability effects of protein mutations appear to be universally distributed
how the thermodynamic stability effects of protein mutations   g are distributed is a fundamental property related to the architecture tolerance to mutations mutational robustness  and evolutionary history of proteins the stability effects of mutations also dictate the rate and dynamics of protein evolution with deleterious mutations being the main inhibitory factor using the foldx algorithm that attempts to computationally predict   g effects of mutations we deduced the overall distributions of stability effects for all possible mutations in  different globular single domain proteins we found that these distributions are strikingly similar despite a range of sizes and folds and largely follow a bi gaussian function the surface residues exhibit a narrow distribution with a mildly destabilizing mean   g     kcal mol  whereas the core residues exhibit a wider distribution with a stronger destabilizing mean     kcal mol  since smaller proteins have a higher fraction of surface residues the relative weight of these single distributions correlates with size we also found that proteins evolved in the laboratory follow an essentially identical distribution whereas de novo designed folds show markedly less destabilizing distributions i e they seem more robust to the effects of mutations  this bi gaussian model provides an analytical description of the predicted distributions of mutational stability effects it comprises a novel tool for analyzing proteins and protein models for simulating the effect of mutations under evolutionary processes and a quantitative description of mutational robustness
