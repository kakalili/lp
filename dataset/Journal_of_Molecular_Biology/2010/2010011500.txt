Class II transactivator (CIITA) is the master regulator of the major histocompatibility class II transcription complex (MHC-II) and is critical for initiation of adaptive immune responses. We have previously demonstrated that the 19S proteasome ATPase Sug1 plays a significant role in regulating CIITA activity and MHC-II expression. We now show that an additional component of the 19S complex, the 19S ATPase S6a (S6′/Tat-binding protein 1), is crucial for regulating cytokine-inducible transcription of CIITA. Lack of S6a negatively impacts CIITA activity and CIITA expression. Decreased expression of S6a significantly diminishes the recruitment of transcription factors to the CIITA interferon-γ-inducible promoter [CIITA promoter IV (pIV)] and significantly decreases CIITApIV histone H3 and histone H4 acetylation, with a preferential loss of acetylation at H3 lysine 18 and H4 lysine 8. In addition, we provide evidence for the involvement of the 19S AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activity) ATPase hexamer as the 19S ATPase S6b binds CIITApIV in an S6a-dependent fashion and has effects similar to S6a on CIITApIV histone acetylation. These analyses demonstrate the importance of 19S ATPases in the assembly of CIITApIV transcription machinery and provide additional insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the 19S proteasome in mammalian transcription.
