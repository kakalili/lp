crucial steps in the structure determination of the na h antiporter nhaa in its native conformation
sodium proton antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins their importance for cell viability is the result of their role in homeostasis of intracellular ph cellular na content and cell volume recently the first structure of this family of secondary transporters namely of nhaa from escherichia coli revealed a novel fold and elucidated the molecular basis for the mechanism of transport and its regulation by ph here we describe the key steps for the structure determination of nhaa an iterative process of improving protein quality as well as crystallization conditions protein quality was optimized by shortening the purification to a single step and by changing the expression host the major steps for crystal improvement were the exchange of the detergent during protein purification from the   to the  anomer of ddm the addition of og to the crystallization set ups and the growth of the crystals under conditions suitable for cryo temperatures unexpectedly the dimeric association of the transporter in the d crystal lattice is non physiological a comparison of the x ray structure with the electron density map from cryo electron microscopy of d crystals demonstrates that the nhaa helix packing in the d crystal is identical with the one in the lipid environment thus the antiporter is in a native conformation in the d crystals
