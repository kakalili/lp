camp dependent protein kinase a selects the excited state of the membrane substrate phospholamban
phosphorylation of membrane proteins is a central regulatory and signaling mechanism across cell compartments however the recognition process and phosphorylation mechanism of membrane bound substrates by kinases are virtually unknown camp dependent protein kinase a pka is a ubiquitous enzyme that phosphorylates several soluble and membrane bound substrates in cardiomyocytes pka targets phospholamban pln  a membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  atpase serca  in the unphosphorylated state pln binds serca reducing the calcium uptake and generating muscle contraction pka phosphorylation of pln at s  in the cytoplasmic helix relieves serca inhibition initiating muscle relaxation using steady state kinetic assays nmr spectroscopy and molecular modeling we show that pka recognizes and phosphorylates the excited membrane detached r state of pln by promoting pln from a ground state to an excited state we obtained a linear relationship between rate of phosphorylation and population of the excited state of pln the conformational equilibrium of pln is crucial to regulate the extent of pln phosphorylation and serca inhibition
