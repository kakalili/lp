toward the molecular basis of inherited prion diseases nmr structure of the human prion protein with v  i mutation
the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses is associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein prpc into a misfolded pathogenic isoform prpsc  spontaneous generation of prpsc in inherited forms of disease is caused by mutations in gene coding for prp prnp  in this work we describe the nmr solution state structure of the truncated recombinant human prp huprp carrying the pathological v  i mutation linked to genetic creutzfeldt  jakob disease the three dimensional structure of v  i mutant consists of an unstructured n terminal part residues      and a well defined c terminal domain residues       the c terminal domain contains three  helices residues           and      and a short antiparallel  sheet residues      and       comparison with the structure of the wild type huprp revealed that although two structures share similar global architecture mutation introduces some local structural differences the observed variations are mostly clustered in the      inter helical interface and in the      loop region introduction of bulkier ile at position   induces reorientations of several residues that are part of hydrophobic core thus influencing      inter helical interactions another important structural feature involves the alteration of conformation of the      loop region and the subsequent exposure of hydrophobic cluster to solvent which facilitates intermolecular interactions involved in spontaneous generation of prpsc the nmr structure of v  i mutant offers new clues about the earliest events of the pathogenic conversion process that could be used for the development of antiprion drugs
