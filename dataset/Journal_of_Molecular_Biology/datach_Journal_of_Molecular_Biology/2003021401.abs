interaction of trigger factor with the ribosome
the trigger factor of escherichia coli is a prolyl isomerase and a chaperone it interacts with the ribosome and affects the folding of newly formed protein chains therefore the dynamics of the interactions of trigger factor with the ribosome and with unfolded protein chains should be tailored for this function previously we had found that binding of unfolded proteins to trigger factor is fast and that the lifetime of the complex between these two components is only about  ms here we have labeled the trigger factor in its amino terminal ribosome binding domain with a fluorescent dye and investigated how it interacts with the ribosome we found that this association as well as the dissociation of the complex are rather slow processes the average lifetime of the complex is about  seconds at   c  the strong differences in the dynamics of the interactions of trigger factor with the ribosome and with protein substrates might ensure that on the one hand trigger factor remains bound to the ribosome while a protein chain is being synthesized and on the other hand allows it to scan the newly formed protein for prolyl bonds that need catalysis of isomerization
