the on  off switch in regulated myosins different triggers but related mechanisms
in regulated myosin motor and enzymatic activities are toggled between the on state and off state by a switch located on its lever arm domain here called the regulatory domain rd  this region consists of a long  helical  heavy chain  stabilized by a  regulatory  light chain rlc and an  essential  light chain elc  the on state is activated by phosphorylation of the rlc of vertebrate smooth muscle rd or by direct binding of ca  to the elc of molluscan rd crystal structures are available only for the molluscan rd to understand in more detail the pathway between the on state and the off state we have now also determined the crystal structure of a molluscan scallop rd in the absence of ca  our results indicate that loss of ca  abolishes most of the interactions between the light chains and may increase the flexibility of the rd heavy chain we propose that disruption of critical links with the c lobe of the rlc is the key event initiating the off state in both smooth muscle myosins and molluscan myosins
