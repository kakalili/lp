structural insights into the mechanism and inhibition of the  hydroxydecanoyl acyl carrier protein dehydratase from pseudomonasaeruginosa
fatty acid biosynthesis is an essential component of metabolism in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway of gram negative bacteria is an established therapeutic target two homologous enzymes faba and fabz catalyze a key step in fatty acid biosynthesis both dehydrate hydroxyacyl fatty acids that are coupled via a phosphopantetheine to an acyl carrier protein acp  the resulting trans  enoyl acp is further polymerized in a processive manner faba however carries out a second reaction involving isomerization of trans  enoyl fatty acid to cis  enoyl fatty acid we have solved the structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa faba with a substrate allowing detailed molecular insight into the interactions of the active site this has allowed a detailed examination of the factors governing the second catalytic step we have also determined the structure of faba in complex with small molecules so called fragments  these small molecules occupy distinct regions of the active site and form the basis for a rational inhibitor design program
