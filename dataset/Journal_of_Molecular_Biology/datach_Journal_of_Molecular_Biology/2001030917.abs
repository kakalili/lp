x ray structure analysis and crystallographic refinement of lumazine synthase from the hyperthermophile aquifex aeolicus at    resolution determinants of thermostability revealed from structural comparisons edited by r huber
an open reading frame optimized for expression of   dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase of the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus in escherichia coli was synthesized and expressed in a recombinant e coli strain to a level of around    the recombinant protein was purified by heat treatment and gel filtration the protein was crystallized in the cubic space group i  with the cell dimensionsand diffraction data were collected to    resolution the structure was solved by molecular replacement using lumazine synthase from bacillus subtilis as search model the structure of the a aeolicus enzyme was refined to a resolution of     the spherical protein consists of  identical subunits with strict icosahedral   symmetry the subunit fold is closely related to that of the b subtilis enzyme rmsd      the extremely thermostable lumazine synthase from a aeolicus has a melting temperature of    c compared to other icosahedral and pentameric lumazine synthases the a aeolicus enzyme has the largest accessible surface presented by charged residues and the smallest surface presented by hydrophobic residues it also has the largest number of ion pairs per subunit two ion pair networks involving two respectively three stacking arginine residues assume a distinct role in linking adjacent subunits the findings indicate the influence of the optimization of hydrophobic and ionic contacts in gaining thermostability
