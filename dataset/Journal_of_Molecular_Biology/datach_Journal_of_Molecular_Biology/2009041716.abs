heat shock protein  is important for sp stability during mitosis
our previous study has revealed that heat shock protein hsp   can interact with sp to regulate the transcriptional activity of  s lipoxygenase herein we further found that the interaction between hsp  and sp occurred during mitosis by geldanamycin ga treatment and knockdown of hsp  we found that this interaction during mitosis was involved in the maintenance of sp stability and that the phospho c jun n terminal kinase jnk  level also decreased as the jnk  was knocked down by the shrna of jnk  sp was degraded through a ubiquitin dependent proteasome pathway in addition for mutation of the jnk  phosphorylated residues of sp  namely sp t    a and sp t    d  the effect of ga on sp stability was reversed finally based on the involvement of hsp  in sp stability the transcriptional activities of p waf cip and  s lipoxygenase under ga treatment were observed to have decreased taken together hsp  is important for maintaining sp stability during mitosis by the jnk  mediated phosphorylation of sp to enable division into daughter cells and to regulate the expression of related genes in the interphase
