redefinition of the cleavage sites of dnase i on the nucleosome core particle
dnase i has been widely used for the footprinting of dna  protein interactions including analyses of nucleosome core particle ncp structure our understanding of the relationship between the footprint and the structure of the nucleosome complex comes mainly from digestion studies of ncps since they have a well defined quasi symmetrical structure and have been widely investigated however several recent results suggest that the established consensus of opinion regarding the mode of digestion of ncps by dnase i may be based on erroneous interpretation of results concerning the relationship between the ncp ends and the dyad axis here we have used reconstituted ncps with defined ends bulk ncps prepared with micrococcal nuclease and molecular modelling to reassess the mode of dnase i digestion our results indicate that dnase i cuts the two strands of the nucleosomal dna independently with an average stagger of nt with the   ends protruding the previously accepted value of nt stagger is explained by the finding that micrococcal nuclease produces ncps not with flush ends but with approximately nt   recessed ends furthermore we explain why the dna stagger is an even and not an odd number of nucleotides these results are important for studies using dnase i to probe nucleosome structure in complex with other proteins or any dna  protein complex containing b form dna we also determine the origin of the  n  nt periodicity found in the internucleosomal ladder of dnase i digests of chromatin from various species the explanation of the  n  nt ladder may have implications for the structure of the  nm fibre
