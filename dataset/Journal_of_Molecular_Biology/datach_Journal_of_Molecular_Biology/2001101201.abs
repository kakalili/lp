central domain assembly thermodynamics and kinetics of s and s  binding to an s  rna complex edited by d draper
the  s ribosomal subunit assembles in vitro through the hierarchical binding of  ribosomal proteins to  s rrna the central domain of  s rrna becomes the platform of the  s subunit upon binding of ribosomal proteins s  s  s  s  s  and s  the assembly of the platform is nucleated by binding of s  to  s rrna followed by the cooperative binding of s and s  the prior binding of s and s  is required for binding of s  and s  we have studied the mechanism of the cooperative binding of s and s  to the s  rrna complex by isothermal titration calorimetry and gel mobility shift assays with rrna and proteins from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus s and s  form a stable heterodimer in solution with an apparent dissociation constant of   nm at   c the s s  heterodimer binds to the s  rrna complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of   nm at   c consistent with previous studies using rrna and proteins from escherichia coli we observed no binding of s or s  in the absence of the other protein or s  the presence of s  increases the affinity of s s  for the rna by at least four orders of magnitude the kinetics of s s  binding to the s  rrna complex are slow with an apparent bimolecular rate constant of      m   s   and an apparent unimolecular dissociation rate of        s   these results which are consistent with a model in which s and s  bind as a heterodimer to the s  rrna complex provide a mechanistic framework to describe the previously observed s  mediated cooperative binding of s and s  in the ordered assembly of a multi protein ribonucleoprotein complex
