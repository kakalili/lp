light induced helix movements in channelrhodopsin
channelrhodopsin  chr  is a cation selective light gated channel from chlamydomonas reinhardtii nagel g szellas t huhn w kateriya s adeishvili n berthold p et al channelrhodopsin  a directly light gated cation selective membrane channel proc natl acad sci usa           which has become a powerful tool in optogenetics two dimensional crystals of the slow photocycling c  t chr mutant were exposed to  nm light and rapidly frozen to trap the open state projection difference maps at   resolution show the location extent and direction of light induced conformational changes in chr during the transition from the closed state to the ion conducting open state difference peaks indicate that transmembrane helices tmhs tmh  tmh and tmh reorient or rearrange during the photocycle no major differences were found near tmh and tmh at the dimer interface while conformational changes in tmh and tmh are known from other microbial type rhodopsins our results indicate that tmh has a key role in light induced channel opening and closing in chr
