directed mutagenesis identifies amino acid residues involved in elongation factor tu binding to yeast phe trnaphe
the co crystal structure of thermus aquaticus elongation factor tu guanosine       imido triphosphate ef tu gdpnp bound to yeast phe trnaphe reveals that ef tu interacts with the trna body primarily through contacts with the phosphodiester backbone twenty amino acids in the trna binding cleft of thermus thermophilus ef tu were each mutated to structurally conservative alternatives and the affinities of the mutant proteins to yeast phe trnaphe determined eleven of the  mutations reduced the binding affinity from fourfold to gt   fold while the remaining ten had no effect the thermodynamically important residues were spread over the entire trna binding interface but were concentrated in the region which contacts the trna t stem most of the data could be reconciled by considering the crystal structures of both free ef tu gtp and the ternary complex and allowing for small      movements in the amino acid side chains thus despite the non physiological crystallization conditions and crystal lattice interactions the crystal structures reflect the biochemically relevant interaction in solution
