acidic residues in the hfq chaperone increase the selectivity of srna binding and annealing
hfq facilitates gene regulation by small non coding rnas srnas  thereby affecting bacterial attributes such as biofilm formation and virulence escherichia coli hfq recognizes specific u rich and aan motifs in srnas and target mrnas after which an arginine patch on the rim promotes base pairing between their complementary sequences in the cell hfq must discriminate between many similar rnas here we report that acidic amino acids lining the srna binding channel between the inner pore and rim of the hfq hexamer contribute to the selectivity of hfq s chaperone activity rnase footprinting in vitro binding and stopped flow fluorescence annealing assays showed that alanine substitution of d  e  or e  strengthened rna interactions with the rim of hfq and increased annealing of non specific or u tailed rna oligomers although the mutants were less able than wild type hfq to anneal srnas with wild type rpos mrna the d a mutation bypassed recruitment of hfq to an aan  motif in rpos both in vitro and in vivo these results suggest that acidic residues normally modulate access of rnas to the arginine patch we propose that this selectivity limits indiscriminate target selection by e coli hfq and enforces binding modes that favor genuine srna and mrna pairs
