structural basis for enantiomer binding and separation of a common  blocker crystal structure of cellobiohydrolase cel a with bound s propranolol at    resolution edited by r huber
cellobiohydrolase cel a previously called cbh   the major cellulase produced by the mould fungus trichoderma reesei has been successfully exploited as a chiral selector for separation of stereo isomers of some important pharmaceutical compounds e g adrenergic  blockers previous investigations including experiments with catalytically deficient mutants of cel a point unanimously to the active site as being responsible for discrimination of enantiomers in this work the structural basis for enantioselectivity of basic drugs by cel a has been studied by x ray crystallography the catalytic domain of cel a was co crystallised with the s enantiomer of a common  blocker propranolol at ph  and the structure of the complex was determined and refined at    resolution indeed  s propranolol binds at the active site in glucosyl binding subsites     the catalytic residues glu  and glu  make tight salt links with the secondary amino group of s propranolol the oxygen atom attached to the chiral centre of s propranolol forms hydrogen bonds to the nucleophile glu  o  and to gln  n   whereas the aromatic naphthyl moiety stacks with the indole ring of trp  in site   the bidentate charge interaction with the catalytic glutamate residues is apparently crucial since no enantioselectivity has been obtained with the catalytically deficient mutants e  q and e  q activity inhibition experiments with wild type cel a were performed in conditions close to those used for crystallisation competitive inhibition constants for r  and s propranolol were determined at    m and   m respectively corresponding to binding free energies of  kj mol and  kj mol respectively the ki value for r propranolol was  fold lower than the highest concentration    mm used in co crystallisation experiments still several attempts to obtain a complex with the r enantiomer have failed by using cellobiose as a selective competing ligand the retention of the enantiomers of propranolol on the chiral stationary phase csp based on cel a mutant d  n were resolved into enantioselective and non selective binding the enantioselective binding was weaker for both enantiomers on d  n csp than on wild type csp
