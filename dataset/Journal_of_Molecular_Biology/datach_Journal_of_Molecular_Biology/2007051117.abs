structural mechanism for the fine tuning of ccpa function by the small molecule effectors glucose  phosphate and fructose   bisphosphate
in gram positive bacteria carbon catabolite regulation ccr is mediated by the carbon catabolite control protein a ccpa  a member of the laci galr family of transcription regulators unlike other laci galr proteins ccpa is activated to bind dna by binding the phosphoproteins hpr ser  p or crh ser  p however fine regulation of ccr is accomplished by the small molecule effectors glucose  phosphate g p and fructose   bisphosphate fbp  which somehow enhance ccpa hpr ser  p binding to dna unlike the ccpa  hpr ser  p complex dna binding by ccpa crh ser  p is not stimulated by g p or fbp to understand the fine tuning mechanism of these effectors we solved the structures of the ccpa core  ccpa which lacks the n terminal dna binding domain in complex with hpr ser  p and g p or fbp g p and fbp bind in a deep cleft between the n and c subdomains of ccpa neither interacts with hpr ser  p this suggests that one role of the adjunct corepressors is to buttress the dna binding conformation effected by the binding of hpr ser  p to the ccpa dimer n subdomains however the structures reveal that an unexpected function of adjunct corepressor binding is to bolster cross interactions between hpr ser  p residue arg  and residues asp  and asp  of the other ccpa subunit these cross contacts which are weak or not present in the ccpa  crh ser  p complex stimulate the ccpa hpr ser  p dna interaction specifically thus stabilization of the closed conformation and bolstering of cross contacts between ccpa and its other corepressor hpr ser  p provide a molecular explanation for how adjunct corepressors g p and fbp enhance the interaction between ccpa hpr ser  p and cognate dna
