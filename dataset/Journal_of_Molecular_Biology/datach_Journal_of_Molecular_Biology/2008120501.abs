understanding the organisation and role of myosin binding protein c in normal striated muscle by comparison with mybp c knockout cardiac muscle
myosin binding protein c mybp c is a component of the thick filament of striated muscle the importance of this protein is revealed by recent evidence that mutations in the cardiac gene are a major cause of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy here we investigate the distribution of mybp c in the a bands of cardiac and skeletal muscles and compare this to the a band structure in cardiac muscle of mybp c deficient mice we have used a novel averaging technique to obtain the axial density distribution of a bands in electron micrographs of well preserved specimens we show that cardiac and skeletal a bands are very similar with a length of        m in normal cardiac and skeletal muscle the distributions are very similar showing clearly the series of  prominent accessory protein stripes in each half of the a band spaced axially at  nm intervals and starting at the edge of the bare zone we show by antibody labelling that in cardiac muscle the distal nine stripes are the location of mybp c these stripes are considerably suppressed in the knockout mouse hearts as expected myosin heads on the surface of the thick filament in relaxed muscle are thought to be arranged in a three stranded quasi helix with a mean   nm axial cross bridge spacing and a  nm helix repeat extra  forbidden  meridional reflections at orders of   nm in x ray diffraction patterns of muscle have been interpreted as due to an axial perturbation of some levels of myosin heads however in the mybp c deficient hearts these extra meridional reflections are weak or absent suggesting that they are due to mybp c itself or to mybp c in combination with a head perturbation brought about by the presence of mybp c
