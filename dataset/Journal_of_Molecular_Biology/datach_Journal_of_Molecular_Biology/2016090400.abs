r loops and links to human disease
aberrant r loop structures are increasingly being realized as an important contributor to human disease r loops which are mainly co transcriptional abundant rna dna hybrids form naturally and can indeed be beneficial for transcription regulation at certain loci however their unwanted persistence elsewhere or in particular situations can lead to dna double strand breaks chromosome rearrangements and hypermutation which are all sources of genomic instability mutations in genes involved in r loop resolution or mutations leading to r loop formation at specific genes affect the normal physiology of the cell we discuss here the examples of diseases for which a link with r loops has been described as well as how disease causing mutations might participate in the development and or progression of diseases that include repeat associated conditions other neurological disorders and cancers
