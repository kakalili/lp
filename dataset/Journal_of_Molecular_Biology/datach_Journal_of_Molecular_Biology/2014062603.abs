redefining the dry molten globule state of proteins
dynamics and function of proteins are governed by the structural and energetic properties of the different states they adopt and the barriers separating them in earlier work native state triplet  triplet energy transfer ttet on the villin headpiece subdomain hp  revealed an equilibrium between a locked native state and an unlocked native state which are structurally similar but have different dynamic properties the locked state is restricted to low amplitude motions whereas the unlocked state shows increased conformational flexibility and undergoes local unfolding reactions this classified the unlocked state as a dry molten globule dmg  which was proposed to represent an expanded native state with loosened side chain interactions and a solvent shielded core to test whether the unlocked state of hp  is actually expanded compared to the locked state we performed high pressure ttet measurements increasing pressure shifts the equilibrium from the locked toward the unlocked state with a small negative reaction volume for unlocking  v       cm mol  therefore rather than being expanded the unlocked state represents an alternatively packed compact state demonstrating that native proteins can exist in several compact folded states an observation with implications for protein function the transition state for unlocking locking in contrast has a largely increased volume relative to the locked and unlocked state with respective activation volumes of     cm mol and     cm mol indicating an expansion of the protein during the locking unlocking transition the presented results demonstrate the existence of both compact low energy and expanded high energy dmgs prompting a broader definition of this state
