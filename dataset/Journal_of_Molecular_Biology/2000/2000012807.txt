A total of 52 null, six reversion, and five silent mutations of frr (the gene encoding for ribosome recycling factor (RRF)) of Escherichia coli are discussed along with 12 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations and 14 intergenic suppressor strains of ts RRF. The null mutations were classified into six different categories. A computer-based secondary structure analysis showed three domains; domain A which has the N-terminal helix, domain B which contains coil, α-helix and β-strand structure, and domain C which is a C-terminal helix. The ts mutations fell into domains A and C but not in domain B. More than a half of the null mutations fell into domain B while the silent mutations fell outside domain B. Substitution of Arg132 in domain C by other amino acids was observed among five independently isolated null mutants. It is suggested that domain B is important for maintaining the RRF structure, while the region including Arg132 is one of the active sites. A total of 14 intergenic suppressor strains of ts RRF were grouped into four categories, depending on which temperature-sensitive alleles were suppressed.
