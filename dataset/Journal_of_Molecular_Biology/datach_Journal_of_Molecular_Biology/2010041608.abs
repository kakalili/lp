intramolecular movements in ef g trapped at different stages in its gtp hydrolytic cycle probed by fret
elongation factor g ef g is one of several gtp hydrolytic proteins gtpases that cycles repeatedly on and off the ribosome during protein synthesis in bacterial cells in the functional cycle of ef g hydrolysis of guanosine   triphosphate gtp is coupled to trna  mrna translocation in ribosomes gtp hydrolysis induces conformational rearrangements in two switch elements in the g domain of ef g and other gtpases these switch elements are thought to initiate the cascade of events that lead to translocation and ef g cycling between ribosomes to further define the coupling mechanism we developed a new fluorescent approach that can detect intramolecular movements in ef g we attached a fluorescent probe to the switch i element sw  of escherichia coli ef g we monitored the position of the sw probe relative to another fluorescent probe anchored to the gtp substrate or product by measuring the distance dependent f rster resonance energy transfer between the two probes by analyzing ef g trapped at five different functional states in its cycle we could infer the cyclical movements of sw within ef g our results provide evidence for conformational changes in sw  which help to drive the unidirectional ef g cycle during protein synthesis more generally our approach might also serve to define the conformational dynamics of other gtpases with their cellular receptors
