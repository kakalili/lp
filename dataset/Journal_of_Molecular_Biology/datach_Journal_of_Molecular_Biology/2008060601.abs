alternative relay domains of drosophila melanogaster myosin differentially affect atpase activity in vitro motility myofibril structure and muscle function
the relay domain of myosin is hypothesized to function as a communication pathway between the nucleotide binding site actin binding site and the converter domain in drosophila melanogaster a single myosin heavy chain gene encodes three alternative relay domains exon a encodes the indirect flight muscle isoform ifi relay domain whereas exon b encodes one of the embryonic body wall isoform emb relay domains to gain a better understanding of the function of the relay domain and the differences imparted by the ifi and the emb versions we constructed two transgenic drosophila lines expressing chimeric myosin heavy chains in indirect flight muscles lacking endogenous myosin one expresses the ifi relay domain in the emb backbone emb a  while the second expresses the emb relay domain in the ifi backbone ifi b  our studies reveal that the emb relay domain is functionally equivalent to the ifi relay domain when it is substituted into ifi essentially no differences in atpase activity actin sliding velocity flight ability at room temperature or muscle structure are observed in ifi b compared to native ifi however when the emb relay domain is replaced with the ifi relay domain we find a   reduction in actin activated atpase activity a significant increase in actin affinity abolition of actin sliding defects in myofibril assembly and rapid degeneration of muscle structure compared to emb we hypothesize that altered relay domain conformational changes in emb a impair intramolecular communication with the emb specific converter domain this decreases transition rates involving strongly bound actomyosin states leading to a reduced atpase rate and loss of actin motility
