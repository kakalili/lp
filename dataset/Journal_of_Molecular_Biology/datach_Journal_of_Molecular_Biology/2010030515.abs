molecular and structural insight into prongf engagement of p ntr and sortilin
nerve growth factor ngf is initially synthesized as a precursor prongf that is cleaved to release its c terminal mature form recent studies suggested that prongf is not an inactive precursor but acts as a signaling ligand distinct from its mature counterpart prongf and mature ngf initiate opposing biological responses by utilizing both distinct and shared receptor components in this study we carried out structural and biochemical characterization of prongf interactions with p ntr and sortilin we crystallized prongf complexed to p ntr and present the structure at     resolution the structure reveals a   symmetric binding mode as compared with the asymmetric structure of a previously reported crystal structure of mature ngf complexed to p ntr and the   symmetric complex of neurotrophin  nt  and p ntr here we discuss the possible origins and implications of the different stoichiometries in the prongf  p ntr complex the pro regions of prongf are mostly disordered and two hairpin loops loop  at the top of the ngf dimer have undergone conformational changes in comparison with mature nt structures suggesting possible interactions with the propeptide we further explored the binding characteristics of prongf to sortilin using surface plasmon resonance and cell based assays and determined that calcium ions promote the formation of a stable ternary complex of prongf  sortilin  p ntr these results together with those of previous structural and mechanistic studies of nt  receptor interactions suggest the potential for distinct signaling activities through p ntr mediated by different nt induced conformational changes
