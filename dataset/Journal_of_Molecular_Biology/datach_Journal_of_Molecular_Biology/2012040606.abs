large is fast small is tight determinants of speed and affinity in subunit capture by a periplasmic chaperone
the chaperone usher pathway assembles surface virulence organelles of gram negative bacteria consisting of fibers of linearly polymerized protein subunits fiber subunits are connected through  donor strand complementation   each subunit completes the immunoglobulin ig like fold of the neighboring subunit by donating the seventh  strand in trans whereas the folding of ig domains is a fast first order process folding of ig modules into the fiber conformation is a slow second order process periplasmic chaperones separate this process in two parts by forming transient complexes with subunits interactions between chaperones and subunits are also based on the principle of donor strand complementation in this study we have performed mutagenesis of the binding motifs of the caf m chaperone and caf capsular subunit from yersinia pestis and analyzed the effect of the mutations on the structure stability and kinetics of caf m  caf and caf  caf interactions the results suggest that a large hydrophobic effect combined with extensive main chain hydrogen bonding enables caf m to rapidly bind an early folding intermediate of caf and direct its partial folding the switch from the caf m  caf contact to the less hydrophobic but considerably tighter and less dynamic caf  caf contact occurs via the zip out  zip in donor strand exchange pathway with pocket  acting as the initiation site based on these findings caf m was engineered to bind caf faster tighter or both faster and tighter to our knowledge this is the first successful attempt to rationally design an assembly chaperone with improved chaperone function
