structural characterization of the gsk   active site using selective and non selective atp mimetic inhibitors
gsk   is a regulatory serine threonine kinase with a plethora of cellular targets consequently selective small molecule inhibitors of gsk   may have a variety of therapeutic uses including the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases type ii diabetes and cancer in order to characterize the active site of gsk   we determined crystal structures of unphosphorylated gsk   in complex with selective and non selective atp mimetic inhibitors analysis of the inhibitors interactions with gsk   in the structures reveals how the enzyme can accommodate a number of diverse molecular scaffolds in addition a conserved water molecule near thr  is identified that can serve a functional role in inhibitor binding finally a comparison of the interactions made by selective and non selective inhibitors highlights residues on the edge of the atp binding site that can be used to obtain inhibitor selectivity information gained from these structures provides a promising route for the design of second generation gsk   inhibitors
