internal bulge and tetraloop of the catalytic domain  of a group ii intron ribozyme are flexible implications for catalysis
rna molecules have an inherent flexibility that enables recognition of other interacting partners through potential disorder  order transitions yet studies to quantify such motional dynamics remain few with an increasing database of three dimensional structures of biologically important rna molecules quantifying such motions becomes important to link structural deformations with function one such system studied intensely is domain  d  from the self splicing group ii introns which is at the heart of its catalytic machinery we report the dynamics of a  nucleotide d from the pylaiella littoralis group ii intron in the presence and absence of magnesium ions and at a range of temperatures   k    k  using high resolution nmr experiments of heteronuclear nuclear overhauser enhancement noe  spin lattice r  and spin  spin r   c relaxation rates we determined the rotational diffusion tensor of d using the rotdif program modified for rna dynamic analysis rotdif rna  the d rotational diffusion tensor has an axial symmetric ratio d  d   of      consistent with an estimated overall rotational correlation time of  m  d  d     of       ns at   k and      ns at   k the measured relaxation data were analyzed with the reduced spectral density mapping formalism using assumed values of the chemical shift anisotropy of the  c spins both the relaxation data and the values of the spectral density function reveal that the functional groups in d implicated in magnesium ion binding and catalysis catalytic triad internal bulge and tetraloop regions exhibit thermally induced motion on a wide variety of timescales because these motions parallel those observed in the intramolecular stem  loop of the u element within the spliceosome we hypothesize that such extensive dynamic disorder likely facilitates d engaging both binding and catalytic regions of the ribozyme and these may be a conserved feature of the catalytic machinery essential for catalysis
