determining the limitations and benefits of noise in gene regulation and signal transduction through single cell microscopy based analysis
stochastic fluctuations termed  noise   in the level of biological molecules can greatly impact cellular functions while biological noise can sometimes be detrimental recent studies have provided an increasing number of examples in which biological noise can be functionally beneficial rather than provide an exhaustive review of the growing literature in this field in this review we focus on single cell studies based on quantitative microscopy that have generated a deeper understanding of the sources characteristics limitations and benefits of biological noise specifically we highlight studies showing how noise can help coordinate the expression of multiple downstream target genes impact the channel capacity of signaling networks and interact synergistically with oscillatory dynamics to enhance the sensitivity of signal processing we conclude with a discussion of current challenges and future opportunities
