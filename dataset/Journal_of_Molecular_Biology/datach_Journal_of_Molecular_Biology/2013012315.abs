c terminal turn stability determines assembly differences between a   and a
oligomerization of the amyloid  protein a  is a seminal event in alzheimer s disease a   which is only two amino acids longer than a   is particularly pathogenic why this is so has not been elucidated fully we report here results of computational and experimental studies revealing a c terminal turn at val   gly  in a   that is not present in a   the dihedral angles of residues  and  in an ile   ala  peptide were consistent with  turns and a  hairpin like structure was indeed observed that was stabilized by hydrogen bonds and by hydrophobic interactions between residues     and residues     in contrast a      mainly existed as a statistical coil to study the system experimentally we chemically synthesized a  peptides containing amino acid substitutions designed to stabilize or destabilize the hairpin the triple substitution gly val  val pro  gly val   vpv   facilitated a   hexamer and nonamer formation while inhibiting formation of classical amyloid type fibrils these assemblies were as toxic as were assemblies from wild type a   when substituted into a   the vpv substitution caused the peptide to oligomerize similarly to a   the modified a   was significantly more toxic than a   the double substitution d pro   l pro  abolished hexamer and dodecamer formation by a   and produced an oligomer size distribution similar to that of a   our data suggest that the val   gly  turn could be the sine qua non of a   if true this structure would be an exceptionally important therapeutic target
