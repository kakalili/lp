structural analysis of kinetic folding intermediates for a tim barrel protein indole  glycerol phosphate synthase by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry and g  model simulation
the structures of partially folded states appearing during the folding of a     tim barrel protein the indole  glycerol phosphate synthase from sulfolobus solfataricus sigps  was assessed by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry hx ms and g  model simulations hx ms analysis of the peptic peptides derived from the pulse labeled product of the sub millisecond folding reaction from the urea denatured state revealed strong protection in the     region modest protection in the neighboring       and      segments and no significant protection in the remaining n and c terminal segments these results demonstrate that this species is not a collapsed form of the unfolded state under native favoring conditions nor is it the native state formed via fast track folding however the striking contrast of these results with the strong protection observed in the        region after  s of folding demonstrates that these species represent kinetically distinct folding intermediates that are not identical as previously thought a re examination of the kinetic folding mechanism by chevron analysis of fluorescence data confirmed distinct roles for these two species the burst phase intermediate is predicted to be a misfolded off pathway intermediate while the subsequent  s intermediate corresponds to an on pathway equilibrium intermediate comparison with the predictions using a c  g  model simulation of the kinetic folding reaction for sigps shows good agreement with the core of the structure offering protection against exchange in the on pathway intermediate s  because the native centric g  model simulations do not explicitly include sequence specific information the simulation results support the hypothesis that the topology of tim barrel proteins is a primary determinant of the folding free energy surface for the productive folding reaction the early misfolding reaction must involve aspects of non native structure not detected by the g  model simulation
