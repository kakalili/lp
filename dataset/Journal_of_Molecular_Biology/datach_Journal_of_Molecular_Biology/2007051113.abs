identification of a novel isoform of iaspp and its interaction with p
iaspp is an inhibitory member of aspp apoptosis stimulating protein of p  or ankyrin repeats sh domain and proline rich region contain protein family as reported previously it at least includes two isoforms one is iaspp rai   amino acids aa and the other is iaspp   aa here we identified a novel open reading frame of human iaspp which encodes a   aa protein and highly matches with the c terminus of iaspp   aa cai    hereafter iaspp   aa will be referred to as iaspp sv iaspp splice variant  in further study we found that iaspp sv is a nuclear protein and is capable of binding to p  in vivo moreover overexpression of iaspp sv can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p  on the promoters of both bax and p
