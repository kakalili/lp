the nuclear i b protein i b  specifically binds nf  b p  homodimers and forms a ternary complex on  b dna
although they share sequence homology to classical cytoplasmic i b inhibitors of transcription factor nf  b the proteins i b  bcl  and i bns function in the nucleus as factors that influence nf  b dependent gene expression profiles through the use of purified recombinant proteins and by comparison with the classical i b protein i b  we have discovered mechanistic details of the interaction between i b  and functional nf  b dimers whereas i b  and other classical i b proteins bind tightly to nf  b dimers that possess the p  subunit i b  binds preferentially to nf  b p  homodimers this altered specificity is particularly interesting in light of the fact that both nf  b subunits exhibit high sequence and structural homology while the i b  and i b  proteins are also conserved in primary amino acid sequence we further show that i b  is capable of forming a stable ternary complex with the nf  b p  homodimer and  b dna again this is a stark contrast from i b  which inhibits nf  b p  homodimer binding to nf  b target dna sequences removal of the dna sequences flanking the nf  b binding site does not directly affect the interaction of p  and i b  rather we have discovered that the carboxy terminal glycine rich region of the nf  b p  homodimer is involved in mediating high affinity binding of i b  and nf  b p  we conclude that the nf  b p  homodimer functions as a legitimate activator of gene expression through formation of a ternary complex between itself i b  and dna the requirement for formation of this complex could explain why the nuclear i b protein i b  is absolutely required for expression of the pluripotent pro inflammatory cytokine interleukin  in peritoneal macrophages
