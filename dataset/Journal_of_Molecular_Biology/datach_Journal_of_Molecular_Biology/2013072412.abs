tail tip proteins related to bacteriophage  gpl coordinate an iron sulfur cluster
the assembly of long non contractile phage tails begins with the formation of the tail tip complex ttc  ttcs are multi functional protein structures that mediate host cell adsorption and genome injection the ttc of phage  is assembled from multiple copies of eight different proteins including gpl purified preparations of gpl and several homologues all displayed a distinct reddish color suggesting the binding of iron by these proteins further characterization of the gpl homologue from phage n  which was most amenable to in vitro analyses showed that it contains two domains the c terminal domain was demonstrated to coordinate an iron sulfur cluster providing the first example of a viral structural protein binding to this type of metal group we characterized the iron sulfur cluster using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy absorbance spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and found that it is an oxygen sensitive  fe s  cluster four highly conserved cysteine residues were shown to be required for coordinating the iron sulfur cluster and substitution of any of these cys residues with ser or ala within the context of  gpl abolished biological activity these data imply that the intact iron sulfur cluster is required for function the presence of four conserved cys residues in the c terminal regions of very diverse gpl homologues suggest that utilization of an iron sulfur cluster is a widespread feature of non contractile tailed phages that infect gram negative bacteria in addition this is the first example of a viral structural protein that binds an iron sulfur cluster
