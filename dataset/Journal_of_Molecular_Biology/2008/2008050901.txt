Low copy number proteins within macromolecular complexes, such as viruses, can be critical to biological function while comprising a minimal mass fraction of the complex. The Bacillus subtilis double-stranded DNA bacteriophage ϕ29 gene 13 product (gp13), previously undetected in the virion, was identified and localized to the distal tip of the tail knob. Western blots and immuno-electron microscopy detected a few copies of gp13 in ϕ29, DNA-free particles, purified tails, and defective particles produced in suppressor-sensitive (sus) mutant sus13(330) infections. Particles assembled in the absence of intact gp13 (sus13(342) and sus13(330)) had the gross morphology of ϕ29 but were not infectious. gp13 has predicted structural homology and sequence similarity to the M23 metalloprotease LytM. Poised at the tip of the ϕ29 tail knob, gp13 may serve as a plug to help restrain the highly pressurized packaged genome. Also, in this position, gp13 may be the first virion protein to contact the cell wall in infection, acting as a pilot protein to depolymerize the cell wall. gp13 may facilitate juxtaposition of the tail knob onto the cytoplasmic membrane and the triggering of genome injection.
