crystal structure of bifunctional aldos  ulose dehydratase isomerase from phanerochaete chrysosporium with the reaction intermediate ascopyrone m
the enzyme aldos  ulose dehydratase isomerase audh participates in carbohydrate secondary metabolism catalyzing the conversion of glucosone and   d anhydrofructose to the secondary metabolites cortalcerone and microthecin respectively audh is a homo dimeric enzyme with subunits of   amino acids the subunit consists of a seven bladed  propeller domain two cupin folds and a c terminal lectin domain audh contains a structural zn  and mg  located in loop regions and two zinc ions at the bottom of two putative active site clefts in the propeller and the cupin domain respectively catalysis is dependent on these two zinc ions as their specific removal led to loss of enzymatic activity the structure of the zn  depleted enzyme is very similar to that of native audh and structural changes upon metal removal as the cause for the catalytic deficiencies can be excluded the complex with the reaction intermediate ascopyrone m shows binding of this compound at two different sites with direct coordination to zn  in the propeller domain and as second sphere ligand of the metal ion in the cupin domain these observations suggest that the two reactions of audh might be catalyzed in two different active sites about    apart the dehydration reaction most likely follows an elimination mechanism where zn  acts as a lewis acid polarizing the c keto group of   d anhydrofructose abstraction of the proton at the c carbon atom and protonation of the leaving group the c hydroxyl moiety could potentially be catalyzed by the side chain of the suitably positioned residue his
