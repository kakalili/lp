nmr reveals the interplay among the amsh sh binding motif stam  and lys  linked diubiquitin
amsh associated molecule with a src homology  domain of signal transducing adaptor molecule stam  is one of the deubiquitinating enzymes associated in the regulation of endocytic cargo trafficking it shows an exquisite selectivity for lys  linked polyubiquitin chains that are the main chains involved in cargo sorting the first step requires the escrt  complex that comprises the stam and hepatocyte growth factor regulated substrate hrs proteins previous studies have shown that the presence of the stam protein increases the efficiency of lys  linked polyubiquitin chain cleavage by amsh one of the deubiquitinating enzyme involved in lysosomal degradation in the present study we are seeking to understand if a particular structural organization among these three key players is responsible for the stimulation of the catalytic activity of amsh to address this question we first monitored the interaction between the ubiquitin interacting motif uim sh construct of stam and the lys  linked diubiquitin lys  ub  chains by means of nmr we show that lys  ub is able to bind either the uim or the sh domain without any selectivity we further demonstrate that the sh binding motif sbm of amsh amsh sbm outcompetes lys  ub for binding sh  additionally we show how different amsh sbm variants modified by their sequence and length exhibit similar equilibrium dissociation constants when binding sh but significantly differ in their dissociation rate constants finally we report the solution nmr structure of the amsh sbm sh complex and propose a structural organization where the amsh sbm interacts with the stam sh domain and contributes to the correct positioning of amsh prior to polyubiquitin chains cleavage
