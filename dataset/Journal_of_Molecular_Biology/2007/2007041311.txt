Protein translocation across membranes is assisted by translocation machineries present in the membrane targeted by the precursor proteins. Translocon subunits can be functionally divided into receptor proteins warranting the specificity of this machine and a translocation channel. At the outer envelope of chloroplasts two sets of receptor proteins regulate protein translocation facing the cytosol or acting in the intermembrane space. One, Toc64 is a receptor of the translocon at the outer envelope of chloroplasts (Toc complex) with dual function. Toc64 recognizes Hsp90 delivered precursor proteins via a cytosolic exposed domain containing three tetratrico-peptide repeat motifs and as demonstrated in here, Toc64 functions also as a major component of a complex facing the intermembrane space. The latter complex is composed of an Hsp70 localized in the intermembrane space, its interaction partner Toc12, a J-domain containing protein and the intermembrane space protein Tic22. We analyzed the intermembrane space domain of Toc64. This domain is involved in preprotein recognition and association with the Toc-complex independent of the cytosolic domain of the Toc64 receptor. Therefore, Toc64 is involved in preprotein translocation across the outer envelope at both sites of the membrane.
