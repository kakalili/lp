The duration and fitness dependence of memory in viral quasispecies evolving in cell culture have been investigated using two genetic markers of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). In lineages of antigenic variant FMDV RED, which reverted to FMDV RGD, memory FMDV RED genomes were detected after 50 infectious cycles, and memory level was fitness dependent. In growth-competition experiments between a reference FMDV RGD and two different FMDV RED populations, a 7.6-fold higher fitness of the initial FMDV RED population resulted in 30 to 100-fold higher memory level. In lineages of low-fitness clones containing an elongated internal polyadenylate tract, revertants lacking excess adenylate residues became dominant by passage 20. However, genomes including a larger number of adenylate residues were detected as memory genomes after at least 150 infectious cycles. Thus, quasispecies memory can be durable and is fitness dependent, as predicted from the growth competition of two mutant forms of a genome. An understanding of factors influencing quasispecies memory levels and duration may have implications for the extended diagnosis of viruses based on the quantification of minority genomes.
