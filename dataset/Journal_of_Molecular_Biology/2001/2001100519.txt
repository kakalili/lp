Retroviral reverse transcriptases use host cellular tRNAs as primers to initiate reverse transcription. In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the 3′ 18 nucleotides of human tRNALys,3 are annealed to a complementary sequence on the RNA genome known as the primer binding site (PBS). The HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) facilitates this annealing. To understand the structural changes that are induced upon NC binding to the tRNA alone, we employed a chemical probing method using the lanthanide metal terbium. At low concentrations of NC, the strong terbium cleavage observed in the core region of the tRNA is significantly attenuated. Thus, NC binding first results in disruption of the tRNA’s metal binding pockets, including those that stabilize the D-TΨC tertiary interaction. When NC concentrations approach the amount needed for complete primer/template annealing, NC further destabilizes the tRNA acceptor-TΨC stem minihelix, as evidenced by increased terbium cleavage in this domain. A mutant form of NC (SSHS NC), which lacks the zinc finger structures, is able to anneal tRNALys,3 efficiently to the PBS, and to destabilize the tRNA tertiary core, albeit less effectively than wild-type NC. This mutant form of NC does not affect cleavage significantly in the helical regions, even when bound at high concentrations. These results, as well as experiments conducted in the presence of polyLys, suggest that in the absence of the zinc finger structures, NC acts as a polycation, neutralizing the highly negative phosphodiester backbone. The presence of an effective multivalent cationic peptide is sufficient for efficient tRNA primer annealing to the PBS.
