molecular dynamics studies of the process of amyloid aggregation of peptide fragments of transthyretin
it has been shown recently that an  residue peptide fragment of transthyretin ttr       can form amyloid fibrils in vitro by adopting an extended  strand conformation we used molecular dynamics simulations on systems of ttr      peptides for a total length of about   s to explore the process of self assembly and the structures of the resulting aggregates our results suggest that an antiparallel association of the  strands is more probable than a parallel one and that the central residues t  l   in a  strand have a high propensity to form inter peptide hydrogen bonds the study of the dynamics of self association indicated that for this peptide trajectories leading to conformations with high  helical content are off pathway from those leading to aggregates with high  structure content we also show that the diverse oligomeric structures that form spontaneously in the molecular dynamics simulations are to a large extent compatible with solid state nmr experimental measurements including chemical shifts on fully formed fibrils the strategy that we present may therefore be used in the design of new experiments to determine the structure of amyloid fibrils such as those involving site specific isotope labelling schemes to measure key inter atomic distances
