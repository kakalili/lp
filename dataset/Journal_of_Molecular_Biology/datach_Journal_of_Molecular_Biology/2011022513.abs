crystal structures of enoyl acp reductases i fabi and iii fabl from b subtilis
enoyl acyl carrier protein  acp reductase enr is a key enzyme in type ii fatty acid synthesis that catalyzes the last step in each elongation cycle therefore it has been considered as a target for antibiotics however recent studies indicate that some pathogens have more than one enr in particular bacillus subtilis has two enrs fabi and fabl the crystal structures of the ternary complexes of bsfabi and bsfabl are found as a homotetramer showing the same overall structure despite a sequence identity of only   the positions of the catalytic dyad of tyr xaa  lys in fabl are almost identical to that of fabi but a detailed structural analysis shows that fabl shares more structural similarities with fabg and other members of the sdr short chain alcohol dehydrogenase reductase family the apo fabl structure shows significantly different conformations at the cofactor and the substrate binding regions and this resulted in a totally different tetrameric arrangement reflecting the flexibility of these regions in the absence of the cofactor and substrate inhibitor
