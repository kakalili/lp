crystal structure of the excisionase  dna complex from bacteriophage lambda
the excisionase xis protein from bacteriophage  is the best characterized member of a large family of recombination directionality factors that control integrase mediated dna rearrangements it triggers phage excision by cooperatively binding to sites x and x within the phage bending dna significantly and recruiting the phage encoded integrase int protein to site p  we have determined the co crystal structure of xis with its x dna binding site at    resolution xis forms a unique winged helix motif that interacts with the major and minor grooves of its binding site using an  helix and an ordered  hairpin wing  respectively recognition is achieved through an elaborate water mediated hydrogen bonding network at the major groove interface while the preformed hairpin forms largely non specific interactions with the minor groove the structure of the complex provides insights into how xis recruits int cooperatively and suggests a plausible mechanism by which it may distort longer dna fragments significantly it reveals a surface on the protein that is likely to mediate xis  xis interactions required for its cooperative binding to dna
