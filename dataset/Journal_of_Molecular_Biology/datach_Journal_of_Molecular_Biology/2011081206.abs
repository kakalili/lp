p   map kinase dimers with swapped activation segments and a novel catalytic loop conformation
many protein kinase functions including autophosphorylation in trans require dimerization possibly by activation segment exchange such dimers have been reported for a few autophosphorylating protein kinases but not for mitogen activated protein kinases mapks  activation of mapks proceeds not only via the well characterized action of dual t y specificity mapk kinases phosphorylating both residues of the mapk txy activation loop motif but also via a noncanonical activation pathway triggered by phosphorylation at tyr  and homodimerization here we report the     resolution structure of p   mapk from salmo salar in a novel domain swapped homodimeric form the tyrosines of the conserved sequence yxape anchor the swapped activation segments in a configuration suitable for autophosphorylation in trans and provide a model for the noncanonical pathway in the dimer a structural unit containing tyr  is formed at a dimerization contact region that stabilizes the hrd catalytic loop in a unique inactive geometry this feature is consistent with the requirement of tyr  phosphorylation for the initiation of the noncanonical pathway despite the interacting surface of more than      the dimer is not obligate as gel filtration shows the dimerization to occur only at relatively high concentrations the transition from monomer to dimer involves a relatively simple hinged displacement of helix ef and adjacent residues thus dimer formation is likely to be transient compatible with functional requirements for autophosphorylation allowing further modulation for example by scaffolding mechanisms
