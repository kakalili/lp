colocalization of fast and slow timescale dynamics in the allosteric signaling protein chey
it is now widely recognized that dynamics are important to consider for understanding allosteric protein function however dynamics occur over a wide range of timescales and how these different motions relate to one another is not well understood here we report an nmr relaxation study of dynamics over multiple timescales at both backbone and side chain sites upon an allosteric response to phosphorylation the response regulator escherichia coli chey allosterically responds to phosphorylation with a change in dynamics on both the microsecond to millisecond  s ms timescale and the picosecond to nanosecond ps ns timescale we observe an apparent decrease and redistribution of  s ms dynamics upon phosphorylation and accompanying mg  saturation of chey additionally methyl groups with the largest changes in ps ns dynamics localize to the regions of conformational change measured by  s ms dynamics the limited spread of changes in ps ns dynamics suggests a distinct relationship between motions on the  s ms and ps ns timescales in chey the allosteric mechanism utilized by chey highlights the diversity of roles dynamics play in protein function
