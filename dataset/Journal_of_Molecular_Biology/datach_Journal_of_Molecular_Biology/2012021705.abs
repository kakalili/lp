a central swivel point in the rfc clamp loader controls pcna opening and loading on dna
replication factor c rfc is a five subunit complex that loads proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna clamps onto primer  template dna ptdna during replication rfc subunits belong to the aaa superfamily and their atpase activity drives interactions between the clamp loader the clamp and the ptdna leading to topologically linked pcna ptdna we report the kinetics of transient events in saccharomyces cerevisiae rfc catalyzed pcna loading including atp induced rfc activation pcna opening ptdna binding atp hydrolysis pcna closing and pcna ptdna release this detailed perspective enables assessment of individual rfc a rfc b rfc c rfc d and rfc e subunit functions in the reaction mechanism functions have been ascribed to rfc subunits previously based on a steady state analysis of  arginine finger  atpase mutants however pre steady state analysis provides a different view the central subunit rfc c serves as a critical swivel point in the clamp loader atp binding to this subunit initiates rfc activation and the clamp loader adopts a spiral conformation that stabilizes pcna in a corresponding open spiral the importance of rfc subunit response to atp binding decreases as rfc c gt rfc d gt rfc b with rfc a being unnecessary rfc c dependent activation of rfc also enables ptdna binding leading to the formation of the rfc atp pcnaopen ptdna complex subsequent atp hydrolysis leads to complex dissociation with rfc d activity contributing the most to rapid ptdna release the pivotal role of the rfc b c d subunit atpase core in clamp loading is consistent with the similar central location of all three atpase active subunits of the escherichia coli clamp loader
