a substrate mimic allows high throughput assay of the faba protein and consequently the identification of a novel inhibitor of pseudomonas aeruginosa faba
eukaryotes and prokaryotes possess fatty acid synthase fas biosynthetic pathways that comprise iterative chain elongation reduction and dehydration reactions the bacterial fasii pathway differs significantly from human fas pathways and is a long standing target for antibiotic development against gram negative bacteria due to differences from the human fas and several existing antibacterial agents are known to inhibit fasii enzymes n acetylcysteamine nac fatty acid thioesters have been used as mimics of the natural acyl carrier protein pathway intermediates to assay fasii enzymes and we now report an assay of fabv from pseudomonas aeruginosa using e  decenoyl nac in addition we have converted an existing uv absorbance assay for faba the bifunctional dehydration epimerization enzyme and key target in the fasii pathway into a high throughput enzyme coupled fluorescence assay that has been employed to screen a library of diverse small molecules with this approach n  chlorobenzyl    furyl  h    triazol  amine n fta was found to competitively inhibit pic       the processing of  hydroxydecanoyl nac by p aeruginosa faba n fta was shown to be potent in blocking crosslinking of escherichia coli acyl carrier protein and faba a direct mimic of the biological process the co complex structure of n fta with p aeruginosa faba protein rationalises affinity and suggests future design opportunities employing nac fatty acid mimics to develop further high throughput assays for individual enzymes in the fasii pathway should aid in the discovery of new antimicrobials
