fiber diffraction data indicate a hollow core for the alzheimer s a   fold symmetric fibril
amyloid  protein a   the principal component of the extracellular plaques found in the brains of patients with alzheimer s disease forms fibrils well suited to structural study by x ray fiber diffraction fiber diffraction patterns from the  residue form a      confirm a number of features of a  fold symmetric a  model from solid  state nmr ssnmr but suggest that the fibrils have a hollow core not present in the original ssnmr models diffraction patterns calculated from a revised  fold hollow model with a more regular  sheet structure are in much better agreement with the observed diffraction data than patterns calculated from the original ssnmr model refinement of a hollow core model against ssnmr data led to a revised ssnmr model similar to the fiber diffraction model
