three dimensional solution structure of an archaeal fkbp with a dual function of peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerase and chaperone like activities
here we report the solution structure of an archaeal fk  binding protein fkbp from a thermophilic archaeum methanococcus thermolithotrophicus mtfkbp   which has peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerase ppiase and chaperone like activities to reveal the structural basis for the dual function in addition to a typical ppiase domain a newly identified domain is formed in the flap loop by a  residue insert that is required for the chaperone like activity the new domain called if domain the insert in the flap  is a novel folding motif and exposes a hydrophobic surface which we consider to play an important role in the chaperone like activity
