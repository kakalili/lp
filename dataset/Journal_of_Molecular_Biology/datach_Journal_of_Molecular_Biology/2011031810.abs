probing cellular processes with oligo mediated recombination and using the knowledge gained to optimize recombineering
recombination with single strand dna oligonucleotides oligos in escherichia coli is an efficient and rapid way to modify replicons in vivo the generation of nucleotide alteration by oligo recombination provides novel assays for studying cellular processes single strand exonucleases inhibit oligo recombination and recombination is increased by mutating all four known exonucleases increasing oligo concentration or adding nonspecific carrier oligo titrates out the exonucleases in a model for oligo recombination   beta protein anneals the oligo to complementary single strand dna at the replication fork mismatches are created and the methyl directed mismatch repair mmr system acts to eliminate the mismatches inhibiting recombination three ways to evade mmr through oligo design include in addition to the desired change   a c c mismatch   bp from that change   four or more adjacent mismatches or   mismatches at four or more consecutive wobble positions the latter proves useful for making high frequency changes that alter only the target amino acid sequence and even allows modification of essential genes efficient uptake of dna is important for oligo mediated recombination uptake of oligos or plasmids is dependent on media and is    fold reduced for cells grown in minimal versus rich medium genomewide engineering technologies utilizing recombineering will benefit from both optimized recombination frequencies and a greater understanding of how biological processes such as dna replication and cell division impact recombinants formed at multiple chromosomal loci recombination events at multiple loci in individual cells are described here
