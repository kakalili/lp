solution structure of a hck sh domain ligand complex reveals novel interaction modes
we studied the interaction of hematopoietic cell kinase sh domain hcksh  with an artificial  residue proline rich peptide pd  hskyplpplpsl identified as high affinity ligand kd    m  pd shows an unusual ligand sequence for sh binding in type i orientation because it lacks the typical basic anchor residue at position p   but instead has a tyrosine residue at this position a basic lysine residue however is present at position p   the solution structure of the hcksh pd complex which is the first hcksh complex structure available clearly reveals that the p   tyrosine residue of pd does not take the position of the typical anchor residue but rather forms additional van der waals interactions with the hcksh rt loop instead lysine at position p   of pd substitutes the function of the p   anchor residue this finding expands the well known ligand consensus sequence xxppxp by xxxppxp thus software tools like ispot fail to identify pd as a high affinity hcksh ligand so far in addition a short antiparallel  sheet in the rt loop of hcksh is observed upon pd binding the structure of the hcksh pd complex reveals novel features of sh ligand binding and yields new insights into the structural basics of sh  ligand interactions consequences for computational prediction tools adressing sh  ligand interactions as well as the biological relevance of our findings are discussed
