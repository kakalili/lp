allorep a repository of sequence structural and mutagenesis data for the laci galr transcription regulators
protein families evolve functional variation by accumulating point mutations at functionally important amino acid positions homologs in the laci galr family of transcription regulators have evolved to bind diverse dna sequences and allosteric regulatory molecules in addition to playing key roles in bacterial metabolism these proteins have been widely used as a model family for benchmarking structural and functional prediction algorithms we have collected manually curated sequence alignments for gt   sequences in vivo phenotypic and biochemical data for gt   laci galr mutational variants and noncovalent residue contact networks for  laci galr homolog structures using this rich data resource we compared the noncovalent residue contact networks of the laci galr subfamilies to design and experimentally validate an allosteric mutant of a synthetic laci galr repressor for use in biotechnology the allorep database freely available at www allorep org is a key resource for future evolutionary studies of laci galr homologs and for benchmarking computational predictions of functional change
