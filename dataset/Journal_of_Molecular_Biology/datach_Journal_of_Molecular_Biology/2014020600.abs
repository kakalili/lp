from darpins to loopdarpins novel loopdarpin design allows the selection of low picomolar binders in a single round of ribosome display
antibodies are the most versatile binding proteins in nature with six loops creating a flexible continuous interaction surface however in some molecular formats antibodies are aggregation prone designed ankyrin repeat proteins darpins were successfully created as alternative design solutions nevertheless their concave shape rigidity and incompletely randomized binding surface may limit the epitopes that can be targeted by this extremely stable scaffold combining conformational diversity and a continuous convex paratope found in many antibodies with the beneficial biophysical properties of darpins we created loopdarpins a next generation of darpins with extended epitope binding properties we employed x ray structure determination of a loopdarpin for design validation biophysical characterizations show that the introduction of an elongated loop through consensus design does not decrease the stability of the scaffold consistent with molecular dynamics simulations ribosome display selections against extracellular signal regulated kinase  erk  and four members of the bcl  family bcl  bcl xl bcl w and mcl  of anti apoptotic regulators yielded loopdarpins with affinities in the mid picomolar to low nanomolar range against all targets the bcl  family binders block the interaction with their natural interaction partner and will be valuable reagents to test the apoptotic response in functional assays with the loopdarpin scaffold binders for bcl  with an affinity of  pm were isolated with only a single round of ribosome display an enrichment that has not been described for any scaffold identical stringent one round selections with conventional darpins without loop yielded no binders the loopdarpin scaffold may become a highly valuable tool for biotechnological high throughput applications
