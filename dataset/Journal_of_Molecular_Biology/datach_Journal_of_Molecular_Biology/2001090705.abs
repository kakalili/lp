nmr structure of the hrap myb motif reveals a canonical three helix bundle lacking the positive surface charge typical of myb dna binding domains edited by p e wright
mammalian telomeres are composed of long tandem arrays of double stranded telomeric ttaggg repeats associated with the telomeric dna binding proteins trf and trf  trf and trf contain a similar c terminal myb domain that mediates sequence specific binding to telomeric dna in the budding yeast telomeric dna is associated with scrap p which has a central dna binding domain that contains two structurally related myb domains connected by a long linker an n terminal brct domain and a c terminal rct domain recently the human ortholog of scrap p hrap  was identified and shown to contain a brct domain and an rct domain similar to scrap p however hrap contained only one recognizable myb motif in the center of the protein furthermore while scrap p binds telomeric dna directly hrap has no dna binding ability instead hrap is tethered to telomeres by trf  here we have determined the solution structure of the myb domain of hrap by nmr it contains three helices maintained by a hydrophobic core the architecture of the hrap myb domain is very close to that of each of the myb domains from trf  scrap p and c myb however the electrostatic potential surface of the hrap myb domain is distinguished from that of the other myb domains each of the minimal dna binding domains containing one myb domain in trf and two myb domains in scrap p and c myb exhibits a positively charged broad surface that contacts closely the negatively charged backbone of dna by contrast the hrap myb domain shows no distinct positive surface explaining its lack of dna binding activity the hrap myb domain may be a member of a second class of myb motifs that lacks dna binding activity but may interact instead with other proteins other possible members of this class are the c myb r myb domain and the myb domains of ada and adf  thus while the folds of all myb domains resemble each other closely the function of each myb domain depends on the amino acid residues that are located on the surface of each protein
