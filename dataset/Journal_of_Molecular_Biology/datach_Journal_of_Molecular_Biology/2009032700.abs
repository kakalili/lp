coupling  factor conformation to rna polymerase reorganisation for dna melting
atp driven remodelling of initial rna polymerase rnap promoter complexes occurs as a major post recruitment strategy used to control gene expression using a model enhancer dependent bacterial system     rnap e   and a slowly hydrolysed atp analogue atp s  we provide evidence for a nucleotide dependent temporal pathway leading to dna melting involving a small set of    dna conformational states we demonstrate that the atp hydrolysis dependent remodelling of e   occurs in at least two distinct temporal steps the first detected remodelling phase results in changes in the interactions between the promoter specificity   factor and the promoter dna the second detected remodelling phase causes changes in the relationship between the promoter dna and the core rnap catalytic     subunits correlating with the loading of template dna into the catalytic cleft of rnap it would appear that for e   promoters loading of template dna within the catalytic cleft of rnap is dependent on fast atp hydrolysis steps that trigger changes in the    jaw domain thereby allowing acquisition of the open complex status
