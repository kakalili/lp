enzymatic and structural characterisation of amphinase a novel cytotoxic ribonuclease from rana pipiens oocytes
besides onconase onc and its v  n  r  variant oocytes of the northern leopard frog rana pipiens contain another homologue of ribonuclease a which we named amphinase amph  four variants amph    were isolated and sequenced each   amino acid residues in length and n glycosylated at two positions sequence identities a among the variants and b versus onc are       and        respectively when compared with other amphibian ribonucleases a typical pattern of cysteine residues is evident but the n terminal pyroglutamate residue is replaced by a six residue extension amph variants have relatively weak ribonucleolytic activity that is insensitive to human ribonuclease inhibitor protein ri  values of kcat km with hypersensitive fluorogenic substrates are   and   fold lower than the maximum values exhibited by ribonuclease a and onc respectively and there is little cytosine uracil or adenine guanine discrimination at the b or b subsites respectively amph variants have cytotoxic activity toward a   carcinoma cells that requires intact ribonucleolytic activity the glycan component has little or no influence over single stranded rna cleavage ri evasion or cytotoxicity the crystal structures of natural and recombinant amph  determined at   and     resolution respectively reveal that the n terminus is unlikely to play a catalytic role but an unusual      loop may do so and the b subsite is rudimentary at the active site structural features that may contribute to the enzyme s low ribonucleolytic activity are the fixture of lys  in an obstructive position the accompanying ejection of lys  and a lack of constraints on the conformations of lys  and his
