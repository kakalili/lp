dynamics of the ssdna recognition by the repa hexameric helicase of plasmid rsf   analyses using fluorescence stopped flow intensity and anisotropy methods
the kinetic mechanism of the single stranded dna ssdna recognition by the repa hexameric replicative helicase of the plasmid rsf   and the nature of formed intermediates in the presence of the atp nonhydrolyzable analog    imidoadenosine   triphosphate amp pnp  have been examined using the fluorescence intensity and anisotropy stopped flow and analytical ultracentrifugation methods association of the repa hexamer with the ssdna oligomers that engage the total dna binding site and exclusively the strong dna binding subsite is a minimum four step mechanismhelicase ssdna  k  k h  ssdna   k  k h  ssdna   k  k h  ssdna   k  k h  ssdna extreme stability of the repa hexamer precludes any disintegration of its structure and the sequential character of the mechanism indicates that the enzyme exists in a predominantly single conformation prior to the association with the nucleic acid moreover the hexameric helicase possesses a dna binding site located outside its cross channel the reaction steps have dramatically different dynamics with rate constants differing by    orders of magnitude such behavior indicates a very diverse nature of the observed transitions which comprises binding steps and large conformational transitions of the helicase including local opening of the hexameric structure steady state fluorescence anisotropies of intermediates indicate that the entry of the dna into the cross channel is initiated from the   end of the bound nucleic acid the global structure of the tertiary complex repa  ssdna  amp pnp is very different from the structure of the binary complex repa  amp pnp indicating that in equilibrium the repa hexamer  ssdna  amp pnp complex exists as a mixture of partially open states
