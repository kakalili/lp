Different concentrations of ATP were mixed rapidly with single-ring or double-ring forms of GroEL containing the Phe44→Trp mutation and the time-resolved changes in fluorescence emission, upon excitation at 295 nm, were followed. Two kinetic phases that were previously found for double-ring GroEL are also observed in the case of the single-ring version: (i) a fast phase with a relatively large amplitude that is associated with the T→R allosteric transition; (ii) and a slow phase with a smaller amplitude that is associated with ATP hydrolysis. In the case of weak intra-ring positive cooperativity, the rate constant corresponding to the T→R allosteric switch of single-ring GroEL displays a bi-sigmoidal dependence on ATP concentration that may reflect parallel pathways of the allosteric transition. The slow phase is absent when double-ring or single-ring forms of GroEL are mixed with ADP or ATP without K+, and it has a rate constant that is independent of ATP concentration. A third fast phase that is still unassigned is observed for both single-ring and double-ring GroEL when a large amount of data is collected. Finally, a fourth phase is observed in the case of double-ring GroEL that is found to be absent in the case of single-ring GroEL. This phase is here assigned to inter-ring communication by (i) determining its dependence on ATP concentration and (ii) based on its absence from single-ring GroEL and the Arg13→Gly, Ala126→Val GroEL mutant, which is defective in inter-ring negative cooperativity. The value of the rate constant corresponding to this phase is found to increase with increasing intra-ring positive cooperativity, with respect to ATP. This is the first report of the rate of ATP-mediated inter-ring communication in GroEL, in the presence of ATP alone, which is crucial for the cycling of this molecular machine between different functional states.
