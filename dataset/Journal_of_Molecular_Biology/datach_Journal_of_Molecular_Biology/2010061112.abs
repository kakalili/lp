crystal structure of the mycoplasma arthritidis derived mitogen in apo form reveals a d domain swapped dimer
mycoplasma arthritidis derived mitogen mam is a superantigen that can activate large fractions of t cells bearing particular v  elements of t cell receptor here we report the crystal structure of a mam mutant k  a in apo form unliganded at    resolutions we also partially refined the crystal structures of the mam wild type and another mam mutant l a in apo forms at low resolutions unexpectedly the structures of these apo mam molecules display a three dimensional domain swapped dimer the entire c terminal domains of these mam molecules are involved in the domain swapping functional analyses demonstrated that the k  a and l a mutants do not show altered ability to bind to their host receptors and that they stimulate the activation of t cells as efficiently as does the wild type structural comparisons indicated that the  reconstituted  mam monomer from the domain swapped dimer displays large differences at the hinge regions from the mamwt molecule in the receptor bound form further comparison indicated that mam has a flexible n terminal loop implying that conformational changes could occur upon receptor binding
