structural basis of pxxdy motif recognition in sh binding
we have determined the solution structure of epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate  eps  l src homology  sh  domain in complex with the ppvpnpdyepir peptide from the cd  cytoplasmic tail our structure reveals the distinct structural features that account for the unusual specificity of the eps family sh domains for ligands containing a pxxdy motif instead of canonical pxxp ligands the cd  peptide binds eps l sh in a class ii orientation but neither adopts a polyproline ii helical conformation nor engages the first proline binding pocket of the sh ligand binding interface ile  of eps l sh  instead of tyr or phe residues typically found in this position in sh domains renders this hydrophobic pocket smaller and nonoptimal for binding to conventional pxxp peptides a positively charged arginine at position   in the n src loop of eps l sh plays a key role in pxxdy motif recognition by forming a salt bridge to d of the cd  peptide in addition our structural model suggests a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of the aromatic ring of y and the carboxyl group of e   thus explaining the critical role of the pxxdy motif tyrosine residue in binding to eps family sh  these finding have direct implications also for understanding the atypical binding specificity of the amino terminal sh of the nck family proteins
