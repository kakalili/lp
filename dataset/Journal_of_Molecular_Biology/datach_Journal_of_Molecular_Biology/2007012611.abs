the crystal structure of the secreted dimeric form of the hemophore hasa reveals a domain swapping with an exchanged heme ligand
to satisfy their iron needs several gram negative bacteria use a heme uptake system involving an extracellular heme binding protein called hemophore the function of the hemophore is to acquire free or hemoprotein bound heme and to transfer it to hasr its specific outer membrane receptor by protein  protein interaction the hemophore hasa secreted by serratia marcescens an opportunistic pathogen was the first to be identified and is now very well characterized hasa is a monomer that binds one b heme with strong affinity the heme in hasa is highly exposed to solvent and coordinated by an unusual pair of ligands a histidine and a tyrosine here we report the identification the characterization and the x ray structure of a dimeric form of hasa from s marcescens dhasa we show that both monomeric and dimeric forms are secreted in iron deficient conditions by s marcescens the crystal structure of dhasa reveals that it is a domain swapped dimer the overall structure of each monomeric subunit of dhasa is very similar to that of hasa but formed by parts coming from the two different polypeptide chains involving one of the heme ligands consequently dhasa binds two heme molecules by residues coming from both polypeptide chains we show here that while dhasa can bind two heme molecules it is not able to deliver them to the receptor hasr however dhasa can efficiently transfer its heme to the monomeric form that in turn delivers it to hasr we assume that dhasa can function as a heme reservoir in the hemophore system
