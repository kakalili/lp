the dice binding activity of kh domain  of hnrnp k is affected by c src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation
hnrnp k and hnrnp e e are rna binding proteins comprised of three hnrnp k homology kh domains these proteins are involved in the translational control and stabilization of mrnas in erythroid cells hnrnp e and hnrnp k regulate the translation of reticulocyte  lipoxygenase r  lox mrna both proteins bind specifically to the differentiation control element dice in the   untranslated region   utr of the r  lox mrna it has been shown that hnrnp k is a substrate of the tyrosine kinase c src and that tyrosine phosphorylation by c src inhibits the binding of hnrnp k to the dice here we investigate which of the three kh domains of hnrnp e and hnrnp k mediate the dice interaction using rna binding assays we demonstrate dice binding of the kh domains  and  of hnrnp e  and kh domain  of hnrnp k furthermore with rna binding assays nmr experiments and in vitro translation studies we show that tyrosine   in kh domain  of hnrnp k is important for the dice interaction and we provide evidence that it is a target of c src
