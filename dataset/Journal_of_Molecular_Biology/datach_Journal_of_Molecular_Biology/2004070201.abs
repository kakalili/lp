enzyme non enzyme discrimination and prediction of enzyme active site location using charge based methods
calculations of charge interactions complement analysis of a characterised active site rationalising ph dependence of activity and transition state stabilisation prediction of active site location through large  pkas or electrostatic strain is relevant for structural genomics we report a study of ionisable groups in a set of  enzymes finding that false positives obscure predictive potential in a larger set of   enzymes peaks in solvent space electrostatic properties are calculated both electric field and potential match well to active site location the best correlation is found with electrostatic potential calculated from uniform charge density over enzyme volume rather than from assignment of a standard atom specific charge set studying a shell around each molecule for   of enzymes the potential peak is within that  of the shell closest to the active site centre and   within   active site identification by largest cleft also with projection onto a shell gives   of enzymes for which the centre of the largest cleft lies within  of the active site and   within   dielectric boundary conditions emphasise clefts in the uniform charge density method which is suited to recognition of binding pockets embedded within larger clefts the variation of peak potential with distance from active site and comparison between enzyme and non enzyme sets gives an optimal threshold distinguishing enzyme from non enzyme we find that   of the enzyme set exceeds the threshold as compared to   of the non enzyme set enzyme non enzyme homologues   structural genomics  annotated proteins and catalytic non catalytic rnas are studied in this context
