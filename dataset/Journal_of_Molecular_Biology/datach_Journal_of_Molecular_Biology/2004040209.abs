a soluble ve cadherin fragment forms d arrays of dimers upon binding to a lipid monolayer
a high concentration of cadherin molecules at cell  cell adhesion sites is believed to be essential for generating strong intercellular junctions in order to determine the interactions of cadherin domains involved in the early stages of lateral cluster formation on the cell surface a recombinant fragment encompassing the first four domains of human ve cadherin with a his tag at the c terminus ve ec  his was produced two dimensional crystals of ve ec  his were formed at the air  water interface using conventional lipids modified to contain a ni  chelating group which provides a specific site for interaction with the polyhistidine tag the ve ec  his was monomeric at the concentration employed for crystal formation however the crystals exhibited a p symmetry and the presence of cis dimer interactions between symmetry related molecules the ve ec  his molecules in the crystalline array have a remarkably compact conformation in contrast to the elongated  string of pearls  conformation seen in the hexameric assembly of ve ec  his in solution and as seen in the crystal structure of c cadherin these results indicate that ve cadherin can exist in at least two oligomeric states with different interactions between domains and can adopt highly different conformational states we suggest that the compact cis dimeric state may occur on isolated cells and that the compact form may serve to protect the molecule from degradation as previously proposed we suppose that the trans hexameric form is involved in intercellular adhesion
