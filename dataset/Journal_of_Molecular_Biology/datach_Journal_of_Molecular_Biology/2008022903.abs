structure of the n terminal mlp binding domain of the saccharomyces cerevisiae mrna binding protein nab
nuclear abundant poly a rna binding protein  nab  is an essential yeast heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein that modulates both mrna nuclear export and poly a tail length the n terminal domain of nab  residues     mediates interactions with both the c terminal globular domain of the nuclear pore associated protein myosin like protein  mlp  and the mrna export factor gfd  the solution and crystal structures of the nab n terminal domain show a primarily helical fold that is analogous to the pwi fold found in several other rna binding proteins in contrast to other pwi containing proteins we find no evidence that the nab n terminal domain binds to nucleic acids instead this domain appears to mediate protein protein interactions that facilitate the nuclear export of mrna the nab n terminal domain has a distinctive hydrophobic patch centered on phe  consistent with this region of the surface being a protein protein interaction site engineered mutations within this hydrophobic patch attenuate the interaction with the mlp c terminal domain but do not alter the interaction with gfd  indicating that this patch forms a crucial component of the interface between nab and mlp
