the crystal structure of guamerin in complex with chymotrypsin and the development of an elastase specific inhibitor
guamerin a canonical serine protease inhibitor from hirudo nipponia was identified as an elastase specific inhibitor and has potential application in various diseases caused by elevated elastase concentration however the application of guamerin is limited because it also shows inhibitory activity against other proteases to improve the selectivity of guamerin as an elastase inhibitor it is essential to understand the binding mode of the inhibitor to elastase and to other proteases for this purpose we determined the crystal structure of guamerin in complex with chymotrypsin at     resolution the binding mode of guamerin on elastase was explored from the model structure of guamerin elastase guamerin binds to the hydrophobic pocket of the protease in a substrate like manner using its binding loop in order to improve the binding selectivity of guamerin to elastase several residues in the binding loop were mutated and the inhibitory activities of the mutants against elastase and chymotrypsin were monitored the substitution of the met  residue for ala in the p site increased the inhibitory activity against elastase up to  fold while the same mutant showed  fold decreased activity against chymotrypsin compared to the wild type guamerin furthermore the m a guamerin mutant more effectively protected endothelial cells against cell damage caused by elastase than the wild type guamerin
