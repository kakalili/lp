crystal structure of the f g aim pyd mutant and similarities of its self association to ded ded interactions
absent in melanoma  aim  is a cytoplasmic double stranded dna sensor involved in innate immunity it uses its c terminal hin domain for recognizing double stranded dna and its n terminal pyrin domain pyd for eliciting downstream effects through recruitment and activation of apoptosis associated speck like protein containing card asc  asc in turn recruits caspase  and or caspase  to form the aim inflammasome the activated caspases process proinflammatory cytokines il   and il  and induce the inflammatory form of cell death pyroptosis here we show that aim pyd aim pyd self oligomerizes we notice significant sequence homology of aim pyd with the hydrophobic patches of death effector domain ded containing proteins and confirm that mutations on these residues disrupt aim pyd self association the crystal structure at    resolution of such a mutant f g of aim pyd shows the canonical six helix h  h  bundle fold in the death domain superfamily in contrast to the wild type aim pyd structure crystallized in fusion with the large maltose binding protein tag the h  h region of the aim pyd f g is well defined with low b factors structural analysis shows that the conserved hydrophobic patches engage in a type i interaction that has been observed in ded ded and other death domain superfamily interactions while previous mutagenesis studies of pyds point to the involvement of charged interactions our results reveal the importance of hydrophobic interactions in the same interfaces these centrally localized hydrophobic residues within fairly charged patches may form the hot spots in aim pyd self association and may represent a common mode of pyd pyd interactions in general
