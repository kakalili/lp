efficient isolation of soluble intracellular single chain antibodies using the twin arginine translocation machinery
one of the most commonly used recombinant antibody formats is the single chain variable fragment scfv that consists of the antibody variable heavy chain connected to the variable light chain by a flexible linker since disulfide bonds are often necessary for scfv folding it can be challenging to express scfvs in the reducing environment of the cytosol thus we sought to develop a method for antigen independent selection of scfvs that are stable in the reducing cytosol of bacteria to this end we applied a recently developed genetic selection for protein folding and solubility based on the quality control feature of the escherichia coli twin arginine translocation tat pathway this selection employs a tripartite sandwich fusion of a protein of interest with an n terminal tat specific signal peptide and c terminal tem   lactamase thereby coupling antibiotic resistance with tat pathway export here we adapted this assay to develop intrabody selection after tat export iselate  a high throughput selection strategy for the identification of solubility enhanced scfv sequences using iselate for three rounds of laboratory evolution it was possible to evolve a soluble scfv from an insoluble parental sequence we show also that iselate enables focusing of an scfv library in soluble sequence space before functional screening and thus can be used to increase the likelihood of finding functional intrabodies finally the technique was used to screen a large repertoire of na ve scfvs for clones that conferred significant levels of soluble accumulation our results reveal that the tat quality control mechanism can be harnessed for molecular evolution of scfvs that are soluble in the reducing cytoplasm of e coli
