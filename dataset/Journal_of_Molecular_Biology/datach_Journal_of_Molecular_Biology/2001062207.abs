gyrb   a mutation of dna gyrase that compensates for topoisomerase i deficiency investigation of its low activity and quinolone hypersensitivity edited by j karn
the b subunit of dna gyrase gyrb consists of a  kda n terminal domain containing the site of atp binding and hydrolysis and a  kda c terminal domain that is thought to play a role in interactions with gyra and dna in cells containing a deletion of topa the gene encoding dna topoisomerase i a compensatory mutation is found in gyrb this mutation gyrb   results in a two amino acid insertion in the n terminal domain of gyrb we found that cells containing this mutation are more sensitive than wild type cells to quinolone drugs with respect to bacteriostatic and lethal action we have characterised the mutant gyrb protein in vitro and found it to have reduced dna supercoiling relaxation atpase and cleavage activities the mutant enzyme is up to threefold more sensitive to quinolones than wild type the mutation also increases the affinity of gyrb for gyra and dna while the affinity of quinolone for the enzyme dna complex is unaffected we propose that the loss in activity is due to misfolding of the gyrb   protein providing an example in which misfolding of one protein dna gyrase suppresses a deficiency of another topoisomerase i the increased quinolone sensitivity is proposed to be a consequence of an altered conformation of the protein that renders quinolones better able to disrupt rather than generate gyrase drug dna complexes
