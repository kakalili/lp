crystal structures of inhibitor complexes of human t cell leukemia virus htlv  protease
human t cell leukemia virus type  htlv  is a retrovirus associated with several serious diseases such as adult t cell leukemia and tropical spastic paraparesis myelopathy for a number of years the protease pr encoded by htlv  has been a target for designing antiviral drugs but that effort was hampered by limited available structural information we report a high resolution crystal structure of htlv  pr complexed with a statine containing inhibitor a significant improvement over the previously available moderate resolution structure we also report crystal structures of the complexes of htlv  pr with five different inhibitors that are more compact and more potent a detailed study of structure  activity relationships was performed to interpret in detail the influence of the polar and hydrophobic interactions between the inhibitors and the protease
