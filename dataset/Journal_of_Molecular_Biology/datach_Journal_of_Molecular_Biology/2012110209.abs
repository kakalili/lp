structural basis for aspp recognition by the tumor suppressor p
tumor suppressors p  p  and p  comprise a family of stress responsive transcription factors with distinct functions in development and tumor suppression most human cancers lose p  function yet all three proteins are capable of inducing apoptosis or cellular senescence mechanisms are therefore under investigation to activate p  dependent apoptosis in p  deficient cancer cells significantly the dna binding domain dbd of p  escapes viral oncoproteins and displays an enhanced thermal stability to further understand the variant features of p  we solved the high  resolution crystal structure of the p  dbd as well as its complex with the ankyrin repeat and sh domains of the pro apoptotic factor aspp  the p  structure exhibits the same conserved architecture as p  but displays a divergent l loop a known site of protein  protein interaction the loop in p  is changed by a two residue insertion that also induces repacking around the site of the p  mutational hotspot r   importantly the binding of aspp is preserved by conformational changes in both the ankyrin repeat and sh domains these results further highlight the structural variation that impacts p  family interactions within the p  interactome
