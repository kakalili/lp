the m domain controls hsp  protein remodeling activity in an hsp  hsp  dependent manner
yeast hsp  is a ring forming atp dependent protein disaggregase that together with the cognate hsp  chaperone system has the remarkable ability to rescue stress damaged proteins from a previously aggregated state both upstream and downstream functions for the hsp  system have been reported but it remains unclear how hsp  hsp  is coupled to hsp  protein remodeling activity hsp  is a multidomain protein that possesses an n terminal domain an m domain and two tandem aaa domains the m domain forms an    long coiled coil and is a hallmark of the hsp  chaperone family while the three dimensional structure of hsp  has been determined the function of the m domain is unclear here we demonstrate that the m domain is essential for protein disaggregation but dispensable for hsp  atpase and substrate translocating activities remarkably replacing the hsp  m domain with that of bacterial clpb and vice versa switches species specificity so that our chimeras now cooperate with the noncognate hsp  dnak chaperone system our results demonstrate that the m domain controls hsp  protein remodeling activities in an hsp  hsp  dependent manner which is required to unleash hsp  protein disaggregating activity
