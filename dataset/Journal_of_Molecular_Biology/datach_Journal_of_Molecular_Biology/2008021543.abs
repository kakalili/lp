crystal structure of the glur ligand binding core from nostoc punctiforme in complex with l glutamate structural dissection of the ligand interaction and subunit interface
glur from nostoc punctiforme npglur  is a bacterial homologue of the ionotropic glutamate receptor iglur  we have solved the crystal structure of the ligand binding core of npglur in complex with l glutamate at a resolution of     the structure exhibits a noncanonical ligand interaction and two distinct subunit interfaces the side chain guanidium group of arg  forms a salt bridge with the  carboxyl group of bound l glutamate in glur from synechocystis sglur  and other iglurs the equivalent residues are asn or thr which cannot form a similar interaction we suggest that the local positively charged environment and the steric constraint created by arg  mediate the selectivity of l glutamate binding by preventing the binding of positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids in addition the npglur ligand binding core forms a new subunit interface in which the two protomers are arranged differently than the known iglur and sglur dimer interfaces the significance of there being two different dimer interfaces was investigated using analytical ultracentrifugation analysis
