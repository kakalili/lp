mutational analysis and nmr studies of the death domain of the tumor necrosis factor receptor  edited by p e wright
tumor necrosis factor receptor  tnfr  death domain dd is the intracellular functional domain responsible for the receptor signaling activities to understand the transduction mechanism of tnfr  signaling we performed structural and functional analysis of the tnfr dd the secondary structure of the tnfr dd shows that it consists of six anti parallel  helices the determination of the topological fold and an extensive mutagenesis analysis revealed that there are two opposite faces that are involved in self association and interaction with the tradd death domain interestingly the same critical residues in tnfr dd are involved in both interactions there is a good correlation between the binding activities of the mutant proteins and their cytotoxic activities these results provide important insight into the molecular interactions mediating tnfr dd self association and subsequent recruitment of tradd in the signaling activity of tnfr
