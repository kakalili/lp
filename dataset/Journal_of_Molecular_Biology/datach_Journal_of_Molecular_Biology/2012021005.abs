engineering antibody fitness and function using membrane anchored display of correctly folded proteins
a hallmark of the bacterial twin arginine translocation tat pathway is its ability to export folded proteins here we discovered that overexpressed tat substrate proteins form two distinct long lived translocation intermediates that are readily detected by immunolabeling methods formation of the early translocation intermediate ti  which exposes the n and c termini to the cytoplasm did not require an intact tat translocase a functional tat signal peptide or a correctly folded substrate in contrast formation of the later translocation intermediate ti  which exhibits a bitopic topology with the n terminus in the cytoplasm and c terminus in the periplasm was much more particular requiring an intact translocase a functional signal peptide and a correctly folded substrate protein the ability to directly detect ti  intermediates was subsequently exploited for a new protein engineering technology called mad trap membrane anchored display for tat based recognition of associating proteins  through the use of just two rounds of mutagenesis and screening with mad trap the intracellular folding and antigen binding activity of a human single chain antibody fragment were simultaneously improved this approach has several advantages for library screening including the unique involvement of the tat folding quality control mechanism that ensures only native like proteins are displayed thus eliminating poorly folded sequences from the screening process
