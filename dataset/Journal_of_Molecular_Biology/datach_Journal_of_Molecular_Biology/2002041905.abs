potent inhibition of hiv  fusion by cyanovirin n requires only a single high affinity carbohydrate binding site characterization of low affinity carbohydrate binding site knockout mutants
cyanovirin n cvn is a novel cyanobacterial protein that potently inhibits viral entry by human immunodeficiency viruses hiv via high affinity carbohydrate mediated binding to the surface envelope glycoprotein gp   bearing c pseudo symmetry cvn contains two carbohydrate binding sites of differing affinities located at opposite ends of the protein cvn selectively binds with nanomolar affinity the mammalian high mannose oligosaccharides oligomannose  d d and oligomannose  which also govern binding to gp   at nanomolar concentrations cvn binds these oligosaccharides only through its high affinity site while at micromolar to millimolar concentrations the oligosaccharides are bound through both sites leading to divalent protein  carbohydrate interactions similarly two modes of binding to gp  can be envisioned where cvn either binds gp  solely through the high affinity site or binds divalently using both carbohydrate binding sites to determine the role of the low affinity site in binding to gp   we sought to design a variant of cvn that lacks the low affinity carbohydrate binding site but retains a fully functional high affinity site thus we constructed a series of cvn mutants possessing cumulative mutations in the low affinity site only and characterized by nmr the overall structure and carbohydrate binding ability of each of these mutants we demonstrate that carbohydrate binding by the low affinity site is completely absent in two mutants bearing three or four mutations namely m cvn lys asn glu ile asn ala and m cvn lys asn thr ala glu ile asn ala  while the high affinity site binds the high affinity ligand man    man  with a kd value equal to that measured for cvn using an hiv  cell fusion assay we show that all of the mutants inhibit hiv  fusion with nearly identical ic  values as wild type cvn we interpret these results as indicating that the low affinity carbohydrate binding site of cvn is not necessary for high affinity binding to gp   and hiv  fusion can therefore be blocked by monovalent protein  carbohydrate interactions
