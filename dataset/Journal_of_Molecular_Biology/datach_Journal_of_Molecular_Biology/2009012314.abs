structure and function of hiv  reverse transcriptase molecular mechanisms of polymerization and inhibition
the rapid replication of hiv  and the errors made during viral replication cause the virus to evolve rapidly in patients making the problems of vaccine development and drug therapy particularly challenging in the absence of an effective vaccine drugs are the only useful treatment anti hiv drugs work so far drug therapy has saved more than three million years of life unfortunately hiv  develops resistance to all of the available drugs although a number of useful anti hiv drugs have been approved for use in patients the problems associated with drug toxicity and the development of resistance means that the search for new drugs is an ongoing process the three viral enzymes reverse transcriptase rt  integrase in  and protease pr are all good drug targets two distinct types of rt inhibitors both of which block the polymerase activity of rt have been approved to treat hiv  infections nucleoside analogs nrtis and nonnucleosides nnrtis  and there are promising leads for compounds that either block the rnase h activity or block the polymerase in other ways a better understanding of the structure and function s of rt and of the mechanism s of inhibition can be used to generate better drugs in particular drugs that are effective against the current drug resistant strains of hiv
