rotamer strain energy in protein helices  quantification of a major force opposing protein folding edited by j thornton
it is widely believed that the dominant force opposing protein folding is the entropic cost of restricting internal rotations the energetic changes from restricting side chain torsional motion are more complex than simply a loss of conformational entropy however a second force opposing protein folding arises when a side chain in the folded state is not in its lowest energy rotamer giving rotameric strain   strain energy results from a dihedral angle being shifted from the most stable conformation of a rotamer when a protein folds we calculated the energy of a side chain as a function of its dihedral angles in a poly ala helix using these energy profiles we quantify conformational entropy rotameric strain energy and  strain energy for all  amino acid residues with side chains in  helices we can calculate these terms for any amino acid in a helix interior in a protein as a function of its side chain dihedral angles and have implemented this algorithm on a web page the mean change in rotameric strain energy on folding is   kcal mol   per residue and the mean  strain energy is   kcal mol   per residue loss of conformational entropy opposes folding by a mean of   kcal mol   per residue and the mean total force opposing restricting a side chain into a helix is   kcal mol   conformational entropy estimates alone therefore greatly underestimate the forces opposing protein folding the introduction of strain when a protein folds should not be neglected when attempting to quantify the balance of forces affecting protein stability consideration of rotameric strain energy may help the use of rotamer libraries in protein design and rationalise the effects of mutations where side chain conformations change
