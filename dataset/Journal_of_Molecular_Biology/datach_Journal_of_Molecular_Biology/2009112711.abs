hiv  nef dimerization is required for nef mediated receptor downregulation and viral replication
nef a human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  accessory factor capable of interaction with a diverse array of host cell signaling molecules is essential for high titer hiv replication and aids progression previous biochemical and structural studies have suggested that nef may form homodimers and higher order oligomers in hiv infected cells which may be required for both immune and viral receptor downregulation as well as viral replication using bimolecular fluorescence complementation we provide the first direct evidence for nef dimers within hiv host cells and identify the structural requirements for dimerization in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis shows that the multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions found within the dimerization interface of the nef x ray crystal structure are essential for dimerization in cells nef dimers localized to the plasma membrane as well as the trans golgi network two subcellular localizations essential for nef function mutations in the nef dimerization interface dramatically reduced both nef induced cd downregulation and hiv replication viruses expressing dimerization defective nef mutants were disabled to the same extent as hiv that fails to express nef in terms of replication these results identify the nef dimerization region as a potential molecular target for antiretroviral drug discovery
