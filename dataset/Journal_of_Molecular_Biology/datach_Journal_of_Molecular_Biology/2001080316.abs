ketoconazole induced conformational changes in the active site of cytochrome p  eryf edited by d rees
the azole based p  inhibitor ketoconazole is used to treat fungal infections and functions by blocking ergosterol biosynthesis in yeast ketoconazole binds to mammalian p  enzymes and this can result in drug drug interactions and lead to liver damage to identify protein drug interactions that contribute to binding specificity and affinity we determined the crystal structure of ketoconazole complexed with p  eryf in the p  eryf ketoconazole structure the azole moiety and nearby rings of ketoconzole are positioned in the active site similar to the substrate  deoxyerythronolide b with the azole nitrogen atom coordinated to the heme iron atom the remainder of the ketoconazole molecule extends into the active site pocket which is occupied by water in the substrate complex binding of ketoconazole led to unexpected conformational changes in the i helix the i helix cleft near the active site has collapsed with a helical pitch of    compared to    in the substrate complex p  eryf ketoconazole crystals soaked in  deoxyerythronolide b to exchange ligands exhibit a structure identical with that of the original p  eryf substrate complex with the i helix cleft restored to a pitch of     these findings indicate that the i helix region of p  eryf is flexible and can adopt multiple conformations an improved understanding of the flexibility of the active site region of cytochrome p  enzymes is important to gain insight into determinants of ligand binding specificity as well as to evaluate models for catalytic mechanism based on static crystal structures
