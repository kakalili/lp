crystal structure of the    integrin i domain in complex with an antibody fab fragment
the     vla  integrin is a cell surface receptor for collagen and laminin and has been implicated in biological pathways involved in several pathological processes these processes may be inhibited by the monoclonal antibody aqc  which binds with high affinity to human    integrin to understand the structural basis of the inhibition we determined the crystal structure of the complex of a chimeric rat human i domain of the    integrin and the fab fragment of humanized aqc antibody the structure of the complex shows that the antibody blocks the collagen binding site of the i domain an aspartate residue from the cdr loop of the antibody heavy chain coordinates the midas metal ion in a manner similar to that of a glutamate residue from collagen substitution of the aspartate residue by alanine or arginine results in significant reduction of antibody binding affinity interestingly although the mode of metal ion coordination resembles that of the open conformation the i domain maintains an overall closed conformation previously observed only for unliganded i domains
