genomic analysis of bacteriophages sp and k   an estranged subgroup of the t supergroup
we have determined the genome sequences of two closely related lytic bacteriophages sp and k   which infect salmonella typhimurium lt and escherichia coli serotypes k and k  respectively the genome organization of these phages is almost identical with the notable exception of the tail fiber genes that confer the different host specificities the two phages have diverged extensively at the nucleotide level but they are still more closely related to each other than either is to any other phage currently characterized the sp and k  genomes contain respectively     bp and    bp with   bp and   bp direct terminal repeats about half of the   putative open reading frames in the two genomes combined show no significant similarity to database proteins with a known or predicted function that is obviously beneficial for growth of a bacteriophage the overall genome organization of sp and k  is comparable to that of the t group of phages although the specific order of genes coding for dna metabolism functions has not been conserved low levels of nucleotide similarity between genomes in the t and sp groups suggest that they diverged a long time ago but on the basis of this conservation of genome organization they are expected to have retained similar developmental strategies
