A method for discerning protein structures containing the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif has been developed. The method uses statistical models based on geometrical measurements of the motif. With a decision tree model, key structural features required for DNA binding were identified. These include a high average solvent-accessibility of residues within the recognition helix and a conserved hydrophobic interaction between the recognition helix and the second alpha helix preceding it. The Protein Data Bank was searched using a more accurate model of the motif created using the Adaboost algorithm to identify structures that have a high probability of containing the motif, including those that had not been reported previously.
