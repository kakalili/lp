improving the resistance of a eukaryotic  barrel protein to thermal and chemical perturbations
barrel membrane proteins have regular structures with extensive hydrogen bond networks between their transmembrane tm   strands which stabilize their protein fold nevertheless weakly stable tm regions which are important for the protein function and interaction with other proteins exist here we report on the apparent stability of human tom a a member of the  mitochondrial porin family  and main constituent of the mitochondrial protein conducting channel tom translocase of the outer membrane  using a physical interaction model tmsip for  barrel membrane proteins we have identified three unfavorable  strands in the tm domain of the protein substitution of key residues inside these strands with hydrophobic amino acids results in a decreased sensitivity of the protein to chemical and or thermal denaturation the apparent melting temperature observed when denatured at a rate of   c per minute is shifted from  to    c moreover the sensitivity of the protein to denaturant agents is significantly lowered further we find a reduced tendency for the mutated protein to form dimers we propose that the identified weakly stable  strands   and  of human tom a play an important role in quaternary protein  protein interactions within the mammalian tom machinery our results show that the use of empirical energy functions to model the apparent stability of  barrel membrane proteins may be a useful tool in the field of nanopore bioengineering
