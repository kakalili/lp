roles of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in functional regulation of the hsp  j protein co chaperone sis
unlike other hsp  molecular chaperones those of the eukaryotic cytosol have four residues eevd at their c termini eevd hsp  binds adaptor proteins of the hsp  chaperone system and mitochondrial membrane preprotein receptors thereby facilitating processing of hsp  bound clients through protein folding and translocation pathways among j protein co chaperones functioning in these pathways sis is unique as it also binds the eevd hsp  motif however little is known about the role of the sis eevd hsp  interaction we found that deletion of eevd hsp  abolished the ability of sis  but not the ubiquitous j protein ydj  to partner with hsp  in in vitro protein refolding sis co chaperone activity with hsp   eevd was restored upon substitution of a glutamic acid of the j domain structural analysis revealed that this key glutamic acid which is not present in ydj  forms a salt bridge with an arginine of the immediately adjacent glycine rich region thus restoration of sis in vitro activity suggests that intramolecular interactions between the j domain and glycine rich region control co chaperone activity which is optimal only when sis interacts with the eevd hsp  motif however we found that disruption of the sis eevd hsp  interaction enhances the ability of sis to substitute for ydj in vivo our results are consistent with the idea that interaction of sis with eevd hsp  minimizes transfer of sis bound clients to hsp s that are primed for client transfer to folding and translocation pathways by their preassociation with eevd binding adaptor proteins these interactions may be one means by which cells triage ydj  and sis bound clients to productive and quality control pathways respectively
