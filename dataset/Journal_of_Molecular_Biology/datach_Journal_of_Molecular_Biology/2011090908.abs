a crystallographic study of the role of sequence context in thymine glycol bypass by a replicative dna polymerase serendipitously sheds light on the exonuclease complex
thymine glycol tg is the most common oxidation product of thymine and is known to be a strong block to replicative dna polymerases a previously solved structure of the bacteriophage rb  dna polymerase rb  gp  in complex with tg in the sequence context   g tg g shed light on how tg blocks primer elongation the protruding methyl group of the oxidized thymine displaces the adjacent   g which can no longer serve as a template for primer elongation aller p  rould m a  hogg m wallace s s  amp doubli  s     a structural rationale for stalling of a replicative dna polymerase at the most common oxidative thymine lesion thymine glycol proc natl acad sci usa          several studies showed that in the sequence context   c tg purine tg is more likely to be bypassed by klenow fragment an a family dna polymerase we set out to investigate the role of sequence context in tg bypass in a b family polymerase and to solve the crystal structures of the bacteriophage rb  dna polymerase in complex with tg containing dna in the three remaining sequence contexts    a tg g    t tg g and   c tg g a combination of several factors  including the associated exonuclease activity the nature of the   and   bases surrounding tg and the cis  trans interconversion of tg  influences tg bypass we also visualized for the first time the structure of a well ordered exonuclease complex allowing us to identify and confirm the role of key residues phe   met   and tyr   in strand separation and in the stabilization of the primer strand in the exonuclease site
