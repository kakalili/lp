the conserved ca tg motif at mu termini t specifies stable transpososome assembly
the dinucleotide ca tg found at the termini of transposable phage mu occurs also at the termini of a large class of transposable elements including hiv all retroviruses and many retrotransposons it was shown recently that mutations of this sequence block transpososome assembly that a t is more critical for activity than c g and that the hierarchy of reactivity of mutant termini follows closely the reported hierarchy of flexibility of their dinucleotide steps in order to test the hypothesis that the terminal dinucleotide plays an essential structural role during  open termini  formation accompanying assembly we have examined the activity of substrates carrying   different pairs of mismatched termini consistent with the flexibility hypothesis we find that mismatched substrates are extremely efficient at assembly a wild type t residue on the bottom strand is essential for stable assembly but the identity of the dinucleotide on the top strand is irrelevant for transposition chemistry in addition we have found a new rule for suppression of terminal defects by mub protein as well as a role for metal ions in dna opening at the termini
