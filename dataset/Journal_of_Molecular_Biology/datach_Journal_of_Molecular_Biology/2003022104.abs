structure of  antithrombin and the effect of glycosylation on antithrombin s heparin affinity and activity
antithrombin is a member of the serpin family of protease inhibitors and the major inhibitor of the blood coagulation cascade it is unique amongst the serpins in that it circulates in a conformation that is inactive against its target proteases activation of antithrombin is brought about by a conformational change initiated upon binding heparin or heparan sulphate two isoforms exist in the circulation   antithrombin and  antithrombin which differ in the amount of glycosylation present on the polypeptide chain   antithrombin lacks the carbohydrate present at asn  in  antithrombin of the two forms   antithrombin has the higher affinity for heparin and thus functions as the major inhibitor in vivo even though it is the less abundant form the reason for the differences in heparin affinity between the  and  forms have been shown to be due to the additional carbohydrate changing the rate of the conformational change here we describe the most accurate structures of  antithrombin and  antithrombin heparin pentasaccharide reported to date    and    resolution respectively both re refinements using old data  and the structure of  antithrombin    resolution  the new structures have a remarkable degree of ordered carbohydrate and include parts of the antithrombin chain not modeled before the structures have allowed a detailed comparison of the conformational differences between the three they show that the structural basis of the lower affinity for heparin of  antithrombin over  antithrombin is due to the conformational change that occurs upon heparin binding being sterically hindered by the presence of the additional bulky carbohydrate at asn
