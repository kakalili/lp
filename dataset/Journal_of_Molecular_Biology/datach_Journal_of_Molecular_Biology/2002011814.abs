active site structure and stereospecificity of escherichia coli pyridoxine   phosphate oxidase edited by r huben
pyridoxine   phosphate oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of either the c   alcohol group or amino group of the two substrates pyridoxine   phosphate and pyridoxamine   phosphate to an aldehyde forming pyridoxal   phosphate a hydrogen atom is removed from c   during the oxidation and a pair of electrons is transferred to tightly bound fmn a new crystal form of the enzyme in complex with pyridoxal   phosphate shows that the n terminal segment of the protein folds over the active site to sequester the ligand from solvent during the catalytic cycle using   r  h pmp as substrate nearly    of the radiolabel appears in water after oxidation to pyridoxal   phosphate thus the enzyme is specific for removal of the pror hydrogen atom from the prochiral c   carbon atom of pyridoxamine   phosphate site mutants were made of all residues at the active site that interact with the oxygen atom or amine group on c   of the substrates other residues that make interactions with the phosphate moiety of the substrate were mutated the mutants showed a decrease in affinity but exhibited considerable catalytic activity showing that these residues are important for binding but play a lesser role in catalysis the exception is arg   which is important for both binding and catalysis the r  m mutant enzyme catalyzed removal of the pros hydrogen atom from   r  h pmp showing that the guanidinium side chain plays an important role in determining stereospecificity the crystal structure and the stereospecificity studies suggests that the pair of electrons on c   of the substrate are transferred to fmn as a hydride ion
