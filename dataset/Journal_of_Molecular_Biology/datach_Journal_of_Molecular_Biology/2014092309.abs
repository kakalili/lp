crystal structure of tir domain of tlr reveals novel dimeric interface of tir  tir interaction for toll like receptor signaling pathway
toll like receptors tlrs are responsible for recognition of particular pathogens during the innate immune response and cytoplasmic toll interleukin  receptor tir domain responsible for downstream signaling tlr working with tlr can detect bacterial lipoprotein leading signal for nuclear factor kappab activation for immune response to better understand tlr mediated signaling event in the innate immune system in this study we report the first crystal structure of the tir domain of tlr at    resolution our structure reveals novel homo dimerization interfaces which might be a critical for the interaction with tir containing adaptor proteins and itself we also report structural similarities and differences of tlr with those of other tir domains which may be functionally relevant
