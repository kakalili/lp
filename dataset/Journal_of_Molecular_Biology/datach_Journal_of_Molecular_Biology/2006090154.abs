the myosin filament superlattice in the flight muscles of flies a band lattice optimisation for stretch activation
low angle x ray diffraction patterns from relaxed fruitfly drosophila flight muscle recorded on the biocat beamline at the argonne advanced photon source aps show many features similar to such patterns from the  classic  insect flight muscle in lethocerus the giant water bug but there is a characteristically different pattern of sampling of the myosin filament layer lines which indicates the presence of a superlattice of myosin filaments in the drosophila a band we show from analysis of the structure factor for this lattice that the sampling pattern is exactly as expected if adjacent four stranded myosin filaments of repeat   nm are axially shifted in the hexagonal a band lattice by one third of the    nm axial spacing between crowns of myosin heads in addition electron micrographs of drosophila and other flies e g the house fly musca and the flesh fly sarcophaga  combined with image processing confirm that the same a band superlattice occurs in all of these flies it may be a general property of the diptera the different a band organisation in flies compared with lethocerus which operates at a much lower wing beat frequency     hz and requires a warm up period may be a way of optimising the myosin and actin filament geometry needed both for stretch activation at the higher wing beat frequencies   hz to    hz of flies and their need for a rapid escape response
