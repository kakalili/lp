solution structure of a dna duplex containing  hydroxy   deoxyguanosine opposite deoxyguanosine
deoxyguanosine residues are hydroxylated by reactive oxygen species at the c  position to form  hydroxy   deoxyguanosine  og  one of the most important mutagenic lesions in dna though the spontaneous g c to c g transversions are rare events the pathways leading to this mutation are not established an  og g mispair if not corrected by dna repair enzymes could lead to g c to c g transversions nmr spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations are used to refine the solution structure of the base mismatch formed by the  og g pair on a self complementary dna dodecamer duplex d cgcgaatt oggcg  the results reveal that the  og base is inserted into the helix and forms hoogsteen base pairing with the g on the opposite strand the  og g base pairs are seen to be stabilized by two hydrogen bonding interactions one between the h of the  og and the o of the g and a three center hydrogen bonding between the o of the  og and the imino and amino protons of the g the  og g base pairs are very well stacked between the watson  crick base paired flanking bases both strands of the dna duplex adopt right handed conformations all of the unmodified bases including the g at the lesion site adopt anti glycosidic torsion angles and form watson  crick base pairs at the lesion site the  og residues adopt syn conformations the structural studies demonstrate that  og syn g anti forms a stable pair in the interior of the duplex providing a basis for the in vivo incorporation of g opposite  og calculated helical parameters and backbone torsional angles and the observed  p chemical shifts indicate that the structure of the duplex is perturbed near lesion sites with the local unwinding of the double helix the melting temperature of the  og g containing duplex is only  deg c less than the tm of the unmodified duplex
