The pore-forming domain of colicin A (pfColA) fused to a prokaryotic signal peptide (sp-pfColA) is transported across and inserts into the inner membrane of Escherichia coli from the periplasmic side and forms a functional channel. The soluble structure of pfColA consists of a ten-helix bundle containing a hydrophobic helical hairpin. Here, we generated a series of mutants in which an increasing number of sp-pfColA α-helices was deleted. These peptides were tested for their ability to form ion channels in vivo and in vitro. We found that the shortest sp-pfColA mutant protein that killed Escherichia coli was composed of the five last α-helices of sp-pfColA, whereas the shortest peptide that formed a channel in planar lipid bilayer membranes similar to that of intact pfColA was the protein composed of the last six α-helices. The peptide composed of the last five α-helices of pfColA generated a voltage-independent conductance in planar lipid bilayer with properties very different from that of intact pfColA. Thus, helices 1 to 4 are unnecessary for channel formation, while helix 5, or some part of it, is important but not absolutely necessary. Voltage-dependence of colicin is evidently controlled by the first four α-helices of pfColA.
