sequence context at human single nucleotide polymorphisms overrepresentation of cpg dinucleotide at polymorphic sites and suppression of variation in cpg islands
human polymorphisms originate as mutations and the influence of context on mutagenesis should be reflected in the distribution of sequences surrounding single nucleotide polymorphisms snps  we have performed a computational survey of nearly two million human snps to determine if sequence dependent hotspots for polymorphism exist in the human genome here we show that sequences containing cpg dinucleotides which occur at low frequencies in the human genome are   fold more abundant at polymorphic sites than expected in contrast polymorphisms in cpg sequences located within cpg islands important regulatory regions that modulate gene expression are   fold less prevalent than expected the distribution of polymorphic alleles at cpgs in cpg islands is also significantly different from that in non island regions these data strongly support a role for  methylcytosine deamination in the generation of human variation and suggest that variation at cpgs in islands is suppressed
