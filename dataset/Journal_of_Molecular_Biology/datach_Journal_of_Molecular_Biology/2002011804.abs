protein folding and stability of human cdk inhibitor p ink d edited by p e wright
p ink d is a tumor suppressing protein and belongs to a family of cyclin d dependent kinase inhibitors of cdk and cdk  which play a key role in human cell cycle control p  comprises ten  helices arranged sequentially in five ankyrin repeats forming an elongated structure this rather simple topology combined with its physiological function makes p  an interesting model protein for folding studies urea induced unfolding transitions monitored by far uv cd and phenylalanine fluorescence coincide and suggest a two state mechanism for equilibrium unfolding unfolding of p  followed by d h  n hsqc spectra revealed a third species at moderate urea concentrations with a maximum population of about   near   m urea it shows poor chemical shift dispersion but cross peaks emerge for some residues that are distinct from the native or unfolded state this equilibrium intermediate either arises only at high protein concentrations as in the nmr experiment or has similar optical properties to the unfolded state stopped flow far uv cd experiments at various urea concentrations revealed that  helical structure is formed in three phases of which only the fastest phase   s   depends upon the urea concentration the kinetic of the slowest phase    s   can be resolved by d real time nmr and accelerated by cyclophilin it is limited in rate by prolyl isomerization and native like ordered structure cannot form prior to this isomerization the two fast phases lead to   native protein within the dead time of the nmr experiment in contrast to p ink a which exhibits only a marginal stability and high unfolding rates p  shows the expected stability for a protein of this size with a clear kinetic barrier between the unfolded and folded state therefore p  might complement the function of less stable ink inhibitors in cell cycle control under unfavorable conditions
