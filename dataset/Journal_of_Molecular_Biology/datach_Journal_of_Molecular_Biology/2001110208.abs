kinetic and crystallographic analyses support a sequential ordered bi bi catalytic mechanism for escherichia coli glucose  phosphate thymidylyltransferase edited by r huber
glucose  phosphate thymidylyltransferase is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of dtdp l rhamnose the precursor of l rhamnose an essential component of surface antigens such as the o lipopolysaccharide mediating virulence and adhesion to host tissues in many microorganisms the enzyme catalyses the formation of dtdp glucose from dttp and glucose  phosphate as well as its pyrophosphorolysis to shed more light on the catalytic properties of glucose  phosphate thymidylyltransferase from escherichia coli specifically distinguishing between ping pong and sequential ordered bi bi reaction mechanisms the enzyme kinetic properties have been analysed in the presence of different substrates and inhibitors moreover three different complexes of glucose  phosphate thymidylyltransferase co crystallized with dtdp with dtmp and glucose  phosphate with d thymidine and glucose  phosphate have been analysed by x ray crystallography in the      resolution range r factors of        the homotetrameric enzyme shows strongly conserved substrate inhibitor binding modes in a surface cavity next to the topological switch point of a quasi rossmann fold inspection of the subunit tertiary structure reveals relationships to other enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars including distant proteins such as the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein moba the precise location of the substrate relative to putative reactive residues in the catalytic center suggests that in keeping with the results of the kinetic measurements both catalysed reactions i e dtdp glucose biosynthesis and pyrophosphorolysis follow a sequential ordered bi bi catalytic mechanism
