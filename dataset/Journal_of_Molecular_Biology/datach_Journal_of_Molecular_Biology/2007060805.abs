paxillin and ponsin interact in nascent costameres of muscle cells
muscle differentiation requires the transition from motile myoblasts to sessile myotubes and the assembly of a highly regular contractile apparatus this striking cytoskeletal remodelling is coordinated with a transformation of focal adhesion like cell  matrix contacts into costameres to assess mechanisms underlying this differentiation process we searched for muscle specific binding partners of paxillin we identified an interaction of paxillin with the vinexin adaptor protein family member ponsin in nascent costameres during muscle differentiation which is mediated by an interaction of the second src homology domain  sh  domain of ponsin with the proline rich region of paxillin to understand the molecular basis of this interaction we determined the structure of this sh domain at     resolution as well as its complex with the paxillin binding peptide at     resolution upon binding the paxillin peptide adopts a polyproline ii helix conformation in the complex contrary to the charged sh binding interface the peptide contains only non polar residues and for the first time such an interaction was observed structurally in sh domains fluorescence titration confirmed the ponsin paxillin interaction characterising it further by a weak binding affinity transfection experiments revealed further characteristics of ponsin functions in muscle cells all three sh domains in the c terminus of ponsin appeared to synergise in targeting the protein to force transducing structures the overexpression of ponsin resulted in altered muscle cell  matrix contact morphology suggesting its involvement in the establishment of mature costameres further evidence for the role of ponsin in the maintenance of mature mechanotransduction sites in cardiomyocytes comes from the observation that ponsin expression was down regulated in end stage failing hearts and that this effect was reverted upon mechanical unloading these results provide new insights in how low affinity protein  protein interactions may contribute to a fine tuning of cytoskeletal remodelling processes during muscle differentiation and in adult cardiomyocytes
