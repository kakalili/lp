direct determination of protonation states of histidine residues in a    neutron structure of deoxy human normal adult hemoglobin and implications for the bohr effect
we have investigated the protonation states of histidine residues potential bohr groups in the deoxy form t state of human hemoglobin by direct determination of hydrogen deuterium positions with the neutron protein crystallography technique the reversible binding of protons is key to the allosteric regulation of human hemoglobin the protonation states of  of the  his residues were directly determined from neutron scattering omit maps with  of the remaining residues being disordered protonation states of  equivalent his residues   his   his   his   his   and  his   differ between the symmetry related globin subunits the distal his residues  his  and  his  are protonated in the    heterodimer and are neutral in     buried residue  his  is found to be protonated in both subunits these distal and buried residues have the potential to act as bohr groups the observed protonation states of his residues are compared to changes in their pka values during the transition from the t to the r state and the results provide some new insights into our understanding of the molecular mechanism of the bohr effect
