thermodynamic and kinetic exploration of the energy landscape of borrelia burgdorferi ospa by native state hydrogen exchange
we report a native state hydrogen exchange hx method to simultaneously obtain both thermodynamic and kinetic information on the formation of multiple excited states in a folding energy landscape our method exploits the inherent dispersion and ph dependence of the intrinsic hx rates to cover both the ex  thermodynamic and ex  kinetic regimes at each concentration of denaturant hx measurements are performed over a range of ph values using this strategy we dissected borrelia burgdorferi ospa a predominantly  sheet protein containing a unique single layer  sheet into five cooperative units and postulated excited states predominantly responsible for hx more importantly we determined the interconversion rates between these excited states and the native state the use of both thermodynamic and kinetic information from native state hx enabled us to construct a folding landscape of this  kda protein including local minima and maxima and to discriminate on pathway and off pathway intermediates this method which we term ex ex hx should be a powerful tool for characterizing the complex folding mechanisms exhibited by the majority of proteins
