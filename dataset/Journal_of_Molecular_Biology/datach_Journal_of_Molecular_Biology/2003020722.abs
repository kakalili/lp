sequence and structure patterns in proteins from an analysis of the shortest helices implications for helix nucleation
the shortest helices three length   and four length   most abundant among helices of different lengths have been analyzed from a database of protein structures a characteristic feature of three length   helices is the shifted backbone conformation for the c terminal residue    angles        compared to the rest of the helix          the deviation can be attributed to the release of electrostatic repulsion between the carbonyl oxygen atoms at the two c terminal residues and further stabilization due to a more linear geometry of an intrahelical hydrogen bond a consequence of this non canonical c terminal backbone conformation can be a potential origin of helix kinks when a   helix is sequence contiguous at the  helix n terminal an analysis of hydrogen bonding as well as hydrophobic interactions in the shortest helices shows that capping interactions some of them not observed for longer helices dominate at the n termini further consideration of the distribution of amino acid residues indicates that the shortest helices resemble the n terminal end of  helices rather than the c terminus implying that the folding of helices may be initiated at the n terminal end which does not get propagated in the case of the shortest helices finally pairwise comparison of  turns and the shortest helices based on correlation matrices of site specific amino acid composition and the relative abundance of these short secondary structural elements leads to a helix nucleation scheme that considers the formation of an isolated  turn and not an  turn as the helix nucleation step with shortest   helices as intermediates between the shortest  helix and the  turn our results ascribe an important role played by shortest   helices in proteins with important structural and folding implications
