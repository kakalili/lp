hiv  nucleocapsid protein zinc finger structures induce trnalys  structural changes but are not critical for primer template annealing edited by m f summers
retroviral reverse transcriptases use host cellular trnas as primers to initiate reverse transcription in the case of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   the     nucleotides of human trnalys  are annealed to a complementary sequence on the rna genome known as the primer binding site pbs  the hiv  nucleocapsid protein nc facilitates this annealing to understand the structural changes that are induced upon nc binding to the trna alone we employed a chemical probing method using the lanthanide metal terbium at low concentrations of nc the strong terbium cleavage observed in the core region of the trna is significantly attenuated thus nc binding first results in disruption of the trna  s metal binding pockets including those that stabilize the d t c tertiary interaction when nc concentrations approach the amount needed for complete primer template annealing nc further destabilizes the trna acceptor t c stem minihelix as evidenced by increased terbium cleavage in this domain a mutant form of nc sshs nc  which lacks the zinc finger structures is able to anneal trnalys  efficiently to the pbs and to destabilize the trna tertiary core albeit less effectively than wild type nc this mutant form of nc does not affect cleavage significantly in the helical regions even when bound at high concentrations these results as well as experiments conducted in the presence of polylys suggest that in the absence of the zinc finger structures nc acts as a polycation neutralizing the highly negative phosphodiester backbone the presence of an effective multivalent cationic peptide is sufficient for efficient trna primer annealing to the pbs
