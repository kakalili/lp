structural studies of ff domains of the transcription factor ca  provide insights into the organization of ff domain tandem arrays
ff domains are poorly understood protein interaction modules that are present within eukaryotic transcription factors such as ca   tcerg   the ca  ff domains have been shown to mediate interactions with the phosphorylated c terminal domain of rna polymerase ii phosphoctd and a multitude of transcription factors and rna processing proteins and may therefore have a central role in organizing transcription ff domains occur in tandem arrays of up to six domains although it is not known whether they adopt higher order structures we have used the ca  ff ff domains as a model system to examine whether tandem ff domains form higher order structures in solution using nmr spectroscopy in the solution structure of ff fused to the linker that joins ff to ff  we observed that the highly conserved linker peptide is ordered and forms a helical extension of helix   suggesting that the interdomain linker might have a role in orientating ff relative to ff  however examination of the ff ff domains using relaxation nmr experiments revealed that although these domains are not rigidly orientated relative to one another they do not tumble independently thus the ff ff structure conforms to a dumbbell shape in solution where the helical interdomain linker maintains distance between the two dynamic ff domains without cementing their relative orientations this model for ff domain organization within tandem arrays suggests a general mechanism by which individual ff domains can manoeuvre to achieve optimal recognition of flexible binding partners such as the intrinsically disordered phosphoctd
