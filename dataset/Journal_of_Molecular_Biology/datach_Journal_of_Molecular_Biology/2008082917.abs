replication forks blocked by protein  dna complexes have limited stability in vitro
there are many barriers that replication forks must overcome in order to duplicate a genome in vivo these barriers include damage to the template dna and proteins bound to this template if replication is halted by such a block then the block must be either removed or bypassed for replication to continue if continuation of replication employs the original fork avoiding the need to reload the replication apparatus then the blocked replisome must retain functionality in vivo studies of escherichia coli replication forks suggest that replication forks blocked by protein  dna complexes retain the ability to resume replication upon removal of the block for several hours here we tested the functional stability of replication forks reconstituted in vitro and blocked by lac repressor  operator complexes once a fork comes to a halt at such a block it cannot continue subsequently to translocate through the block until addition of iptg induces repressor dissociation however the ability to resume replication is retained only for    min regardless of the topological state of the template dna comparison of our in vitro data with previous in vivo data suggests that either accessory factors that stabilise blocked forks are present in vivo or the apparent stability of blocked forks in vivo is due to continual reloading of the replication apparatus at the site of the block
