the runx runt domain at    resolution a structural switch and specifically bound chloride ions modulate dna binding
the evolutionarily conserved runt homology domain is characteristic of the runx family of heterodimeric eukaryotic transcription factors including runx  runx and runx  the genes for runx  also termed acute myeloid leukemia protein  aml  and its dimerization partner core binding factor   cbf  are essential for hematopoietic development and are together the most common targets for gene rearrangements in acute human leukemias here we describe the crystal structure of the uncomplexed runx runt domain at    resolution and compare its conformation to previously published structures in complex with dna cbf  or both we find that complex formation induces significant structural rearrangements in this immunoglobulin ig like dna binding domain most pronounced is the movement of loop l  which changes from a closed conformation in the free runt structure to an open conformation in the cbf  bound and dna bound forms this transition which we refer to as the s switch and accompanying structural movements that affect other parts of the runt domain are crucial for sustained dna binding the closed to open transition can be induced by cbf  alone suggesting that one role of cbf  is to trigger the s switch and to stabilize the runt domain in a conformation enhanced for dna binding a feature of the runt domain hitherto unobserved in any ig like dna binding domain is the presence of two specifically bound chloride ions one chloride ion is coordinated by amino acid residues that make direct dna contact in a series of electrophoretic mobility shift analyses we demonstrate a chloride ion concentration dependent stimulation of the dna binding activity of runt in the physiological range a comparable dna binding stimulation was observed for negatively charged amino acid residues this suggests a regulatory mechanism of runx proteins through acidic amino acid residues provided by activation domains during cooperative interaction with other transcription factors
