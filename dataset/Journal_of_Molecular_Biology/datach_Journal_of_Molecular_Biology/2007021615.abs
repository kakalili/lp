point mutations in the hiv  matrix protein turn off the myristyl switch
during the late phase of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  replication newly synthesized retroviral gag proteins are targeted to lipid raft regions of specific cellular membranes where they assemble and bud to form new virus particles gag binds preferentially to the plasma membrane pm of most hematopoietic cell types a process mediated by interactions between the cellular pm marker phosphatidylinositol    bisphosphate pi   p  and gag s n terminally myristoylated matrix ma domain we recently demonstrated that pi   p binds to a conserved cleft on ma and promotes myristate exposure suggesting a role as both a direct membrane anchor and myristyl switch trigger here we show that pi   p is also capable of binding to ma proteins containing point mutations that inhibit membrane binding in vitro and in vivo including v r l a and l i however these mutants do not exhibit pi   p or concentration dependent myristate exposure nmr studies of v r and l a ma reveal minor structural changes that appear to be responsible for stabilizing the myristate sequestered myr s  species and inhibiting exposure unexpectedly the myristyl group of a revertant mutant with normal pm targeting properties v r l k is also tightly sequestered and insensitive to pi   p binding this mutant binds pi   p with twofold higher affinity compared with the native protein suggesting a potential compensatory mechanism for membrane binding
