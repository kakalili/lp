antisense rna mediated transcriptional attenuation importance of a u turn loop structure in the target rna of plasmid pip  for efficient inhibition by the antisense rna
antisense rna mediated gene regulation has been found and studied in detail mainly in prokaryotic accessory dna elements in spite of different regulatory mechanisms in all cases a rapid interaction between antisense and target rna has been shown to be crucial for efficient regulation recently a sequence comparison revealed in  antisense rna control systems a   yunr motif indicative for the formation of a u turn structure in either an antisense or a target rna loop and confirmed in the case of the hok sok system of plasmid r its importance for regulation here we demonstrate the importance of the   yunr motif in the target rna rnaii loop l of the replication control system of plasmid pip   the effect of four individual mutations in l was studied in vivo and in vitro mutations that maintained the putative u turn or swapped it from sense to antisense rna were silent whereas mutations that eliminated the   yunr motif showed two to threefold elevated copy numbers in vivo in correlation with three to fourfold reduced inhibition rate constants of the complementary rnaiii species in vitro whereas the half lives of all rnaiii species were not affected enu probing experiments confirmed the u turn structure for the silent mutation n c and disruption of this structure upon alteration of the invariant u or inversion of the yunr motif containing loop rna secondary structure probing excluded loop size alterations as a reason for altered inhibition rates implications for the pathway and efficiency of rnaii rnaiii interaction and hence pip  copy number control are discussed
