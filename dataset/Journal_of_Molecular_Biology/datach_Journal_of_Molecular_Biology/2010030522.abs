conformational dynamics and structural plasticity play critical roles in the ubiquitin recognition of a uim domain
ubiquitin interacting motifs uims are an important class of protein domains that interact with ubiquitin or ubiquitin like proteins these approximately  residue long domains are found in a variety of ubiquitin receptor proteins and serve as recognition modules towards intracellular targets which may be individual ubiquitin subunits or polyubiquitin chains attached to a variety of proteins previous structural studies of interactions between uims and ubiquitin have shown that uims adopt an extended structure of a single  helix containing a hydrophobic surface with a conserved sequence pattern that interacts with key hydrophobic residues on ubiquitin in light of this large body of structural studies details regarding the presence and the roles of structural dynamics and plasticity are surprisingly lacking in order to better understand the structural basis of ubiquitin  uim recognition we have characterized changes in the structure and dynamics of ubiquitin upon binding of a uim domain from the yeast vps  protein the solution structure of a ubiquitin  uim fusion protein designed to study these interactions is reported here and found to consist of a well defined ubiquitin core and a bipartite uim helix moreover we have studied the plasticity of the docking interface as well as global changes in ubiquitin due to uim binding at the picoseconds to nanoseconds and microseconds to milliseconds protein motions by nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation changes in generalized order parameters of amide groups show a distinct trend towards increased structural rigidity at the uim  ubiquitin interface relative to values determined in unbound ubiquitin analysis of  n carr  purcell  meiboom  gill relaxation dispersion measurements suggests the presence of two types of motions one directly related to the uim binding interface and the other induced to distal parts of the protein this study demonstrates a case where localized interactions among protein domains have global effects on protein motions at timescales ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds
