a distal high affinity binding site on the cyclin cdk substrate pho is important for its phosphorylation and regulation
cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases cdks are key components of signaling pathways essential for cell growth and survival the cyclin cdk pho  pho  inactivates the transcription factor pho in budding yeast by phosphorylating it on five sites we isolated seven single amino acid substitutions outside of the phosphorylation sites that cause pho to be constitutively active the substitutions decrease the amount of pho phosphorylation in vivo and they increase the apparent km of the in vitro phosphorylation reaction by an order of magnitude but do not alter kcat substantially these data suggest that the substituted residues are part of a cyclin cdk binding site that is distal to the phosphorylation sites further analysis revealed that all of pho variants were phosphorylated by pho  pho  in a more distributive manner than the wild type protein further supporting the idea that binding at a distal high affinity binding site is important in determining the processivity of pho phosphorylation in addition computational modeling of the pho phosphorylation reactions shows that the kd of binding between the pho mutants and pho  pho  increases confirming that the mutations are located in a relatively high affinity  docking site  for the kinase interestingly the kd derived from the in vitro data correlates well with the strength of the in vivo phenotypes demonstrating that the in vitro data are relevant to the in vivo regulation of pho
