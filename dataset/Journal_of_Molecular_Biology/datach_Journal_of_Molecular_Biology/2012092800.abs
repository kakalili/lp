dynamic association of bam complex modules includes surface exposure of the lipoprotein bamc
the   barrel assembly machinery bam complex drives the assembly of  barrel proteins into the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria it is composed of five subunits bama bamb bamc bamd and bame we find that the bam complex isolated from the outer membrane of escherichia coli consists of a core complex of bama b c d e and in addition a bama b module and a bamc d module in the absence of bamc these modules are destabilized resulting in increased protease susceptibility of bamd and bamb while the n terminus of bamc carries a highly conserved region crucial for stable interaction with bamd immunofluorescence immunoprecipitation and protease sensitivity assays show that the c terminal domain of bamc composed of two helix grip motifs is exposed on the surface of e coli this unexpected topology of a bacterial lipoprotein is reminiscent of the analogous protein subunits from the mitochondrial  barrel insertion machinery the sam complex the modular arrangement and topological features provide new insight into the architecture of the bam complex towards a better understanding of the mechanism driving  barrel membrane protein assembly
