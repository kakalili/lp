non stressful death of  s rrna mutant g  c defective in puromycin reaction
catalysis of peptide bond formation in the peptidyl transferase center is a major enzymatic activity of the ribosome mutations limiting peptidyl transferase activity are mostly lethal however cellular processes triggered by peptidyl transferase deficiency in the bacterial cell are largely unknown here we report a study of the lethal g  c mutant of escherichia coli  s ribosomal rna rrna  the g  c mutation completely impaired the puromycin reaction and abolished formation of the active firefly luciferase in an in vitro translation system while poly u  and short synthetic mrna directed peptidyl transferase reaction with aminoacylated trnas in vitro was seemingly unaffected study of the cellular proteome upon expression of the  s rrna gene carrying the g  c mutation compared to cells expressing wild type  s rrna gene revealed substantial differences most of the observed effects in the mutant were associated with reduced expression of stress response proteins and particularly proteins associated with the ppgpp mediated stringent response
