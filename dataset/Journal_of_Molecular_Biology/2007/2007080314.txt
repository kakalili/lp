Transcriptional silencing of Pol II-transcribed genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae occurs at the HM loci, telomeres and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus. Gene silencing at these loci requires histone-modifying enzymes as well as factors that regulate local chromatin structure. Previous work has shown that the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling protein Isw1 is required for silencing of a marker gene inserted at the HMR locus, but not at telomeres. Here we show that Isw1 is required for transcriptional silencing of Pol II-transcribed genes in the ribosomal DNA locus. Our results indicate that Isw1 associates with the rDNA and that this interaction is not altered in cells lacking other members of the Isw1a and Isw1b chromatin remodeling complexes. Further, the association of Isw1 with the rDNA is not altered in cells lacking the histone deacetylase Sir2 or the histone methyltransferase Set1, two factors that are required for gene silencing at the rDNA. Notably, the loss of transcriptional silencing at the rDNA in cells lacking Isw1 is correlated with a change in rDNA chromatin structure. Together, our data support a model in which Isw1 acts independently of the previously characterized Isw1a and Isw1b complexes to maintain a heterochromatin-like structure at the rDNA that is required for gene silencing.
