crystal structure of the non regulatory a isoform of spinach chloroplast glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase complexed with nadp edited by r huber
here we report the first crystal structure of a photosynthetic glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh complexed with nadp the enzyme purified from spinach chloroplasts is constituted of a single type of subunit a arranged in homotetramers it shows non regulated nadp dependent and nad dependent activities with a preference for nadp the structure has been solved to    resolution by molecular replacement the crystals belong to space group c  with three monomers in the asymmetric unit one of the three monomers generates a tetramer using the space group   point symmetry and a very similar tetramer is generated by the other two monomers related by a non crystallographic symmetry using a crystallographic  fold axis the protein reveals a large structural homology with known gapdhs both in the cofactor binding domain and in regions of the catalytic domain like all other gapdhs investigated so far the a gapdh belongs to the rossmann fold family of dehydrogenases however unlike most dehydrogenases of this family the adenosine   phosphate group of nadp does not form a salt bridge with any positively charged residue in its surroundings being instead set in place by hydrogen bonds with a threonine residue belonging to the rossmann fold and a serine residue located in the s loop of a symmetry related monomer while increasing our knowledge of an important photosynthetic enzyme these results contribute to a general understanding of nadp versus nad recognition in pyridine nucleotide dependent enzymes although the overall structure of a gapdh is similar to that of the cytosolic gapdh from bacteria and eukaryotes the chloroplast tetramer is peculiar in that it can actually be considered a dimer of dimers since monomers are bound in pairs by a disulphide bridge formed across cys  residues this bridge is not found in other cytosolic or chloroplast gapdhs from animals bacteria or plants other than spinach
