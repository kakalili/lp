structural basis of allosteric regulation and substrate specificity of the non phosphorylating glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase from thermoproteus tenax
the non phosphorylating glyceraldehyde  phosphate dehydrogenase gapn of the hyperthermophilic archaeum thermoproteus tenax is a member of the superfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenases aldh  gapn catalyses the irreversible oxidation of glyceraldehyde  phosphate gap to  phosphoglycerate in the modified glycolytic pathway of this organism in contrast to other members of the aldh superfamily gapn from t tenax tt gapn is regulated by a number of intermediates and metabolites in the nad dependent oxidation of gap glucose  phosphate fructose  phosphate amp and adp increase the affinity for the cosubstrate whereas atp nadp nadph and nadh decrease it leaving however the catalytic rate virtually unaltered as we show here the enzyme also uses nadp as a cosubstrate displaying however unusual discontinuous saturation kinetics indicating different cosubstrate affinities and or reactivities of the four active sites of the protein tetramer caused by cooperative effects furthermore in the nadp dependent reaction the presence of activators decreases the overall s  and increases vmax by a factor of  to explore the structural basis for the different effects of both pyridine nucleotides we solved the crystal structure of tt gapn in complex with nad at    resolution and compared it to the binary tt gapn  nadph structure although both pyridine nucleotides show a similar binding mode nadph appears to be more tightly bound to the protein via the   phosphate moiety moreover we present four co crystal structures with the activating molecules glucose  phosphate fructose  phosphate amp and adp determined at resolutions ranging from    to    these crystal structures reveal a common regulatory site able to accommodate the different activators a phosphate binding pocket serves as an anchor point ensuring similar binding geometry the observed conformational changes upon activator binding are discussed in terms of allosteric regulation furthermore we present a crystal structure of tt gapn in complex with the substrate d gap at    resolution which allows us to analyse the structural basis for substrate binding the mechanism of catalysis as well as the stereoselectivity of the enzymatic reaction
