insights into the origin of the tendency of the pi sh domain to form amyloid fibrils
the sh domain of the p   subunit of phosphatidylinositol  kinase has been found to form amyloid fibrils in vitro under acidic conditions pi sh is peculiar due to a large insertion of  amino acid residues in the n src loop when compared with more canonical members of the family spectrin sh  spc sh  with a shorter loop does not form fibrils under any of our conditions tested thus it could be that the longer loop could play a role in amyloid formation to investigate this we have engineered two chimeras containing the common core of the pi sh and spc sh with an exchanged n src loop thermodynamic and kinetic analyses show that the two chimeras are less stable than the parent proteins but useful for our comparative purposes they have similar stability neither stability nor folding rates or ph transition can be invoked as being responsible for the amyloid formation in the pi sh domain substitution of the long n src loop in pi sh by that of spc sh does not prevent fibril formation the spc sh with the pi sh n src loop is in an a state at low ph and forms  sheet amorphous aggregates but not amyloid fibrils thus we conclude that for a protein to form ordered fibrils a delicate balance between solubility of non native states to allow efficient nucleation and the formation of amorphous aggregates must be achieved it is the amino acid residue sequence of the protein and probably its parts that play a determinant role in shifting this balance in one direction or the other
