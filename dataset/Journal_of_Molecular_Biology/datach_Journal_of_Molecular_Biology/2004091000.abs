evidence for lipid packaging in the crystal structure of the gm activator complex with platelet activating factor
gm activator protein gm ap is a lipid transfer protein that has the ability to stimulate the enzymatic processing of gangliosides as well as t cell activation through lipid presentation our previous x ray crystallographic studies of gm ap have revealed a large lipid binding pocket as the central overall feature of the structure with non protein electron density within this pocket suggesting bound lipid to extend these studies we present here the   crystal structure of gm ap complexed with platelet activating factor paf  paf is a potent phosphoacylglycerol whose toxic patho physiological effects can be inhibited by gm ap the structure shows an ordered arrangement of two bound lipids and a fatty acid molecule one paf molecule binds in an extended conformation within the hydrophobic channel that has an open and closed conformation and was seen to contain bound phospholipid in the low ph apo structure the second molecule is submerged inside the pocket in a u shaped conformation with its head group near the single polar residue s   it was refined as lyso paf as it lacks electron density for the sn  acetate group the alkyl chains of paf interact through van der waals contacts while the head groups bind in different environments with their phosphocholine moieties in contact with aromatic rings y   f   the structure has revealed further insights into the lipid binding properties of gm ap suggesting an unexpected unique mode of lipid packaging that may explain the efficiency of gm ap in inhibiting the detrimental biological effects of paf
