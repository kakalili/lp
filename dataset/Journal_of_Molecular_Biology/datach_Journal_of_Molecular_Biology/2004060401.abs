a hidden markov model derived structural alphabet for proteins
understanding and predicting protein structures depends on the complexity and the accuracy of the models used to represent them we have set up a hidden markov model that discretizes protein backbone conformation as series of overlapping fragments states of four residues length this approach learns simultaneously the geometry of the states and their connections we obtain using a statistical criterion an optimal systematic decomposition of the conformational variability of the protein peptidic chain in  states with strong connection logic this result is stable over different protein sets our model fits well the previous knowledge related to protein architecture organisation and seems able to grab some subtle details of protein organisation such as helix sub level organisation schemes taking into account the dependence between the states results in a description of local protein structure of low complexity on an average the model makes use of only   states among  to describe each position of a protein structure although we use short fragments the learning process on entire protein conformations captures the logic of the assembly on a larger scale using such a model the structure of proteins can be reconstructed with an average accuracy close to    root mean square deviation and for a complexity of only  finally we also observe that sequence specificity increases with the number of states of the structural alphabet such models can constitute a very relevant approach to the analysis of protein architecture in particular for protein structure prediction
