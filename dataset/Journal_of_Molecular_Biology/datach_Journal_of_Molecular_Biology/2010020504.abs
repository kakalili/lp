molecular mechanisms of rhodopsin retinitis pigmentosa and the efficacy of pharmacological rescue
variants of rhodopsin a complex of  cis retinal and opsin cause retinitis pigmentosa rp  a degenerative disease of the retina trafficking defects due to rhodopsin misfolding have been proposed as the most likely basis of the disease but other potentially overlapping mechanisms may also apply pharmacological therapies for rp must target the major disease mechanism and contend with overlap if it occurs to this end we have explored the molecular basis of rhodopsin rp in the context of pharmacological rescue with  cis retinal stable inducible cell lines were constructed to express wild type opsin the pathogenic variants t r t m p a p h p l and c  y or the nonpathogenic variants f  l and a  s pharmacological rescue was measured as the fold increase in rhodopsin or opsin levels upon addition of  cis retinal during opsin expression only pro  and t m variants were rescued significantly c  y opsin was produced at low levels and did not yield rhodopsin whereas the t r f  l and a  s proteins reached near wild type levels and changed little with  cis retinal all of the mutant rhodopsins exhibited misfolding which increased over a broad range in the order f  l a  s t r t m p a p h p l as determined by decreased thermal stability in the dark and increased hydroxylamine sensitivity pharmacological rescue increased as misfolding decreased but was limited for the least misfolded variants significantly pathogenic variants also showed abnormal photobleaching behavior including an increased ratio of metarhodopsin i like species to metarhodopsin ii like species and aberrant photoproduct accumulation with prolonged illumination these results combined with an analysis of published biochemical and clinical studies suggest that many rhodopsin variants cause disease by affecting both biosynthesis and photoactivity we conclude that pharmacological rescue is promising as a broadly effective therapy for rhodopsin rp particularly if implemented in a way that minimizes the photoactivity of the mutant proteins
