only centromeres can supply the partition system required for ars function in the yeast yarrowia lipolytica
autonomously replicating sequences arss in the yeast yarrowia lipolytica require two components an origin of replication ori and centromere cen dna both of which are necessary for extrachromosomal maintenance to investigate this cooperation in more detail we performed a screen for genomic sequences able to confer high frequency of transformation to a plasmid borne ori our results confirm a cooperation between ori and cen sequences to form an ars since all sequences identified in this screen displayed features of centromeric dna and included the previously characterized cen   cen  and cen  fragments two new centromeric dnas were identified as they are unique map to different chromosomes ii and iv and induce chromosome breakage after genomic integration a third sequence which is adjacent to but distinct from the previously characterized cen  region was isolated from chromosome i although these cen sequences do not share significant sequence similarities they display a complex pattern of short repeats including conserved blocks of  to  bp and regions of dyad symmetry consistent with their a t richness and strong negative roll angle y lipolytica cen derived sequences but not oris were capable of binding isolated drosophila nuclear scaffolds however a drosophila scaffold attachment region that functions as an ars in other yeasts was unable to confer autonomous replication to an ori containing plasmid deletion analysis of cen  showed that the sequences responsible for the induction of chromosome breakage could be eliminated without compromising extrachromosomal maintenance we propose that while y lipolyticacen dna is essential for plasmid maintenance this function can be supplied by several sub fragments which together form the active chromosomal centromere this complex organization of y lipolytica centromeres is reminiscent of the regional structures described in the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe or in multicellular eukaryotes
