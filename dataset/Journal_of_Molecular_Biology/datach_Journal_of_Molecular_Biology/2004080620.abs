x ray and thermodynamic studies of staphylococcal nuclease variants i e and i k insights into polarity of the protein interior
we have used crystallography and thermodynamic analysis to study nuclease variants i e and i k in which an ionizable side chain is placed in the hydrophobic core of nuclease we find that the energetic cost of burying ionizable groups is rather modest the x ray determinations show water molecules solvating the buried glutamic acid under cryo conditions but not at room temperature the lysine side chain does not appear solvated in either case guanidine hydrochloride gnhcl denaturation of i e and i k done as a function of ph and monitored by tryptophan fluorescence showed that i e and i k are folded in the ph range ph      and ph      respectively the stability of the parental protein is independent of ph over a broad range in contrast the stabilities of i e and i k exhibit a ph dependence which is quantitatively explained by thermodynamic analysis the pka value of the buried k  is   while that of the buried e  is    the free energy difference between burying the uncharged and charged forms of the groups is modest about kcal mol we also found that  app for i k and i e is in the range       instead of    commonly used to represent the protein interior side chains  e and  k were uncharged under the conditions of the x ray experiment both are buried completely inside the well defined hydrophobic core of the variant proteins without forming salt bridges or hydrogen bonds to other functional groups of the proteins under cryo conditions  e shows a chain of four water molecules which hydrate one oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of the glutamic acid two other water molecules which are present in the wild type at all temperatures are also connected to the water ring observed inside the hydrophobic core the ready burial of water with an uncharged e  raises the possibility that solvent excursions into the interior also take place in the wild type protein but in a random dynamic way not detectable by crystallography such transient excursions could increase the average polarity and thus  app of the protein interior
