the structural bases of the processive degradation of  carrageenan a main cell wall polysaccharide of red algae
carrageenans are sulfated        galactans from the cell walls of red algae which auto associate into crystalline fibers made of aggregates of double stranded helices   carrageenases which constitute family  of glycoside hydrolases fold into a right handed  helix here the structure of alteromonas fortis  carrageenase bound to  carrageenan fragments was solved at    resolution pdb ktw  the enzyme holds a  carrageenan tetrasaccharide subsites  to   and a disaccharide subsites       thus providing the first direct determination of a d structure of  carrageenan electrostatic interactions between basic protein residues and the sulfate substituents of the polysaccharide chain dominate  carrageenan recognition glu  and asp  are the proton donor and the base catalyst respectively c terminal domain a which was highly flexible in the native enzyme structure adopts a    fold also found in dna rna binding domains in the substrate  enzyme complex this polyanion binding module shifts toward the  helix groove forming a tunnel thus from an open conformation which allows for the initial endo attack of  carrageenan chains the enzyme switches to a closed tunnel form consistent with its highly processive character as seen from the electron microscopy analysis of the degradation of  carrageenan fibers
