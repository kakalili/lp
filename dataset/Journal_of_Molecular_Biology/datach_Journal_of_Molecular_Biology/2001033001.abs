solution structure of a type i dockerin domain a novel prokaryotic extracellular calcium binding domain edited by p e wright
the type i dockerin domain is responsible for incorporating its associated glycosyl hydrolase into the bacterial cellulosome a multienzyme cellulolytic complex via its interaction with a receptor domain cohesin domain of the cellulosomal scaffolding subunit the highly conserved dockerin domain is characterized by two ca  binding sites with sequence similarity to the ef hand motif here we present the three dimensional solution structure of the  residue dockerin domain of clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase cels torsion angle dynamics calculations utilizing a total of   noe derived distance constraints and  torsion angle restraints yielded an ensemble of  structures with an average backbone r m s d for residues  to  and  to  of     from the mean structure the structure consists of two ca  binding loop helix motifs connected by a linker the e helices entering each loop of the classical ef hand motif are absent from the dockerin domain each dockerin ca  binding subdomain is stabilized by a cluster of buried hydrophobic side chains structural comparisons reveal that in its non complexed state the dockerin fold displays a dramatic departure from that of ca  bound ef hand domains a putative cohesin binding surface comprised of conserved hydrophobic and basic residues is proposed providing new insight into cellulosome assembly
