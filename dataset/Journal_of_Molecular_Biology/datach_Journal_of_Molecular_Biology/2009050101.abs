globins synthesize the second messenger bis        cyclic diguanosine monophosphate in bacteria
globin coupled sensors are heme binding signal transducers in bacteria and archaea in which an n terminal globin controls the activity of a variable c terminal domain here we report that bpegreg a globin coupled diguanylate cyclase from the whooping cough pathogen bordetella pertussis synthesizes the second messenger bis        cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c di gmp upon oxygen binding expression of bpegreg in salmonella typhimurium enhances biofilm formation while knockout of the bpegreg gene of b pertussis results in decreased biofilm formation these results represent the first identification a signal ligand for any diguanylate cyclase and provide definitive experimental evidence that a globin coupled sensor regulates c di gmp synthesis and biofilm formation we propose that the synthesis of c di gmp by globin sensors is a widespread phenomenon in bacteria
