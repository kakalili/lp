solution structure of escherichia coli glutaredoxin  shows similarity to mammalian glutathione s transferases edited by m f summers
glutaredoxin  grx  from escherichia coliis distinguished from other glutaredoxins by its larger size low overall sequence identity and lack of electron donor activity with ribonucleotide reductase however catalysis of glutathione gsh dependent general disulfide reduction by grx is extremely efficient the high resolution solution structure of e coli grx shows a two domain protein with residues  to  forming a classical  thioredoxin fold  glutaredoxin domain connected by an  residue linker to the highly helical c terminal domain residues  to   the active site cys pro  tyr  cys  is buried in the interface between the two domains but cys is solvent accessible consistent with its role in catalysis the structures reveal the hither to unknown fact that grx is structurally similar to glutathione s transferases gst  although there is no obvious sequence homology the similarity of these structures gives important insights into the functional significance of a new class of mammalian gst like proteins the single cysteine  class which have glutaredoxin oxidoreductase activity rather than gsh s transferase conjugating activity e coli grx  is structurally and functionally a member of this new expanding family of large glutaredoxins the primary function of grx as a gst like glutaredoxin is to catalyze reversible glutathionylation of proteins with gsh in cellular redox regulation including stress responses
