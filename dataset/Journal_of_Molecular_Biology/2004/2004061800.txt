N Oct-3, a neurospecific POU protein, homodimerizes in a non-cooperative fashion on the neuronal aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase gene promoter and generates heterodimers with HNF-3β. Several other neuronal gene promoters, the corticotropin releasing hormone and the aldolase C gene promoters also contain overlapping binding sites for N Oct-3 and HNF-3β.We have demonstrated that N Oct-3 presents a non-cooperative homodimerization on these two additional targets and can also give rise to heterodimers with HNF-3β. Surprisingly, despite the high degree of conservation of the respective POU subunits, the ubiquitous POU protein Oct-1 can only form monomers even in the presence of either N Oct-3 or HNF-3β on these DNA targets. Our data indicate that this difference is correlated with the specific ability of a portion of the N Oct-3 linker to fold as an α-helix, a property shared by class III POU proteins.These results suggest that this novel binding pattern permits the heterodimerization of N Oct-3 and HNF-3β on the neuronal promoters, which could be a key issue in the development of the nervous system and possibly tumors of neural origin.
