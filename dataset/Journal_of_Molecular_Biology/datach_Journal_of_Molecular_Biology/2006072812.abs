characterization of the functional domains of escherichia coli rnase ii
rnase ii is a single stranded specific   exoribonuclease that degrades rna generating   mononucleotides this enzyme is the prototype of an ubiquitous family of enzymes that are crucial in rna metabolism and share a similar domain organization by sequence prediction three different domains have been assigned to the escherichia coli rnase ii two rna binding domains at each end of the protein csd and s  and a central rnb catalytic domain in this work we have performed a functional characterization of these domains in order to address their role in the activity of rnase ii we have constructed a large set of rnase ii truncated proteins and compared them to the wild type regarding their exoribonucleolytic activity and rna binding ability the dissociation constants were determined using different single or double stranded substrates the results obtained revealed that s is the most important domain in the establishment of stable rna  protein complexes and its elimination results in a drastic reduction on rna binding ability in addition we also demonstrate that the n terminal csd plays a very specific role in rnase ii preventing a tight binding of the enzyme to single stranded poly a chains moreover the biochemical results obtained with rnb mutant that lacks both putative rna binding domains revealed the presence of an additional region involved in rna binding such region was identified by sequence analysis and secondary structure prediction as a third putative rna binding domain located at the n terminal part of rnb catalytic domain
