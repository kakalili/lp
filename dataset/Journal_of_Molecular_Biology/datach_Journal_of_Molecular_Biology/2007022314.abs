mybbp a is a novel repressor of nf  b
nf  b is an inducible transcription factor activated in many different cell types by inflammatory and stress signals the transcription of a wide variety of nf  b genes is regulated by the coordinated action of transcription co activators and co repressors previously we identified myb binding protein a mybbp a as an interaction partner of the transcription activation domain of rela p  mybbp a has been shown by others to regulate various transcription factors through largely unknown mechanisms here we present evidence that mybbp a is a novel co repressor of nf  b mybbp a interacted directly with rela p  and expression of mybbp a in cells repressed nf  b dependent reporter expression but did affect neither rela p  nuclear translocation nor its dna binding activity in vitro mybbp a inhibited transcription from chromatinized templates at a step before pre initiation complex formation mybbp a was found to compete with the histone acetyl transferase co activator p   for interaction with the transcription activation domain of rela p  expression levels of mybbp a are dependent on the cell type and are particularly high in jurkat t cells these results indicate that mybbp a is a novel nf  b co repressor of transcription that competes with p  and may function to regulate cell type specific genes
