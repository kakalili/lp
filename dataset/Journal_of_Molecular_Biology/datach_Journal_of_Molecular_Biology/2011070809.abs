conformational changes in bacteriophage p  scaffolding protein induced by interaction with coat protein
many prokaryotic and eukaryotic double stranded dna viruses use a scaffolding protein to assemble their capsid assembly of the double stranded dna bacteriophage p  procapsids requires the interaction of   molecules of coat protein and     molecules of scaffolding protein although the   amino acid scaffolding protein is essential for proper assembly of procapsids little is known about its structure beyond an nmr structure of the extreme c terminus which is known to interact with coat protein deletion mutagenesis indicates that other regions of scaffolding protein are involved in interactions with coat protein and other capsid proteins single cysteine and double cysteine variants of scaffolding protein were generated for use in fluorescence resonance energy transfer and cross linking experiments designed to probe the conformation of scaffolding protein in solution and within procapsids we showed that the n terminus and the c terminus are proximate in solution and that the middle of the protein is near the n terminus but not accessible to the c terminus in procapsids the n terminus was no longer accessible to the c terminus indicating that there is a conformational change in scaffolding protein upon assembly in addition our data are consistent with a model where scaffolding protein dimers are positioned parallel with one another with the associated c termini
