association of neighboring  strands of outer membrane protein a in lipid bilayers revealed by site directed fluorescence quenching
we present a detailed study on the formation of neighboring  strands during the folding of a monomeric integral membrane protein of the  barrel type   strand and  barrel formations were investigated for the eight stranded transmembrane domain of outer membrane protein a ompa with single tryptophan w  single cysteine c ompa mutants based on the ompa structure w and c were introduced in two neighboring  strands oriented toward the hydrocarbon core of the membrane replaced residue pairs were closer to either the periplasmic turns named cis side or the outer loops named trans side of the strand wncm ompa mutants containing w at position n and c at position m along the polypeptide chain were labeled at the c by a nitroxyl spin label which is a short range fluorescence quencher to monitor the association of neighboring  strands we determined the proximity between fluorescent w and labeled c in ompa folding experiments by intramolecular fluorescence quenching formation of native  strand contacts in folding experiments required the lipid membrane residues in the trans side of strands      and   represented by mutants w c      trans and w c      trans  reached close proximity prior to residues in the n    and c   terminal strands as examined for mutants w c       trans and w c       cis  tryptophan and cysteine converged slightly faster in w c       trans than in w c       cis  the last folding step was observed for residues at the cis ends of strands   and   for the mutant w c      cis  the data also demonstrate that the neighboring  strands associate upon insertion into the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer
