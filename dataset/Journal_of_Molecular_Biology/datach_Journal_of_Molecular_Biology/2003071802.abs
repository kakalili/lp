insights into protein  protein binding by binding free energy calculation and free energy decomposition for the ras  raf and ras  ralgds complexes
absolute binding free energy calculations and free energy decompositions are presented for the protein  protein complexes h ras c raf and h ras ralgds ras is a central switch in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation in our study we investigate the capability of the molecular mechanics mm generalized born surface area gbsa approach to estimate absolute binding free energies for the protein  protein complexes averaging gas phase energies solvation free energies and entropic contributions over snapshots extracted from trajectories of the unbound proteins and the complexes calculated binding free energies ras  raf        kcalmol   ras  ralgds        kcalmol   are in fair agreement with experimentally determined values    kcalmol      kcalmol    if appropriate ionic strength is taken into account structural determinants of the binding affinity of ras  raf and ras  ralgds are identified by means of free energy decomposition for the first time computationally inexpensive generalized born gb calculations are applied in this context to partition solvation free energies along with gas phase energies between residues of both binding partners for selected residues in addition entropic contributions are estimated by classical statistical mechanics comparison of the decomposition results with experimentally determined binding free energy differences for alanine mutants of interface residues yielded correlations with r    and   for ras  raf and ras  ralgds respectively extension of the decomposition reveals residues as far apart as   from the binding epitope that can contribute significantly to binding free energy these  hotspots  are found to show large atomic fluctuations in the unbound proteins indicating that they reside in structurally less stable regions furthermore hotspot residues experience a significantly larger than average decrease in local fluctuations upon complex formation finally by calculating a pair wise decomposition of interactions interaction pathways originating in the binding epitope of raf are found that protrude through the protein structure towards the loop l  this explains the finding of a conformational change in this region upon complex formation with ras and it may trigger a larger structural change in raf which is considered to be necessary for activation of the effector by ras
