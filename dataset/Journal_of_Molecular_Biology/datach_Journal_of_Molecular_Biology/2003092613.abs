comprehensive mutagenesis of the c terminal domain of the m  gene  minor coat protein the requirements for assembly into the bacteriophage particle
filamentous bacteriophage assemble at the host membrane in a non lytic process the gene  minor coat protein p  is required for release from the membrane and subsequently for recognition and infection of a new host p contains at least three distinct domains two n terminal domains that mediate host recognition and infection and a c terminal domain p c that is required for release from the host cell following phage assembly and contributes to the structural stability of the phage particle a comprehensive mutational analysis of the   residue p c revealed that only  side chains located within the last  residues of sequence were necessary for efficient incorporation into a wild type coat the results reveal that the requirements for the assembly of p into the phage particle are quite lax and involve only a few key side chains these findings shed light on the functional and structural requirements for filamentous phage assembly and they may provide guidelines for the engineering of improved coat proteins as scaffolds for phage display technology
