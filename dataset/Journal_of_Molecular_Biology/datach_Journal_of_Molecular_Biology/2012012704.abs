crystal structure of sol i  a major allergen from fire ant venom
sol i  is a potent allergen from the venom of red imported fire ant which contains allergens sol i  sol i  sol i  and sol i  that are known to be powerful triggers of anaphylaxis sol i  causes ige antibody production in about one third of individuals stung by fire ants baculovirus recombinant dimeric sol i  was crystallized as a native and selenomethionyl derivatized protein and its structure has been determined by single wavelength anomalous dispersion at     resolution the overall fold of each subunit consists of five helices that enclose a central hydrophobic cavity the structure is stabilized by three intramolecular disulfide bridges and one intermolecular disulfide bridge the nearest structural homologue is the sequence unrelated odorant binding protein and pheromone binding protein lush of the fruit fly drosophila which may suggest a similar biological function to test this hypothesis we measured the reversible binding of various pheromones plant odorants and other ligands to sol i  by the changes in n phenyl  naphthylamine fluorescence emission upon binding of ligands that compete with n phenyl  naphthylamine the highest binding affinity was observed for hydrophobic ligands such as aphid alarm pheromone e   farnesene analogs of ant alarm pheromones and plant volatiles decane undecane and  caryophyllene conceivably sol i  may play a role in capturing and or transporting small hydrophobic ligands such as pheromones odors fatty acids or short living hydrophobic primers molecular surface analysis in combination with sequence alignment can explain the serological cross reactivity observed between some ant species
