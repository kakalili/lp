determinants of the rate of mrna translocation in bacterial protein synthesis
studying the kinetics of translocation of mrna and trnas on the translating ribosome is technically difficult since the rate limiting steps involve large conformational changes without covalent bond formation or disruption here we have developed a unique assay system for precise estimation of the full translocation cycle time at any position in any type of open reading frame orf  using a buffer system optimized for high accuracy of trna selection together with high concentration of elongation factor g we obtained in vivo compatible translocation rates we found that translocation was comparatively slow early in the orf and faster further downstream of the initiation codon the maximal translocation rate decreased from the in vivo compatible value of  s   at mm free mg  concentration to the detrimentally low value of s   at mm free mg  concentration thus high and in vivo compatible accuracy of codon translation as well as high and in vivo compatible translocation rate required a remarkably low mg  concentration finally we found that the rate of translocation deep inside an orf was not significantly affected upon variation of the standard free energy of interaction between a  nt upstream shine dalgarno sd like sequence and the anti sd sequence of  s rrna in a range of   kcal mol based on these experiments we discuss the optimal choice of mg  concentration for maximal fitness of the living cell by taking its effects on the accuracy of translation the peptide bond formation rate and the translocation rate into account
