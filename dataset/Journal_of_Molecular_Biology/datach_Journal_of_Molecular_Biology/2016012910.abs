identification and characterization of botulinum neurotoxin a substrate binding pockets and their re engineering for human snap
botulinum neurotoxins bonts are highly potent bacterial proteins that block neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction by cleaving snares soluble n ethyl maleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors  however their serotype a bont a that cleaves snap   synaptosomal associated protein of  kda has also been an established pharmaceutical for treatment of medical conditions that rely on hyperactivity of cholinergic nerve terminals for  years the expansion of its use to a variety of further medical conditions associated with hypersecretion components is prevented partly because the involved snare isoforms are not cleaved therefore we examined by mutational analyses the reason for the resistance of human snap   an isoform of snap   we show that replacement of  snap  residues with their snap  counterparts effects snap  like cleavability conversely transfer of each of the replaced snap  residues to snap  drastically decreased the cleavability of snap   by means of the existing snap  toxin co crystal structure molecular dynamics simulations and corroborative mutagenesis studies the appropriate binding pockets for these residues in bont a were characterized systematic mutagenesis of two major bont a binding pockets was conducted in order to adapt these pockets to corresponding amino acids of human snap   human snap  cleaving mutants were isolated using a newly established yeast based screening system this method may be useful for engineering novel bont a pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases that rely on snap  mediated hypersecretion
