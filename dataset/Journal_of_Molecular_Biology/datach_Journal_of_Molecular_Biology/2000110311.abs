evolution of the family of prn plasmids and their integrase mediated insertion into the chromosome of the crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus edited by j karn
plasmid phen from sulfolobus islandicus was sequenced    kb and shown to belong to the archaeal prn family which includes plasmids prn  prn  pssvx and pdl  that share a large conserved sequence region phen is most closely related to prn in this conserved region it also shares a large variant region containing several homologous genes with pdl  which is absent from the other plasmids the variant region is flanked by the sequence motif ttagaatggggattc and similar duplicated motifs occur in plasmids prn and prn  separated by a few bases it is inferred that recombination at these sites produces the main genetic variability in the plasmid family the conserved region of the plasmid and duplicated copies of the motif are also present in the genome of sulfolobus solfataricus p  moreover they are bordered by a partitioned integrase gene int and by a  bp perfect direct repeat corresponding to the downstream half of a trnaval gene the integrase and the direct repeat are highly similar in sequence to the integrase and the chromosomal integration site att  respectively of the ssv virus which integrates into the chromosome of sulfolobus shibatae recombination at the att repeats in s solfataricus would produce a novel plasmid pxq  which carries both an intact integrase gene and a single integration site att  this strongly suggests that the same mechanism of site specific integration at a trna gene is used for both viruses and plasmids in sulfolobus
