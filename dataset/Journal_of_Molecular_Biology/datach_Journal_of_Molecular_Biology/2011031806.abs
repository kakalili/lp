structure of the human protein kinase ck catalytic subunit ck    and interaction thermodynamics with the regulatory subunit ck
protein kinase ck  formerly  casein kinase    is composed of a central dimer of noncatalytic subunits ck   binding two catalytic subunits in humans there are two isoforms of the catalytic subunit and an additional splicing variant  one of which ck   is well characterized to supplement the limited biochemical knowledge about the second paralog ck     we developed a well soluble catalytically active full length mutant of human ck    characterized it by michaelis  menten kinetics and isothermal titration calorimetry and determined its crystal structure to a resolution of    the affinity of ck    for ck  is about  times lower than that of ck  and is less driven by enthalpy this result fits the observation that the     loop a key element of the ck  ck  interface adopts an open conformation in ck    while in ck   it opens only after assembly with ck   the open     loop in ck    is stabilized by two elements that are absent in ck     the extension of the n terminal  sheet by an additional  strand and   the filling of a conserved hydrophobic cavity between the     loop and helix  c by a tryptophan residue moreover the interdomain hinge region of ck    adopts a fully functional conformation while unbound ck  is often found with a nonproductive hinge conformation that is overcome only by ck  binding taken together ck    exhibits a significantly lower affinity for ck  than ck   moreover in functionally critical regions it is less dependent on ck  to obtain a fully functional conformation
