identification of a new antizyme mrna  frameshifting stimulatory pseudoknot in a subset of diverse invertebrates and its apparent absence in intermediate species
the expression of eukaryotic antizyme genes requires  translational frameshifting the frameshift in decoding most vertebrate antizyme mrnas is stimulated by an rna pseudoknot   of the frameshift site although the frameshifting event itself is conserved in a wide variety of organisms from yeast to mammals until recently no corresponding   rna pseudoknot was known in invertebrate antizyme mrnas a pseudoknot different in structure and origin from its vertebrate counterparts is now shown to be encoded by the antizyme genes of distantly related invertebrates identification of the   frameshifting stimulator in intermediate species or other invertebrates remains unresolved
