solution structure of human il  and implication for receptor binding edited by p e wright
interleukin  has been implicated as a key factor in asthma allergy atopy and inflammatory response establishing the protein as a valuable therapeutic target the high resolution solution structure of human il  has been determined by multidimensional nmr the resulting structure is consistent with previous short chain left handed four helix bundles where a significant similarity in the folding topology between il  and il  was observed il  shares a significant overlap in biological function with il  a result of the common  chain component il r  in their respective receptors based on the available structural and mutational data an il  il r  model and a sequential mechanism for forming the signaling heterodimer is proposed for il
