sgs truncations induce genome rearrangements but suppress detrimental effects of blm overexpression in saccharomyces cerevisiae
recq like dna helicases are conserved from bacteria to humans they perform functions in the maintenance of genome stability and their mutation is associated with cancer predisposition and premature aging syndromes in humans here a series of c terminal deletions and point mutations of sgs  the only recq like helicase in yeast show that the helicase rnase d c terminal domain and the rad  interaction domain are dispensable for sgs s role in suppressing genome instability whereas the zinc binding domain and the helicase domain are required blm expression from the native sgs promoter had no adverse effects on cell growth and was unable to complement any sgs  defects blm overexpression however significantly increased the rate of accumulating gross chromosomal rearrangements in a dosage dependent manner and greatly exacerbated sensitivity to dna damaging agents co expressing sgs truncations of up to   residues lacking all known functional domains of sgs  suppressed the hydroxyurea sensitivity of blm overexpressing cells suggesting a functional relationship between sgs and blm protein disorder prediction analysis of sgs and blm was used to produce a functional sgs  blm chimera by replacing the n terminus of blm with the disordered n terminus of sgs  the functionality of this chimera suggests that it is the disordered n terminus a site of protein binding and posttranslational modification that confers species specificity to these two recq like proteins
