a recruited protease is involved in catabolism of pyrimidines
in nature the same biochemical reaction can be catalyzed by enzymes having fundamentally different folds reaction mechanisms and origins for example the third step of the reductive catabolism of pyrimidines the conversion of n carbamyl  alanine to  alanine is catalyzed by two  alanine synthase  asase ec     subfamilies we show that the  prototype  eukaryote  asases such as those from drosophila melanogaster and arabidopsis thaliana are relatively efficient in the conversion of n carbamyl  a compared with a representative of fungal  asases the yeast saccharomyces kluyveri  asase which has a high km value   mm  s kluyveri  asase is specifically inhibited by dipeptides and tripeptides and the apparent ki value of glycyl glycine is in the same range as the substrate km we show that this inhibitor binds to the enzyme active center in a similar way as the substrate the observed structural similarities and inhibition behavior as well as the phylogenetic relationship suggest that the ancestor of the fungal  asase was a protease that had modified its profession and become involved in the metabolism of nucleic acid precursors
