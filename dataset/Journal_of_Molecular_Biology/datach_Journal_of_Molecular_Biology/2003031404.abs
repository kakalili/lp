novel uncomplexed and complexed structures of plasmepsin ii an aspartic protease from plasmodium falciparum
malaria remains a human disease of global significance and a major cause of high infant mortality in endemic nations parasites of the genus plasmodium cause the disease by degrading human hemoglobin as a source of amino acids for their growth and maturation hemoglobin degradation is initiated by aspartic proteases termed plasmepsins with a cleavage at the  chain between residues phe  and leu  plasmepsin ii is one of the four catalytically active plasmepsins that has been identified in the food vacuole of plasmodium falciparum novel crystal structures of uncomplexed plasmepsin ii as well as the complex with a potent inhibitor have been refined with data extending to resolution limits of    and    and to r factors of   and   respectively the inhibitor n    benzo   dioxol  yl ethyl    methyl  oxo   dihydro isoindol  yl propionyl amino  benzyl  hydroxypropyl  benzyloxy   dimethoxy benzamide belongs to a family of potent non peptidic inhibitors that have large p   groups such inhibitors could not be modeled into the binding cavity of the structure of plasmepsin ii in complex with pepstatin a our structures reveal that the binding cavities of the new complex and uncomplexed plasmepsin ii are considerably more open than that of the pepstatin a complex allowing for larger heterocyclic groups in the p   p   and p positions both complexed and uncomplexed plasmepsin ii crystallized in space group p  with one monomer in the asymmetric unit the structures show extensive interlocking of monomers around the crystallographic axis of symmetry with areas in excess of     buried at the interface and a loop of one monomer interacting with the binding cavity of the  fold related monomer electron density for this loop is only fully ordered in the complexed structure
