structural and catalytic diversity in the two family  aldo keto reductases
aldo keto reductases akrs are a large superfamily of nad p h dependent enzymes that function in a wide range of biological processes the structures of two enzymes from the previously uncharacterized family   akr a and akr b  the products of the iols and yhdn genes of bacillus subtilis have been determined akr b appears to be a relatively conventional member of the superfamily with respect to structural and biochemical properties it is an efficient enzyme specific for nadph and possesses a catalytic triad typical for akrs akr a exhibits catalytic divergence from the other members of the superfamily and surprisingly akr b the most closely related aldo keto reductase in sequence although both have conserved catalytic residues consisting of an acidic tyrosine a lysine and an aspartate a water molecule interrupts this triad in cofactor bound akr a by inserting between the lysine and tyrosine side chains this results in a unique architecture for an akr active site with scant catalytic power in addition the absence of a bulky tryptophan side chain in akr a allows an unconventional conformation of the bound nadp cosubstrate raising the possibility that it donates the  pro s hydride rather than the  pro r hydride seen in most other akrs based upon the architecture of the active site and the resulting reaction velocities it therefore appears that functioning as an efficient oxido reductase is probably not the primary role of akr a a comparison of the apo and holo forms of akr a demonstrates that the cosubstrate does not play the dramatic role in active site assembly seen in other superfamily members
