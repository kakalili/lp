engineering the nk fragment of hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor as a met receptor antagonist
the growth and motility factor hepatocyte growth factor scatter factor hgf sf and its receptor met the tyrosine kinase encoded by the c met proto oncogene exert major roles in cancer invasion and metastasis and are key targets for therapy nk is an alternative spliced variant of hgf sf that consists of the n terminal n and first kringle k  domains and has partial agonistic activity nk crystallises as a head to tail dimer with an extensive inter protomeric interface resulting from contacts between the two short interdomain linkers and reciprocal contacts between the n and k domains here we show that a subset of mutants at the nk dimer interface such as the linker mutants y  a or n  a or the kringle mutant v  a i  a bind the met receptor with affinities comparable to wild type nk but fail to assemble a dimeric signalling competent nk  met complex these nk variants have no detectable agonistic activity on behave as bona fide receptor antagonists by blocking cell migration and dna synthesis in target cells and have strong prospects as therapeutics for human cancer
