We have compared the axial structures of negatively stained heterotypic, type II collagen-containing fibrils with computer-generated staining patterns. Theoretical negative-staining patterns were created based upon the “bulkiness” of the individual amino acid side-chains in the primary sequence and the D-staggered arrangement of the triple-helices. The theoretical staining pattern of type II collagen was compared and cross-correlated with the experimental staining pattern of both reconstituted type II collagen fibrils, and fibrils isolated from adult and foetal cartilage and vitreous humour. The isolated fibrils differ markedly in both diameter and composition. Correlations were significantly improved when a degree of theoretical hydroxylysine glycosylation was applied, showing for the first time that this type of glycosylation influences the negative-staining pattern of collagen fibrils. Increased correlations were obtained when contributions from types V/XI and IX collagen were included in the simulation model. The N-propeptide of collagen type V/XI and the NC2 domain of type IX collagen both contribute to prominent stain-excluding peaks in the gap region. With decreasing fibril diameter, an increase of these two peaks was observed. Simulations of the fibril-derived staining patterns with theoretical patterns composed of proportions of types II, V/XI and IX collagen confirmed that the thinnest fibrils (i.e. vitreous humour collagen fibrils) have the highest minor collagen content. Comparison of the staining patterns showed that the organisation of collagen molecules within vitreous humour and cartilage fibrils is identical. The simulation model for vitreous humour, however, did not account for all stain-excluding mass observed in the staining pattern; this additional mass may be accounted for by collagen-associated macromolecules.
