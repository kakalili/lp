non  helical elements modulate polytopic membrane protein architecture edited by g von heijne
in  all  fold  transmembrane proteins including ion channels g protein coupled receptors gpcrs  bacterial rhodopsins and photosynthetic reaction centers relatively long  helices straight curved or kinked pack into compact elliptical or circular domains using both existing and newly developed tools to analyze transmembrane segments of all available membrane protein three dimensional structures including that very recently elucidated for the gpcr rhodopsin we report here the finding of frequent non  helical components i e   helices   tight turns     helices   wide turns   and intrahelical kinks often due to residues other than proline  often diverse helical types and kinks concatenate over long segments and produce complex inclinations of helical axis and or diverse frame shifts in the  canonical    helical side chain pattern marked differences in transmembrane architecture exist even between seemingly structurally related proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin deconvolution of these non canonical features into their composite elements is essential for understanding the pleiotropy of polytopic protein structure and function and must be considered in developing valid macromolecular models
