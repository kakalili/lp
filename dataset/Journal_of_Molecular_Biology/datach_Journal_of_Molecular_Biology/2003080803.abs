functional analysis of the novel c terminal domains of s pombe transcription factor iiia
transcription factor iiia from s pombe exhibits a novel structural organization compared to its homologues in other species tfiiia from s cerevisiae or vertebrates contains a total of nine c h zinc finger domains and a non zinc finger region at its c terminus in addition the s cerevisiae protein possesses an  amino acid spacer between zinc fingers eight and nine in contrast the s pombe tfiiia sequence includes ten potential zinc finger motifs with a  amino acid spacer between fingers nine and ten zinc finger nine of the s pombe protein deviates from the consensus for a c h zinc finger however in that it does not include an appropriately positioned second zn  coordinating histidine we demonstrate here through analysis of mutated forms of the protein that the non canonical ninth zinc finger is functional in both dna binding and transcription in addition we have shown that the spacer preceding finger ten and finger ten itself are essential for the transcriptional function of s pombe tfiiia but neither is required for wild type s rrna gene binding activity
