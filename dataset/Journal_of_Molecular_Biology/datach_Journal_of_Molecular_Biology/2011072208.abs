a retroviral chimeric capsid protein reveals the role of the n terminal  hairpin in mature core assembly
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv is an enveloped virus constituted by two monomeric rna molecules that encode for  proteins among these are the structural proteins that are translated as the gag polyprotein in order to become infectious hiv must undergo a maturation process mediated by the proteolytic cleavage of gag to give rise to the isolated structural protein matrix capsid ca  nucleocapsid as well as p and spacer peptides  and  upon maturation the  n terminal residues from ca fold into a  hairpin which is stabilized mainly by a salt bridge between pro and asp  previous reports have shown that non formation of the salt bridge which potentially disrupts proper  hairpin arrangement generates noninfectious virus or aberrant cores to date however there is no consensus on the role of the  hairpin in order to shed light in this subject we have generated mutations in the hairpin region to examine what features would be crucial for the  hairpin s role in retroviral mature core formation these features include the importance of the proline at the n terminus the amino acid sequence and the physical structure of the  hairpin itself the presented experiments provide biochemical evidence that  hairpin formation plays an important role in regard to ca protein conformation required to support proper mature core arrangement hydrogen deuterium exchange and in vitro assembly reactions illustrated the importance of the  hairpin structure its dynamics and its influence on the orientation of helix  for the assembly of the mature ca lattice
