genetic selection for and molecular dynamic modeling of a protein transmembrane domain multimerization motif from a random escherichia coli genomic library edited by g von heijne
in order to identify new transmembrane helix packing motifs in naturally occurring proteins we have selected transmembrane domains from a library of random escherichia coli genomic dna fragments and screened them for homomultimerization via their abilities to dimerize the bacteriophage  ci repressor dna binding domain sequences were isolated using a modified  ci headpiece dimerization assay system which was shown previously to measure transmembrane helix helix association in the e coli inner membrane screening resulted in the identification of several novel sequences that appear to mediate helix helix interactions one sequence representing the predicted sixth transmembrane domain tm  of the e coli protein yjio was chosen for further analysis using site directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics a small set of models for yjio tm multimerization interface interactions were generated this work demonstrates the utility of combining in vivo genetic tools with computational systems for understanding membrane protein structure and assembly
