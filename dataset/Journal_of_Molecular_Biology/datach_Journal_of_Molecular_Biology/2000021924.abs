direct visualisation of conformational changes in ef f by electron microscopy edited by w baumeister
the isolated h atpase from escherichia coli ef f  was investigated by electron microscopy of samples of negatively stained monodisperse molecules followed by single particle image processing the resulting three dimensional maps showed that the f part is connected by a prominent stalk to a more peripheral part of f  the f part showed stain accessible cavities inside in three dimensional maps from selected particles a second stalk could be detected which was thinner than the main stalk and is thought to correspond to the stator three dimensional maps of the enzyme in the absence and in the presence of the substrate analogue adenyl    imidodiphosphate amp pnp were calculated upon binding of amp pnp the three dimensional maps showed no significant changes in the f part of ef f  whereas a major conformational change in the f part was observed   the diameter of the f part decreased upon binding of amp pnp mainly in the upper half of f    enzyme particles prepared in the presence of amp pnp had a pointed cap at the top of the f part which was missing in its absence   the stain accessible cavity inside the f part altered its pattern significantly
