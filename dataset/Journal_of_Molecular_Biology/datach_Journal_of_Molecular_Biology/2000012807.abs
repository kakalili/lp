mutations influencing the frr gene coding for ribosome recycling factor rrf  edited by d e draper
a total of  null six reversion and five silent mutations of frr the gene encoding for ribosome recycling factor rrf  of escherichia coli are discussed along with  temperature sensitive ts mutations and  intergenic suppressor strains of ts rrf the null mutations were classified into six different categories a computer based secondary structure analysis showed three domains domain a which has the n terminal helix domain b which contains coil   helix and  strand structure and domain c which is a c terminal helix the ts mutations fell into domains a and c but not in domain b more than a half of the null mutations fell into domain b while the silent mutations fell outside domain b substitution of arg  in domain c by other amino acids was observed among five independently isolated null mutants it is suggested that domain b is important for maintaining the rrf structure while the region including arg  is one of the active sites a total of  intergenic suppressor strains of ts rrf were grouped into four categories depending on which temperature sensitive alleles were suppressed
