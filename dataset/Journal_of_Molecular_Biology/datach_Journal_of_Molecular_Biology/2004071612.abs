biochemical and structural studies of the interaction of cdc  with hsp
the heat shock protein hsp  plays a key but poorly understood role in the folding assembly and activation of a large number of signal transduction molecules in particular kinases and steroid hormone receptors in carrying out these functions hsp  hydrolyses atp as it cycles between adp and atp bound forms and this atpase activity is regulated by the transient association with a variety of co chaperones cdc  is one such co chaperone protein that also has a role in client protein recognition in that it is required for hsp  dependent folding and activation of a particular group of protein kinases these include the cyclin dependent kinases cdk   and cdk  raf  akt and many others here the biochemical details of the interaction of human hsp   and cdc  have been characterised small angle x ray scattering saxs was then used to study the solution structure of hsp  and its complexes with cdc  the results suggest a model for the interaction of cdc  with hsp  whereby a cdc  dimer binds the two n terminal domain linker regions in an hsp  dimer fixing them in a single conformation that is presumably suitable for client protein recognition
