comparative multiplexed mass spectrometric analyses of endogenously expressed yeast nuclear and cytoplasmic exosomes
here we combined tandem affinity purification with several mass spectrometry based approaches to gain more insight into the composition and structure of the yeast nuclear  cytoplasmic exosome protein complex the yeast exosome fulfills several different functions in rna metabolism and can be localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus these two exosome complexes differ in protein composition although they share several constituents we focused on these differences in composition by selecting a nuclear specific exosome protein rrp  and a cytoplasmic specific protein ski  as the tandem affinity purification tagged affinity bait protein first we investigated both these purified exosome assemblies by macromolecular mass spectrometry ms to determine the stability and mass of the intact protein complexes and to obtain information on composition and core constituents we used tandem ms on these intact protein complexes to further probe the composition and to obtain insight into the peripheral nature of some of the constituents finally we combine stable isotope labeling with ms to quantitate differences in exosome composition and posttranslational modifications we identified a few phosphorylation sites that are differentially regulated between the cytoplasmic exosome and the nuclear exosome from all of these data we conclude that the yeast nuclear exosome and the cytoplasmic exosome share a common stable core complex but are decorated with quite a few differing peripheral proteins we show that the nuclear exosome selectively copurifies with the    importin heterodimer which is known to be involved in the transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane
