quantitative dissection of the notch csl interaction insights into the notch mediated transcriptional switch
complex formation between the intracellular domain of the notch receptor nicd and the transcription factor csl is indispensable for transcriptional activation to understand how nicd displaces csl associated co repressors we have quantified the binding of different notch icd regions to a key interaction domain the beta trefoil domain or btd of human csl electrophoresis scattering and titration calorimetry indicate that nicd and btd combine to form a   heterodimer neither the notch ankyrin domain ank nor c terminal region contributes binding energy towards btd in contrast binding energy is attributed largely to a short segment including the conserved wfp sequence motif within the ram region the    residue polypeptide segment n terminal to the ank domain  substitution of this motif substantially reduces affinity short    residues wfp containing peptides encoded by the four mammalian notch genes have similar affinities to btd thus activity differences between paralogues either result from other regions of nicd and csl or from differences in interaction with downstream components the importance of ram was demonstrated by the ability of a short ram peptides to dissociate nicd csl interaction in cellular lysates these results support an emerging molecular mechanism for the displacement of co repressors from dna bound csl by nicd
