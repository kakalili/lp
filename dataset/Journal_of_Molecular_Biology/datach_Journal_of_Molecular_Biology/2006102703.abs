activation of ubiquitin ligase scfskp by cks  insights from hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry
skp is the substrate recognition subunit of the multi subunit ubiquitin ligase scfskp  it consists of an n terminal f box domain that binds to the skp subunit and thereby tethers it to the scf catalytic core and an elongated c terminal domain comprising ten leucine rich repeats lrr that binds the substrate a small accessory protein cks  is required for scfskp to target certain substrates including the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p  here we have used hydrogen deuterium exchange monitored by mass spectrometry to investigate the mode of action of cks on scfskp  we show that complex formation between cks and skp causes conformational changes in both proteins in regions distant from the respective binding sites we find that skp interacts with a localised region of cks but the interaction causes a global change in the hydrogen exchange behaviour of cks  also whilst cks binds to the most c terminal lrrs of the elongated skp molecule the interaction induces conformational changes at the distant n terminal lrrs close to the f box motif further binding of cks to skp significantly stabilises the interaction between skp and skp  the results reveal that the c terminal substrate recognition region of skp is coupled to the n terminal skp binding region and thereby to the scf catalytic core this result adds to the model proposed previously that whilst the principal function of the f box protein is to recruit the substrate an additional function may be to help position the substrate in an optimal way within the scf complex to enable efficient ubiquitin transfer
