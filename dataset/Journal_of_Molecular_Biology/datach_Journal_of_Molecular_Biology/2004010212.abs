the mechanism of insulin action on islet amyloid polypeptide fiber formation
the pathology of type ii diabetes includes the presence of cytotoxic amyloid deposits in the islets of langerhans the main component of these deposits islet amyloid polypeptide iapp  is a hormone involved in glucose metabolism and is normally co secreted with insulin by the  cells of the pancreas here we perform in vitro iapp fibrillogenesis experiments in the presence and in the absence of insulin to elucidate the mechanism by which insulin acts on fiber formation we find that insulin is an exceptionally potent inhibitor in contrast to the vast excess of insulin over iapp in vivo substoichiometric amounts of insulin inhibit seeded and unseeded reactions by more than tenfold in vitro unusually the magnitude of the inhibitory effect is dependent on the concentration of insulin yet independent of the concentration of iapp in addition insulin appears to bind non specifically to fiber surfaces giving rise to altered morphology iapp fiber formation in vitro requires a minimum of three steps fiber independent nucleation elongation and fiber dependent nucleation furthermore these steps are attenuated by the presence of a dispersed phase transition we interpret these data in the context of the phase mediated fibrillogenesis model pmf and conclude through experiment and kinetic simulation that the dominant effect of insulin is to act on the elongation portion of the reaction these results suggest that amyloid formation in type ii diabetes involves either an additional agent that acts as an accelerant or a step that segregates iapp from insulin
