the    structure of human  n acetylgalactosaminidase the molecular basis of schindler and kanzaki diseases
n acetylgalactosaminidase   nagal e c      is a lysosomal exoglycosidase that cleaves terminal  n acetylgalactosamine residues from glycopeptides and glycolipids in humans a deficiency of  nagal activity results in the lysosomal storage disorders schindler disease and kanzaki disease to better understand the molecular defects in the diseases we determined the crystal structure of human  nagal after expressing wild type and glycosylation deficient glycoproteins in recombinant insect cell expression systems we measured the enzymatic parameters of our purified wild type and mutant enzymes establishing their enzymatic equivalence to investigate the binding specificity and catalytic mechanism of the human  nagal enzyme we determined three crystallographic complexes with different catalytic products bound in the active site of the enzyme to better understand how individual defects in the  nagal glycoprotein lead to schindler disease we analyzed the effect of disease causing mutations on the three dimensional structure
