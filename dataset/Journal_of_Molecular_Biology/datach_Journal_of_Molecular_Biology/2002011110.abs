folding of the yeast prion protein ure  kinetic evidence for folding and unfolding intermediates edited by j karn
the saccharomyces cerevisiae non mendelian factor ure  propagates by a prion like mechanism involving aggregation of the chromosomally encoded protein ure  the n terminal prion domain prd of ure is required for prion activity in vivo and amyloid formation in vitro however the molecular mechanism of the prion like activity remains obscure here we measure the kinetics of folding of ure and two n terminal variants that lack all or part of the prd the kinetic folding behaviour of the three proteins is identical indicating that the prd does not change the stability rates of folding or folding pathway of ure  both unfolding and refolding kinetics are multiphasic an intermediate is populated during unfolding at high denaturant concentrations resulting in the appearance of an unfolding burst phase and  roll over  in the denaturant dependence of the unfolding rate constants during refolding the appearance of a burst phase indicates formation of an intermediate during the dead time of stopped flow mixing a further fast phase shows second order kinetics indicating formation of a dimeric intermediate regain of native like fluorescence displays a distinct lag due to population of this on pathway dimeric intermediate double jump experiments indicate that isomerisation of pro   which is cis in the native state occurs late in refolding after regain of native like fluorescence during protein refolding there is kinetic partitioning between productive folding via the dimeric intermediate and a non productive side reaction via an aggregation prone monomeric intermediate in the light of this and other studies schemes for folding aggregation and prion formation are proposed
