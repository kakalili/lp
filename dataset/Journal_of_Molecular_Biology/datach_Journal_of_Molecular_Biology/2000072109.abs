the fold of human aquaporin
the fold of human aquaporin  is determined from cryo electron microscopic data at    resolution the monomeric structure consists of two transmembrane triple helices arranged around a pseudo  fold axis connected by a long flexible extracellular loop each triplet contains between its second and third helix a functional loop containing the highly conserved fingerprint npa motif these functional loops are assumed to fold inwards between the two triplets thereby forming the heart of the water channel the helix topology was determined from the directionality pattern of each of the six transmembrane helices with respect to the membrane together with constraints defined by the sequence and atomic force microscopy data the directionality of the helices was determined by collecting the best fitting orientations resulting from a search through the three dimensional experimental map for a large number of  helical fragments tests on cryo electron crystallographic bacteriorhodopsin data suggest that our method is generally applicable to determine the topology of helical proteins for which only medium resolution electron microscopy data are available
