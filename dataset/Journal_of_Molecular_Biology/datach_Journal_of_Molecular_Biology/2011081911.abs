common structural traits across pathogenic mutants of the human prion protein and their implications for familial prion diseases
human hu familial prion diseases are associated with about  point mutations of the gene coding for the prion protein prp  most of the variants associated with these mutations are located in the globular domain of the protein we performed   ns of molecular dynamics for each of these mutants to investigate their structure in aqueous solution overall     s of molecular dynamics data is presented the calculations are based on the amber parm  force field which has been shown to reproduce very accurately the structural features of the huprp wild type and a few variants for which experimental structural information is available the variants present structural determinants different from those of wild type huprp and the protective mutation huprp e  k  m  these include the loss of salt bridges in      regions and the loss of  stacking interactions in the      loop in addition in the majority of the mutants the   helix is more flexible and y  is more solvent exposed the presence of similar traits in this large spectrum of mutations hints to a role of these fingerprints in their known disease causing properties overall the regions most affected by disease linked mutations in terms of structure and or flexibility are those involved in the pathogenic conversion to the scrapie form of the protein and in the interaction with cellular partners these regions thus emerge as optimal targets for antibody and ligand binding studies
