Most DNA glycosylases including N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), which initiate DNA base excision repair, have a wide substrate range of damaged or altered bases in duplex DNA. In contrast, uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is specific for uracil and excises it from both single-stranded and duplex DNAs. Here we show by DNA footprinting analysis that MPG, but not UDG, bound to base-pair mismatches especially to less stable pyrimidine–pyrimidine pairs, without catalyzing detectable base cleavage. Thermal denaturation studies of these normal and damaged (e.g. 1,N6-ethenoadenine, εA) base mispairs indicate that duplex instability rather than exact fit of the flipped out damaged base in the catalytic pocket is a major determinant in the initial recognition of damage by MPG. Finally, based on our determination of binding affinity and catalytic efficiency we conclude that the initial recognition of substrate base lesions by MPG is dependent on the ease of flipping of the base from unstable pairs to a flexible catalytic pocket.
