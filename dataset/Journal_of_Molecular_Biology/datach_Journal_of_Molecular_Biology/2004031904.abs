crystal structures of creatininase reveal the substrate binding site and provide an insight into the catalytic mechanism
creatininase from pseudomonas putida is a member of the urease related amidohydrolase superfamily the crystal structure of the mn activated enzyme has been solved by the single isomorphous replacement method at    resolution the structures of the native creatininase and the mn activated creatininase  creatine complex have been determined by a difference fourier method at    and    resolution respectively we found the disc shaped hexamer to be roughly    in diameter and   in thickness and arranged as a trimer of dimers with   d  point group symmetry the enzyme is a typical zn  enzyme with a binuclear metal center metal and metal  atomic absorption spectrometry and x ray crystallography revealed that zn  at metal  zn  was easily replaced with mn  mn  in the case of the mn activated enzyme metal  mn  has a square pyramidal geometry bound to three protein ligands of glu  asp  and his  and two water molecules metal  zn  has a well ordered tetrahedral geometry bound to the three protein ligands of his  asp  and glu  and a water molecule the crystal structure of the mn activated creatininase  creatine complex which is the first structure as the enzyme  substrate inhibitor complex of creatininase reveals that significant conformation changes occur at the flap between the   helix and the   helix of the active site and the creatine is accommodated in a hydrophobic pocket consisting of trp   trp   tyr   phe   tyr   and gly   the high resolution crystal structure of the creatininase  creatine complex enables us to identify two water molecules wat and wat  that are possibly essential for the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme the structure and proposed catalytic mechanism of the creatininase are different from those of urease related amidohydrolase superfamily enzymes we propose a new two step catalytic mechanism possibly common to creatininases in which the wat acts as the attacking nucleophile in the water adding step and the wat acts as the catalytic acid in the ring opening step
