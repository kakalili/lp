yajl the prokaryotic homolog of the parkinsonism associated protein dj  protects cells against protein sulfenylation
yajl is the closest escherichia coli homolog of the parkinsonism associated protein dj  a multifunctional oxidative stress response protein whose biochemical function remains unclear we recently described the oxidative stress dependent aggregation of proteins in yajl mutants and the oxidative stress dependent formation of mixed disulfides between yajl and members of the thiol proteome we report here that yajl mutants display increased protein sulfenic acids levels and that formation of mixed disulfides between yajl and its protein substrates in vivo is inhibited by the sulfenic acid reactant dimedone suggesting that yajl preferentially forms disulfides with sulfenylated proteins yajl but not yajlc  a also forms mixed disulfides in vitro with the sulfenylated form of bovine serum albumin the yajl serum albumin disulfides can be subsequently reduced by glutathione or dihydrolipoic acid we also show that dj  can form mixed disulfides with sulfenylated e coli proteins and with sulfenylated serum albumin these results suggest that yajl and possibly dj  function as covalent chaperones involved in the detection of sulfenylated proteins by forming mixed disulfides with them and that these disulfides are subsequently reduced by low molecular weight thiols
