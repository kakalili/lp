serpin acceleration of amyloid fibril formation a role for accessory proteins
protein aggregation underlies an increasing number of human diseases recent experiments have shown that the aggregation reaction is exquisitely specific involving particular interactions between non native proteins however aggregation of certain proteins for example  amyloid in vivo leads to the recruitment of other proteins into the aggregate antichymotrypsin a non fibril forming protein is always observed to be associated with  amyloid plaques in alzheimer s sufferers the role of antichymotrypsin is controversial with studies showing it can either accelerate or inhibit the aggregation reaction to investigate the role of antichymotrypsin in fibrillogenesis we have studied its interaction with apolipoprotein c ii a well characterized model system for the study of fibrillogenesis our data demonstrate that sub stoichiometric amounts of antichymotrypsin and its alternate structural forms can dramatically accelerate the aggregation of apolipoprotein c ii whereas the presence of   antitrypsin a structural homologue of antichymotrypsin cannot sedimentation velocity experiments show more apolipoprotein c ii fibrils were formed in the presence of antichymotrypsin using pull down assays and immuno gold labeling we demonstrate an interaction between antichymotrypsin and apolipoprotein c ii fibrils that specifically occurs during fibrillogenesis taken together these data demonstrate an interaction between antichymotrypsin and apolipoprotein c ii that accelerates fibrillogenesis and indicates a specific role for accessory proteins in protein aggregation
