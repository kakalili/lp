inhibition of human pancreatic ribonuclease by the human ribonuclease inhibitor protein
the ribonuclease inhibitor protein ri binds to members of the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease rnase a superfamily with an affinity in the femtomolar range here we report on structural and energetic aspects of the interaction between human ri hri and human pancreatic ribonuclease rnase   the structure of the crystalline hri rnase  complex was determined at a resolution of      revealing the formation of  intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving  residues of rnase  in contrast only nine such hydrogen bonds are apparent in the structure of the complex between porcine ri and rnase a hri which is anionic also appears to use its horseshoe shaped structure to engender long range coulombic interactions with rnase  which is cationic in accordance with the structural data the hri rnase  complex was found to be extremely stable t    days kd       m  site directed mutagenesis experiments enabled the identification of two cationic residues in rnase  arg  and arg  that are especially important for both the formation and stability of the complex and are thus termed  electrostatic targeting residues   disturbing the electrostatic attraction between hri and rnase  yielded a variant of rnase  that maintained ribonucleolytic activity and conformational stability but had a     fold lower association rate for complex formation and     fold lower affinity for hri this variant of rnase  which exhibits the largest decrease in ri affinity of any engineered ribonuclease is also toxic to human erythroleukemia cells together these results provide new insight into an unusual and important protein  protein interaction and could expedite the development of human ribonucleases as chemotherapeutic agents
