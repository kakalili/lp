mouse apom displays an unprecedented seven stranded lipocalin fold folding decoy or alternative native fold
mouse apolipoprotein m m apom displays a   sequence identity to human apolipoprotein m h apom  both proteins are apolipoproteins associated with high density lipoproteins with similar anticipated biological functions the structure of h apom has recently been determined by x ray crystallography which revealed that h apom displays as expected a lipocalin like fold characterized by an eight stranded   barrel that encloses an internal fatty acid binding site surprisingly this is not true for m apom after refolding from inclusion bodies the crystal structure of m apom reported here at     resolution displays a novel yet unprecedented seven stranded  barrel structure the fold difference is not caused by a mere deletion of a single  strand instead   strands e and f are removed and replaced by a single  strand a  formed from residues from the n terminus molecular dynamics simulations suggest that m apom is able to adopt both a seven stranded barrel structure and an eight stranded barrel structure in solution and that both folds are comparably stable thermal unfolding simulations identify the position where  strand exchange occurs as the weak point of the  barrel we wonder whether the switch in topology could have a biological function and could facilitate ligand release since it goes hand in hand with a narrowing of the barrel diameter possibly also the observed conformation represents an on pathway or off pathway folding intermediate of apom the difference in fold topology is quite remarkable and the fold promiscuity observed for m apom might possibly provide a glimpse at potential cross points during the evolution of  barrels
