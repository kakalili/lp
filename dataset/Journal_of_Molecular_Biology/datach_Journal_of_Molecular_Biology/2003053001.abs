the   kda subunit of complex i related to bacterial na translocating nadh dehydrogenases is required for enzyme assembly and function in neurospora crassa
a nuclear gene encoding a   kda subunit of complex i the homologue of mammalian mwfe protein was identified in the genome of neurospora crassa the gene was cloned and inactivated in vivo by the generation of repeat induced point mutations fungal mutant strains lacking the   kda polypeptide were subsequently isolated analyses of mitochondrial proteins from mutant nuo  indicate that the membrane and peripheral arms of complex i fail to assemble respiration of mutant mitochondria on matrix nadh is rotenone insensitive confirming that the   kda protein is required for the assembly and activity of complex i we found a similarity between the mwfe homologues and the c terminal part of the nqra subunit of bacterial na translocating nadh quinone oxidoreductases na nqr  suggesting a link between proton pumping and sodium pumping nadh dehydrogenases
