response of scp l domain of human mfe  to ligand removal binding site closure and burial of peroxisomal targeting signal
in the study of the structure and function relationship of human mfe  we have investigated the dynamics of human mfe scp l hscp l and its response to ligand removal a comparison was made with homologous rabbit scp  breathing and a closing motion are found identifiable with an adjustment in size and a closing off of the binding pocket crucial residues for structural integrity have been identified particularly mobile areas of the protein are loop  that is connecting helices a and c in space and helix d next to the entrance of the pocket in hscp l the binding pocket gets occupied by phe  which is making a tight hydrophobic contact with trp  in addition it is found that the c terminal peroxisomal targeting signal pts  that is solvent exposed in the complexed structure becomes buried when no ligand is present moreover an anti correlation exists between burial of pts and the size of the binding pocket the results are in accordance with plant nsltps where a similar accommodation of binding pocket size was found after ligand binding removal furthermore the calculations support the suggestion of a ligand assisted targeting mechanism
