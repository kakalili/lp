distinct requirements within the msh nucleotide binding pocket for mismatch and double strand break repair
in saccharomyces cerevisiae repair of insertion deletion loops is carried out by msh  msh mediated mismatch repair mmr  msh  msh is also required for   non homologous tail removal    nhtr in double strand break repair in both pathways msh  msh binds double strand single strand junctions and initiates repair in an atp dependent manner however the kinetics of the two processes appear different mmr is likely rapid in order to coordinate with the replication fork whereas   nhtr has been shown to be a slower process to understand the molecular requirements in both repair pathways we performed an in vivo analysis of well conserved residues in msh that are hypothesized to be required for mmr and or   nhtr these residues are predicted to be involved in either communication between the dna binding and atpase domains within the complex or nucleotide binding and or exchange within msh  msh  we identified a set of aromatic residues within the fly motif of the predicted msh nucleotide binding pocket that are essential for msh  msh mediated mmr but are largely dispensable for   nhtr in contrast mutations in other regions gave similar phenotypes in both assays based on these results we suggest that the two pathways have distinct requirements with respect to the position of the bound atp within msh  we propose that the differences are related at least in part to the kinetics of each pathway proper binding and positioning of atp is required to induce rapid conformational changes at the replication fork but is less important when more time is available for repair as in   nhtr
