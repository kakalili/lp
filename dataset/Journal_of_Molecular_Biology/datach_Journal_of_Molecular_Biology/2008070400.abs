heterodimer formation within universal stress protein classes revealed by an in silico and experimental approach
universal stress proteins usps are found in all kingdoms of life and can be divided into four classes by phylogenic analysis according to available structures usps exist as homodimers and genetic studies show that their cellular assignments are extensive including functions relating to stress resistance carbon metabolism cellular adhesion motility and bacterial virulence we approached the question of how usps can achieve such a variety of functions in a cell by using a new procedure for statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments based on physicochemically related values for each amino acid residue of usp dimer interfaces the results predicted that usp proteins within a class may in addition to forming homodimers be able to form heterodimers using escherichia coli usps as model proteins we confirmed the existence of such interactions we especially focused on class i uspa and uspc and demonstrated that they are able to form homo and heterodimers in vitro and in vivo we suggest that this ability to form both homo and heterodimers may allow for an expansion of the functional repertoire of usps and explains why organisms usually contain multiple usp paralogues
