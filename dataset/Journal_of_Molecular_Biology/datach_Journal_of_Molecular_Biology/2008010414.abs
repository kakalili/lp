divergence of cofactor recognition across evolution coenzyme a binding in a prokaryotic arylamine n acetyltransferase
arylamine n acetyltransferase nat enzymes are widespread in nature they serve to acetylate xenobiotics and or endogenous substrates using acetyl coenzyme a coa as a cofactor conservation of the architecture of the nat enzyme family from mammals to bacteria has been demonstrated by a series of prokaryotic nat structures together with the recently reported structure of human nat  we report here the cloning purification kinetic characterisation and crystallographic structure determination of nat from mycobacterium marinum a close relative of the pathogenic mycobacterium tuberculosis we have also determined the structure of m marinum nat in complex with coa shedding the first light on cofactor recognition in prokaryotic nats surprisingly the principal coa recognition site in m marinum nat is located some    from the site of coa recognition in the recently deposited structure of human nat bound to coa the structure explains the ping pong bi bi reaction mechanism of nat enzymes and suggests mechanisms by which the acetylated enzyme intermediate may be protected recognition of coa in a much wider groove in prokaryotic nats suggests that this subfamily may accommodate larger substrates than is the case for human nats and may assist in the identification of potential endogenous substrates it also suggests the cofactor binding site as a unique subsite to target in drug design directed against nat in mycobacteria
