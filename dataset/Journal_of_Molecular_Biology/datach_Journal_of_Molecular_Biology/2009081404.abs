structure and disorder in an unfolded state under nondenaturing conditions from ensemble models consistent with a large number of experimental restraints
obtaining detailed structural models of disordered states of proteins under nondenaturing conditions is important for a better understanding of both functional intrinsically disordered proteins and unfolded states of folded proteins extensive experimental characterization of the drk n terminal sh domain unfolded state has shown that although it appears to be highly disordered it possesses significant nonrandom secondary and tertiary structure in our previous attempts to generate structural models of the unfolded state using the program ensemble we were limited by insufficient experimental restraints and conformational sampling in this study we have vastly expanded our experimental restraint set to include h   n residual dipolar couplings small angle x ray scattering measurements nitroxide paramagnetic relaxation enhancements o induced  c paramagnetic shifts hydrogen exchange protection factors and  n r data in addition to the previously used nuclear overhauser effects amino terminal cu   ni  binding paramagnetic relaxation enhancements j couplings chemical shifts hydrodynamic radius and solvent accessibility restraints we have also implemented a new ensemble calculation methodology that uses iterative conformational sampling and seeks to calculate the simplest possible ensemble models as a result we can now generate ensembles that are consistent with much larger experimental data sets than was previously possible although highly heterogeneous and having broad molecular size distributions the calculated drk n terminal sh domain unfolded state ensembles have very different properties than expected for random or statistical coils and possess significant nonnative  helical structure and both native like and nonnative tertiary structure
