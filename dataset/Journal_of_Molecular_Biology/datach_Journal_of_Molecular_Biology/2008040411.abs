switching antibody specificity through minimal mutation
antibody e  which was elicited with a hexachloronorbornene derivative and catalyzes the diels  alder reaction between tetrachlorothiophene dioxide and n ethylmaleimide with high efficiency was successfully reengineered to bind a range of structurally diverse steroids with nanomolar affinities remarkably two mutations leuh trp argh  trp out of  total sequence differences suffice to switch the selectivity of e to that of the progesterone binding antibody db  in contrast to the double mutant which tightly binds multiple steroids with differently configured a  b ring junctions the individual leuh trp and argh  trp single mutants both exhibit significantly greater specificity than db  preferentially binding   pregnan   ol  one kd   nm over other steroids these findings illustrate how easily differently shaped binding pockets can be created through subtle changes to the same primordial germ line template
