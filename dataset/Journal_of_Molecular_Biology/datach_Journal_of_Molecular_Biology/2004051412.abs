atp dependent transcriptional activation by bacterial pspf aaa protein
transcription activation by bacterial   dependent enhancer binding proteins ebps requires their tri nucleotide hydrolysis to restructure the   rna polymerase rnap  ebps share sequence similarity with guanine nucleotide binding proteins and atpases associated with various cellular activities aaa proteins especially in the mononucleotide binding p loop fold using the phage shock protein f pspf ebp we identify p loop residues responsible for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis consistent with their roles in other p loop ntpases we show the refined low resolution structure of an ebp pspf revealing a hexameric ring organisation characteristic of aaa proteins functioning of ebps involves atp binding higher oligomer formation and atp hydrolysis coupled to the restructuring of the rnap this is thought to be a highly coordinated multi step process but the nucleotide driven mechanism of oligomerisation and atp hydrolysis is little understood our kinetic and structural data strongly suggest that three pspf dimers assemble to form a hexamer upon nucleotide binding during the atp hydrolysis cycle both atp and adp are bound to oligomeric pspf in line with a sequential hydrolysis cycle we identify a putative r finger and show its involvement in atp hydrolysis substitution of this arginine residue results in nucleotide independent formation of hexameric rings structurally linking the putative r finger and by inference a specific nucleotide interaction to the control of pspf oligomerisation
