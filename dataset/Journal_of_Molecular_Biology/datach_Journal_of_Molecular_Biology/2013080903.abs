regulation of lipoprotein assembly secretion and fatty acid  oxidation by kr ppel like transcription factor klf
lipid metabolism is coordinately regulated through signaling networks that integrate biochemical pathways of fat assimilation mobilization and utilization excessive diversion of fat for storage is a key risk factor for many fat related human diseases dietary lipids are absorbed from the intestines and transported to various organs and tissues to provide energy and maintain lipid homeostasis in humans disparity between triglycerides tg synthesis and removal via mitochondrial  oxidation and vldl very low density lipoprotein secretion causes excessive tg accumulation in the liver the mutation in caenorhabditis elegans klf  leads to high tg accumulation in the worm s intestine our previous data suggested that klf  regulates lipid metabolism by promoting fatty acid  oxidation depletion of cholesterol in the diet has no effect on fat deposition in klf  ok   mutants addition of vitamin d in the diet however increases fat levels in klf  worms this suggests that excess vitamin d may be lowering the rate of fatty acid  oxidation with the eventual increase in fat accumulation we also demonstrate that mutation in klf  reduces expression of c elegans dsc  and or vit genes the orthologs of mammalian microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein b respectively both microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and apolipoprotein b are essential for mammalian lipoprotein assembly and transport and mutation in both dsc  qm   and vit  ok   results in high fat accumulation in worm intestine genetic interactions between klf  and dsc  as well as vit  genes suggest that klf  may have an important role in regulating lipid assembly and secretion
