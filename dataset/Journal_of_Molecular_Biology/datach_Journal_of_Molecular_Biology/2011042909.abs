crystal structure of glucansucrase from the dental caries pathogen streptococcus mutans
glucansucrase gsase from streptococcus mutans is an essential agent in dental caries pathogenesis here we report the crystal structure of s mutans glycosyltransferase gtf si  which synthesizes soluble and insoluble glucans and is a glycoside hydrolase gh family  gsase in the free enzyme form and in complex with acarbose and maltose resolution of the gtf si structure confirmed that the domain order of gtf si is circularly permuted as compared to that of gh family    amylases as a result domains a b and iv of gtf si are each composed of two separate polypeptide chains structural comparison of gtf si and amylosucrase which is closely related to gh family  amylases indicated that the two enzymes share a similar transglycosylation mechanism via a glycosyl enzyme intermediate in subsite    on the other hand novel structural features were revealed in subsites  and  of gtf si trp  provided the platform for glycosyl acceptor binding while tyr   asn  and ser   which are conserved in family  enzymes but not in family  enzymes comprised subsite   based on the structure of gtf si and amino acid comparison of gtf si gtf i and gtf s asp  in gtf si appeared to be the most critical point for acceptor sugar orientation influencing the transglycosylation specificity of gsases that is whether they produced insoluble glucan with      glycosidic linkages or soluble glucan with      linkages the structural information derived from the current study should be extremely useful in the design of novel inhibitors that prevent the biofilm formation by gtf si
