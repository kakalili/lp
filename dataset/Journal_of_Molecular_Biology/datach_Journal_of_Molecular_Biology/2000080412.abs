on the role of the n terminal group in the allosteric function of glucosamine  phosphate deaminase from escherichia coli edited by a fersht
glucosamine  phosphate deaminase ec      from escherichia coli is an allosteric enzyme of the k type activated by n acetylglucosamine  phosphate it is a homohexamer and has six allosteric sites located in clefts between the subunits the amino acid side chains in the allosteric site involved in phosphate binding are arg   lys  and ser  from one subunit and the n terminal amino group from the facing polypeptide chain to study the functional role of the terminal amino group we utilized a specific non enzymic transamination reaction and we further reduced the product with borohydride to obtain the corresponding enzyme with a terminal hydroxy group several experimental controls were performed to assess the procedure including reconditioning of the enzyme samples by refolding chromatography allosteric activation by n acetylglucosamine  phosphate became of the k v mixed type in the transaminated protein its kinetic study suggests that the allosteric equilibrium for this modified enzyme is displaced to the r state with the consequent loss of co operativity the deaminase with a terminal hydroxy acid obtained by reducing the transaminated enzyme showed significant recovery of the catalytic activity and its allosteric activation pattern became similar to that found for the unmodified enzyme it had lost however the ph dependence of homotropic co operativity shown by the unmodified deaminase in the ph range    these results show that the terminal amino group plays a part in the co operativity of the enzyme and more importantly indicate that the loss of this co operativity at low ph is due to the hydronation of this amino group
