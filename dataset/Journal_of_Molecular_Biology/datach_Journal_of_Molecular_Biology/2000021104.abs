lead is unusually effective in sequence specific folding of dna edited by i tinoco
dna quadruplex structures based on the guanine quartet are typically stabilized by monovalent cations such as k  na  or nh  certain divalent cations can also induce quadruplex formation such as sr  here we show that pb  binds with unusually high affinity to the thrombin binding aptamer d ggttggtgtggttgg  inducing a unimolecular folded structure at micromolar concentrations the binding is stoichiometric and a single lead cation suffices to fold the aptamer the lead induced changes in uv and cd spectra are characteristic of folded quadruplexes although the long wavelength cd maximum occurs at   nm rather than the typical value of   nm the one dimensional exchangeable proton nmr spectrum shows resonances expected for imino protons involved in guanine quartet base pairing furthermore two dimensional nmr experiments reveal noe contacts typically seen in folded structures formed by guanine quartets such as the k form of the thrombin aptamer only sequences capable of forming guanine quartets appear to bind pb  tightly and change conformation this sequence specific tight dna binding may be relevant to possible genotoxic effects of lead in the environment
