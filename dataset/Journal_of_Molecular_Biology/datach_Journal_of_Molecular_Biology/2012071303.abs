the three dimensional structural basis of type ii hyperprolinemia
type ii hyperprolinemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in   pyrroline  carboxylate dehydrogenase p cdh also known as aldh a  the aldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the oxidation of glutamate semialdehyde to glutamate here we report the first structure of human p cdh hsp cdh and investigate the impact of the hyperprolinemia associated mutation of ser  to leu on the structure and catalytic properties of the enzyme the     resolution crystal structure of hsp cdh was determined using experimental phasing structures of the mutant enzymes s  a      and s  l      were determined to elucidate the structural consequences of altering ser   structures of the   identical mouse p cdh complexed with sulfate ion     resolution  glutamate      and nad      were determined to obtain high resolution views of the active site together the structures show that ser  occupies a hydrophilic pocket and is connected via water mediated hydrogen bonds to catalytic cys   mutation of ser  to leu is shown to abolish catalytic activity and eliminate nad binding analysis of the s  a mutant shows that these functional defects are caused by the introduction of the nonpolar leu  side chain rather than the removal of the ser  hydroxyl the s  l structure shows that the mutation induces a dramatic   rearrangement of the catalytic loop because of this conformational change ser  is not positioned to interact with the aldehyde substrate conserved glu  is no longer poised to bind nad  and cys  faces the wrong direction for nucleophilic attack these structural alterations render the enzyme inactive
