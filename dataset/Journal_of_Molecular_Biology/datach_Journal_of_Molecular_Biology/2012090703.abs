structural analysis of the substrate recognition mechanism in o phosphoserine sulfhydrylase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon aeropyrum pernix k
l cysteine is synthesized from o acetyl l serine oas and sulfide by o acetylserine sulfhydrylase oass ec      in plants and bacteria o phosphoserine sulfhydrylase opss ec      is a novel enzyme from the hyperthermophilic aerobic archaeon aeropyrum pernix k     opss can use oas or o phospho l serine ops to synthesize l cysteine to elucidate the mechanism of the substrate specificity of opss we analyzed three dimensional structures of the active site of the enzyme the active site lysine k   of opss forms an internal schiff base with pyridoxal   phosphate therefore crystals of the complexes formed by the k  a mutant with the external schiff base of pyridoxal   phosphate with either ops or oas were prepared and examined by x ray diffraction analysis in contrast to that observed for oass no significant difference was seen in the overall structure between the free and complexed forms of opss the side chains of t   s   and q  interacted with the carboxylate of the substrates as a previous study has suggested the side chain of r  has been proposed to recognize the phosphate group of ops surprisingly however the position of r  was significantly unchanged in the complex of the opss k  a mutant with the external schiff base allowing enough space for an interaction with ops the positively charged environment around the entrance of the active site including s  and r  is important for accepting negatively charged substrates such as ops
