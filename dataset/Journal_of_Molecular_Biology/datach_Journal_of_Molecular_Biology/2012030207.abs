modifications modulate anticodon loop dynamics and codon recognition of e coli trnaarg
three of six arginine codons are read by two trnaarg isoacceptors in escherichia coli the anticodon stem and loop of these isoacceptors aslarg   differs only in that the position  cytidine of trnaarg is posttranscriptionally modified to  thiocytidine s c   the trnaarg  are also modified at positions   inosine i  and    methyladenosine m a   to investigate the roles of modifications in the structure and function we analyzed six aslarg  constructs differing in their array of modifications by spectroscopy and codon binding assays thermal denaturation and circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that modifications contribute thermodynamic and base stacking properties resulting in more order but less stability nmr derived structures of the aslarg  showed that the solution structures of the asls were nearly identical surprisingly none possessed the u turn conformation required for effective codon binding on the ribosome yet all aslarg  constructs efficiently bound the cognate cgu codon three asls with i  were able to decode cgc whereas only the singly modified aslarg  icg with i  was able to decode cga the dissociation constants for all codon bindings were physiologically relevant        m  however with the introduction of s c  or m a  to aslarg  icg the maximum amount of asl bound to cgu and cgc was significantly reduced these results suggest that by allowing loop flexibility the modifications modulate the conformation of the aslarg   which takes one structure free in solution and two others when bound to the cognate arginyl trna synthetase or to codons on the ribosome where modifications reduce or restrict binding to specific codons
