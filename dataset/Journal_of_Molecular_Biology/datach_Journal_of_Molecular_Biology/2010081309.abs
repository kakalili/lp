a critical assessment of putative gatekeeper interactions in the villin headpiece helical subdomain
the helical subdomain of the villin headpiece hp  is one of the smallest naturally occurring proteins that folds cooperatively its small size rapid folding and simple three helix topology have made it an extraordinary popular model system for computational theoretical and experimental studies of protein folding aromatic  proline interactions involving trp  and pro  have been proposed to play a critical role in specifying the subdomain fold by acting as gatekeeper residues note that the numbering corresponds to full length headpiece mutation of pro  has been shown to lead to a protein that does not fold but this may arise for two different reasons the residue may make interactions that are critical for the specificity of the fold or the mutation may simply destabilize the domain in the first case the protein cannot fold while in the second the small fraction of molecules that do fold adopt the correct structure the modest stability of the wild type prevents a critical analysis of these interactions because even moderately destabilizing mutations lead to a very small folded state population using a hyperstable variant of hp  denoted dm hp  as our new wild type we characterized a set of mutants designed to assess the role of the putative gatekeeper interactions four single mutants dm pro ala dm trp leu dm trp lys and dm trp ala and a double mutant dm pro ala trp leu were prepared all mutants are less stable than dm hp  but all are well folded as judged by cd and h nmr all of the mutants display sigmoidal thermal unfolding and urea induced unfolding curves double mutant cycle analysis shows that the interactions between pro  and trp  are weak but favorable interactions involving pro  and proline  aromatic interactions are thus not required for specifying the subdomain fold the implications for the design and thermodynamics of miniature proteins are discussed
