importance of the     interaction in escherichia coli rnase p rna substrate complexes for cleavage and metal ion coordination
we have studied an interaction the      interaction   between residues   in m rna the catalytic subunit of escherichia coli rnase p and   in the trna precursor substrate the    interaction is part of the  rcca rnase p rna interaction   which anchors the   r  cca motif of the substrate to m rna interacting residues underlined  considering that in a large fraction of trna precursors residue   is base paired to nucleotide   immediately   of the cleavage site formation of the    interaction results in exposure of the cleavage site we show that the nature orientation of the    interaction is important for cleavage site recognition and cleavage efficiency our data further suggest that this interaction is part of a metal ion binding site and that specific chemical groups are likely to act as ligands in binding of mg  or other divalent cations important for function we argue that this mg  is involved in metal ion cooperativity in m rna mediated cleavage moreover we suggest that the    interaction operates in concert with displacement of residue   in the substrate to ensure efficient and correct cleavage the possibility that the residue at   binds to a specific binding surface pocket in m rna is discussed our data finally rationalize why the preferred residue at position   in m rna is u
