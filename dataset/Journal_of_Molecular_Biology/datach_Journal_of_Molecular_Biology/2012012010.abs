structure and kinetic stability of the p  tetramerization domain
the p  family of transcription factors  comprising p  p  and p   plays an important role in tumor prevention and development essential to their function is the formation of tetramers allowing cooperative binding to their dna response elements we solved crystal structures of the human p  tetramerization domain showing that p  forms a dimer of dimers with d symmetry composed of highly intertwined monomers the primary dimers are formed via an intramolecular  sheet and hydrophobic helix packing h  a hallmark of all p  family members like p  but unlike p  p  requires a second helix h  to stabilize the architecture of the tetramer in order to investigate the impact of structural differences on tetramer stability we measured the subunit exchange reaction of p  family homotetramers by nanoflow electrospray mass spectrometry there were differences in both the kinetics and the pattern of the exchange reaction with the p  and p  tetramers exhibiting much faster exchange kinetics than p  the structural similarity between p  and p  rationalizes previous observations that p  and p  form mixed tetramers and the kinetic data reveal the dissociation of the p  homotetramers as the rate limiting step for heterotetramer formation differential stability of the tetramers may play an important role in the cross talk between different isoforms and regulation of p  p  and p  function in the cell cycle
