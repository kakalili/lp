interactions at the dimer interface influence the relative efficiencies for purine nucleotide synthesis and pyrophosphorolysis in a phosphoribosyltransferase
enzymes that salvage  oxopurines including hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferases hprts  are potential targets for drugs in the treatment of diseases caused by protozoan parasites for this reason a number of high resolution x ray crystal structures of the hprts from protozoa have been reported although these structures did not reveal why hprts need to form dimers for catalysis they revealed the existence of potentially relevant interactions involving residues in a loop of amino acid residues adjacent to the dimer interface but the contributions of these interactions to catalysis remained poorly understood the loop referred to as active site loop i contains an unusual non proline cis peptide and is composed of residues that are structurally analogous with leu  lys  and gly  in the human hprt functional analyses of site directed mutations k d k e k n k p and k r in the hprt from trypanosoma cruzi etiologic agent of chagas disease show that the side chain at position  can differentially influence the km values for all four substrates as well as the kcat values for both imp formation and pyrophosphorolysis also the results for the k p mutant are inconsistent with a cis  trans peptide isomerization assisted catalytic mechanism these data together with the results of structural studies of the k r mutant reveal that the side chain of residue  does not participate directly in reaction chemistry but it strongly influences the relative efficiencies for imp formation and pyrophosphorolysis and the prevalence of lysine at position  in the hprt of the majority of eukaryotes is consistent with there being a biological role for nucleotide pyrophosphorolysis
