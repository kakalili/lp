maturation of shark single domain ignar antibodies evidence for induced fit binding
sharks express an unusual heavy chain isotype called ignar whose variable regions bind antigen as independent soluble domains to further probe affinity maturation of the ignar response we structurally characterized the germline and somatically matured versions of a type ii variable v region both in the presence and absence of its antigen hen egg white lysozyme despite a disulfide bond linking complementarity determining regions cdrs  and  both germline and somatically matured v regions displayed significant structural changes in these cdrs upon complex formation with antigen somatic mutations in the ignar v region serve to increase the number of contacts with antigen as reflected by a tenfold increase in affinity and one of these mutations appears to stabilize the cdr region in addition a residue in the hv loop plays an important role in antibody  antigen interaction consistent with the high rate of somatic mutations in this non cdr loop
