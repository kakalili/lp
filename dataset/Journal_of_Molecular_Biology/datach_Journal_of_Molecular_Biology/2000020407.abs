structural comparison of the phob and ompr dna binding transactivation domains and the arrangement of phob molecules on the phosphate box edited by p e wright
phob is a transcriptional activator that binds to the phosphate box in the promoters of the phosphate genes of escherichia coli phob contains two functional domains an n terminal phosphorylation domain and a c terminal dna binding transactivation domain here the three dimensional structure of the dna binding transactivation domain has been determined by nmr it consists of an n terminal four stranded  sheet a central three helical bundle and a c terminal  hairpin the second and third helices form a helix turn helix hth variant containing a longer turn than the corresponding turn of the classical hth motif the overall architecture is very close to that of the ompr dna binding transactivation domain however the conformation of the long turn region of phob a putative interaction site for the rna polymerase  subunit is entirely different from that of the corresponding turn of ompr which interacts with the  subunit in addition the third helix of phob is three amino acid residues longer than the corresponding helix of ompr the binding site of phob is a tgtca sequence and the phospahte box contains the two binding sites nmr studies of the complexes of the phob dna binding transactivation domain bound to several different dna molecules have revealed that two phob molecules bind in a tandem array on the phosphate box in each complex of phob the third helix of the dna binding transactivation domain is likely to recognize the tgtca sequence from the major groove of dna and the c terminal  hairpin contacts on the minor groove of the   site out of the tgtca sequence in a non specific manner the long turn region facing outward is likely to interact with the  subunit
