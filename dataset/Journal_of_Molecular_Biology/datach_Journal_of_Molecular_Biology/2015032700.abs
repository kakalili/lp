heterodimers of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases suggest existence of a higher organization level of transferases in the membrane of the trans golgi apparatus
tyrosine sulfation of proteins is an important post translational modification shown to play a role in many membrane associated or extracellular processes such as virus entry blood clotting antibody mediated immune response inflammation and egg fecundation the sole two human enzymes that transfer sulfate moieties from   phospho adenosine   phospho sulfate onto tyrosine residues tpst and tpst  are anchored to the membranes of the trans golgi compartment with the catalytic domain oriented to the lumen in contrast to the relatively well studied organization of medial golgi enzymes the organization of trans golgi transferases remains elusive although tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases are known to exist as homodimers in the golgi membranes this organization level may represent only a small piece of a puzzle that is linked to the entire picture here we report the formation of tpst tpst heterodimers and a novel interaction between either tpst or tpst and the    sialyltransferase indicating a higher organization level of tyrosylprotein sulfotransferases that may serve for substrate selectivity and or effective organization of multiple post translational modification of proteins
