functional implications of the conformational switch in aicd peptide upon binding to grb sh domain
it has been hypothesized previously that synergistic effect of both amyloid precursor protein intracellular c terminal domain aicd and a  aggregation could contribute to alzheimer s disease pathogenesis structural studies of aicd have found no stable globular fold over a broad range of ph present work is based on the premises that a conformational switch involving the flipping of c terminal helix of aicd would be essential for effective binding with the src homology  sh  domain of growth factor receptor binding protein  grb  and subsequent initiation of grb mediated endo lysosomal pathway high resolution crystal structures of grb sh domain bound to aicd peptides reveal a unique mode of binding where the peptides assume a noncanonical conformation that is unlike other structures of aicd peptides bound to protein tyrosine binding domains or that of its free state rather a flipping of the c terminal helix of aicd is evident the involvement of different aicd residues in grb sh interaction is further elucidated through fluorescence based assays our results reveal the significance of a specific interaction of the two molecules to optimize the rapid transport of aicd inside endosomal vesicles presumably to reduce the cytotoxic load
