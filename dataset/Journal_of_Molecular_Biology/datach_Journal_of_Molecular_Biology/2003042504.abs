peptide library approach with a disulfide tether to refine the tom  recognition motif in mitochondrial presequences
many mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as precursor proteins with an n terminal presequence and are imported into the mitochondria although no distinct sequence homology has been found among mitochondrial presequences tom  a general import receptor in the outer mitohcondrial membrane binds to presequences and distinguishes mitochondrial proteins from non mitochonrial proteins the recently determined structure of the cytosolic domain of tom   tom  in a complex with the presequence of rat aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh showed that a short stretch of the presequence forms an amphiphilic helix and its hydrophobic surface interacts with the hydrophobic binding groove of tom  the following nmr analyses revealed a common five residue pattern for tom  binding in five different presequences to refine the common amino acid motif for the recognition by tom  we introduced a new peptide library approach in this study we prepared a mixture of aldh presequence variants tethered these peptides to  tom  in a competitive manner by an intermolecular disulfide bond and determined the relative affinities by maldi tof mass spectrometry we successfully deduced a refined common motif for the recognition by tom  and found that the segment consisting of residues     of the aldh presequence was locally optimized in the sequence space with respect to tom  binding
