structure of the murine unglycosylated igg fc fragment
a prototypic igg antibody can be divided into two major structural units the antigen binding fragment fab and the fc fragment that mediates effector functions the igg fc fragment is a homodimer of the two c terminal domains ch and ch  of the heavy chains characteristic of the fc part is the presence of a sugar moiety at the inner face of the ch domains the structure of this complex branched oligosaccharide is generally resolved in crystal structures of fc fragments due to numerous well defined sugar  protein interactions and a small number of sugar  sugar interactions this suggested that sugars play an important role in the structure of the fc fragment to address this question directly we determined the crystal structure of the unglycosylated fc fragment of the murine igg mak  the structures of the ch domains of the unglycosylated fc fragment superimpose perfectly with the structure of the isolated mak  ch domain the unglycosylated ch domains in contrast approach each other much more closely compared to known structures of partly deglycosylated fc fragments with rigid body motions between  and     leading to a strongly  closed  conformation of the unglycosylated fc fragment the glycosylation sites in the c  e loop and the bc and fg loops are well defined in the unglycosylated ch domain however with increased mobility and with a significant displacement of about     for the unglycosylated asn residue compared to the glycosylated structure thus glycosylation both stabilizes the c  e loop conformation within the ch domain and also helps to ensure an  open  conformation as seen upon fc receptor binding these structural data provide a rationale for the observation that deglycosylation of antibodies often compromises their ability to bind and activate fc  receptors
