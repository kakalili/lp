autotransporter  domains have a specific function in protein secretion beyond outer membrane targeting
autotransporters ats of gram negative bacteria contain an n proximal passenger domain that is transported to the extracellular milieu and a c terminal  domain that inserts into the outer membrane om in a  barrel conformation this  domain facilitates translocation of the passenger domain across the om and has long been considered to be the translocation pore however available crystal structures of  domains show that the  barrel pore is too narrow for the observed transport of folded elements within the passenger domains ats have recently been shown to interact with the  barrel assembly machinery these findings questioned a direct involvement of the  domain in passenger translocation and suggested that it may only target the passenger to the  barrel assembly machinery pore to address the function of the  domain in more detail we have replaced the  domain of the escherichia coli at hemoglobin protease by  domains originating from other om proteins furthermore we have modified the diameter of the  domain pore the mutant proteins were analyzed for their capacity to insert into the om and for surface display of the passenger our results show that efficient passenger secretion requires a specific  domain that not only functions as a targeting device but also is directly involved in the translocation of the passenger to the cell surface
