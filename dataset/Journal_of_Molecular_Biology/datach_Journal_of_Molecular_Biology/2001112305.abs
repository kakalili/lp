protease c of erwinia chrysanthemi the crystal structure and role of amino acids y  and e   edited by r huber
prtc a metallo protease secreted by erwinia chrysanthemi is a member of the serralysin family and hence belongs to the metzincin superfamily while the crystal structures of representatives of all metzincin subfamilies have been elucidated in the past there is still some controversy about the reaction mechanism and the role of certain characteristic amino acids in the active centre in this study we probed the role of tyr  and glu  by site directed mutagenesis and x ray crystallography there is evidence that these residues participate in catalysis although conflicting hypotheses have been proposed the crystal structures of wild type and mutants have been refined to an rfree of about   at resolutions of    or better exchange of glu  versus alanine reduces the catalytic efficiency to less than   using resorufin casein as substrate and to about  using an assay utilising the thiol ester ac pro leu gly sleu leu gly oet the drop in activity is caused by a reduction in kcat while the km values are virtually the same in the resorufin casein assay the mutant y  f shows about  of the wild type activity and in the thiol ester assay this increases to about   in the latter case the km value of the mutant is increased from   mm to   mm with only little reduction in kcat the different behaviour of this mutant with respect to the two substrates can be explained by a switch in the rate determining step during catalysis the study presented here provides clear evidence that glu  of the hexxhxxgxxh motif is the catalytic base while tyr  is more likely involved in substrate binding and the stabilisation of the tetrahedral transition state
