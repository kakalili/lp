structural and functional characterization of plasmodium falciparum nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase namnat is an indispensable enzyme for the synthesis of nad and nad phosphate it catalyzes the adenylylation of nicotinic acid mononucleotide namn to yield nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide naad  since nad h and nad phosphate h are essentially involved in metabolic and redox regulatory reactions namnat is an attractive drug target in the fight against bacterial and parasitic infections notably namnat of the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum possesses only   sequence identity with the homologous human enzyme here we present for the first time the two x ray structures of p falciparum namnat pfnamnat  in the product bound state with naad and complexed with an    non hydrolizable atp analog  the structures were determined to a resolution of    and    respectively the overall architecture of pfnamnat was found to be more similar to its bacterial homologs than its human counterparts although the pphk motif conserved in bacteria is missing furthermore pfnamnat possesses two cysteine residues within the active site that have not been described for any other namnatase so far and are likely to be involved in redox regulation of pfnamnat activity enzymatic studies and surface plasmon resonance data reveal that pfnamnat is capable of utilizing namn and nicotinamide mononucleotide with a slight preference for namn surprisingly a comparison with the active site of escherichia coli namnat showed very similar architectures despite different substrate preferences
