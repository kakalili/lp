multiple mechanisms for e f binding inhibition by phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein c terminal domain
the retinoblastoma protein c terminal domain rbc is necessary for the tumor suppressor protein s activities in growth suppression and e f transcription factor inhibition cyclin dependent kinase phosphorylation of rbc contributes to rb inactivation and weakens the rb e f inhibitory complex here we demonstrate two mechanisms for how rbc phosphorylation inhibits e f binding we find that phosphorylation of s  and s  weakens the direct association between the n terminal portion of rbc rbcn and the marked box domains of e f and its heterodimerization partner dp phosphorylation of these sites and s  s  also induces an intramolecular association between rbc and the pocket domain which overlaps with the site of e f transactivation domain binding a reduction in e f binding affinity occurs with s  s  phosphorylation that is additive with the effects of phosphorylation at other sites and we propose a structural mechanism that explains this additivity we find that different rb phosphorylation events have distinct effects on activating e f family members which suggests a novel mechanism for how rb may differentially regulate e f activities
