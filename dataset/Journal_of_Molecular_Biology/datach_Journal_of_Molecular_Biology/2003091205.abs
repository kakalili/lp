the crystal structure and mutational analysis of human nudt
human adp ribose pyrophosphatase nudt belongs to a superfamily of nudix hydrolases that catabolize potentially toxic compounds in the cell the enzyme hydrolyzes adp ribose adpr to amp and ribose   phosphate nudt shares   sequence identity with the c terminal cytoplasmic domain of the adpr gated calcium channel trpm  which exhibits low but specific enzyme activity we determined crystal structures of nudt in the presence and in the absence of the reaction product ribose   phosphate on the basis of these structures and comparison with a bacterial homologue a model of the substrate complex was built the structure and activity of a double point mutant r  e  f  to r  i  l   which mimics the nudix signature of the ion channel domain was determined finally the activities of a pair of additional mutated constructs were compared to the wild type enzyme the first corresponds to a minimal nudix domain missing an n terminal domain and c terminal tail the second disrupts two potential general bases in the active site nudt contains an n terminal domain with a novel fold and a catalytic c terminal nudix domain unlike its closest functional homologue homodimeric escherichia coli adprase  it is active as a monomer and the substrate is bound in a cleft between the domains the structure of the ril mutant provides structural basis for the reduced activity of the trpm ion channel the conformation and binding interactions of adpr substrate are predicted to differ from those observed for e coli adprase mutation of structurally aligned acidic residues in their active sites produce significantly different effects on catalytic efficiency indicating that their reaction pathways and mechanisms may have diverged
