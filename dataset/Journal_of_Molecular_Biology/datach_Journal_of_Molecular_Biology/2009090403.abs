histone deacetylases regulate multicellular development in the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum
epigenetic modifications of histones regulate gene expression and lead to the establishment and maintenance of cellular phenotypes during development histone acetylation depends on a balance between the activities of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases hdacs and influences transcriptional regulation in this study we analyse the roles of hdacs during growth and development of one of the cellular slime moulds the social amoeba dictyostelium discoideum the inhibition of hdac activity by trichostatin a results in histone hyperacetylation and a delay in cell aggregation and differentiation cyclic amp oscillations are normal in starved amoebae treated with trichostatin a but the expression of a subset of camp regulated genes is delayed bioinformatic analysis indicates that there are four genes encoding putative hdacs in d discoideum using biochemical genetic and developmental approaches we demonstrate that one of these four genes hdab is dispensable for growth and development under laboratory conditions a knockout of the hdab gene results in a social context dependent phenotype hdab cells develop normally but sporulate less efficiently than the wild type in chimeras we infer that hdac activity is important for regulating the timing of gene expression during the development of d discoideum and for defining aspects of the phenotype that mediate social behaviour in genetically heterogeneous groups
