structure of the rack dimer from saccharomyces cerevisiae
receptor for activated c kinase  rack  serves as a scaffolding protein in numerous signaling pathways involving kinases and membrane bound receptors from different cellular compartments it exists simultaneously as a cytosolic free form and as a ribosome bound protein as part of the  s ribosomal subunit it triggers translational regulation by establishing a direct link between protein kinase c and the protein synthesis machinery it has been suggested that rack could recruit other signaling molecules onto the ribosome providing a signal specific modulation of the translational process rack is able to dimerize both in vitro and in vivo this homodimer formation has been observed in several processes including the regulation of the n methyl d aspartate receptor by the fyn kinase in the brain and the oxygen independent degradation of hypoxia inducible factor  the functional relevance of this dimerization is however still unclear and the question of a possible dimerization of the ribosome bound protein is still pending here we report the first structure of a rack homodimer as determined from two independent crystal forms of the saccharomyces cerevisiae rack protein also known as asc p at   and     resolution the structure reveals an atypical mode of dimerization where monomers intertwine on blade  thus exposing a novel surface of the protein to potential interacting partners we discuss the significance of the dimer structure for rack function
