crystal structures of penicillin acylase enzyme substrate complexes structural insights into the catalytic mechanism edited by k nagai
the crystal structure of penicillin g acylase from escherichia coli has been determined to a resolution of    from a crystal form grown in the presence of ethylene glycol to study aspects of the substrate specificity and catalytic mechanism of this key biotechnological enzyme mutants were made to generate inactive protein useful for producing enzyme substrate complexes owing to the intimate association of enzyme activity and precursor processing in this protein family the ntn hydrolases  most attempts to alter active site residues lead to processing defects mutation of the invariant residue arg b  results in the accumulation of a protein precursor form however the mutation of asn b   a residue implicated in stabilisation of the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis inactivates the enzyme but does not prevent autocatalytic processing or the ability to bind substrates the crystal structure of the asn b  ala oxyanion hole mutant enzyme has been determined in its native form and in complex with penicillin g and penicillin g sulphoxide we show that asn b  has an important role in maintaining the active site geometry and in productive substrate binding hence the structure of the mutant protein is a poor model for the michaelis complex for this reason we subsequently solved the structure of the wild type protein in complex with the slowly processed substrate penicillin g sulphoxide analysis of this structure suggests that the reaction mechanism proceeds via direct nucleophilic attack of ser b on the scissile amide and not as previously proposed via a tightly h bonded water molecule acting as a  virtual  base
