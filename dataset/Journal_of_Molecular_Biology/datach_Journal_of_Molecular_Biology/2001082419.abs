analysis of rapid large scale protein quaternary structural changes time resolved x ray solution scattering of nudaurelia capensis  virus n v maturation edited by d rees
time resolved small angle x ray scattering tr saxs was used to study the kinetics of a large conformational change that occurs during the maturation of an icosahedral virus virus like particles vlps of the t  non enveloped rna virus nudaurelia capensis  virus n v were shown to undergo a large ph dependent conformational change electron cryo microscopy cryoem and x ray solution scattering were used to show that the precursor vlp procapsid was   larger in diameter than the resulting capsid which was shown by the cryoem study to closely resemble the infectious mature virion the procapsid form of the vlps was observed at ph   and was converted to the capsid form at ph   static saxs measurements of the vlps in solutions ranging between these ph values determined that the half titration point of the transition was ph   time resolved saxs experiments were performed on vlp solutions by initiating a ph change from   to   using a stopped flow device and the time scale of the conformational change occurred in the subsecond range using a less drastic ph change lowering the ph to   or    the conformational change occurred more slowly on the subminute or minute time scale with the detection of a fast forming intermediate in the transition further characterization using static saxs measurements showed that the conformational change was initially reversible but became irreversible after autoproteolytic maturation was about   complete in addition to characterizing the large quaternary conformational change we have been able for the first time to demonstrate that it takes place on the subsecond time scale a regime comparable to that observed in other multisubunit assemblies
