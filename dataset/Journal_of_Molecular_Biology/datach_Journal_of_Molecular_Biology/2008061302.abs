classical nls proteins from saccharomyces cerevisiae
proteins can enter the nucleus through various receptor mediated import pathways one class of import cargos carries a classical nuclear localization signal cnls containing a short cluster of basic residues this pathway involves importin   imp   which possesses the cnls binding site and importin   imp   which translocates the import complex through the nuclear pore complex the defining criteria for a cnls protein from saccharomyces cerevisiae are an in vivo import defect in imp  and imp  mutants direct binding to purified imp  and stimulation of this binding by imp  we show for the first time that endogenous s cerevisiae proteins prp  cdc  swi  cdc  and clb fulfill all of these criteria identifying them as authentic yeast cnls cargos furthermore we found that the targeting signal of prp  is a bipartite cnls and that of cdc is a monopartite cnls basic residues present within these motifs are of different significance for the interaction with imp  we determined the binding constants for import complexes containing the five cnls proteins by surface plasmon resonance spectrometry the dissociation constants for cnls    complexes differ considerably ranging from  nm for cdc to   nm for swi  suggesting that the nuclear import kinetics is determined by the strength of cnls imp  binding imp  enhances the affinity of imp  for cnlss approximately   fold this stimulation of cnls binding to imp  results from a faster association in the presence of imp  whereas the dissociation rate is unaffected by imp  this implies that after entry into the nucleus the release of imp  by the ran guanosine triphosphatase ran gtpase from the import complex is not sufficient to dissociate the cnls imp  subcomplex our observation that the nucleoporin nup  which had been previously shown to release the cnls from imp  in vitro is required for efficient import of all the genuine cnls cargos supports a general role of nup in import termination
