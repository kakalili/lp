thermodynamic properties of bpti variants with highly simplified amino acid sequences
we report the first detailed thermodynamic analysis of simplified proteins by differential scanning calorimetry dsc  the experiments were carried out with five simplified bpti variants whose structures and activities have been reported in which several residues not essential for specifying the tertiary structure were replaced by alanine in most aspects the thermodynamics of simplified proteins were very similar to if not essentially identical with those of natural proteins in particular they undergo a highly cooperative two state thermal unfolding process with a large enthalpy change which is a thermodynamic hallmark of the native state of natural globular proteins furthermore the specific enthalpy and entropy changes upon unfolding at    c were close to values invariably observed for small natural globular proteins   j g   and   j k   g   respectively  on the other hand two simplified bpti variants bpti  and bpti   containing  and  alanine residues  were enthalpically stabilized while entropically destabilized with respect to the reference bpti    molecule this peculiar type of entropy  enthalpy compensation is in sharp contrast to the usual enthalpy destabilization entropy stabilization observed in mutational studies of natural proteins overall we conclude that a thermodynamic native state can be achieved by proteins encoded with extensively simplified sequences
