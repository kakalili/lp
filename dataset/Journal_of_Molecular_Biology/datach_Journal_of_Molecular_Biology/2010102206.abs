crystal structure of  hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase lina from sphingobium japonicum ut
lina from sphingobium japonicum ut  catalyzes two steps of dehydrochlorination from  hexachlorocyclohexane hch to     tetrachloro   cyclohexadiene via  pentachlorocyclohexene we determined the crystal structure of lina at     by single anomalous dispersion lina exists as a homotrimer and each protomer forms a cone shaped    barrel fold the c terminal region of lina is extended to the neighboring subunit unlike that of scytalone dehydratase from magnaporthe grisea which is one of the most structurally similar proteins identified by the dali server the structure we obtained in this study is in open form in which  hch can enter the active site there is a hydrophobic cavity inside the barrel fold and the active site is largely surrounded by the side chains of k  l  v  d  w  l  f  c  h  v  l  i   f   and r   h  was considered to function as a base that abstracts the proton of  hch through its interaction with d  docking simulations with  hch and  pentachlorocyclohexene suggest that  residues k  i  l  v  l  i   a   f   a   c   and t   are involved in the binding of these compounds and support the degradation mechanism
