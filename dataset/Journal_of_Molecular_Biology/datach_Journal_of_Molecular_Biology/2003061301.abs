structure based analysis of gpcr function conformational adaptation of both agonist and receptor upon leukotriene b binding to recombinant blt
we produced the human leukotriene b  ltb  receptor blt  a g protein coupled receptor in escherichia coli with yields that are sufficient for the first structural characterization of this receptor in solution overexpression was achieved through codon optimization and the search for optimal refolding conditions of blt recovered from inclusion bodies the detergent solubilized receptor displays a d fold compatible with a seven transmembrane tm domain with ca    helix and an essential disulfide bridge circular dichroism evidence  it binds ltb with ka        m   and a stoichiometric ratio of        antagonistic effects were investigated using a synthetic molecule that shares common structural features with ltb  we report evidence that both partners ltb and blt  undergo a rearrangement of their respective conformations upon complex formation  i a departure from planarity of the ltb conjugated triene moiety  ii a change in the environment of trp   tm vi helix and in the exposure of the cytoplasmic region of this transmembrane helix
