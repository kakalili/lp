insights into the regulatory landscape of the lysine riboswitch
a prevalent means of regulating gene expression in bacteria is by riboswitches found within mrna leader sequences like protein repressors these rna elements must bind an effector molecule with high specificity against a background of other cellular metabolites of similar chemical structure to elicit the appropriate regulatory response current crystal structures of the lysine riboswitch do not provide a complete understanding of selectivity as recognition is substantially mediated through main  chain atoms of the amino acid using a directed set of lysine analogs and other amino acids we have determined the relative contributions of the polar functional groups to binding affinity and the regulatory response our results reveal that the lysine riboswitch has gt   fold specificity for lysine over other amino acids the aptamer is highly sensitive to the precise placement of the  amino group and relatively tolerant of alterations to the main  chain functional groups in order to achieve this specificity at low nucleotide triphosphate ntp concentrations we observe good agreement between the half maximal regulatory activity t  and the affinity of the receptor for lysine kd  as well as many of its analogs however above   m ntp  the concentration of lysine required to elicit transcription termination rises moving into the riboswitch into a kinetic control regime these data demonstrate that under physiologically relevant conditions riboswitches can integrate both effector and ntp concentrations to generate a regulatory response appropriate for global metabolic state of the cell
