crystal structures of urtica dioica agglutinin and its complex with tri n acetylchitotriose edited by r huber
urtica dioica agglutinin is a small plant lectin that binds chitin we purified the isolectin vi uda vi and crystal structures of the isolectin and its complex with tri n acetylchitotriose nag  were determined by x ray analysis the uda vi consists of two domains analogous to hevein and the backbone folding of each domain is maintained by four disulfide bridges the sequence similarity of the two domains is not high    but their backbone structures are well superimposed except some loop regions the chitin binding sites are located on the molecular surface at both ends of the dumbbell shape molecule the crystal of the nag complex contains two independent molecules forming a protein sugar   complex one nag molecule is sandwiched between two independent uda vi molecules and the other sugar molecule is also sandwiched by one uda vi molecule and symmetry related another one the sugar binding site of n terminal domain consists of three subsites accommodating nag while two nag residues are bound to the c terminal domain in each sugar binding site three aromatic amino acid residues and one serine residue participate to the nag binding the sugar rings bound to two subsites are stacked to the side chain groups of tryptophan or histidine and a tyrosine residue is in face to face contact with an acetylamino group to which the hydroxyl group of a serine residue is hydrogen bonded the third subsite of the n terminal domain binds a nag moiety with hydrogen bonds the results suggest that the triad of aromatic amino acid residues is intrinsic in sugar binding of hevein like domains
