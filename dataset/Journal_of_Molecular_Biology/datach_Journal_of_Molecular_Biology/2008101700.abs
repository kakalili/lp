function of transmembrane domain ix in the na proline transporter putp
selected residues of transmembrane domain tm ix were previously shown to play key roles in ligand binding and transport in members of the na solute symporter family using the na proline transporter putp as a model a complete cys scanning mutagenesis of tm ix positions   to   was performed here to further investigate the functional significance of the domain g   s   q   and l  were newly identified as important for na coupled proline uptake placement of cys at one of these positions altered km pro  s  c and l  c   and  fold decreased respectively q  c   fold increased  k  na  s  c   fold decreased q  c   fold increased  and or vmax g  c s  c q  c and l  c        and  fold decreased compared to putp wild type  respectively  membrane permeant n ethylmaleimide inhibited proline uptake into cells containing putp with cys at distinct positions in the middle t  c and cytoplasmic half of tm ix c   l  c v  c and s  c and had little or no effect on all other single cys putp variants the inhibition pattern was in agreement with the pattern of labeling with fluorescein  maleimide in addition cys placed into the cytoplasmic half of tm ix c   l  c v  c and s  c was protected from fluorescein  maleimide labeling by proline while na alone had no effect membrane impermeant methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium modified cys in the middle a  c and t  c and periplasmic half l  c but not in the cytoplasmic half of tm ix in intact cells furthermore cys at the latter positions was partially protected by na but not by proline based on these results a model is discussed according to which residues of tm ix participate in the formation of ligand sensitive hydrophilic cavities in the protein that may reconstitute part of the na and or proline translocation pathway of putp
