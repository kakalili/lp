the identification of similarities between biological networks application to the metabolome and interactome
the increasing interest in systems biology has resulted in extensive experimental data describing networks of interactions or associations between molecules in metabolism protein  protein interactions and gene regulation comparative analysis of these networks is central to understanding biological systems we report a novel method phunkee pairing subgraphs using network environment equivalence by which similar subgraphs in a pair of networks can be identified like other methods phunkee explicitly considers the graphical form of the data and allows for gaps however it is novel in that it includes information about the context of the subgraph within the adjacent network we also explore a new approach to quantifying the statistical significance of matching subgraphs we report similar subgraphs in metabolic pathways and in protein  protein interaction networks the most similar metabolic subgraphs were generally found to occur in processes central to all life such as purine pyrimidine and amino acid metabolism the most similar pairs of subgraphs found in the protein  protein interaction networks of drosophila melanogaster and saccharomyces cerevisiae also include central processes such as cell division but interestingly also include protein sub  networks involved in pre mrna processing the inclusion of network context information in the comparison of protein interaction networks increased the number of similar subgraphs found consisting of proteins involved in the same functional process this could have implications for the prediction of protein function
