correlating protein  dna and protein  protein interaction networks
here we search protein  dna binding data for prevalent pairs and higher order tuples of co occurring transcription factors tf in saccharomyces cerevisiae while the identification of such modules is dependent on uncertainties of genome wide data sets we find several biologically meaningful examples which allow putative annotation of yet unclassified genes for the frequently occurring transcriptional module mcm fkh ndd  we identified several new target genes involved in cell cycle control and filament formation using large scale protein interaction data we demonstrate a significant correlation between co occurrence of tf binding sites and the vicinity in the protein interaction network in particular we find that directly interacting transcription factors and those which are members of a protein complex are more likely to occur together as putative dna binding modules
