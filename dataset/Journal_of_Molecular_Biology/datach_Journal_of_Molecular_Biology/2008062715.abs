protein quaternary structure and expression levels contribute to peroxisomal targeting sequence  mediated peroxisomal import of human soluble epoxide hydrolase
the peroxisomal targeting sequence  pts  is a consensus tripeptide  s c a k r h l m that is found at the c terminus of most peroxisomal proteins however the only known mammalian protein containing a terminal methionine pts  skm  human soluble epoxide hydrolase hseh  shows both peroxisomal and cytosolic localizations in vivo mechanisms regulating the subcellular localization of hseh thus remain unclear here we utilized green fluorescent protein  hseh fusion constructs to study the peroxisomal targeting of hseh in transiently and stably transfected chinese hamster ovary cells our results suggest that the peroxisomal import of hseh is regulated by three factors first we show that skm is required but not sufficient for peroxisomal import second by manipulating protein expression levels we show that skm mediates peroxisomal import of wild type hseh only when expression levels are high third we show that amino acid modifications that decrease subunit oligomerization and presumably enhance accessibility of the skm motif confer peroxisomal targeting even at low protein expression levels we conclude that in hseh skm is a necessary but inefficient and context dependent pts  peroxisomal import occurs when expression levels are high or when the skm motif is accessible these results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the cell specific and tissue specific localization of hseh in vivo
