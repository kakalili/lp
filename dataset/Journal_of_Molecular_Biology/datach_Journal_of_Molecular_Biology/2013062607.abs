discrete molecular dynamics study of oligomer formation by n terminally truncated amyloid  protein
in alzheimer s disease ad  amyloid  protein a  self assembles into toxic oligomers of the two predominant a  alloforms a     and a     the latter is particularly strongly linked to ad n terminally truncated and pyroglutamated a  peptides were recently shown to seed a  aggregation and contribute significantly to a  mediated toxicity yet their folding and assembly were not explored computationally discrete molecular dynamics approach previously captured in vitro derived distinct a     and a     oligomer size distributions and predicted that the more toxic a     oligomers had more flexible and solvent exposed n termini than a     oligomers here we examined oligomer formation of a     a     a      and a     by the discrete molecular dynamics approach the four n terminally truncated peptides showed increased oligomerization propensity relative to the full length peptides consistent with in vitro findings conformations formed by a      had significantly more flexible and solvent exposed n termini than a      conformations in contrast in a       conformations the n termini formed more contacts and were less accessible to the solvent the compactness of the a       conformations was in part facilitated by val  two single amino acid substitutions that reduced and abolished hydrophobicity at position   respectively resulted in a proportionally increased structural variability our results suggest that a     and a     oligomers might be less toxic than a     and a     oligomers and offer a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed increased toxicity of a     and a     and their pyroglutamated forms
