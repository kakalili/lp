structure and energetics of protein  protein interactions the role of conformational heterogeneity in omtky binding to serine proteases
proteins with flexible binding surfaces can interact with numerous binding partners however this promiscuity is more difficult to understand in  rigid body  proteins whose binding results in little or no change in the position of backbone atoms the binding of kazal inhibitors to serine proteases is considered a classic case of rigid body binding although they bind to a wide range of proteases we have studied the thermodynamics of binding of the kazal serine protease inhibitor turkey ovomucoid third domain omtky  to the serine protease subtilisin carlsberg using isothermal titration calorimetry and have determined the crystal structure of the complex at very high resolution     comparison of the binding energetics and structure to other omtky interactions demonstrates that small changes in the position of side chains can make significant contributions to the binding thermodynamics including the enthalpy of binding these effects emphasize that small   rigid body  proteins are still dynamic structures and these dynamics make contributions to both the enthalpy and entropy of binding interactions
