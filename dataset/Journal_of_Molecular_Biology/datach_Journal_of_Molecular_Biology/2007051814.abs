a clathrin caveolae and dynamin independent endocytic pathway requiring free membrane cholesterol drives hiv  internalization and infection in polarized trophoblastic cells
in human trophoblastic cells a correlation between early endosomal trafficking of hiv  and virus infection was previously documented however if hiv  is massively internalized in these cells the endocytic pathway s responsible for viral uptake is still undefined here we address this vital question amongst all the putative endocytic pathways present in polarized trophoblastic cells we demonstrate that hiv  infection of these cells is independent of clathrin mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis importantly treatment with the cholesterol sequestering drug filipin severely impairs virus internalization whereas the cholesterol depleting compound methyl  cyclodextrin has no impact on this pathway moreover viral internalization is unaffected by overexpression of a mutant dynamin  or treatment with a kinase or tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor thus hiv  infection in polarized trophoblastic cells occurs primarily via a clathrin caveolae and dynamin independent pathway requiring free cholesterol notably even though hiv  did not initially co localize with transferrin some virions migrate at later time points to transferrin enriched endosomes suggesting an unusual transit from the non classical pathway to early endosomes finally virus internalization in these cells does not involve the participation of microtubules but relies partly on actin filaments collectively these findings provide unprecedented information on the route of hiv  internalization in polarized human trophoblasts
