a minor capsid protein p  is essential for bacteriophage prd capsid assembly edited by m gottesman
bacteriophage prd is a double stranded dna virus infecting gram negative hosts it has a membrane component located in the interior of the isometric capsid in addition to the major capsid protein p  the capsid contains a  kda protein p  protein p  is proposed to be located between the adjacent facets of the icosahedral capsid and is required for stable capsid assembly in its absence an empty phage specific membrane vesicle is formed the major protein component of this vesicle is a phage encoded assembly factor protein p  that is not present in the final structure
