mechanistic basis of zidovudine hypersusceptibility and lamivudine resistance conferred by the deletion of codon  in the hiv  reverse transcriptase coding region
deletions in the      hairpin loop of human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase rt are associated with the emergence of multidrug resistance common mutational patterns involve the deletion of asp     and mutations such as k r and t  f or t  y or the deletion of thr     and mutations of the q  m complex human immunodeficiency virus type  clones containing   in a multidrug resistant sequence background including the q  m complex and substitutions k  n y  c m  v and g  a showed high level resistance to all tested nucleoside rt inhibitors in a multidrug resistant sequence context the deletion increases viral replication capacity by itself    conferred increased susceptibility to  d     azido   deoxythymidine azt and  l         dideoxy   thiacytidine resistance here we use transient kinetics to show that in a wild type sequence background    does not affect the discrimination between azt triphosphate and   deoxythymidine   triphosphate but decreases the catalytic efficiency of the incorporation of  l         dideoxy   thiacytidine triphosphate relative to   deoxycytidine   triphosphate in comparison with the wild type rt the   mutant showed decreased ability to excise primers terminated with azt monophosphate in the presence of atp or pyrophosphate ppi  these data support the role of the excision mechanism in mediating azt hypersusceptibility in addition we demonstrate that the deletion has no effect on resistance to foscarnet a ppi analogue on phenotypic and nucleotide incorporation assays carried out with viral clones and recombinant enzymes respectively the results of molecular modeling studies suggest that the side chains of lys  asp  and lys  could play an important role in azt hypersusceptibility mediated by    whereas in the absence of thr  local structural rearrangements affecting the      and   a    loops of the  kda subunit of the rt could reduce the accessibility of the ppi donor to the terminating nucleotide at the   end of the primer
