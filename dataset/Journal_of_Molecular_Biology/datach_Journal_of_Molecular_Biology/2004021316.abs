thermodynamic dissection of the binding energetics of proline rich peptides to the abl sh domain implications for rational ligand design
the inhibition of the interactions between sh domains and their targets is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy to date rational design of potent ligands for these domains has been hindered by the lack of understanding of the origins of the binding energy we present here a complete thermodynamic analysis of the binding energetics of the p  proline rich decapeptide apsysppppp to the sh domain of the c abl oncogene isothermal titration calorimetry experiments have revealed a thermodynamic signature for this interaction very favourable enthalpic contributions opposed by an unfavourable binding entropy inconsistent with the highly hydrophobic nature of the p  ligand and the abl sh binding site our structural and thermodynamic analyses have led us to the conclusion having once ruled out any possible ionization events or conformational changes coupled to the association that the establishment of a complex hydrogen bond network mediated by water molecules buried at the binding interface is responsible for the observed thermodynamic behaviour the origin of the binding energetics for proline rich ligands to the abl sh domain is further investigated by a comparative calorimetric analysis of a set of p  related ligands the striking effects upon the enthalpic and entropic contributions provoked by conservative substitutions at solvent exposed positions in the ligand confirm the complexity of the interaction the implications of these results for rational ligand design are discussed
