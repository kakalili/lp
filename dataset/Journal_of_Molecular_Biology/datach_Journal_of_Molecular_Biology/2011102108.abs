a new structural form in the sam metal dependent o  methyltransferase family myce from the mycinamicin biosynthetic pathway
o linked methylation of sugar substituents is a common modification in the biosynthesis of many natural products and is catalyzed by multiple families of s adenosyl l methionine sam or adomet dependent methyltransferases mts  mycinamicins potent antibiotics from micromonospora griseorubida can be methylated at two positions on a  deoxyallose substituent the first methylation is catalyzed by myce a sam and metal dependent mt crystal structures were determined for myce bound to the product s adenosyl l homocysteine adohcy and magnesium both with and without the natural substrate mycinamicin vi this represents the first structure of a natural product sugar mt in complex with its natural substrate myce is a tetramer of a two domain polypeptide comprising a c terminal catalytic mt domain and an n terminal auxiliary domain which is important for quaternary assembly and for substrate binding the symmetric myce tetramer has a novel mt organization in which each of the four active sites is formed at the junction of three monomers within the tetramer the active site structure supports a mechanism in which a conserved histidine acts as a general base and the metal ion helps to position the methyl acceptor and to stabilize a hydroxylate intermediate a conserved tyrosine is suggested to support activity through interactions with the transferred methyl group from the sam methyl donor the structure of the free enzyme reveals a dramatic order  disorder transition in the active site relative to the s adenosyl l homocysteine complexes suggesting a mechanism for product substrate exchange through concerted movement of five loops and the polypeptide c terminus
