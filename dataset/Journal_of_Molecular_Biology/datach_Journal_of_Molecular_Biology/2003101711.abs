crystal structure of putidaredoxin the  fe  s component of the p  cam monooxygenase system from pseudomonas putida
stability of the  fe  s containing putidaredoxin pdx  the electron donor to cytochrome p  cam in pseudomonas putida was improved by mutating non ligating cysteine residues cys  and cys  to serine singly and in combination the increasing order of stability is cys ser cys ser gt cys ser gt cys ser gt wt pdx crystal structures of cys ser cys ser and cys ser mutants of pdx solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing using the  fe  s iron atoms to    and    resolution respectively are nearly identical and very similar to those of bovine adrenodoxin adx and escherichia coli ferredoxin however unlike the adx structure no motion between the core and interaction domains of pdx is observed this higher conformational stability of pdx might be due to the presence of a more extensive hydrogen bonding network at the interface between the two structural domains around the conserved his  in particular formation of a hydrogen bond between the side chain of tyr  and the carbonyl oxygen atom of glu  and the presence of two well ordered water molecules linking the interaction domain and the c terminal peptide to the core of the molecule are unique to pdx the folding topology of the nmr model is similar to that of the x ray structure of pdx the overall rmsd of c  positions between the two models is     the largest positional differences are observed for residues     and     in the loop regions and the c terminus the latter two peptides display conformational heterogeneity in the crystal structures owing to flexibility the aromatic ring of the c terminal trp  can closely approach the side chains of asp  and thr         or move away and leave the active site solvent exposed therefore trp   previously shown to be important in the pdr to pdx and pdx to p  cam electron transfer reactions is in a position to regulate and or mediate electron transfer to or from the  fe  s center of pdx
