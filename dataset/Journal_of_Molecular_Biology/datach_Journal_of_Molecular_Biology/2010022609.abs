functional analysis of human trna isodecoders
trna isodecoders share the same anticodon but have differences in their body sequence an unexpected result from genome sequencing projects is the identification of a large number of trna isodecoder genes in mammalian genomes in the reference human genome more than   isodecoder genes are present among the approximately   trna genes distributed among  isoacceptor families whether sequence diversity among isodecoder trna genes reflects functional variability is an open question to address this we developed a method to quantify the efficiency of trna isodecoders in stop codon suppression in human cell lines first a green fluorescent protein gfp gene that contains a single uag stop codon at two distinct locations is introduced gfp is only produced when a trna suppressor containing cua anticodon is co transfected with the gfp gene the suppression efficiency is examined for  trna isodecoders all contain cua anticodon   derived from four isoacceptor families of trnaser genes  from five families of trnaleu genes and  from three families of trnaala genes we found that isodecoder trnas display a large difference in their suppression efficiency among those with above background suppression activity differences of up to  fold were observed we were able to tune trna suppression efficiency by subtly adjusting the trna sequence and inter convert poor suppressors into potent ones we also demonstrate that isodecoder trnas with varying suppression efficiencies have similar stability and exhibit similar levels of aminoacylation in vivo our results indicate that naturally occurring trna isodecoders can have large functional variations and suggest that some trna isodecoders may perform a function distinct from translation
