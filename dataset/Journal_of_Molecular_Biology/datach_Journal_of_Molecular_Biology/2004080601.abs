scanning force microscopy of dna translocation by the type iii restriction enzyme ecop i
type iii restriction enzymes are multifunctional heterooligomeric enzymes that cleave dna at a fixed position downstream of a non symmetric recognition site for effective dna cleavage these restriction enzymes need the presence of two unmethylated inversely oriented recognition sites in the dna molecule dna cleavage was proposed to result from atp dependent dna translocation which is expected to induce dna loop formation and collision of two enzyme  dna complexes we used scanning force microscopy to visualise the protein interaction with linear dna molecules containing two ecop i recognition sites in inverse orientation in the presence of the cofactors atp and mg  ecop i molecules were shown to bind specifically to the recognition sites and to form dna loop structures one of the origins of the protein clipped dna loops was shown to be located at an ecop i recognition site the other origin had an unspecific position in between the two ecop i recognition sites the data demonstrate for the first time dna translocation by the type iii restriction enzyme ecop i using scanning force microscopy moreover our study revealed differences in the dna translocation processes mediated by type i and type iii restriction enzymes
