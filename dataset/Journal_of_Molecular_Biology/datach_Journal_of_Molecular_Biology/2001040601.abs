sequence dependence of translational positioning of core nucleosomes edited by t richmond
the basis for the choice of translational position of a histone octamer on dna is poorly understood to gain further insights into this question we have studied the translational and rotational settings of core particles assembled on a simple repeating  bp positioning sequence we show that the translational positions of the core particles assembled on this sequence are invariant with respect to the dna sequence and occur at  bp intervals certain modifications of the original sequence reduce the spacing of possible dyads to  bp at least one of these alters both the translational and rotational settings we conclude that the translational position of a core particle is specified by sequence determinants additional to those specifying rotational positioning the rotational settings on either side of the dyads of core particles assembled on the wild type and a mutant sequence differ by  bp corresponding to an overall helical periodicity of     bp the average helical periodicity of the central two to four turns is      bp whilst that of the flanking dna is closer to  bp the dna immediately flanking the dyad is also characterised by a more extensive susceptibility to cleavage by hydroxyl radical
