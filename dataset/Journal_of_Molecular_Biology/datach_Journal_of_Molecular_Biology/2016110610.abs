an adaptive mutation in enterococcus faecium liar associated with antimicrobial peptide resistance mimics phosphorylation and stabilizes liar in an activated state
the cyclic antimicrobial lipopeptide daptomycin dap triggers the liafsr membrane stress response pathway in enterococci and many other gram positive organisms liar is the response regulator that upon phosphorylation binds in a sequence specific manner to dna to regulate transcription in response to membrane stress in clinical settings non susceptibility to dap by enterococcus faecium is correlated frequently with a mutation in liar of trp  to cys liarw c  we have determined the structure of the activated e faecium liar protein at    resolution and in combination with solution studies show that the activation of liar induces the formation of a liar dimer that increases liar affinity at least  fold for the extended regulatory regions upstream of the liafsr and liaxyz operons in vitro liarw c induces phosphorylation independent dimerization of liar and provides a biochemical basis for non susceptibility to dap by the upregulation of the liafsr regulon a comparison of the e faecalis liar e faecium liar and the liar homolog from staphylococcus aureus vrar and the mutations associated with dap resistance suggests that physicochemical properties such as oligomerization state and dna specificity although tuned to the biology of each organism share some features that could be targeted for new antimicrobials
