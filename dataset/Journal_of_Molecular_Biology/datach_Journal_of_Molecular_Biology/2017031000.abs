regulation of calcium homeostasis by er redox a close up of the er mitochondria connection
calcium signaling plays an important role in cell survival by influencing mitochondria related processes such as energy production and apoptosis the endoplasmic reticulum er is the main storage compartment for cell calcium ca        m  and the ca  released by the er has a prompt effect on the homeostasis of the juxtaposed mitochondria recent findings have highlighted a close connection between er redox and ca  signaling that is mediated by ca  handling proteins this paper describes the redox regulated mediators and mechanisms that orchestrate ca  signals from the er to mitochondria
