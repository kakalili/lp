large rotation of the n terminal domain of hsp  is important for interaction with some but not all client proteins
the  kda heat shock protein hsp  chaperones the late folding steps of many protein kinases transcription factors and a diverse set of other protein clients not related in sequence and structure hsp  s interaction with clients appears to be coupled to a series of conformational changes how these conformational changes contribute to its chaperone activity is currently unclear using crosslinking hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry and fluorescence experiments we demonstrate here that the n terminal domain of hsp  rotates by approximately    as compared to the crystal structure of yeast hsp  in complex with sba and amppnp surprisingly aha but not sba suppresses this rotation in the presence of amppnp but not in its absence a minimum length of the largely unstructured linker between n terminal and middle domain is necessary for this rotation and interfering with the rotation strongly affects the interaction with aha and the intrinsic and aha stimulated atpase activity surprisingly suppression of the rotation only affects the activity of some clients and does not compromise yeast viability
