atomic resolution structures of native copper nitrite reductase from alcaligenes xylosoxidans and the active site mutant asp glu
we provide the first atomic resolution  lt     structure of a copper protein nitrite reductase and of a mutant of the catalytically important asp  residue d e  the atomic resolution where carbon  carbon bonds of the peptide become clearly resolved remains a key goal of structural analysis despite much effort and technological progress still very few structures are known at such resolution for example in the protein data bank pdb there are some   structures of copper proteins but the highest resolution structure is that of amicyanin a small  kda protein which has been resolved to     here we present the structures of wild type copper nitrite reductase wtnir from alcaligenes xylosoxidans   kda monomer  the  half apo  recombinant native protein and the d e mutant at      and    resolutions respectively these structures provide the basis from which to build a detailed mechanism of this important enzyme
