the n terminal domain of p  is natively unfolded
p  is one of the key molecules regulating cell proliferation apoptosis and tumor suppression by integrating a wide variety of signals the structural basis for this function is still poorly understood p  appears to exercise its function as a modular protein in which different functions are associated with distinct domains presumably p  contains both folded and partially structured parts here we have investigated the structure of the isolated n terminal part of p  amino acid residues     using biophysical techniques we demonstrate that this domain is devoid of tertiary structure and largely missing secondary structure elements it exhibits a large hydrodynamic radius typical for unfolded proteins these findings suggest strongly that the entire n terminal part of p  is natively unfolded under physiological conditions furthermore the binding affinity to its functional antagonist mdm was investigated a comparison of the binding of human mdm to the n terminal part of p  and full length p  suggests that unfolded and folded parts of p  function synergistically
