the crystal structure of bacillus subtili lipase a minimal    hydrolase fold enzyme   edited by r huber  this paper is dedicated to the memory of professor charles colson louvain la neuve who initiated the molecular research on bacillus subtilis lipase
the x ray structure of the lipase lipa from bacillus subtilis has been determined at    resolution it is the first structure of a member of homology family i  of bacterial lipases the lipase shows a compact minimal    hydrolase fold with a six stranded parallel  sheet flanked by five  helices two on one side of the sheet and three on the other side the catalytic triad residues ser  asp  and his   and the residues forming the oxyanion hole backbone amide groups of ile  and met  are in positions very similar to those of other lipases of known structure however no lid domain is present and the active site nucleophile ser  is solvent exposed a model of substrate binding is proposed on the basis of a comparison with other lipases with a covalently bound tetrahedral intermediate mimic it explains the preference of the enzyme for substrates with c fatty acid chains
