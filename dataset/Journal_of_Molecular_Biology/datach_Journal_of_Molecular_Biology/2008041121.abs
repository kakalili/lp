compensatory and long range changes in picosecond  nanosecond main chain dynamics upon complex formation  n relaxation analysis of the free and bound states of the ubiquitin like domain of human plexin b and the small gtpase rac
the formation of a complex between rac and the cytoplasmic domain of plexin b is one of the first documented cases of a direct interaction between a small guanosine   triphosphatase gtpase and a transmembrane receptor structural studies have begun to elucidate the role of this interaction for the signal transduction mechanism of plexins mapping of the rac gtpase surface that contacts the rho gtpase binding domain of plexin b by solution nmr spectroscopy confirms the plexin domain as a gtpase effector protein regions neighboring the gtpase switch i and ii regions are also involved in the interaction and there is considerable interest to examine the changes in protein dynamics that take place upon complex formation here we present main chain nitrogen  relaxation measurements for the unbound proteins as well as for the rho gtpase binding domain and rac proteins in their complexed state derived order parameters s  show that considerable motions are maintained in the bound state of plexin in fact some of the changes in s on binding appear compensatory exhibiting decreased as well as increased dynamics fluctuations in rac  already a largely rigid protein on the picosecond  nanosecond timescale are overall diminished but isomerization dynamics in the switch i and ii regions of the gtpase are retained in the complex and appear to be propagated to the bound plexin domain remarkably fluctuations in the gtpase are attenuated at sites including helices   the rho specific insert helix    and   that are spatially distant from the interaction region with plexin this effect of binding on long range dynamics appears to be communicated by hinge sites and by subtle conformational changes in the protein similar to recent studies on other systems we suggest that dynamical protein features are affected by allosteric mechanisms altered protein fluctuations are likely to prime the rho gtpase  plexin complex for interactions with additional binding partners
