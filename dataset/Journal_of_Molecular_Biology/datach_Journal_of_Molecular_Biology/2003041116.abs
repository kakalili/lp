antiviral inhibition of the hiv  capsid protein
during the assembly stage of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv replication cycle several thousand copies of the viral gag polyprotein associate at the cell membrane and bud to form an immature non infectious virion gag is subsequently cleaved by the protease which liberates the capsid proteins for assembly into the polyprotein shell of the central core particle or capsid of the mature virus viral infectivity is critically dependent on capsid formation and stability making the capsid protein a potentially attractive antiviral target we have identified compounds that bind to an apical site on the n terminal domain of the hiv  capsid protein and inhibit capsid assembly in vitro one compound n  chloro  methylphenyl n       dimethylamino methyl  furyl methyl sulfanyl ethyl urea  cap   is well tolerated in cell cultures enabling in vivo antiviral and mechanistic studies cap  inhibits hiv  infectivity in a dose dependent manner but does not interfere with viral entry reverse transcription integration proteolytic processing or virus production indicating a novel antiviral mechanism significantly virus particles generated in the presence of cap  exhibit heterogeneous sizes and abnormal core morphologies consistent with inhibited ca  ca interactions during virus assembly and maturation these findings lay the groundwork for the development of assembly inhibitors as a new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of aids
