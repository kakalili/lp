function of tyrosyl trna synthetase in splicing group i introns an induced fit model for binding to the p p domain based on analysis of mutations at the junction of the p p stacked helices edited by d draper
we used an escherichia coli genetic assay based on the phage t td intron to test the ability of the neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase cyt  protein to suppress mutations that cause structural defects around its binding site in the p p domain of the group i intron catalytic core we analyzed all possible combinations of nucleotides at either p bp  or p bp  which together form the junction of the p p stacked helices and looked for synergistic effects in double mutants most mutations at either position inhibit self splicing but can be suppressed by cyt   cyt  can compensate efficiently for mutations that disrupt base pairing at either p bp  or p bp  for mutations at p bp  that disrupt the base triple interaction with j    and for nucleotide substitutions at either position that are predicted to be suboptimal for base stacking based on the analysis of dna four way junctions however cyt  has difficulty suppressing combinations of mutations at p bp  and p bp  that simultaneously disrupt base pairing and base stacking thermal denaturation and fe ii edta analysis showed that mutations at the junction of the p p stacked helices lead to grossly impaired tertiary structure formation centered in the p p domain cyt  suppressible mutants bind the protein with kd values up to  fold higher than that for the wild type intron but in all cases tested the koff value for the complex remains within twofold of the wild type value suggesting that the binding site can be formed properly and that the increased kd value reflects primarily an increased kon value for the binding of cyt  to the misfolded intron our results indicate that the p p junction is a linchpin region where even small nucleotide substitutions grossly disrupt the catalytically active group i intron tertiary structure and that cyt  binding induces the formation of the correct structure in this region leading to folding of the group i intron catalytic core
