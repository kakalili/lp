the distal c terminal region of the kcsa potassium channel is a ph dependent tetramerization domain
the intracellular c terminal domain ctd of kcsa a bacterial homotetrameric potassium channel is a  residue long segment that natively adopts a helical bundle conformation with  fold symmetry a hallmark of kcsa behavior is ph induced conformational change which leads to the opening of the channel at acidic ph previous studies have reached conflicting conclusions as to the role of the ctd in this transition here we investigate the involvement of this domain in ph mediated channel opening by nmr using a soluble peptide corresponding to residues      of the ctd ctd   at neutral ph ctd  exhibits concentration dependent spectral changes consistent with oligomer formation we prove this slowly tumbling species to be a tetramer with a dissociation constant of           m by nmr and sedimentation equilibrium experiments whereas monomeric ctd  is only mildly helical secondary chemical shifts prove that the tetrameric species adopts a tight native like helical bundle conformation the tetrameric species undergoes ph dependent dissociation and ctd  is fully monomeric below ph    the structural basis for this phenomenon is the destabilization of the tetrameric ctd  by protonation of residue h  in the monomeric form of the peptide we conclude that i the ctd  peptide is independently capable of forming a tetrameric helical bundle and ii this structurally significant conformational shift is modulated by the effects of solution ph on residue h   therefore the involvement of this domain in the ph gating of the channel is strongly suggested
