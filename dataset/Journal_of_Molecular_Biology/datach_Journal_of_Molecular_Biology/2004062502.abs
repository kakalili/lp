crystal structure of the schiff base intermediate prior to decarboxylation in the catalytic cycle of aspartate  decarboxylase
l aspartate  decarboxylase adc  encoded by the pand gene catalyzes the conversion of l aspartate into  alanine in the microorganisms   alanine is required for the synthesis of pantothenate vitamin b  which is the precursor of   phosphopantetheine and coenzyme a we have determined the crystal structure of helicobacter pylori adc a tetrameric enzyme in two forms the apo structure at    resolution and the isoasparagine complex structure at    resolution all subunits of the tetramer are self processed at the gly  ser  linkage producing the smaller  chain residues     and the larger  chain residues      each subunit contains nine  strands and three  helices it is folded into the double psi  barrel structure in the apo structure the new amino terminus of the  chain ser  is converted into a pyruvoyl group in the isoasparagine complex structure the substrate analog is covalently attached to the pyruvoyl group this structure represents the enzyme  substrate schiff base intermediate that was proposed to form prior to the decarboxylation step in the catalytic cycle of adc thus our study provides direct structural evidence for the reaction mechanism of adc
