modulation of an ectodomain motif in the influenza a virus neuraminidase alters tetherin sensitivity and results in virus attenuation in vivo
we previously demonstrated that ectodomain residue asp  in n neuraminidase na asp  in n na present in budding capable na proteins contributes to productive na plasma membrane transport partly by mediating escape from tetherin restriction yondola ma fernandes f belicha villanueva a uccelini m gao q carter c et al     budding capability of the influenza virus neuraminidase can be modulated by tetherin j virol          budding incapable na proteins contain a g at this position and either co expression of human immunodeficiency virus type  vpu or sirna mediated depletion of tetherin rescued budding capabilities in these proteins yondola ma fernandes f belicha villanueva a uccelini m gao q carter c et al     budding capability of the influenza virus neuraminidase can be modulated by tetherin j virol          furthermore replacement of d  with g in budding capable na proteins caused loss of function preventing release of na virus like particles vlps  here we show that mutation of this residue specifically modulates the ability of na to escape tetherin restriction at the plasma membrane and results in virus attenuation in vivo based on immunogold electron microscopy and co immunoprecipitation assays both nad  containing and nad  g containing proteins associated with tetherin in the endoplasmic reticulum er  however the nad  g loss of function mutant also associated with the host factor outside the er and in plasma membrane localized vlps as visualized using immunogold electron microscopy we conclude that the presence of aspartate at residue   liberates na from tetherin dependent restriction upon exit from the er compartment thus preventing restriction at the plasma membrane underscoring the importance of these observations knockdown of tetherin resulted in a     log increase in influenza virus growth additionally the loss of function mutation conferred attenuation in a mouse model of influenza infection as evidenced by a  fold increase in ld  and increases in either percent survival or time to death dependent on the administered dose in vivo
