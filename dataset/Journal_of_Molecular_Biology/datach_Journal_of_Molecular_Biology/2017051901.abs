protein kinases in pluripotency  beyond the usual suspects
post translational modification of proteins by phosphorylation plays a key role in regulating all aspects of eukaryotic biology embryonic stem cell esc pluripotency defined as the ability to differentiate into all cell types in the adult body is no exception maintenance and dissolution of pluripotency are tightly controlled by phosphorylation as a result key signalling pathways that regulate pluripotency have been identified and their functions well characterised amongst the best studied are the fibroblast growth factor fgf erk  pathway pi k akt the leukemia inhibitory factor lif jak stat axis wnt gsk signalling and the transforming growth factor tgf  family however these kinase pathways constitute only a small proportion of the protein kinase complement of pluripotent cells and there is accumulating evidence that diverse phosphorylation systems modulate esc pluripotency here we review recent progress in understanding the overarching role of phosphorylation in mediating communication from the cellular environment metabolism and cell cycle to the core pluripotency machinery
