increased chromatin association of sp in interphase cells by pp a mediated dephosphorylations
sp dephosphorylation by phosphatase a is related to sustained cellular proliferation and is illustrated by an enhanced electrophoretic migration shift this event occurs concurrently with cell cycle interphase and increases sp transcriptional activity and in vitro affinity for dna we show here that dephosphorylated sp is associated with chromatin more tightly than its phosphorylated counterparts from either resting or mitotic cells analysis of the expression of sp point mutants and use of a phospho specific antibody enabled identification of serine  as a major target of pp a during cell cycle interphase importantly serine  dephosphorylation appeared to up regulate sp association with chromatin various studies suggested that this might occur through the control of the reciprocal o phosphate o glcnac modification of other residues some of which are likely to belong to the sp c terminal dna binding domain in addition we demonstrated by phosphopeptide mapping that threonine   which belongs to the latter region is another target of pp a yet unrelated to serine   we propose that the coordinated dephosphorylation of several sp residues a general feature of dividing cells is a required post translational mechanism for sp dependent transcription of genes related to cell division
