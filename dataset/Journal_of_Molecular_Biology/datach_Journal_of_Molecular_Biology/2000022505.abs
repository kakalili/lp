projection structure of a transcriptional regulator hupr determined by electron cryo microscopy edited by m f moody
large well ordered two dimensional crystals of the histidine tagged hupr protein a transcriptional regulator from the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus were obtained by specific interaction with a ni  chelated lipid monolayer hupr is a response regulator of the ntrc subfamily it activates the transcription of the structural genes hupslc of nife hydrogenase a projection map of the full length protein at   resolution was obtained by electron cryo microscopy and image analysis of frozen hydrated two dimensional crystals the crystals have a p plane group with unit cell dimensions of a  b                     the structure of the n terminal domain of ntrc the family to which hupr belongs had been determined previously by nmr the atomic coordinates of the n terminal domain of ntrc were compared to the structure obtained by cryo electron microscope techniques of the whole hupr these results provide the first structure at medium resolution of a whole transcription factor hupr from the ntrc family
