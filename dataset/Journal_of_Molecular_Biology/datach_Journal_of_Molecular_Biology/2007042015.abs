haploinsuffciency for znf in znf    mice is associated with multiorgan abnormalities resembling myotonic dystrophy
myotonic dystrophy type  is caused by a cctg  ccug n repeat expansion in the first intron of the znf gene the pathomechanism for the myotonic dystrophies is not well understood and the role of znf in myotonic dystrophy type  pathogenesis has not been fully clarified we characterized znf    mice in which the expression of znf was significantly decreased and found that their phenotype reflects many of the features of myotonic dystrophy including muscle histological morphology and myotonic discharges and heart conduction abnormalities shown by electromyography and electrocardiogram analysis respectively znf is normally highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle where skeletal muscle chloride channel  clc  plays an important role clc expression was dramatically decreased in znf    mice znf transgenic mice raised znf and clc expression and rescued the myotonic dystrophy phenotype in znf    mice our results suggest that the znf haploinsufficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype in znf    mice
