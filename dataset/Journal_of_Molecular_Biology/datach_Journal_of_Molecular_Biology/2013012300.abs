native state heterogeneity of   microglobulin as revealed by kinetic folding and real time nmr experiments
the kinetic folding of   microglobulin from the acid denatured state was investigated by interrupted unfolding and interrupted refolding experiments using stopped flow double jump techniques in the interrupted unfolding we first unfolded the protein by a ph jump from ph  to ph   and the kinetic refolding assay was carried out by the reverse ph jump by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence similarly in the interrupted refolding we first refolded the protein by a ph jump from ph  to ph  and used a guanidine hydrochloride gdnhcl concentration jump as well as the reverse ph jump as unfolding assays based on these experiments the folding is represented by a parallel pathway model in which the molecule with the correct pro  cis isomer refolds rapidly with a rate constant of   s   while the molecule with the pro  trans isomer refolds more slowly ph  and   c  at the last step of folding the native like trans conformer produced on the latter pathway isomerizes very slowly        s   into the native cis conformer in the gdnhcl induced unfolding assays in the interrupted refolding the native like trans conformer unfolded remarkably faster than the native cis conformer and the direct gdnhcl induced unfolding was also biphasic indicating that the native like trans conformer is populated at a significant level under the native condition the one dimensional nmr and the real time nmr experiments of refolding further indicated that the population of the trans conformer increases up to    under a more physiological condition ph  and   c
