visualization of bacteriophage t capsids with dna incompletely packaged in vivo
the tightly packaged double stranded dna dsdna genome in the mature particles of many tailed bacteriophages has been shown to form multiple concentric rings when reconstructed from cryo electron micrographs however recent single particle dna packaging force measurements have suggested that incompletely packaged dna ipdna is less ordered when it is shorter than    of the full genome length the study presented here initially achieves both the isolation and the ipdna length based fractionation of ipdna containing t phage capsids ipdna capsids produced by dna packaging in vivo some ipdna has quantized lengths as judged by high resolution gel electrophoresis of expelled dna this is the first isolation of such particles among the tailed dsdna bacteriophages the ipdna capsids are a minor component containing      of packaged dna in all particles and are initially detected by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis after partial purification by buoyant density centrifugation the primary contaminants are aggregates of phage particles and empty capsids this study then investigates ipdna conformations by the first cryo electron microscopy of ipdna capsids produced in vivo the  d structures of dna free capsids ipdna capsids with various lengths of ipdna and mature bacteriophage are reconstructed which reveals the typical t l icosahedral shell of many tailed dsdna bacteriophages though the icosahedral shell structures of these capsids are indistinguishable at the current resolution for the protein shell       the conformations of the dna inside the shell are drastically different t ipdna capsids with    kb or shorter dsdna  lt   of total genome have an ipdna conformation indistinguishable from random however t ipdna capsids with   kb dna   of total genome form a single dna ring next to the inner surface of the capsid shell in contrast dsdna fully packaged    kb in mature t phage particles forms multiple concentric rings such as those seen in other tailed dsdna bacteriophages the distance between the icosahedral shell and the outermost dna ring decreases in the mature fully packaged phage structure these results suggest that in the early stage of dna packaging the dsdna genome is randomly distributed inside the capsid not preferentially packaged against the inner surface of the capsid shell and that the multiple concentric dsdna rings seen later are the results of pressure driven close packing
