Helicases are ubiquitous molecular motor proteins that have an important role in the metabolism of nucleic acids. The gene encoding a helicase was cloned from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The polypeptide of 398 amino acid residues has a molecular mass of 45 kDa, contains striking homology to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and all the conserved domains of the DEAD-box family. The recombinantly expressed and homogeneous P. falciparum protein PfH45 is an ATP-dependent DNA and RNA helicase, with ATPase and ATP-binding activities. PfH45 is a unique bipolar helicase that contains both the 3′ to 5′ and 5′ to 3′ directional helicase activities and anti-PfH45 antibodies curtail all its activities. PfH45 is expressed in all the intraerythrocytic developmental stages of the parasite and has a role in translation. Parasite cultures treated with PfH45 double-stranded RNA or purified immunoglobulins against PfH45 exhibited ∼60% and ∼55% growth inhibition, respectively. This inhibitory effect was due to interference with expression of the cognate messenger and down-regulation of synthesis of PfH45 protein in the parasite culture and was associated with morphologic deformation of the parasite. These studies indicate that PfH45 is an indispensable enzyme that is essential for growth, and probably survival, of P. falciparum.
