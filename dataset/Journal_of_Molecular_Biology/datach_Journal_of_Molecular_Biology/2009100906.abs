crystal structure of the glur amino terminal domain provides insights into the architecture and assembly of ionotropic glutamate receptors
ionotropic glutamate receptors are functionally diverse but have a common architecture including the   residue amino terminal domain atd  we report a    resolution crystal structure of human glur atd this dimeric structure provides a mechanism for how the atds can drive receptor assembly and subtype restricted composition lattice contacts in a    resolution crystal form reveal a tetrameric dimer  dimer arrangement consistent with previous cellular and cryo electron microscopic data for full length ampa receptors
