the kinetics of nucleation and growth of sickle cell hemoglobin fibers
polymerization of sickle cell hemoglobin hbs in deoxy state is one of the basic events in the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia for insight into the polymerization process we monitor the kinetics of nucleation and growth of the hbs polymer fibers we define a technique for the determination of the rates j and delay times  of nucleation and the fiber growth rates r of deoxy hbs fibers based on photolysis of co hbs by laser illumination we solve numerically time dependent equations of heat conductance and co transport coupled with respective photo chemical processes during kinetics experiments under continuous illumination after calibration with experimentally determined values we define a regime of illumination ensuring uniform temperature and deoxy hbs concentration and fast within lt  s egress to steady conditions with these procedures data on the nucleation and growth kinetics have relative errors of lt  and are reproducible within   in independent experiments the nucleation rates and delay times have steep exponential dependencies on temperature in contrast the average fiber growth rates only weakly depend on temperature the individual growth rates vary by up to   under identical conditions these variations are attributed to instability of the coupled kinetics and diffusion towards the growing end of a fiber the activation energy for incorporation of hbs molecules into a polymer is ea   kj mol   a low value indicating the significance of the hydrophobic contacts in the hbs polymer more importantly the contrast between the strong  t and weak r t dependencies suggests that the homogenous nucleation of hbs polymers occurs within clusters of a precursor phase this conclusion may have significant consequences for the understanding of the pathophysiology of sickle cell anemia and should be tested in further work
