structural comparison of fucosylated and nonfucosylated fc fragments of human immunoglobulin g
removal of the fucose residue from the oligosaccharides attached to asn  of human immunoglobulin g  igg  results in a significant enhancement of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc via improved igg binding to fc  receptor iiia to provide structural insight into the mechanisms of affinity enhancement we determined the crystal structure of the nonfucosylated fc fragment and compared it with that of fucosylated fc the overall conformations of the fucosylated and nonfucosylated fc fragments were similar except for hydration mode around tyr   stable isotope assisted nmr analyses confirmed the similarity of the overall structures between fucosylated and nonfucosylated fc fragments in solution these data suggest that the glycoform dependent adcc enhancement is attributed to a subtle conformational alteration in a limited region of igg fc furthermore the electron density maps revealed that the traces between asp  and asn  of our fucosylated and nonfucosylated fc crystals were both different from that in previously reported isomorphous fc crystals
