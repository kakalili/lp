a simple method for modeling transmembrane helix oligomers
we describe an effective procedure for modeling the structures of simple transmembrane helix homo oligomers the method differs from many previous approaches in that the only structural constraint we use to help select the correct model is the oligomerization state of the protein the method involves the following steps   perform      independent monte carlo energy minimizations of helix pairs to produce a large collection of well packed structures   filter the minimized structures to find those that are consistent with the expected symmetry of the oligomer   cluster the structures that pass the symmetry filter and   select a representative of the most populous cluster as the final prediction we applied the method to the transmembrane helices of five proteins and compare our results to the available experimental data our predictions of glycophorin a neu the m channel and phospholamban resulted in a single model for each protein that agreed with the experimental results in the case of erbb  however we obtained three structurally distinct clusters of approximately equal sizes so it was not possible to identify a clearly favored structure this may reflect a real heterogeneity of packing modes for erbb  which is known to interact with different receptor subunits our method should be useful for obtaining structural models of transmembrane domains improving our understanding of structure function relationships for particular membrane proteins
