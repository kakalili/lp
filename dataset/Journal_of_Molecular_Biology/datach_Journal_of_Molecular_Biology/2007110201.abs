evidence that human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein  hint  is a distinct branch of the histidine triad hit superfamily
human hint  hhint  has been classified as a member of the histidine triad nucleotide hint binding protein subfamily while hint is ubiquitously expressed by both eukaryotes and prokaryotes hint is found only in eukaryotes previously our laboratory has characterized and compared the aminoacyl adenylate and nucleoside phosphoramidate hydrolase activity of hhint and escherichia coli hint in this study hhint  ala  and its single nucleotide polymorphism hhint   a g variant  were cloned overexpressed and purified steady state kinetic studies with a synthetic fluorogenic indolepropinoic acyl adenylate aipa and with a series of fluorogenic tryptamine nucleoside phosphoramidates revealed that hhint  and hhint  are adenylate and phosphoramidate hydrolases with apparent second order rate constants kcat km ranging from   to   s   m   unlike hhint  hhint  and hhint  prefer aipa over tryptamine adenosine phosphoramidate by factors of   and  fold respectively in general hhint s hydrolyze phosphoramidate   to   fold less efficiently than hhint  substitution of the potential active site nucleophile his   by ala was shown to abolish the adenylate and phosphoramidate hydrolase activity for hhint   however       residual activity was observed for the h  a mutant of hhint   both hhint  and hhint  were found to hydrolyze lysyl adenylate generated by human lysyl trna synthetase hlysrs by proceeding through an adenylated protein intermediate hlysrs dependent labeling of hhint  and hhint  was found to depend on his   which aligns with the his  of the hint active site the extent of active site his  amp labeling was shown to be similar to his  amp labeling of hhint  in contrast to all previously characterized members of the histidine triad superfamily which have been shown to exist exclusively as homodimers wild type and the h  a of hhint  were found to exist across a range of multimeric states from dimers to octamers and even larger oligomers while wild type and the h  a of hhint  exist predominantly in a monomeric state the differences in oligomeric state may be important in vivo because unlike tetracysteine tagged hint  which was found along linear arrays exclusively in the cytoplasm in transfected hela cells tagged hint  and hint  were found as aggregates both in the cytosol and in the nucleus taken together these results imply that while hint and hint prefer aminoacyl adenylates as substrates and catalytically interact with aminoacyl trna synthetases the significant differences in phosphoramidase activity oligomeric state and cellular localization suggest that hint s should be placed in a distinct branch of the histidine triad superfamily
