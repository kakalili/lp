metabolic regulation of the ultradian oscillator hes by reactive oxygen species
ultradian oscillators are cyclically expressed genes with a period of less than  h found in the major signalling pathways the notch effector hairy and enhancer of split hes genes are ultradian oscillators the physiological signals that synchronise and entrain hes oscillators remain poorly understood we investigated whether cellular metabolism modulates hes cyclic expression we demonstrated that in mouse myoblasts c c   hes oscillation depends on reactive oxygen species ros  which are generated by the mitochondria electron transport chain and by nadph oxidases noxs in vitro the regulation of hes by ros occurs via the calcium mediated signalling the modulation of hes by ros was relevant in vivo since perturbing ros homeostasis was sufficient to alter medaka oryzias latipes somitogenesis a process that is dependent on hes ultradian oscillation during embryo development moreover in a medaka model for human microphthalmia with linear skin lesions syndrome in which mitochondrial ros homeostasis was impaired we documented important somitogenesis defects and the deregulation of hes homologues genes involved in somitogenesis notably both molecular and developmental defects were rescued by antioxidant treatments our studies provide the first evidence of a coupling between cellular redox metabolism and an ultradian biological oscillator with important pathophysiological implication for somitogenesis
