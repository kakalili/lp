crystal structure of plant asparaginase
in plants specialized enzymes are required to catalyze the release of ammonia from asparagine which is the main nitrogen relocation molecule in these organisms in addition k independent plant asparaginases are also active in splitting the aberrant isoaspartyl peptide bonds which makes these proteins important for seed viability and germination here we present the crystal structure of potassium independent l asparaginase from yellow lupine lla and confirm the classification of this group of enzymes in the family of ntn hydrolases the   and  subunits that form the mature     enzyme arise from autoproteolytic cleavage of two copies of a precursor protein in common with other ntn hydrolases the    heterodimer has a sandwich like fold with two  sheets flanked by two layers of  helices       the nucleophilic thr  residue which is liberated in the autocatalytic event at the n terminus of subunit   is part of an active site that is similar to that observed in a homologous bacterial enzyme an unusual sodium binding loop of the bacterial protein necessary for proper positioning of all components of the active site shows strictly conserved conformation and metal coordination in the plant enzyme a chloride anion complexed in the lla structure marks the position of the  carboxylate group of the l aspartyl substrate product moiety detailed analysis of the active site suggests why the plant enzyme hydrolyzes asparagine and its  peptides but is inactive towards substrates accepted by similar ntn hydrolases such as taspase  an enzyme implicated in some human leukemias structural comparisons of lla and taspase provide interesting insights into the role of small inorganic ions in the latter enzyme
