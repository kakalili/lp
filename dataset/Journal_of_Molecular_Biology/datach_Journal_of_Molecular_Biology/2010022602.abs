site directed mutagenesis on human cystathionine  lyase reveals insights into the modulation of h s production
in recent years increased interest has been directed towards hydrogen sulfide h s as the third gasotransmitter and its role in various diseases cystathionine  lyase cse is one of the enzymes responsible for the endogenous production of h s in mammals with the aid of the crystal structures of human cse and site directed mutagenesis studies we have identified several amino acid residues in cse that are actively involved in the catalysis of h s production contrary to reports suggesting that tyr  is required for substrate binding our results reveal a significant increase in the production of h s upon mutation of tyr  to phenylalanine this is attributed to an increased rate of pyridoxal   phosphate plp regeneration due to weakened  stacking interactions between phe  and plp thr  is also identified as a crucial residue where hydrogen bonding to asp  keeps the latter in an optimal position for hydrogen bonding to the pyridoxal nitrogen of plp furthermore mutation of glu  to lysine alanine or tyrosine reveals the importance of the hydrophobicity of the  th amino acid in determining the specificity of the enzyme for the catalysis of    elimination or    elimination reaction our study also shows that the rate of h s production is increased with increasing exogenous plp concentration hence supporting our hypothesis that apo cse is formed during the catalysis of h s production taken together these findings suggest novel routes towards the design of activators or inhibitors that modulate the production of h s these modulators may also serve as lead compounds in the development of drugs or mechanistic probes in the study of various h s related diseases
