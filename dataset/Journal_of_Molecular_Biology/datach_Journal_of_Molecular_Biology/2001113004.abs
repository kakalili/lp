ntf monomer dimer equilibrium edited by b holland
nuclear transport factor  ntf  mediates nuclear import of rangdp a central component of many nuclear trafficking pathways ntf is a homodimer and each chain has independent binding sites for rangdp and nuclear pore proteins nucleoporins that contain fxfg sequence repeats we show here that the monomer dimer dissociation constant for ntf obtained by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation is in the micromolar range indicating that a substantial proportion of cellular ntf may be monomeric to investigate the functional significance of ntf dimerization we engineered a series of point mutations at the dimerization interface and one of these m  e remained monomeric below concentrations of    m cd spectra and x ray crystallography showed that m  e ntf preserved the wild type ntf fold although its thermal stability was  deg c lower than that of the wild type m  e ntf bound both rangdp and fxfg nucleoporins less strongly suggesting that dissociation of the ntf dimer could facilitate rangdp release and thus nucleotide exchange after it had been transported into the nucleus moreover colloidal gold coated with m  e ntf showed reduced binding to xenopus oocyte nuclear pores overall our results indicate that dimer formation is important for ntf function and give insight into the formation of heterodimers by mrna export factors such as tap and nxt that contain ntf homology domains
