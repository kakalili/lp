loading a ring structure of the bacillus subtilis dnab protein a co loader of the replicative helicase
loading of the ring shaped replicative helicase is a critical step in the initiation of dna replication bacillus subtilis has adopted a two protein strategy to load its hexameric replicative helicase dnab and dnai interact with the helicase and mediate its delivery onto dna we present here the d electron microscopy structure of the dnab protein along with a detailed analysis of both its oligomeric state and its domain organization dnab is organized as an asymmetric tetramer that is comprised of two stacked components one arranged as a closed collar and the other as an open  shape intriguingly the d map of dnab exhibits an overall architecture similar to the structure of the escherichia coli  complex the loader of the ring shaped processivity factor we propose a model whereby each dnab monomer participates in both stacked components of the tetramer and displays a different overall shape this asymmetric quaternary organization could be a general feature of ring loaders
