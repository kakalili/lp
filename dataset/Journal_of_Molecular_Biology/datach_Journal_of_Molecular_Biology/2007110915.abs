interactions between the leucine zipper motif of cgmp dependent protein kinase and the c terminal region of the targeting subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase
nitric oxide induces vasodilation by elevating the production of cgmp an activator of cgmp dependent protein kinase pkg  pkg subsequently causes smooth muscle relaxation in part via activation of myosin light chain phosphatase mlcp  to date the interaction between pkg and the targeting subunit of mlcp mypt  is not fully understood earlier studies by one group of workers showed that the binding of pkg to mypt is mediated by the leucine zipper motifs at the n and c termini respectively of the two proteins another group however reported that binding of pkg to mypt did not require the leucine zipper motif of mypt  in this work we fully characterized the interaction between pkg and mypt using biophysical techniques for this purpose we constructed a recombinant pkg peptide corresponding to a predicted coiled coil region that contains the leucine zipper motif we further constructed various c terminal mypt peptides bearing various combinations of a predicted coiled coil region extensions preceding this coiled coil region and the leucine zipper motif our results show firstly that while the leucine zipper motif at the n terminus of pkg forms a homodimeric coiled coil the one at the c terminus of mypt is monomeric and non helical secondly the leucine zipper motif of pkg binds to that of mypt to form a heterodimer thirdly when the leucine zipper motif of mypt is absent the pkg leucine zipper motif binds to the coiled coil region and upstream segments of mypt via formation of a heterotetramer these results provide rationalization of some of the findings by others using alternative binding analyses
