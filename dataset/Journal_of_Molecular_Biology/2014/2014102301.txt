Fibrin formation from fibrinogen is a rare process in the healthy organism but is a pathological feature of thrombotic events, cancer and a wide range of inflammatory conditions. We have designed and constructed an antibody phage display library (containing 13 billion clones) for the selective recognition of the N-terminal peptide of fibrin alpha chain. The key structural feature for selective fibrin binding was a K94E mutation in the VH domain. From this library, an antibody was isolated (termed AP2), which recognizes the five N-terminal amino acids of fibrin with high affinity (Kd=44nM), but does not bind to fibrinogen. The AP2 antibody could be expressed in various formats (scFv, small immune protein and IgG) and inhibited fibrin clot formation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the AP2 antibody stained the fibrin-rich provisional stroma in solid tumors but did not exhibit any detectable staining toward normal tissues. Using a radioiodinated antibody preparation and quantitative biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing mice, AP2 was shown to selectively localize to fibrin-rich F9 murine teratocarcinomas, but not to SKRC-52 human kidney cancer xenografts. Collectively, the experiments indicate that the AP2 antibody recognizes fibrin in vitro and in vivo. The antibody may facilitate the development of fibrin-specific therapeutic agents.
