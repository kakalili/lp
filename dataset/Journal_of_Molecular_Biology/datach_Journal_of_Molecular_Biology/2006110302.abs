parp  interaction with vp capsid protein regulates polyomavirus early gene expression
poly adp ribose polymerases are involved in fundamental cellular events as well as they seem to be associated to some viral infection process in this work the poly adp ribose polymerase  parp  role in the polyomavirus life cycle has been investigated early viral transcription was reduced by competitive inhibitors of parps in swiss t cells and almost abolished in parp  knockout fibroblasts and in wild type fibroblasts when parp  was silenced by rna interference in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that poly adp ribosyl ation poly adp ribose  facilitates the release of the capsid protein viral protein  vp  from the chromatin of infecting virions in vitro experiments demonstrated that vp stimulates the enzymatic activity of parp  and binds non covalently both protein free and parp  bound poly adp ribose  our studies suggest that parp  promotes the complete vp displacement from viral dna favouring the viral early transcription
