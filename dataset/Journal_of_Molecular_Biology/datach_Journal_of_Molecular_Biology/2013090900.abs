insights into notch activation and inhibition mediated by antibodies directed against its negative regulatory region
notch receptors are single pass transmembrane proteins that regulate development and tissue homeostasis in all metazoan organisms prior to ligand induced signaling notch receptors adopt a proteolytic resistant conformation maintained by a critical interdomain interface within a negative regulatory region nrr  which sits immediately external to the plasma membrane signaling is initiated when ligand binding induces exposure of the proteolytic cleavage site termed s  within the nrr here we use hydrogen exchange in conjunction with mass spectrometry to study the dynamics of the human notch nrr in four distinct biochemical states in its unmodified quiescent form in a proteolytically  on  state induced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and in complex with either agonist or inhibitory antibodies induction of the on state by either ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or the agonist monoclonal antibody leads to accelerated deuteration in the region of the s cleavage site reflecting an increase in s dynamics in contrast complexation of the notch nrr with an inhibitory antibody retards deuteration not only across its discontinuous binding epitope but also around the s site stabilizing the nrr in its  off  state together with previous work investigating the dynamics of the notch nrr these studies show that key features of autoinhibition and activation are shared among different notch receptors and provide additional insights into mechanisms of notch activation and inhibition by modulatory antibodies
