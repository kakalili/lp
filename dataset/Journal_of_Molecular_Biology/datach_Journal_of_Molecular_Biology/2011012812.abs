solution structure and activation mechanism of ubiquitin like small archaeal modifier proteins
in archaea two ubiquitin like small archaeal modifier protein samps were recently shown to be conjugated to proteins in vivo samps display homology to bacterial moad sulfur transfer proteins and eukaryotic ubiquitin like proteins and they share with them the conserved c terminal glycine  glycine motif here we report the solution structure of samp from methanosarcina acetivorans and the activation of samps by an archaeal protein with homology to eukaryotic e enzymes our results show that samp possesses a  grasp fold and that its hydrophobic and electrostatic surface features are similar to those of moad m acetivorans samp exhibits an extensive flexible surface loop between helix  and the third strand of the  sheet which contributes to an elongated surface groove that is not observed in bacterial ubiquitin homologues and many other samps we provide in vitro biochemical evidence that samps are activated in an atp dependent manner by an e like enzyme that we have termed e like samp activator elsa  we show that activation occurs by formation of a mixed anhydride adenylate at the samp c terminus and is detectable by sds page and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
