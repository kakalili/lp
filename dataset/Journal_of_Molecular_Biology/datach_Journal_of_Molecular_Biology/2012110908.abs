the structure of human galns reveals the molecular basis for mucopolysaccharidosis iv a
lysosomal enzymes catalyze the breakdown of macromolecules in the cell in humans loss of activity of a lysosomal enzyme leads to an inherited metabolic defect known as a lysosomal storage disorder the human lysosomal enzyme galactosamine  sulfatase galns also known as n acetylgalactosamine  sulfatase and galn s e c      is deficient in patients with the lysosomal storage disease mucopolysaccharidosis iv a also known as mps iv a and morquio a  here we report the three dimensional structure of human galns determined by x ray crystallography at    resolution the structure reveals a catalytic gem diol nucleophile derived from modification of a cysteine side chain the active site of galns is a large positively charged trench suitable for binding polyanionic substrates such as keratan sulfate and chondroitin  sulfate enzymatic assays on the insect  cell expressed human galns indicate activity against synthetic substrates and inhibition by both substrate and product mapping   mps iv a missense mutations onto the structure reveals that a majority of mutations affect the hydrophobic core of the structure indicating that most mps iv a cases result from misfolding of galns comparison of the structure of galns to paralogous sulfatases shows a wide variety of active  site geometries in the family but strict conservation of the catalytic machinery overall the structure and the known mutations establish the molecular basis for mps iv a and for the larger mps family of diseases
