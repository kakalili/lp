The Escherichia coli RNA degradosome is a multienzyme assembly that functions in transcript turnover and maturation of structured RNA precursors. We have developed a procedure to reconstitute the RNA degradosome from recombinant components using modular coexpression vectors. The reconstituted assembly can be purified on a scale that has enabled biochemical and biophysical analyses, and we compare the properties of recombinant and cell-extracted RNA degradosomes. We present evidence that auxiliary protein components can be recruited to the ‘superprotomer’ core of the assembly through a dynamic equilibrium involving RNA intermediaries. We discuss the implications for the regulation of RNA degradosome function in vivo.
