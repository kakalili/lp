an iron  sulfur cluster in the polymerase domain of yeast dna polymerase
dna polymerase   pol  is a multi subunit polymerase that contributes to genomic stability via its roles in leading strand replication and the repair of damaged dna pol  from saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of four subunits  pol  dpb  dpb  and dpb  here we report the presence of a fe s cluster directly within the active polymerase domain of pol  residues      we show that binding of the fe s cluster is mediated by cysteines in an insertion pol ins that is conserved in pol orthologs but is absent in the polymerase domains of pol  pol  and pol  we also show that the fe s cluster is required for pol polymerase activity but not for its exonuclease activity collectively our work suggests that pol  is perhaps more sensitive than other dna polymerases to changes in oxidative stress in eukaryotic cells
