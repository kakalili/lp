dna polymerase switching ii replication factor c abrogates primer synthesis by dna polymerase  at a critical length edited by j karn
a crucial event in dna replication is the polymerase switch from the synthesis of a short rna dna primer by dna polymerase  primase to the pro cessive elongation by dna polymerase   in order to shed light on the role of replication factor c rf c in this process the effects of rf c on dna polymerase  were investigated we show that rf c stalls dna polymerase  after synthesis of approximately  nucleotides while not inhibiting the polymerase activity per se this suggested that rf c and the length of the primer may be two important factors contributing to the polymerase switch furthermore the dna binding properties of rf c were tested band shift experiments indicated that rf c has a preference for   recessed ends and double stranded dna over   ends finally pcna can be loaded onto a dna template carrying a rna primer suggesting that a dna moiety is not necessarily required for the loading of the clamp thus we propose a model where rf c upon binding to the rna dna primer influences primer synthesis and sets the conditions for a polymerase switch after recruiting pcna to dna
