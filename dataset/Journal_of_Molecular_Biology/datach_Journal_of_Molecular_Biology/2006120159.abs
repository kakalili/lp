crystal structure of the human prostacyclin synthase
prostacyclin synthase pgis catalyzes an isomerization of prostaglandin h to prostacyclin a potent mediator of vasodilation and anti platelet aggregation here we report the crystal structure of human pgis at     resolution which represents the first three dimensional structure of a class iii cytochrome p   while notable sequence divergence has been recognized between pgis and other p  s pgis exhibits the typical triangular prism shaped p  fold with only moderate structural differences the conserved acid  alcohol pair in the i helix of p  s is replaced by residues g  and n  in pgis but the distinctive disruption of the i helix and the presence of a nearby water channel remain conserved the side chain of n  appears to be positioned to facilitate the endoperoxide bond cleavage suggesting a functional conservation of this residue in o  o bond cleavage a combination of bent i helix and tilted b  helix creates a channel extending from the heme distal pocket which seemingly allows binding of various ligands however residue w   placed in this channel at a distance of     from the iron with its indole side chain lying parallel with the porphyrin plane may serve as a threshold to exclude most ligands from binding additionally a long  meander  region protruding from the protein surface may impede electron transfer although the primary sequence of the pgis cysteine ligand loop diverges significantly from the consensus conserved tertiary structure and hydrogen bonding pattern are observed for this region the substrate binding model was constructed and the structural basis for prostacyclin biosynthesis is discussed
