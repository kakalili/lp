substrate preference of transglutaminase  revealed by logistic regression analysis and intrinsic disorder examination
tissue transglutaminase tg  catalyzes the ca  dependent posttranslational modification of proteins via formation of isopeptide bonds between their glutamine and lysine residues although substrate specificity of tg has been studied repeatedly at the sequence level no clear consensus sequences have been determined so far with the use of the extensive structural information on tg substrate proteins listed in transdab wiki database   http  genomics dote hu wiki a slight preference of tg for glutamine and lysine residues situated in turns could be observed when the spatial environment of the favored glutamine and lysine residues was analyzed with logistic regression the presence of specific amino acid patterns was identified by using the occurrence of the predictor amino acids as selection criteria several polypeptides were predicted and later identified as novel in vitro substrates for tg  by studying the sequence of tg substrate proteins lacking available crystal structure the strong favorable influence on substrate selection of the presence of substrate glutamine and lysine residues in intrinsically disordered regions could also be revealed the collected structural data have provided novel understanding of how this versatile enzyme selects its substrates in various cell compartments and tissues
