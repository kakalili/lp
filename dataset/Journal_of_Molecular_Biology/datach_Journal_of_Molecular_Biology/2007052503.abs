an atp hydrolysis sensor in the dna packaging motor from bacteriophage t suggests an inchworm type translocation mechanism
tailed bacteriophages and large eukaryotic viruses employ powerful molecular motors to translocate dsdna into a preassembled capsid shell the phage t motor is composed of a dodecameric portal and small and large terminase subunits assembled at the special head  tail connector vertex of the prohead the motor pumps dna through the portal channel utilizing atp hydrolysis energy provided by an atpase present in the large terminase subunit we report that the atpase motors of terminases helicases translocating restriction enzymes and protein translocases possess a common coupling motif c motif  mutations in the phage t terminase c motif lead to loss of stimulated atpase and dna translocation activities surprisingly the mutants can catalyze at least one atp hydrolysis event but are unable to turn over and reset the motor this is the first report of a catalytic block in translocating atpase motor after atp hydrolysis occurred we suggest that the c motif is an atp hydrolysis sensor linking product release to mechanical motion a novel terminase driven mechanism is proposed for translocation of dsdna in viruses
