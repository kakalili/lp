complete sequence and genetic organization of pdtg  the  kilobase naphthalene degradation plasmid from pseudomonas putida strain ncib
the complete    bp sequence of the circular naphthalene degradation plasmid pdtg from pseudomonas putida strain ncib    was determined in order to examine the process by which the nah and sal operons may have been compiled and distributed in nature eighty nine open reading frames were predicted using computer analyses comprising    of the pdtg dna sequence the most distinctive feature of the plasmid is the upper and lower naphthalene degradation operons which occupy   kb and   kb regions respectively bordered by numerous defective mobile genetic element fragments identified on this plasmid were homologues of genes required for large plasmid replication maintenance and conjugation as well as transposases resolvases and integrases suggesting an evolution that involved the lateral transfer of dna between bacterial species also found were genes that contain a high degree of sequence similarity to other known degradation genes as well as genes involved in chemotaxis although the incompatibility group designation of pdtg remains unresolved striking sequence organization and homology exists between the plasmid backbones of pdtg and the incp  toluene degradation plasmid pww  which suggests a divergent evolution from a progenitor plasmid prior to degradative gene incorporation
