direct optical microscopic observation of the microtubule polymerization intermediate sheet structure in the presence of gas
the process of microtubule elongation is thought to consist of two stages  formation of a tubulin sheet structure and its closure into a tube however real time observation of this process has been difficult here by utilizing phospho tau binding protein gas  growth arrest specific protein   we visualized the polymer transformation process by dark field microscopy upon elongation thin and flexible structures often similar to a curved hook appeared at the end of microtubules electron microscopic observations supported the idea that these flexible structures are tubulin sheets they maintained their length until they gradually became thick and rigid beginning in the central portion resulting in straight microtubules in the absence of gas  the sheet like structure was rarely observed moreover when observed it was fragile and engaged in typical dynamic instability with gas  no catastrophe was observed these results suggest that gas enhances microtubule polymerization by stabilizing sheet intermediates and is a useful tool for analyzing microtubule transformation
