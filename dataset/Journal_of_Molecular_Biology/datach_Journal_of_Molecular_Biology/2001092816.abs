dynamic regimes and correlated structural dynamics in native and denatured alpha lactalbumin edited by m f moody
understanding the mechanisms of protein folding requires knowledge of both the energy landscape and the structural dynamics of a protein we report a neutron scattering study of the nanosecond and picosecond dynamics of native and the denatured  lactalbumin the quasielastic scattering intensity shows that there are  helical structure and tertiary like side chain interactions fluctuating on sub nanosecond time scales under extremely denaturing conditions and even in the absence of disulfide bonds based on the length scale dependence of the decay rate of the measured correlation functions the nanosecond dynamics of the native and the variously denatured proteins have three dynamic regimes when    lt q lt       where the scattering vector q is inversely proportional to the length scale  the decay rate   shows a power law relationship     q       that is analogous to the dynamic behavior of a random coil however when   lt q lt       the decay rate exhibits a    q      relationship the effective diffusion constant of the protein decreases with increasing q a striking dynamic behavior that is not found in any chain like macromolecule we suggest that this unusual dynamics is due to the presence of a strongly attractive force and collective conformational fluctuations in both the native and the denatured states of the protein above q gt       is a regime that displays the local dynamic behavior of individual residues     q      the picosecond time scale dynamics shows that the potential barrier to side chain proton jump motion is reduced in the molten globule and in the denatured proteins when compared to that of the native protein our results provide a dynamic view of the native like topology established in the early stages of protein folding
