crystal structures of d tagatose  epimerase from pseudomonas cichorii and its complexes with d tagatose and d fructose
pseudomonas cichoriii d tagatose  epimerase p cichorii d te can efficiently catalyze the epimerization of not only d tagatose to d sorbose but also d fructose to d psicose and is used for the production of d psicose from d fructose the crystal structures of p cichorii d te alone and in complexes with d tagatose and d fructose were determined at resolutions of       and      respectively a subunit of p cichorii d te adopts a     barrel structure and a metal ion mn  found in the active site is coordinated by glu   asp   his   and glu  at the end of the  barrel p cichorii d te forms a stable dimer to give a favorable accessible surface for substrate binding on the front side of the dimer the simulated omit map indicates that o and o of d tagatose and or d fructose coordinate mn  and that c  o is located between carboxyl groups of glu  and glu   supporting the previously proposed mechanism of deprotonation protonation at c by two glu residues although the electron density is poor at the     and  positions of the substrates substrate  enzyme interactions can be deduced from the significant electron density at o  the o possibly interacts with cys  via hydrogen bonding whereas o and o in d tagatose and o in d fructose do not undergo hydrogen bonding to the enzyme and are in a hydrophobic environment created by phe  trp  trp   and phe   due to the lack of specific interactions between the enzyme and its substrates at the  and  positions p cichorii d te loosely recognizes substrates in this region allowing it to efficiently catalyze the epimerization of d tagatose and d fructose c epimer of d tagatose as well furthermore a c  o proton exchange mechanism for p cichorii d te is suggested by x ray structural analysis providing a clear explanation for the regulation of the ionization state of glu  and glu
