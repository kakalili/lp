molecular basis for bre cofactor recognition by the ubp deubiquitylating enzyme
yeast ubp and its co factor bre form a deubiquitylation complex to regulate protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi compartments of the cell a novel n terminal domain of the ubp catalytic subunit forms a complex with the ntf like domain of the bre regulatory subunit here we report the x ray crystal structure of an ubp  bre complex and show that it forms a symmetric hetero tetrameric complex in which the bre ntf like domain dimer interacts with two l shaped  strand  turn   helix motifs of ubp  the ubp n terminal domain binds within a hydrophobic cavity on the surface of the bre ntf like domain subunit with conserved residues within both proteins interacting predominantly through antiparallel  sheet hydrogen bonds and van der waals contacts structure based mutagenesis and functional studies confirm the significance of the observed interactions for ubp  bre association in vitro and ubp function in vivo comparison of the structure to other protein complexes with ntf like domains shows that the ubp  bre interface is novel together these studies provide new insights into ubp recognition by bre and into protein recognition by ntf like domains
