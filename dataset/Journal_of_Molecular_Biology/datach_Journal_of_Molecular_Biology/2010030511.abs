the indispensable n terminal half of eif j hcr cooperates with its structurally conserved binding partner eif b prt rrm and with eif a in stringent aug selection
despite recent progress in our understanding of the numerous functions of individual subunits of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif   little is known on the molecular level using nmr spectroscopy we determined the first solution structure of an interaction between eif subunits we revealed that a conserved tryptophan residue in the human eif j n terminal acidic motif nta is held in the helix   and loop  hydrophobic pocket of the human eif b rna recognition motif rrm  mutating the corresponding  pocket  residues in its yeast orthologue reduces cellular growth rate eliminates eif j hcr association with eif b prt in vitro and in vivo affects  s occupancy of eif  and produces a leaky scanning defect indicative of a deregulation of the aug selection process unexpectedly we found that the n terminal half of eif j hcr containing the nta is indispensable and sufficient for wild type growth of yeast cells furthermore we demonstrate that deletion of either j hcr or its n terminal half only or mutation of the key tryptophan residues results in the severe leaky scanning phenotype partially suppressible by overexpressed eif a which is thought to stabilize properly formed preinitiation complexes at the correct start codon these findings indicate that eif j hcr remains associated with the scanning preinitiation complexes and does not dissociate from the small ribosomal subunit upon mrna recruitment as previously believed finally we provide further support for earlier mapping of the ribosomal binding site for human eif j by identifying specific interactions of eif j hcr with small ribosomal proteins rps and rps  located in the vicinity of the mrna entry channel taken together we propose that eif j hcr closely cooperates with the eif b prt rrm and eif a on the ribosome to ensure proper formation of the scanning arrested conformation required for stringent aug recognition
