unveiling hidden catalytic contributions of the conserved his trp iii in tyrosine recombinases assembly of a novel active site in flp recombinase harboring alanine at this position
the catalytic pentad of tyrosine recombinases that assists the tyrosine nucleophile includes a conserved histidine tryptophan his trp iii  flp and cre harbor tryptophan at this position most of their kin recombinases display histidine contrary to the conservation rule flp w  f is a much stronger recombinase than flp w  h  the hydrophobicity of trp  or phe  is utilized in correctly positioning tyr  during the strand cleavage step of recombination why then is phenylalanine almost never encountered in the recombinase family at this conserved position using exogenous nucleophiles and synthetic methylphosphonate or   thiolate substrates we decipher that trp  also assists in the activation of the scissile phosphate and the departure of the   hydroxyl leaving group these two functions are consistent with the hydrogen bonding property of trp  as well as its location in structures of the flp recombination complexes however van der waals contact between trp  and arg  may also be important for the phosphate activation step a structure based suppression strategy permits the inactive variant flp w  a to be rescued by a second site mutation a  m modeling alanine and methionine at positions   and   respectively in the flp crystal structure suggests a plausible mechanism for active site restoration successful suppression suggests the possibility of evolving by design new active site configurations for tyrosine recombination
