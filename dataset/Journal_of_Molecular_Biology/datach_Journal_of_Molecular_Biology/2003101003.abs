a protein contortionist core mutations of gb that induce dimerization and domain swapping
immunoglobulin binding domain b of streptococcal protein g gb  a small   residues  stable single domain protein is one of the most extensively used model systems in the area of protein folding and design recently nmr and x ray structures of a quintuple gb core mutant l v a f f v y f a f that showed an unexpected intertwined tetrameric architecture were determined here we report the nmr structure of another mutant derived from the tetramer by reverting the single amino acid position f  back to the wild type sequence a  the structure reveals a domain swapped dimer that involves exchange of the second  hairpin the resulting overall structure comprises an eight stranded  sheet whose concave side is covered by two  helices the dimer dissociates into a partially folded monomeric species with a dissociation constant of      m
