ligand induced structural transitions mutational analysis and  open  quaternary structure of the m tuberculosis feast famine regulatory protein rv  c
rv  c is a member of the feast famine regulatory protein family that is known to form stable protein  dna complexes we report a specific oligomeric transition between hexadecameric and octameric lower order oligomers in the presence of phe that supports an effector mediated model for the disassembly of a nucleosome like particle we had generated two mutants gly  thr and glu  ala which are part of the essential      effector binding loop the gly  thr mutant adopts an unusual  open  quaternary structure and offers interesting functional insights co related to the binding of an effector this is similar to the previously reported escherichia coli lrp co crystallized in the presence of dna where the interactions of the substrate with the n terminal dna binding domain presumably lead to symmetry deviations to the oligomeric association the present structure represents a direct evidence to support that changes made to the effector binding domain at the c terminus also result in a functionally relevant quaternary structural change conversely the glu  ala mutant retains the closed quaternary association observed in the native protein and reveals nonsymmetrical interaction effects in the two subunits of the dimer we also report that the native protein unexpectedly binds lys but does not recognize arg and offer a structural explanation for it error scaled difference distance matrix analysis suggests that the protein has a relatively flexible core that is presumably needed to mediate the structural changes necessary for the protein s regulatory functions
