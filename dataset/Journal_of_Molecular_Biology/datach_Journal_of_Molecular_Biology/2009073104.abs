a zinc site in the c terminal domain of rag is essential for dna cleavage activity
the recombination activating protein rag  a key component of the v d j recombinase binds multiple zn  ions in its catalytically required core region however the role of zinc in the dna cleavage activity of rag is not well resolved to address this issue we determined the stoichiometry of zn  ions bound to the catalytically active core region of rag under various conditions using metal quantitation methods we determined that core rag can bind up to four zn  ions stripping the full complement of bound zn  ions to produce apoprotein abrogated dna cleavage activity moreover even partial removal of zinc binding equivalents resulted in a significant diminishment of dna cleavage activity as compared to holo zn  core rag  mutants of the intact core rag and the isolated core rag domains were studied to identify the location of zinc binding sites significantly the c terminal domain in core rag binds at least two zn  ions with one zinc binding site containing c  and c  as ligands termed the cc zinc site and h  and h  coordinating a zn  ion in a separate site hh zinc site  the latter zinc binding site is essential for dna cleavage activity given that the h  a and h  a mutants were defective in both in vitro dna cleavage assays and cellular recombination assays furthermore as mutation of the active site residue e  reduces zn  coordination we propose that the hh zinc site is located in close proximity to the dde active site overall these results demonstrate that zn  serves an important auxiliary role for rag dna cleavage activity furthermore we propose that one of the zinc binding sites is linked to the active site of core rag directly or indirectly by e
