the structure of holo and metal deficient wild type human cu zn superoxide dismutase and its relevance to familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
cu zn superoxide dismutase sod  forms a crucial component of the cellular defence against oxidative stress zn deficient wild type and mutant human sod have been implicated in the disease familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis fals  we present here the crystal structures of holo and metal deficient apo wild type protein at    resolution the p  wild type holo enzyme structure has nine independently refined dimers and these combine to form a  trimer of dimers  packing motif in each asymmetric unit there is no significant asymmetry between the monomers in these dimers in contrast to the subunit structures of the fals g r mutant of human sod and in bovine cu zn sod metal deficient apo sod crystallizes with two dimers in the asymmetric unit and shows changes in the metal binding sites and disorder in the zn binding and electrostatic loops of one dimer which is devoid of metals the second dimer lacks cu but has    occupancy of the zn site and remains structurally similar to wild type sod  the apo protein forms a continuous extended arrangement of  barrels stacked up along the short crystallographic b axis while perpendicular to this axis the constituent  strands form a zig zag array of filaments the overall arrangement of which has a similarity to the common structure associated with amyloid like fibrils
