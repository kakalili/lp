complete sequence determination combined with analysis of transposition site specific recombination events to explain genetic organization of incp  tol plasmid pww  and related mobile genetic elements
recent studies have indicated that the evolutionarily common catabolic gene clusters are loaded on structurally diverse toluene catabolic tol plasmids and their residing transposons to elucidate the mechanisms supporting the diversification of catabolic plasmids and transposons we determined here the complete     bp sequence of pww  a tol plasmid from pseudomonas putida mt  pww  was found to belong to the incp  incompatibility group that play important roles in the catabolism of several xenobiotics pww  carried two distinct transposase resolvase gene clusters tnpar modules  five short terminal inverted repeats irs  and three site specific resolution res sites that are all typical of class ii transposons this organization of pww  suggested the four possible transposable regions tn   to tn   the largest   kb region tn   spanned the three other regions and tn   and tn     kb covered all of the  xyl genes for toluene catabolism our subsequent transposition experiments clarified that the three transposons tn   to tn   indeed exhibit their transposability and that pww  also generated another   kb toluene catabolic transposon tn   which carried the two separated and inversely oriented segments of pww  the tnpra ir module of tn   and a part of xyl gene clusters on tn   the tn   transposase was able to mediate the transposition of tn   tn   and tn   while the tn   transposase catalyzed only the transposition of tn   tn   was formed by the tn   resolvase mediated site specific inversion between the two inversely oriented res sites on pww  these findings and comparison with other catabolic plasmids clearly indicate multiple copies of transposition related genes and sites on one plasmid and their recombination activities contribute greatly to the diversification of plasmid structures as well as wide dissemination of the evolutionary common gene clusters in various plasmids
