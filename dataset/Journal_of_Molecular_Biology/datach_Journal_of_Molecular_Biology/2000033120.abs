the nuclear poly a binding protein pabp  forms an oligomeric particle covering the length of the poly a tail edited by i tinoco
the mammalian nuclear poly a binding protein pabp  controls the length of the newly synthesized poly a tail on messenger rnas to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of length control we have investigated the structure of the pabp  poly a complex electron microscopy and scanning force microscopy studies reveal that pabp  when bound to poly a  forms both linear filaments and discrete sized compact oligomeric particles the maximum diameter of the filament is  nm the maximum diameter of the particle is     nm maximum particle size is realized when the pabp  poly a complex is formed with poly a molecules      nt long which corresponds to the average length of the newly synthesized poly a tail in vitro and in vivo the equilibrium between filaments and particles is highly sensitive to ionic strength filaments are favored at low ionic strength while particles predominate at moderate to high ionic strength nitrocellulose filter binding and gel mobility shift assays indicate that the pabp  poly a particle formed on a  is not significantly more stable than complexes formed with smaller species of poly a  these results are discussed in the context of the proposed functions for pabp
