topr  the second reverse gyrase of sulfolobus solfataricus exhibits unusual properties
whereas reverse gyrase is considered as a strong marker of thermophily the function of this peculiar type ia topoisomerase still remains to be elucidated the archaeon sulfolobus solfataricus encodes two reverse gyrases topr and topr  this duplication seems to be important because most of crenarcheota exhibit two copies of reverse gyrase however to date while topr has been well characterized no characterization of topr has been reported in this study we describe for the first time the activity of s solfataricus topr that appears as a new reverse gyrase indeed in spite of the sequence similarities between topr and topr  we evidence unexpected great differences between the two enzymes while topr exhibits atp independent relaxation activity topr does not and its activity is strictly dependent on the presence of atp whereas topr is a distributive topoisomerase topr exhibits an amazing high intrinsic processivity compared to all the topoisomerases studied so far topr is able to introduce a very high number of positive superturns in dna while topr generates weakly positively supercoiled dna finally topr behaves differently from topr when incubated at different assay temperatures all the results presented in this study indicate that topr and topr have in vitro different activities suggesting different functions in vivo
