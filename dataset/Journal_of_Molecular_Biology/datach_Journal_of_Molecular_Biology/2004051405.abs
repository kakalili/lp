distinct dna elements contribute to rap p affinity for its binding sites
the essential saccharomyces cerevisiae regulatory protein rap contains two tandem myb like dna binding sub domains that interact with two defined dna  hemisites   separated by a trinucleotide linker sequence we have mapped the thermodynamically defined dna binding site of rap by a primer extension method coupled with electrophoretic separation of bound and unbound dnas relative to published consensus sequences we detect binding interactions that extend  bp beyond the   end of the putative dna binding site this new site of interaction is located where the dna minor groove faces the protein and may account for the major dna bending induced by rap p that previous studies have mapped to a site immediately upstream of the consensus binding site in addition we show that a minimal dna binding site made of one single consensus hemisite preceded or followed by a spacer trinucleotide that interacts with the unstructured protein linker between the two rap p dna binding domains is able to bind the protein although at lower affinity these findings may explain the observed in vivo binding properties of rap p at many promoters that lack canonical binding sites
