identifying and quantifying orphan protein sequences in fungi
for large regions of many proteins and even entire proteins no homology to known domains or proteins can be detected these sequences are often referred to as orphans surprisingly it has been reported that the large number of orphans is sustained in spite of a rapid increase of available genomic sequences however it is believed that de novo creation of coding sequences is rare in comparison to mechanisms such as domain shuffling and gene duplication hence most sequences should have homologs in other genomes to investigate this the sequences of  complete fungi genomes were compared by using the phylogenetic relationship between these genomes we could identify potentially de novo created orphans in saccharomyces cerevisiae we found that only a small fraction  lt   of the s cerevisiae proteome is orphan which confirms that de novo creation of coding sequences is indeed rare furthermore we found it necessary to compare the most closely related species to distinguish between de novo created sequences and rapidly evolving sequences where homologs are present but cannot be detected next the orphan proteins ops and orphan domains ods were characterized first it was observed that both ops and ods are short in addition at least some of the ops have been shown to be functional in experimental assays showing that they are not pseudogenes furthermore in contrast to what has been reported before and what is seen for older orphans s cerevisiae specific ods and proteins are not more disordered than other proteins this might indicate that many of the older and earlier classified orphans indeed are fast evolving sequences finally  gt   of the detected ods are located at the protein termini which suggests that these orphans could have been created by mutations that have affected the start or stop codons
