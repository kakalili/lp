crystal structure of the human liver x receptor  ligand binding domain in complex with a synthetic agonist
lxr  belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand activated transcription factors its natural ligands are supposed to be oxidised derivatives of cholesterol stimulation of lxr  by agonists activates a number of genes that are involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and cholesterol efflux from cells therefore lxr  may represent a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis here we report the x ray crystal structure of the lxr  ligand binding domain in complex with a synthetic agonist t     this compound occupies the ligand binding pocket of the receptor forms numerous lipophilic contacts with the protein and one crucial hydrogen bond to his  and stabilises the agonist conformation of the receptor ligand binding domain the recruitment of the af region of the protein is not achieved via direct polar interactions of the ligand with protein side chains of this helical segment but rather via few hydrophobic contacts and probably more importantly via indirect effects involving the pre orientation of side chains that surround the ligand binding pocket and form the interface to the af helix on the basis of these results we propose a binding mode and a mechanism of action for the putative natural ligands oxidised derivatives of cholesterol
