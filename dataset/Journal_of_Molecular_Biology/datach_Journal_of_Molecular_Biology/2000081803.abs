identification of an epitope in the c terminus of normal prion protein whose expression is modulated by binding events in the n terminus edited by f cohen
we have characterized the epitopes of a panel of  monoclonal antibodies mabs directed to normal human cellular prion protein prpc using elisa and western blotting of recombinant prp or synthetic peptide fragments of prp the first group of antibodies which is represented by mabs b and b  reacts with prp     indicating that the epitopes for these mabs are located in the  to   n terminal region of human prp the second group includes mabs a  h  a  c  h  h and g  these antibodies bind to epitopes localized within n terminally truncated recombinant prp     finally mabs c  c and a  recognize both prp     and prp     suggesting that the epitopes for this group are located in the region encompassing residues  to   by western blotting with pepspot   only three of mabs studied  b  b and g  bind to linear epitopes that are present in  residue long synthetic peptides corresponding to human prp fragments the remaining nine mabs appear to recognize conformational epitopes two n terminus specific mabs were found to prevent the binding of the c terminus specific mab h  this observation suggests that the unstructured n terminal region may influence the local conformation within the folded c terminal domain of prion protein
