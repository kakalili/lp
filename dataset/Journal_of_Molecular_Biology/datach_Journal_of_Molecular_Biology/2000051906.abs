mimicry of human ige epitopes by anti idiotypic antibodies edited by i a wilson
according to jerne  s network hypothesis the binding site of an anti idiotypic antibody also represents the internal image of an epitope present on a foreign or even a self antigen in recent years antigen mimicry has been defined at the molecular level for some xeno antigens however until now there has been no demonstration of structural mimicry between a human anti idiotypic antibody and a self structure to address this question we used human ige as the self structure and a well defined anti human ige mab bsw   we describe the isolation of two anti idiotypic antibodies specific for the anti ige antibody bsw  from a non immune human fab phage display library interestingly these two anti idiotypic antibodies mimic the same molecular surface region as a previously described ige peptide mimotope isolated by panning on bsw  but they cover a much larger epitope on the ige molecule accordingly immunisation of rabbits with the two anti idiotypic antibodies induced high affinity antibodies with the same characteristics as bsw  thus our data demonstrate that it is possible to isolate anti idiotypic antibodies derived from the human genome without the need for hyperimmunisation and confirm jerne  s hypothesis that both foreign antigens and self structures can be mimicked by our own immunoglobulins
