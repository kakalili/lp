structural and kinetic effects of pak phosphorylation mimic of ctni s  e on the ctnc ctni interaction in the cardiac thin filament
residue ser  of cardiac troponin i ctni is known to be phosphorylated by p  activated kinase  pak  it has been found that pak mediated phosphorylation of ctni induces an increase in the sensitivity of myofilament to ca  but the detailed mechanism is unknown we investigated how the structural and kinetic effects mediated by pseudo phosphorylation of ctni s  e modulates ca  induced activation of cardiac thin filaments using steady state time resolved f rster resonance energy transfer fret and stopped flow kinetic measurements we monitored ca  induced changes in ctni  ctnc interactions measurements were done using reconstituted thin filaments which contained the pseudo phosphorylated ctni s  e  we hypothesized that the thin filament regulation is modulated by altered ctnc  ctni interactions due to charge modification caused by the phosphorylation of ser  in ctni our results showed that the pseudo phosphorylation of ctni s  e sensitizes structural changes to ca  by shortening the intersite distances between ctnc and ctni furthermore kinetic rates of ca  dissociation induced structural change in the regulatory region of ctni were reduced significantly by ctni s  e  the aforementioned effects of pseudo phosphorylation of ctni were similar to those of strong crossbridges on structural changes in ctni our results provide novel information on how cardiac thin filament regulation is modulated by pak phosphorylation of ctni
