on the role of the conformational flexibility of the active site lid on the allosteric kinetics of glucosamine  phosphate deaminase
the active site of glucosamine  phosphate deaminase from escherichia coli glcn p deaminase ec      has a complex lid formed by two antiparallel  strands connected by a helix loop segment       this motif contains arg   which is a residue involved in binding the substrate in the active site and three residues that are part of the allosteric site arg   lys  and thr   this dual binding role of the motif forming the lid suggests that it plays a key role in the functional coupling between active and allosteric sites previous crystallographic work showed that the temperature coefficients of the active site lid are very large when the enzyme is in its t allosteric state these coefficients decrease in the r state thus suggesting that this motif changes its conformational flexibility as a consequence of the allosteric transition in order to explore the possible connection between the conformational flexibility of the lid and the function of the deaminase we constructed the site directed mutant phe  ala phe  is located at the c end of the lid helix and its side chain establishes hydrophobic interactions with the remainder of the enzyme the crystallographic structure of the t state of phe  ala deaminase determined at    resolution shows no density for the segment      which is part of the active site lid pdb jt  this mutant form of the enzyme is essentially inactive in the absence of the allosteric activator n acetylglucosamine  p although it recovers its activity up to the wild type level in the presence of this ligand spectrometric and binding studies show that inactivity is due to the inability of the active site to bind ligands when the allosteric site is empty these data indicate that the conformational flexibility of the active site lid critically alters the binding properties of the active site and that the occupation of the allosteric site restores the lid conformational flexibility to a functional state
