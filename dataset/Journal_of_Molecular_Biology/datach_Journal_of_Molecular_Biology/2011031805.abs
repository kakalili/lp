ligand bound structures of a glycosyl hydrolase family  glucuronoxylan xylanohydrolase
xylanases of glycosyl hydrolase family   gh  have been shown to cleave    linkages of  o methylglucuronoxylan megxn as directed by the position along the xylan chain of an    linked  o methylglucuronate mega moiety complete hydrolysis of megxn by these enzymes results in singly substituted aldouronates having a  o methylglucuronate moiety linked to a xylose penultimate from the reducing terminal xylose and some number of xylose residues toward the nonreducing terminus this novel mode of action distinguishes gh  xylanases from the more common xylanase families that cleave megxn in accessible regions to help understand this unique biochemical function we have determined the structure of xync in its native and ligand bound forms xync structure models derived from diffraction data of xync crystal soaks with the simple sugar glucuronate ga and the tetrameric sugar  o methyl aldotetrauronate resulted in models containing ga and  o methyl aldotriuronate respectively each is observed in two locations within xync surface openings ligand coordination occurs within the xync catalytic substrate binding cleft and on the structurally fused side  domain demonstrating a substrate targeting role for this putative carbohydrate binding module structural data reveal that ga acts as a primary functional appendage for recognition and hydrolysis of the megxn polymer by the protein this work compares the structure of xync with a previously reported homologous enzyme xyna from erwinia chrysanthemi and analyzes the ligand binding sites our results identify the molecular interactions that define the unique function of xync and homologous gh  enzymes
