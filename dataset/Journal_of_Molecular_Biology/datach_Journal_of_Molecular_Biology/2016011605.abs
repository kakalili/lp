proline conformation in a functional tau fragment
the conformational state of distinct prolines can determine the folding of a protein but equally other biological processes when coupled to a conformation sensitive secondary reaction for the neuronal tau protein the importance of proline conformation is underscored by its interaction with different prolyl cis trans isomerases the proline conformation would gain even further importance after phosphorylation of the preceding residue by various proline directed kinases a number of molecular diseases including alzheimer s disease and traumatic brain injury were thereby recently qualified as  cistauosis   as they would imply a cis conformation for the pthr  pro  prolyl bond we here investigate by nmr spectroscopy the conformation of all prolines in a functional tau fragment tau      although we can detect and identify some minor conformers in the cis form we show that all prolines are for over   in the trans conformation phosphorylation by cdk cyca  which notably leads to complete modification of the thr  residue does not change this conclusion our data hence disagree with the notion that specific prolyl bonds in tau would adopt preferentially the cis conformation
