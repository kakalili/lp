crystal structure of escherichia colil arabinose isomerase ecai  the putative target of biological tagatose production
escherichia coli l arabinose isomerase ecai ec     catalyzes the isomerization of l arabinose to l ribulose in vivo this enzyme is also of commercial interest as it catalyzes the conversion of d galactose to d tagatose in vitro the crystal structure of ecai was solved and refined at     resolution the subunit structure of ecai is organised into three domains an n terminal a central and a c terminal domain it forms a crystallographic trimeric architecture in the asymmetric unit packing within the crystal suggests the idea that ecai can form a hexameric assembly previous electron microscopic and biochemical studies supports that ecai is hexameric in solution a comparison with other known structures reveals that ecai adopts a protein fold most similar to e coli fucose isomerase ecfi despite very low sequence identity    the structural similarity between ecai and ecfi with regard to number of domains overall fold biological assembly and active site architecture strongly suggests that the enzymes have functional similarities further the crystal structure of ecai forms a basis for indentifying molecular determinants responsible for isomerization of arabinose to ribulose in vivo and galactose to tagatose in vitro
