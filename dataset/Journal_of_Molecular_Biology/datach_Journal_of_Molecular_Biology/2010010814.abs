the role of arrestin  helix i in receptor binding
arrestins rapidly bind phosphorylated activated forms of their cognate g protein coupled receptors thereby preventing g protein coupling and often switching signaling to other pathways amphipathic  helix i residues      has been implicated in receptor binding but the mechanism of its action has not been determined yet here we show that several mutations in the helix itself and in adjacent hydrophobic residues in the body of the n domain reduce arrestin binding to light activated phosphorylated rhodopsin p rh   on the background of phosphorylation independent mutants that bind with high affinity to both p rh  and light activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin these mutations reduce the stability of the arrestin complex with p rh   but not with light activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin using site directed spin labeling we found that the local structure around  helix i changes upon binding to rhodopsin however the intramolecular distances between  helix i and adjacent  strand i or the rest of the n domain  measured using double electron  electron resonance do not change ruling out relocation of the helix due to receptor binding collectively these data demonstrate that  helix i plays an indirect role in receptor binding likely keeping  strand i which carries several phosphate binding residues in a position favorable for its interaction with receptor attached phosphates
