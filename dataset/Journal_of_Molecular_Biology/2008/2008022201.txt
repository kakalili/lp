Stomatin is a major integral membrane protein of human erythrocytes, the absence of which is associated with a form of hemolytic anemia known as hereditary stomatocytosis. However, the function of stomatin is not fully understood. An open reading frame, PH1511, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii encodes p-stomatin, a prokaryotic stomatin. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a stomatin ortholog, the core domain of the p-stomatin PH1511p (residues 56–234 of PH1511p, designated as PhStoCD). PhStoCD forms a novel homotrimeric structure. Three α/β domains form a triangle of about 50 Å on each side, and three α-helical segments of about 60 Å in length extend from the apexes of the triangle. The α/β domain of PhStoCD is partly similar in structure to the band-7 domain of mouse flotillin-2. While the α/β domain is relatively rigid, the α-helical segment shows conformational flexibility, adapting to the neighboring environment. One α-helical segment forms an anti-parallel coiled coil with another α-helical segment from a symmetry-related molecule. The α-helical segment shows a heptad repeat pattern, and mainly hydrophobic residues form a coiled-coil interface. According to chemical cross-linking experiments, PhStoCD would be able to assemble into an oligomeric form. The coiled-coil fold observed in the crystal probably contributes to self-association.
