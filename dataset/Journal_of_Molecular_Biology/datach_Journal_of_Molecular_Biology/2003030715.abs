engineered fibronectin type iii domain with a rgdwxe sequence binds with enhanced affinity and specificity to human  v  integrin
fibronectin is an extracellular matrix protein with broad binding specificity to cell surface receptors integrins the tenth fibronectin type iii domain fnfn  is a small autonomous domain of fibronectin containing the rge sequence that is directly involved in integrin binding however in isolation fnfn  only weakly bind to integrins we reasoned that high affinity and high specificity variants of fnfn  to a particular integrin could be engineered by optimizing residues surrounding the integrin binding rgd sequence in the flexible fg loop affinity maturation of fnfn  to  v  integrin an integrin up regulated in angiogenic endothelial cells and in some metastatic tumor cells yielded  v  binding fnfn  mutants with a novel rgdwxe consensus sequence we characterized one of the rgdwxe modified clones fnfn  jcli  as purified protein fnfn  jcli binds with high affinity and specificity to purified  v  integrin alanine scanning mutagenesis suggested that both the tryptophan and glutamic acid residues following the rgd sequence are required for maximal affinity and specificity for  v   fnfn  jcli specifically stained  v  positive cells as detected with flow cytometry and it inhibited  v  dependent cell adhesion as with the anti  v  antibody lm   fnfn  jcli can interfere with in vitro capillary formation taken together these data show that fnfn  jcl  is a specific high affinity  v  binding protein that can inhibit  v  dependent cellular processes similar to an anti  v  monoclonal antibody these properties combined with the small monomeric cysteine free and highly stable structure of fnfn  jcli  may make this protein useful in future applications involving detection and targeting of  v  positive cells
