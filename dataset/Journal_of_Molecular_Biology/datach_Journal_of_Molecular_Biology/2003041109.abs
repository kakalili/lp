prediction of catalytic residues in enzymes based on known tertiary structure stability profile and sequence conservation
the catalytic or functionally important residues of a protein are known to exist in evolutionarily constrained regions however the patterns of residue conservation alone are sometimes not very informative depending on the homologous sequences available for a given query protein here we present an integrated method to locate the catalytic residues in an enzyme from its sequence and structure mutations of functional residues usually decrease the activity but concurrently often increase stability also catalytic residues tend to occupy partially buried sites in holes or clefts on the molecular surface after confirming these general tendencies by carrying out statistical analyses on  representative enzymes these data together with amino acid conservation were evaluated this novel method exhibited better sensitivity in the prediction accuracy than traditional methods that consider only the residue conservation we applied it to some so called  hypothetical  proteins with known structures but undefined functions the relationships among the catalytic conserved and destabilizing residues in enzymatic proteins are discussed
