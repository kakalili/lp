modelling the ph dependent properties of kv potassium channels
it is known that the ph dependence of conductance for the rat potassium channel kv  is susbstantially reduced upon mutation of either h  or k   these residues lie in the extracellular mouth of the channel pore we have used continuum electrostatics to investigate their interactions with k sites in the pore the predicted scale of interactions between h  k  and potassium sites is sufficient to significantly alter potassium occupancy and thus channel function we interpret the effect of k  mutation as indicating that the ph dependent effect requires not only an ionisable group with a suitable pka value i e histidine  but also that other charged groups set the potential profile at a threshold level this hypothesis is examined in the context of ph dependence for other members of the kv family and may represent a general tool with which to study potassium channels
