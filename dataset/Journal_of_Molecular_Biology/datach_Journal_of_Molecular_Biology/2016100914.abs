interaction analyses of the integrin   cytoplasmic tail with the f ferm domain of talin and     reveal a ternary complex with phosphorylated tail
integrins which are heterodimeric   and  subunits signal transducer proteins are essential for cell adhesion and migration   cytosolic tails   cts of integrins interact with a number of cytosolic proteins including talin dok  and      the formation of multiprotein complexes with  cts is involved in the activation and regulation of integrins the leukocyte specific   integrins are essential for leukocyte trafficking phagocytosis antigen presentation and proliferation in this study we examined the binding interactions between integrin   ct and t  phosphorylated   ct with positive regulators talin and     and negative regulator dok  residues of the f domain of talin belonging to the c terminal helix   strand  and the adjacent loop were found to be involved in the binding interactions with   ct the binding affinity between talin f and   ct was reduced when   t  was phosphorylated but this modification promoted     binding however we were able to detect stable ternary complex formation of t  phosphorylated   ct talin f  and     that involved the repositioning of talin f on   ct we showed that dok binding to   ct was reduced in the presence of     and when   t  was phosphorylated based on these data we propose a sequential model of   integrin activation involving these molecules our study provides for the first time insights toward   integrin activation that involves a multiprotein complex
