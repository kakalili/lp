xenobiotic reductase a in the degradation of quinoline by pseudomonas putida   physiological function structure and mechanism of  hydroxycoumarin reduction
a continuous evolutionary pressure of the biotic and abiotic world has led to the development of a diversity of microbial pathways to degrade and biomineralize aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds the heterogeneity of compounds metabolized by bacteria like pseudomonas putida indicates the large variety of enzymes necessary to catalyse the required reactions quinoline a n heterocyclic aromatic compound can be degraded by microbes along different pathways for p putida  quinoline degradation by the  hydroxycoumarin pathway has been described and several intermediates were identified to select enzymes catalysing the later stages of the  hydroxycoumarin pathway p putida  was grown with quinoline the fmn containing enzyme xenobiotic reductase a xena was isolated and analysed for its reactivity with intermediates of the  hydroxycoumarin pathway xena catalyses the nadph dependent reduction of  hydroxycoumarin and coumarin to produce  hydroxy   dihydrocoumarin and   dihydrocoumarin respectively crystallographic analysis of xena alone and in complex with the two substrates revealed insights into the mechanism xena shows a dimeric arrangement of two     barrel domains each binding one fmn cofactor high resolution crystal structures of complexes with  hydroxycoumarin and coumarin show different modes of binding for these molecules in the active site while coumarin is ideally positioned for hydride transfer from n  of the isoalloxazine ring to c  of coumarin  hydroxycoumarin forms a non productive complex with oxidised xena orientation of  hydroxycoumarin in the active site appears to be dependent on the electronic state of the flavin we postulate that xena catalyses the last step of the  hydroxycoumarin pathway before the heterocyclic ring is hydrolysed to yield    dihydroxyphenyl propionic acid as xena is also found in p putida strains unable to degrade quinoline it appears to have more than one physiological function and is an example of how enzymes with low substrate specificity can help to explain the variety of degradation pathways possible
