polycystin  associates with tropomyosin  an actin microfilament component
polycystin  pc  is the product of the second cloned gene pkd  responsible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and has recently been shown to be a calcium permeable cation channel pc has been shown to connect indirectly with the actin microfilament here we report a direct association between pc and the actin microfilament using a yeast two hybrid screen we identified a specific interaction between the pc cytoplasmic c terminal domain and tropomyosin  tm   a component of the actin microfilament complex tropomyosins constitute a protein family of more than  isoforms arising mainly from alternative splicing and are present in muscle as well as non muscle cells we identified a new tm  splicing isoform in kidney and heart tm a that differs from tm  in the c terminus and interacted with pc  in vitro biochemical methods including gst pull down blot overlay and microtiter binding assays confirmed the interaction between pc and the two tm  isoforms further experiments targeted the interacting domains to g  r  of pc and a  e   a common segment of tm  and tm a indirect double immunofluorescence experiments showed partial co localization of pc and tm  in transfected mouse fibroblast nih t cells co immunoprecipitation co ip studies using t cells and xenopus oocytes co expressing pc and tm  or tm a revealed in vivo association between the protein pairs furthermore the in vivo interaction between the endogenous pc and tm  was demonstrated also by reciprocal co ip using native human embryonic kidney cells and human adult kidney considering previous reports that tm  acts as a suppressor of neoplastic growth of transformed cells it is possible that tm  contributes to cyst formation growth when the anchorage of pc to the actin microfilament via tm  is altered
