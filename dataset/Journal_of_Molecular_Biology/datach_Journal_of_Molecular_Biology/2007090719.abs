biophysical properties of  c crystallin in human and mouse eye lens the role of molecular dipoles
the eye lens is packed with soluble crystallin proteins providing a lifetime of transparency and light refraction   crystallins are major components of the dense high refractive index central regions of the lens and generally have high solubility high stability and high levels of cysteine residues human  c belongs to a group of  crystallins with a pair of cysteine residues at positions  and   unlike other  crystallins it has relatively low solubility whereas mouse  c which has the exposed c  replaced with arginine and a novel mouse splice variant  cins are both highly soluble furthermore human  c is extremely stable while the mouse orthologs are less stable evolutionary pressure may have favoured stability over solubility for human  c and the reverse for the orthologs in the mouse mutation of c  to r  in human  c greatly increased solubility however neither form produced crystals remarkably when the human  d r s crystallization cataract mutation was mimicked in human  c crystallin the solubility of  c was dramatically increased although it still did not crystallize the highly soluble mouse  c crystallin did crystallize its x ray structure was solved and used in homology modelling of human  c and its mutants c r and r s the human  d r s mutant was also modelled from human  d coordinates molecular dynamics simulation of the six molecules in the solution state showed that the human  cs differed from  ds in domain pairing behaviour that correlates with interface sequence changes when the fluctuations of the calculated molecular dipoles for the six structures over time were analysed characteristic patterns for soluble  c and  d proteins were observed individual sequence changes that increase or decrease solubility correlated well with changes in the magnitude and direction of these dipoles it is suggested that changes in surface residues have allowed adaptation for the differing needs of human and mouse lenses
