solution structure of the complex formed by the two n terminal rna binding domains of nucleolin and a pre rrna target
nucleolin is a  kda multidomain protein involved in several steps of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis in vitro selection in combination with mutagenesis and structural analysis identified binding sites in pre rrna with the consensus u g cccg a g in the context of a hairpin structure the nucleolin recognition element nre  the central region of the protein contains four tandem rna binding domains rbds  of which the first two are responsible for the rna binding specificity and affinity for nres here we present the solution structure of the  kda complex formed by the two n terminal rna binding domains of nucleolin rbd  and a natural pre rrna target b nre the structure demonstrates that the sequence specific recognition of the pre rrna nre is achieved by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions involving mainly the  sheet surfaces of the two rbds and the linker residues a comparison with our previously determined nmr structure of rbd  in complex with an in vitro selected rna target snre shows that although the sequence specific recognition of the loop consensus nucleotides is the same in the two complexes they differ in several aspects while the protein makes numerous specific contacts to the non consensus nucleotides in the loop e motif s turn in the upper part of the snre stem nucleolin rbd  contacts only consensus nucleotides in b nre the absence of these upper stem contacts from the rbd  b nre complex results in a much less stable complex as demonstrated by kinetic analyses the role of the loop e motif in high affinity binding is supported by gel shift analyses with a series of snre mutants the less stable interaction of rbd  with the natural rna target is consistent with the proposed role of nucleolin as a chaperone that interacts transiently with pre rrna to prevent misfolding
