a far upstream oct  motif regulates cytokine induced transcription of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase gene
transcriptional regulation of the human inducible nitric oxide synthase hinos gene is highly complex and requires an orchestrated flow of positive and negative transcription factors that bind to specific cis acting upstream response elements very little specific information exists about the far upstream region of the hinos gene oct  protein belongs to the pit  oct  unc domain transcription factor family and is constitutively expressed in all dividing cells it is essential for proliferation differentiation and other key cell processes however the role of oct  in regulating hinos gene expression has not been reported in this work the octamer sequence   atgcaaat   at     kb in the hinos promoter was identified as high affinity oct  binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay in vitro and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in vivo mutation of oct  motif at     kb in the hinos promoter decreased cytokine induced hinos promoter activity by   cytokine induced hinos promoter activity was also significantly reduced by oct  small interfering rna targeting overexpression of oct  increased cytokine induced hinos protein expression in primary human hepatocytes furthermore the oct  motif at     kb of the hinos promoter conferred increased transcriptional activity to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter irrespective of cytokine induction taken together this work identifies a far upstream functional oct  enhancer motif at     kb in the hinos promoter that regulates cytokine induced hinos gene transcription and further underscores tight control mechanisms regulating the expression of the hinos gene
