identification of the core structure of lysozyme amyloid fibrils by proteolysis
human lysozyme variants form amyloid fibrils in individuals suffering from a familial non neuropathic systemic amyloidosis in vitro wild type human and hen lysozyme and the amyloidogenic mutants can be induced to form amyloid fibrils when incubated under appropriate conditions in this study fibrils of wild type human lysozyme formed at low ph have been analyzed by a combination of limited proteolysis and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy in order to map conformational features of the   residue chain of lysozyme when embedded in the amyloid aggregates after digestion with pepsin at low ph the lysozyme fibrils were found to be composed primarily of n and c terminally truncated protein species encompassing residues     and      although a significant minority of molecules was found to be completely resistant to proteolysis under these conditions ftir spectra provide evidence that lysozyme fibrils contain extensive  sheet structure and a substantial element of non  sheet or random structure that is reduced significantly in the fibrils after digestion the sequence     includes the  sheet and helix c of the native protein previously found to be prone to unfold locally in human lysozyme and its pathogenic variants moreover this core structure of the lysozyme fibrils encompasses the highly aggregation prone region of the sequence recently identified in hen lysozyme the present proteolytic data indicate that the region of the lysozyme molecule that unfolds and aggregates most readily corresponds to the most highly protease resistant and thus highly structured region of the majority of mature amyloid fibrils overall the data show that amyloid formation does not require the participation of the entire lysozyme chain the majority of amyloid fibrils formed from lysozyme under the conditions used here contain a core structure involving some   of the polypeptide chain that is flanked by proteolytically accessible n and c terminal regions
