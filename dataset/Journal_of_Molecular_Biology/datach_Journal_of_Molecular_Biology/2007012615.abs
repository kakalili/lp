the mechanosensitive channel protein mscl is targeted by the srp to the novel yidc membrane insertion pathway of escherichia coli
the mechanosensitive channel mscl in the inner membrane of escherichia coli is a homopentameric complex involved in homeostasis when cells are exposed to hypo osmotic conditions the e coli mscl protein is synthesized as a polypeptide of   amino acid residues and uses the bacterial signal recognition particle srp for membrane targeting the protein is inserted into the membrane independently of the sec translocon mutants affected in the sec components are competent for mscl assembly translocation of the periplasmic domain was detected using a membrane impermeant sulfhydryl specific gel shift reagent the modification of a single cysteine residue at position  indicated its translocation across the inner membrane from these in vivo experiments it is concluded that the electrical chemical membrane potential is not necessary for membrane insertion of mscl however depletion of the membrane insertase yidc inhibits translocation of the protein across the membrane we show here that yidc is essential for efficient membrane insertion of the mscl protein yidc is a component of a recently identified membrane insertion pathway that is evolutionarily conserved in bacteria mitochondria and chloroplasts
