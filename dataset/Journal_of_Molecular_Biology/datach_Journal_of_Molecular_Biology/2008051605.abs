molecular dynamics simulation of the escherichia coli nikr protein equilibrium conformational fluctuations reveal interdomain allosteric communication pathways
escherichia coli nikr is a homotetrameric ni  and dna binding protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor of the nikabcde nickel permease the protein is composed of two distinct domains the n terminal  amino acids of each chain forms part of the dimeric ribbon  helix  helix rhh domains a well studied dna binding fold the  residue c terminal nickel binding domain forms an act aspartokinase chorismate mutase and tyra fold and contains the tetrameric interface in this study we have utilized an equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation in order to explore the conformational dynamics of the nikr tetramer and determine important residue interactions within and between the rhh and act domains to gain insight into the effects of ni  on dna binding activity the molecular simulation data were analyzed using two different correlation measures based on fluctuations in atomic position and noncovalent contacts together with a clustering algorithm to define groups of residues with similar correlation patterns for both types of correlation measure based on these analyses we have defined a series of residue interrelationships that describe an allosteric communication pathway between the ni  and dna binding sites which are separated by     several of the residues identified by our analyses have been previously shown experimentally to be important for nikr function an additional subset of the identified residues structurally connects the experimentally implicated residues and may help coordinate the allosteric communication between the act and rhh domains
