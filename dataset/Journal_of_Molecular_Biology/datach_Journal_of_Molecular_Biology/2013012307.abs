the molten globule of   microglobulin accumulated at ph and its role in protein folding
the acid transition of   microglobulin   m was studied by tryptophan fluorescence peptide circular dichroism and nmr spectroscopy the protein exhibits a three state transition with an equilibrium intermediate accumulated at ph    c  the ph intermediate has typical characteristics of the molten globule mg state it showed a native like secondary structure without specific side chain tertiary structure and the hydrodynamic radius determined by pulse field gradient nmr was only   larger than that of the native state the accumulation of the ph intermediate is very analogous to the behavior of apomyoglobin for which the ph mg has been well characterized although  m a  protein is structurally very different from  helical apomyoglobin nmr ph titration of histidine residues of  m has also indicated that his  has an abnormally low pka value in the native state from the ph dependence of the unfolding transition the protonations of this histidine and  weakly abnormal carboxylates triggered the transition from the native to the mg state this behavior is again analogous to that of apomyoglobin suggesting a common mechanism of production of the ph mg in contrast to the folding of apomyoglobin in which the mg was equivalent to the burst phase kinetic folding intermediate the burst phase refolding intermediate of  m detected by stopped flow circular dichroism was significantly more structured than the ph intermediate it is proposed that the folding of  m from its acid denatured state takes place in the following order denatured state  mg  burst phase intermediate  native state
