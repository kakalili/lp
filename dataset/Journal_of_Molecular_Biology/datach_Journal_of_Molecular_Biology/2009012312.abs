keyhole limpet hemocyanin    cryoem structure and molecular model of the klh didecamer reveal the interfaces and intricate topology of the   functional units
hemocyanins are blue copper containing respiratory proteins in the hemolymph of many arthropods and molluscs molluscan hemocyanins are decamers didecamers or multidecamers of a   to   kda polypeptide subunit containing seven or eight globular functional units fus fu a to fu h  each with an oxygen binding site the decamers are short  nm hollow cylinders with their lumen narrowed by a collar complex our recently published   cryo electron microscopy crystal structure hybrid model of a   mda cephalopod hemocyanin decamer nautilus pompilius hemocyanin nph  revealed the pathway of the seven fu subunit    kda   types of inter fu interface and an asymmetric collar consisting of five  arcs   fu g pairs  we now present a comparable hybrid model of an  mda gastropod hemocyanin didecamer assembled from two asymmetric decamers isoform keyhole limpet hemocyanin klh  of the established immunogen klh  compared to nph the klh subunit    kda is c terminally elongated by fu h which is further extended by a unique tail domain we have found that the wall and arc structure of the klh decamer is very similar to that of nph we have traced the subunit pathway and how it continues from klh g to klh h to form an annulus of five  slabs   fu h pairs at one cylinder edge the  types of inter fu interface detected in nph are also present in klh  moreover we have identified one arc slab interface two slab slab interfaces five slab wall interfaces and four decamer decamer interfaces the  interfaces are described on the basis of two subunit conformers yielding an asymmetric homodimer six protrusions from the cryo electron microscopy structure per subunit are associated with putative attachment sites for n linked glycans indicating a total of   sugar trees in klh  also putative binding sites for divalent cations have been detected in conclusion the present   data on klh confirm and substantially broaden our recent analysis of the smaller cephalopod hemocyanin and essentially solve the gastropod hemocyanin structure
