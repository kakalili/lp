structural basis for isotype selectivity of the human retinoic acid nuclear receptor edited by t richmond
the human retinoic acid receptor hrar belongs to the family of nuclear receptors that regulate transcription in a ligand dependent way the isotypes rar   and  are distinct pharmacological targets for retinoids that are involved in the treatment of various skin diseases and cancers in particular breast cancer and acute promyelocytic leukemia therefore synthetic retinoids have been developed aiming at isotype selectivity and reduced side effects we report the crystal structures of three complexes of the hrar  ligand binding domain lbd bound to agonist retinoids that possess selectivity either for rar  bms    or for rar    cd   or that are potent for all rar isotypes panagonist bms     the high resolution data        provide a description at the atomic level of the ligand pocket revealing the molecular determinants for the different degrees of ligand selectivity the comparison of the complexes of the chemically closely related retinoids bms    and cd  shows that the side chain of met  adopts different conformations depending on the presence of a hydrogen bond between its sulfur atom and the ligand this accounts for their different isotype selectivity on the other hand the difference between the pan and the rar   selective agonist is probably due to a steric discrimination at the level of the  naphthoic acid moiety of cd   based on this study we propose a model for a complex with the rar  specific agonist cd  that shows the possible applications for structure based drug design of rar isotype selective retinoids
