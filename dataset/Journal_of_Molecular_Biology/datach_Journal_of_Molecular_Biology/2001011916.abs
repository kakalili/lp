x ray crystallographic analyses of complexes between bovine  trypsin and schiff base copper ii or iron iii chelates edited by i a wilson
to establish the structural basis underlying the activity of a novel series of metal chelate trypsin inhibitors the structures of p amidinosalicylidene l alaninato aqua copper ii  a  m amidinosalicylidene l alaninato aqua copper ii  b  bis p amidinosalicylidene l alaninato iron iii  a  and bis m amidinosalicylidene l alaninato iron iii  b bound to bovine  trypsin were studied by x ray crystallography the amidinium group of the inhibitor donates hydrogen bonds to asp   gly  and ser   as seen before in trypsin benzamidine complexes the copper ii ion of a is situated away from trypsin  s catalytic triad residues and is octahedrally coordinated by a schiff base and three water molecules in contrast the copper ii ion of b is situated close to the catalytic triad and adopts a square pyramidal coordination geometry the iron iii ion of a is octahedrally coordinated by two schiff base ligands and like the copper ii ion of a is situated away from the catalytic triad the p amidinophenyl ring of a second schiff base ligand of a is directed toward a hydrophobic groove formed by trp  and leu  finally the iron iii ion of b appears to be replaced by magnesium ii  which is octahedrally coordinated by a schiff base gln  and two water molecules one of the schiff base ligands seen in the trypsin a complex or in the unbound form of b is replaced by water molecules and gln   his  and ser  form water mediated interactions with the magnesium ii ion of b and ser  also forms a hydrogen bond with the phenolic oxygen atom of the schiff base ligand these structures reveal a novel mode of interaction between metal chelate inhibitors and serine proteases thus providing a structural basis for the development of more potent inhibitors against a variety of trypsin like enzymes
