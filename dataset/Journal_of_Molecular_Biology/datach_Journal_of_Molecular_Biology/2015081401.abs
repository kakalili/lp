post transcriptional regulation of renalase gene by mir  and mir   micrornas implications for cardiometabolic disorders
renalase a recently identified oxidoreductase is emerging as a novel regulator of cardiovascular and metabolic disease states the mechanism of regulation of renalase gene especially at the post transcriptional level is completely unknown we set out to investigate the possible role of micrornas in regulation of renalase gene in this study computational predictions using multiple algorithms coupled with systematic functional analysis revealed specific interactions of mir  a b c and mir  a b with mouse and human renalase   utr untranslated region in cultured cells next we estimated mir  b and mir  a as well as renalase expression in genetically hypertensive blood pressure high and genetically hypotensive blood pressure low mice kidney tissues from blood pressure high mice showed diminished    to   fold renalase mrna protein levels and elevated    fold mir  b levels as compared to blood pressure low mice a common single nucleotide polymorphism in human renalase   utr c t rs     creates a binding site for mir  a consistently mir  a down regulated human renalase   utr luciferase activity in case of the t allele suggesting its potential role in regulation of renalase in humans indeed genome wide association studies revealed directionally concordant association of rs     with diastolic blood pressure glucose and triglyceride levels in large human populations n          subjects  this study provides evidence for post transcriptional regulation of renalase gene by mir  and mir   and has implications for inter individual variations on cardiometabolic traits
