structure fluorescence correlations in a single tryptophan mutant of carp parvalbumin solution structure backbone and side chain dynamics edited by p e wright
heterogeneous fluorescence intensity decays of tryptophan in proteins are often rationalized using a model which proposes that different rotameric states of the indole alanyl side chain are responsible for the observed fluorescence lifetime heterogeneity we present here the study of a mutant of carp parvalbumin bearing a single tryptophan residue at position   f  w whose fluorescence intensity decay is heterogeneous and assess the applicability of a rotamer model to describe the fluorescence decay data we have determined the solution structure of f  w in the calcium ligated state using multi dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and have used the minimum perturbation mapping technique to explore the possible existence of multiple conformations of the indole moiety of trp  of f  w and for comparison trp  of holo azurin the maps for parvalbumin suggest two potential conformations of the indole side chain the high energy barrier for rotational isomerization between these conformers implies that interwell rotation would occur on time scales of milliseconds or greater and suggests a rotamer basis for the heterogeneous fluorescence however the absence of alternate trp  conformers in the nmr data to within   of the dominant species suggests that the heterogeneous fluorescence of trp  may arise from mechanisms independent of rotameric states of the trp side chain the map for holo azurin has only one conformation and suggests a rotamer model may not be required to explain its heterogeneous fluorescence intensity decay the backbone and trp  side chain dynamics at   c of f  w has been characterized based on an analysis of  n nmr relaxation data which we have interpreted using the lipari szabo formalism high order parameter s  values were obtained for both the helical and loop regions additionally the s values imply that the calcium binding cd and ef loops are not strictly equivalent the s value for the indole side chain of trp  obtained from the fluorescence nmr relaxation and minimum perturbation data are consistent with a trp moiety whose motion is restricted
