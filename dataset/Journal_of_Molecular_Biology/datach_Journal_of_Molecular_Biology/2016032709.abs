ease mm sequence based prediction of mutation induced stability changes with feature based multiple models
protein engineering and characterisation of non synonymous single nucleotide variants snvs require accurate prediction of protein stability changes   gu induced by single amino acid substitutions here we have developed a new prediction method called evolutionary amino acid and structural encodings with multiple models ease mm  which comprises five specialised support vector machine svm models and makes the final prediction from a consensus of two models selected based on the predicted secondary structure and accessible surface area of the mutated residue the new method is applicable to single domain monomeric proteins and can predict   gu with a protein sequence and mutation as the only inputs ease mm yielded a pearson correlation coefficient of       in  fold cross validation and independent testing and was able to outperform other sequence based methods when compared to structure based energy functions ease mm achieved a comparable or better performance the application to a large dataset of human germline non synonymous snvs showed that the disease causing variants tend to be associated with larger magnitudes of   gu predicted with ease mm the ease mm web server is available at http  sparks lab org server ease
