functional interplay between cbp and pcaf in acetylation and regulation of transcription factor klf  activity
the transcriptional co activators cbp p  and pcaf participate in transcriptional activation by many factors we have shown that both cbp p  and pcaf stimulate the transcriptional activation by klf  a member of the klf sp family either individually or cooperatively here we further investigated how cbp and pcaf acetylation regulate klf  activity and how these two co activators functionally interplay in the regulation of klf  activity we found that cbp and pcaf acetylated klf  at specific lysine residues in the zinc finger domain of klf  the acetylation by cbp however resulted in disruption of klf  dna binding although the acetyltransferase activity of cbp is not required for stimulating the dna binding activity of all of the transcription factors that we have examined the disruption of factor dna binding by cbp acetylation is factor specific we further showed that pcaf and cbp act synergistically and antagonistically to regulate klf  dna binding depending on the status of acetylation pcaf blocked cbp acetylation and disruption of klf  dna binding conversely acetylation of klf  by cbp prevented pcaf stimulation of klf  dna binding pcaf blocked cbp disruption of klf  dna binding by preventing cbp acetylation of klf  these results demonstrate that acetylation by cbp has distinct effects on transcription factor dna binding and that cbp and pcaf regulate each other functionally in their regulation of transcription factor dna binding
