nmr mapping of pcna interaction with translesion synthesis dna polymerase rev mediated by rev brct domain
rev is a y family translesion synthesis tls dna polymerase involved in bypass replication across sites of dna damage and postreplicational gap filling in the process of tls high fidelity replicative dna polymerases stalled by dna damage are replaced by error prone tls enzymes responsible for the majority of mutagenesis in eukaryotic cells the polymerase exchange that gains low fidelity tls polymerases access to dna is mediated by their interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna  rev stands alone from other y family tls enzymes since it lacks the consensus pcna interacting protein box pip box motif instead utilizing other modular domains for pcna binding here we report solution nmr structure of an  kda brca c terminus brct domain from saccharomyces cerevisiae rev and demonstrate with the use of transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy trosy nmr methods that rev brct domain directly interacts with an  kda pcna in solution the domain adopts    fold                  typical for brct domain superfamily pcna binding interface of the rev brct domain comprises conserved residues of the outer surface of the   helix and the         and     loops on the other hand rev brct binds to the inter domain region of pcna that overlaps with the binding site for the pip box motif furthermore rev brct domain bound to pcna can be displaced by increasing amounts of the pip box peptide from tls dna polymerase pol  suggesting that rev brct and pol  pip box interactions with the same pcna monomer are mutually exclusive these results provide structural insights into pcna recognition by tls dna polymerases that help better understand tls regulation in eukaryotes
