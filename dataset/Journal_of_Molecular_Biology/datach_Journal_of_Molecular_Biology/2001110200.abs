hepatitis c virus ns ntpase helicase different stereoselectivity in nucleoside triphosphate utilisation suggests that ntpase and helicase activities are coupled by a nucleotide dependent rate limiting step edited by a r fersht
hepatitis c virus hcv ns protein is a multifunctional enzyme possessing protease ntpase and helicase activities within a single polypeptide of   amino acid residues these activities are essential for the virus life cycle and are considered attractive targets for anti hcv chemotherapy beside atp the ns protein has the ability to utilise deoxynucleoside triphosphates dntps as the energy source for nucleic acid unwinding we have performed an extensive analysis of the substrate specificities of both ns ntpase and helicase activities with respect to all four dntps as well as with dideoxynucleoside triphoshate ddntp analogs including both d   and l   deoxy and dideoxy nucleoside triphosphates our results show that almost all dntps and ddntps tested were able to inhibit hydrolysis of atp by the ntpase activity albeit with different efficiencies moreover this activity showed almost no stereoselectivity being able to recognise both d    l   deoxy and ddntps on the contrary the helicase activity had more strict substrate selectivity since among d   nucleotides only ddttp and its analog      didehydro thymidine triphosphate could be used as substrates with an efficiency comparable to atp whereas among l   nucleotides only l   datp was utilised comparison of the steady state kinetic parameters for both reactions suggested that datp l   dctp and l   dttp specifically reduced a rate limiting step present in the helicase but not in the ntpase reaction pathway these results suggest that ns associated ntpase and helicase activities have different sensitivities towards different classes of deoxy and dideoxy nucleoside analogs depending on a specific step in the reaction as well as show different enantioselectivity for the d   and l   conformations of the sugar ring these observations provide an essential mechanistic background for the development of specific nucleotide analogs targeting either activity as potential anti hcv agents
