crystal structure of the complex between the fab  fragment of the cross neutralizing anti hiv  antibody f and the fab fragment of its anti idiotypic antibody h
the monoclonal antibody f neutralizes a broad range of human immunodeficiency virus  isolates via a conserved epitope on the viral glycoprotein gp  the conformation of the principal epitope is a type i  turn centered on gp  residues  dkw   in addition binding studies indicate that residues n and c terminal to this core as well as structurally more distant parts of gp  also contribute to the interaction ab  h is an anti idiotypic antibody that inhibits the interaction between f and gp  and as such ab  h may in principle possess a paratope that mimics the gp  epitope to establish the potential of ab  h to serve as a guide for the design of vaccine components against human immunodeficiency virus we investigated the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex of ab  h fab and f fab   ab  h fab binds to f fab  via a helix like protrusion formed by residues  h ryspslntrl  h of the f fab  variable domain and proximal to but not overlapping with the gp   dkw  epitope binding pocket this defines ab  h as an anti idiotypic antibody of the ab  class i e  an antigen inhibitable idiotype that does not carry the internal image of the linear primary gp   eldkwas  epitope
