folding mechanism of an ankyrin repeat protein scaffold and active site formation of human cdk inhibitor p ink d
the p ink d protein consists of five ankyrin repeats ank and controls the human cell cycle by inhibiting the cyclin d dependent kinases cdk  and  we investigated the folding of p ink d by urea induced unfolding transitions kinetic analyses of unfolding and refolding including double mixing experiments and a special assay for folding intermediates folding is a sequential two step reaction via a hyperfluorescent on pathway intermediate this intermediate is present under all conditions during unfolding refolding and at equilibrium the folding mechanism was confirmed by a quantitative global fit of a consistent set of equilibrium and kinetic data revealing the thermodynamics and intrinsic folding rates of the different states surprisingly the n  i transition is much faster compared to the i  u transition the urea dependence of the intrinsic folding rates causes population of the intermediate at equilibrium close to the transition midpoint nmr detected hydrogen deuterium exchange and the analysis of truncated variants showed that the c terminal repeats ank  are already folded in the on pathway intermediate whereas the n terminal repeats  and  are not folded we suggest that during refolding repeats ank  ank first form the scaffold for the subsequent assembly of repeats ank and ank  the binding function of p ink d resides in the latter repeats we propose that the graded stability and the facile unfolding of repeats  and  is a prerequisite for the down regulation of the inhibitory activity of p ink d during the cell cycle
