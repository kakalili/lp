altered ion channel formation by the parkinson s disease linked e k mutant of  synuclein is corrected by gm but not by gm gangliosides
synuclein   syn is an amyloidogenic protein that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of parkinson s disease pd  the ability of  syn oligomers to form ionic channels is postulated as a channelopathy mechanism in human brain here we identified a ganglioside binding domain in  syn fragment      which includes the mutation site  linked to a familial form of pd e k  we show that this fragment is structurally related to the common glycosphingolipid binding domain gbd shared by various microbial and amyloid proteins including alzheimer s  amyloid peptide   syn gbd interacts with several glycosphingolipids but has a marked preference for gm  a minor brain ganglioside whose expression increases with aging the  syn mutant e k has a stronger affinity for gm than the wild type protein and the interaction is inhibited by   sialyllactose the glycone part of gm  alanine substitutions of lys  and tyr  in synthetic gbd peptides resulted in limited interaction with gm  demonstrating the critical role of these residues in gm recognition when incubated with reconstituted phosphatidylcholine bilayers the e k protein formed channels that are five times less conductive than those formed by wild type  syn exhibit a higher selectivity for cations and present an asymmetrical response to voltage and nonstop single channel activity this e k associated channelopathy was no longer observed when gm was present in phosphatidylcholine bilayers this corrective effect was highly specific for gm  since it was not obtained with the major brain ganglioside gm but was still detected in bilayer membranes containing both gm and gm  moreover synthetic gbd peptides prevented the interaction of  syn proteins with gm  thus abolishing the regulatory effects of gm on  syn mediated channel formation overall these data show that gm can specifically regulate  syn induced channel formation and raise the intriguing possibility that this minor brain ganglioside could play a key protective role in the pathogenesis of pd
