crystal structure of the acidaminococcus fermentans  hydroxyglutaryl coa dehydratase component a edited by i a wilson
acidaminococcus fermentans degrades glutamate via the hydroxyglutarate pathway which involves the syn elimination of water from r  hydroxyglutaryl coa in a key reaction of the pathway this anaerobic process is catalyzed by  hydroxyglutaryl coa dehydratase an enzyme with two components a and d that reversibly associate during reaction cycles component a compa  a homodimeric protein of x  kda contains a single bridging  fe s cluster and uses the hydrolysis of atp to deliver an electron to the dehydratase component compd  where the electron is used catalytically the structure of the extremely oxygen sensitive compa protein was solved by x ray crystallography to   resolution the protein was found to be a member of the actin fold family revealing a similar architecture and nucleotide binding site the key differences between compa and other members of the actin fold family are  i the presence of a cluster binding segment the  cluster helix   ii the  fe s cluster and iii the location of the homodimer interface which involves the bridging cluster possible reaction mechanisms are discussed in light of the close structural similarity to members of the actin fold family and the functional similarity to the nitrogenase fe protein
