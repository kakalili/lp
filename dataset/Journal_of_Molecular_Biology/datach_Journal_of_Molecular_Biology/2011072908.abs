focal adhesion proteins talin  and vinculin negatively affect paxillin phosphorylation and limit retroviral infection
many of the early events in retroviral infection are not well understood but it is known that the host cytoskeleton and signaling pathways play integral roles in various entry and post entry processes focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface here we show that talin  and vinculin two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton function during retroviral infection transient overexpression of either talin  or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  and moloney murine leukemia virus in contrast transient short interfering rna mediated knockdown of talin  or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped hiv  and simian immunodeficiency virus demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection talin  or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis while analysis of hiv  dna synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents finally talin  and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped hiv  infection together these findings demonstrate that talin  and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin a novel positive regulator of hiv  infection and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses
