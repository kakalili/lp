the location and the significance of a cross link between the sarcin ricin domain of ribosomal rna and the elongation factor g
during translocation peptidyl trna moves from the a site to the p site and mrna is displaced by three nucleotides in the   direction this reaction is catalyzed by elongation factor g ef g and is associated with ribosome dependent hydrolysis of gtp the molecular basis of translocation is the most important unsolved problem with respect to ribosome function a critical question one that might provide a clue to the mechanism of translocation is the precise identity of the contacts between ef g and ribosome components to make the identification a covalent bond was formed by ultraviolet irradiation between ef g and a sarcin ricin domain srd oligoribonucleotide containing  iodouridine the cross link was established by mass spectroscopy and by edman degradation to be between a tryptophan at position   in the g domain in ef g and either one of two  iodouridine nucleotides in the sequence uag  u in the srd g   is a critical identity element for the recognition of the factor s ribosomal binding site the site of the cross link provides the first direct evidence that the srd is in close proximity to the ef g catalytic center the proximity suggests that the srd rna has a role in the activation of gtp hydrolysis that leads to a transition in the conformation of the factor and to its release from the ribosome
