calcium induced folding of a beta roll motif requires c terminal entropic stabilization
beta roll motifs are associated with several proteins secreted by the type  secretion system t ss  located just upstream of the c terminal t ss secretion signal they are believed to act as calcium induced switches that prevent folding before secretion bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase cyaa toxin has five blocks of beta roll motifs or repeats in toxin motifs separated by linkers the block v motif on its own has been reported to be non responsive to calcium only when the n and c terminal linkers or flanking groups were fused did the motif bind calcium and fold in an effort to understand the requirements for beta roll folding we have truncated the n and c terminal flanks at several locations to determine the minimal essential sequences calcium responsive beta roll folding occurred even in the absence of the natural n terminal flank the natural c terminal flank could not be truncated without decreased calcium affinity and only partially truncated before losing calcium responsiveness globular protein fusion at the c terminus likewise enabled calcium induced folding but fusions solely at the n terminus failed this demonstrates that calcium induced folding is an inherent property of the beta roll motif rather than the flanking groups given the disparate nature of the observed functional flanking groups c terminal fusions appear to confer calcium responsiveness to the beta roll motif via a non specific mechanism suggesting that entropic stabilization of the unstructured c terminus can enable beta roll folding increased calcium affinity was observed when the natural c terminal flank was used to enable calcium induced folding pointing to its cooperative participation in beta roll formation this work indicates that a general principle of c terminal entropic stabilization can enable stimulus responsive repeat protein folding while the c terminal flank has a specific role in tuning calcium responsive beta roll formation these observations are in stark contrast to what has been reported for other repeat proteins
