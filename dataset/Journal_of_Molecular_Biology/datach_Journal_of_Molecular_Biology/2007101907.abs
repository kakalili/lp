the periplasmic bacterial molecular chaperone sura adapts its structure to bind peptides in different conformations to assert a sequence preference for aromatic residues
the periplasmic molecular chaperone protein sura facilitates correct folding and maturation of outer membrane proteins in gram negative bacteria it preferentially binds peptides that have a high fraction of aromatic amino acids phage display selections isothermal titration calorimetry and crystallographic structure determination have been used to elucidate the basis of the binding specificity the peptide recognition is imparted by the first peptidyl prolyl isomerase ppiase domain of sura crystal structures of complexes between peptides of sequence weyipnv and nftlkfwdifrk with the first ppiase domain of the escherichia coli sura protein at     resolution and of a complex between the dodecapeptide and a sura fragment lacking the second ppiase domain at     resolution have been solved sura binds as a monomer to the heptapeptide in an extended conformation it binds as a dimer to the dodecapeptide in an  helical conformation predicated on a substantial structural rearrangement of the sura protein in both cases side chains of aromatic residues of the peptides contribute a large fraction of the binding interactions sura therefore asserts a recognition preference for aromatic amino acids in a variety of sequence configurations by adopting alternative tertiary and quaternary structures to bind peptides in different conformations
