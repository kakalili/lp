molecular origins of the compatibility between glycosaminoglycans and a   amyloid fibrils
the a  peptide forms extracellular plaques associated with alzheimer s disease in addition to protein fibrils amyloid plaques also contain non proteinaceous components including glycosaminoglycans gags  we have shown previously that the gag low molecular weight heparin lmwh binds to a   fibrils with a three fold symmetric  q morphology with higher affinity than a   fibrils in alternative structures a   fibrils or amyloid fibrils formed from other sequences solid state nmr analysis of the gag  q fibril complex revealed an interaction site at the corners of the q fibril structure but the origin of the binding specificity remained obscure here using a library of short heparin polysaccharides modified at specific sites we show that the n sulfate or  o sulfate of glucosamine but not the  o sulfate of iduronate within heparin is required for q binding indicating selectivity in the interactions of the gag with the fibril that extends beyond general electrostatic complementarity by creating q fibrils containing point substitutions in the amino acid sequence we also show that charged residues at the fibril three fold apices provide the majority of the binding free energy while charged residues elsewhere are less critical for binding the results indicate therefore that lmwh binding to q fibrils requires a precise molecular complementarity of the sulfate moieties on the gag and charged residues displayed on the fibril surface differences in gag binding to fibrils with distinct sequence and or structure may thus contribute to the diverse etiology and progression of amyloid diseases
