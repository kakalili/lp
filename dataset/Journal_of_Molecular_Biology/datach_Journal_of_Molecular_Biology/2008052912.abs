snapshots of a y family dna polymerase in replication substrate induced conformational transitions and implications for fidelity of dpo
y family dna polymerases catalyze translesion dna synthesis over damaged dna each y family polymerase has a polymerase core consisting of a palm finger and thumb domain in addition to a fourth domain known as a little finger domain it is unclear how each domain moves during nucleotide incorporation and what type of conformational changes corresponds to the rate limiting step previously reported in kinetic studies here we present three crystal structures of the prototype y family polymerase apo dpo at    resolution dpo dna binary complex and dpo dna dtmp ternary complex at    resolution dpo undergoes dramatic conformational changes from the apo to the binary structures with a    rotation of the little finger domain relative to the polymerase core upon dna binding this dna induced conformational change is verified in solution by our tryptophan fluorescence studies in contrast the polymerase core retains the same conformation in all three conformationally distinct states particularly the finger domain which is responsible for checking base pairing between the template base and an incoming nucleotide retains a rigid conformation the inflexibility of the polymerase core likely contributes to the low fidelity of dpo  in addition to its loose and solvent accessible active site interestingly while the binary and ternary complexes of dpo retain an identical global conformation the aromatic side chains of two conserved tyrosines at the nucleotide binding site change orientations between the binary and ternary structures such local conformational changes may correspond to the rate limiting step in the mechanism of nucleotide incorporation together the global and local conformational transitions observed in our study provide a structural basis for the distinct kinetic steps of a catalytic cycle of dna polymerization performed by a y family polymerase
