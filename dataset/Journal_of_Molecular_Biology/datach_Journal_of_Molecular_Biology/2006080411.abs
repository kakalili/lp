structure of the bet  tpc b core of trapp two tpc paralogs form trimeric complexes with bet and mum
the transport protein particle trapp complexes are involved in the tethering process at different trafficking steps of vesicle transport we here present the crystal structure of a human bet  tpc b heterodimer which represents a core sub complex in the assembly of trapp we describe a conserved patch of tpc with uncharged pockets forming a putative interaction interface for an anchoring moiety at the golgi the structural and functional comparison of the two paralogs tpc a and tpc b only found in some organisms indicates redundancy and added complexity of trapp architecture and function both iso complexes bet  tpc a and bet  tpc b are able to recruit mum  a further trapp subunit and we identify the      loop regions as a binding site for mum  our study reveals similar stability of the iso complexes and similar expression patterns of the tpc variants in different mouse organs these findings raise the possibility that the tpc paralogs might contribute to the formation of two distinct trapp complexes that differ in function
