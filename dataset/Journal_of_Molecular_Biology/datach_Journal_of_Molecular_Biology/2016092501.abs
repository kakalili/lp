molecular mechanisms of two component signal transduction
two component systems tcs comprising sensor histidine kinases and response regulator proteins are among the most important players in bacterial and archaeal signal transduction and also occur in reduced numbers in some eukaryotic organisms given their importance to cellular survival virulence and cellular development these systems are among the most scrutinized bacterial proteins in the recent years a flurry of bioinformatics genetic biochemical and structural studies have provided detailed insights into many molecular mechanisms that underlie the detection of signals and the generation of the appropriate response by tcs importantly it has become clear that there is significant diversity in the mechanisms employed by individual systems this review discusses the current knowledge on common themes and divergences from the paradigm of tcs signaling an emphasis is on the information gained by a flurry of recent structural and bioinformatics studies
