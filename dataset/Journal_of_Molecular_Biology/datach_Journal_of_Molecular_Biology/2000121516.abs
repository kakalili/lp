dna structure what s in charge
dna structure is well known to be sensitive to hydration and ionic strength recent theoretical predictions and experimental observations have raised the idea of the intrusion of monovalent cations into the minor groove spine of hydration in b form dna to investigate this further extensions and further analysis of molecular dynamics md simulations on d cgccgaattcgcg  d ataggcaaaaaataggcaaaaatgg and d g  ga t c  c  including counterions and water have been performed to examine the effective of minor groove ions on structure we analyzed the md snapshots from a  ns trajectory on d cgcgaattcgcg as two subsets those exhibiting a minor groove water spine and those with groove bound ions the results indicate that na at the apt step of the minor groove of d cgccgaattcgcg makes only small local changes in the dna structure and these changes are well within the thermal fluctuations calculated from the md to examine the effect of ions on the differential stability of a b form helix further analysis was performed on two longer oligonucleotides which exhibit a tract induced axis bending localized around the cpg step in the major groove plots of axis bending and proximity of ions to the bending locus were generated as a function of time and revealed a strong linear correlation supporting the idea that mobile cations play a key role in local helix deformations of dna and indicating ion proximity just precedes the bending event to address the issue of  what s in charge   of dna structure more generally the relative free energy of a and b form d cgcgaattcgcg structures from md simulations under various environmental circumstances were estimated using the free energy component method the results indicate that the dominant effects on conformational stability come from the electrostatic free energy but not exclusively from groove bound ions per se but from a balance of competing factors in the electrostatic free energy including phosphate repulsions internal to the dna the electrostatic component of hydration i e solvent polarization  and electrostatic effects of the counterion atmosphere in summary free energy calculations indicate that the electrostatic component is dominant md shows temporal proximity of mobile counterions to be correlated with a track induced bending and thus the mobile ion component of electrostatics is a significant contributor however the md structure of the dodecamer d cgcgaattcgcg is not highly sensitive to whether there is a sodium ion in the minor groove
