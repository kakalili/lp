coevolution of antibody stability and v  cdr l canonical structure
antibodies recognize antigens through six hypervariable loops five of which have a limited set of conformations known as canonical structures for  light chains the majority of cdr l  the third hypervariable loop of the light chain variable domain vl  adopts the type  canonical structure cs  with a cis proline at position   here we present the design and structural studies of the monoclonal antibody mab  and related mutants that contained a series of progressively germline mutations only in the heavy chain variable domain vh that ultimately led to an increase of more than    c in the melting temperature tm of the antigen binding fragment fab  the all trans cdr l structure in the wild type is significantly different from any known cdr l canonical structures in the thermally stable mutants the l l  s l peptide bond adopts an energetically unfavorable non x proline cis conformation but the overall cdr l loop converted to cs  the stabilized vh appears to function as a specific molecular chaperone that facilitated the trans  cis isomerization of s l thus it is plausible that proline is the evolutionary choice to maintain overall structure and stability for vl these results provide new insights into the evolution of cs and suggest a potential molecular switch mechanism at position  that links cdr l structural diversity and antibody stability and will have implications for antibody engineering
