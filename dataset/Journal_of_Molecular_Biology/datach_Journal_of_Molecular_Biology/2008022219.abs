the transmembrane segment of tom  is recognized by mim for docking to the mitochondrial tom complex
mitochondria cannot be made de novo mitochondrial biogenesis requires that up to   proteins are imported into mitochondria and the protein import pathway relies on hetero oligomeric translocase complexes in both the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes the translocase in the outer membrane the tom complex is composed of a core complex formed from the  barrel channel tom  and additional subunits each with single   helical transmembrane segments how  helical transmembrane segments might be assembled onto a transmembrane  barrel in the context of a membrane environment is a question of fundamental importance the master receptor subunit of the tom complex tom  recognizes the targeting sequence on incoming mitochondrial precursor proteins binds these protein ligands and then transfers them to the core complex for translocation across the outer membrane here we show that the transmembrane segment of tom  contains critical residues essential for docking the tom  receptor into its correct environment within the tom complex this crucial docking reaction is catalyzed by the unique assembly factor mim tom  mutations in the transmembrane segment that destabilize tom  or deletion of mim  prevent tom  from functioning as a receptor for protein import into mitochondria
