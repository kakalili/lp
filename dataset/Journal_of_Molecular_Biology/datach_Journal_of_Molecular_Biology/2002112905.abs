crystal structure and nucleotide sequence of an anionic trypsin from chum salmon oncorhynchus keta in comparison with atlantic salmon salmo salar and bovine trypsin
the nucleotide sequence and crystal structure of chum salmon trypsin cst are now reported the cdna isolated from the pyloric caeca of chum salmon encodes   amino acid residues the same number of residues as the anionic atlantic salmon trypsin ast  but one residue less than bovine  trypsin bt  the net charge on cst determined from the sum of all charged amino acid side chains is    there are  sequence differences between cst and bt but only seven sequence differences between cst and ast anionic cst isolated from pyloric caeca has also been purified and crystallized the structure of the cst  benzamidine complex has been determined to    resolution the overall tertiary structure of cst is similar to that of ast and bt but some differences are observed among the three trypsins the most striking difference is at the c terminus of cst where the expected last two residues are absent the absence of these residues likely increases the flexibility of cst by the loss of important interactions between the n and c terminal domains similarly the lack of tyr  in cst when compared with bt allows more space for gln  in the active site thereby increasing substrate accessibility to the binding pocket lys  in cst also adopts the important role of stabilizing the loop from residue   to   these observations on cst provide a complementary view of a second cold adapted trypsin which in comparison with the structures of ast and bt suggest a structural basis for differences in enzymatic activity between enzymes from cold adapted species and mammals
