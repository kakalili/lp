the nucleoside analogs   c methyl thymidine and   c ethyl thymidine block dna synthesis by wild type hiv  rt and excision proficient nrti resistant rt variants
hiv  can become resistant to nucleoside analogs by developing an enhanced ability to excise the analogs after they have been incorporated excision requires that the analog be located at the   terminus of the primer we have describe nucleoside analogs that do not block dna synthesis at the point of incorporation but only after additional dntps have been added to the dna these nucleoside analogs are called  delayed chain terminators  and are relatively effective inhibitors of drug resistant hiv  reverse transcriptases rts that are excision proficient however the first delayed chain terminator that we characterized was poorly phosphorylated in cultured cells we have examined other nucleoside analogs to determine whether these compounds also act as delayed chain terminators but were more efficiently converted to the triphosphate form by cellular kinases these analogs contain substitutions on the deoxyribose sugar ring at the   carbon   c methyl dt and   c ethyl dt  unlike true delayed chain terminators which terminate dna synthesis in a spatial sense dna synthesis is halted only after additional dntps have been incorporated after the analog    c methyl dttp causes a pause in dna synthesis at the point of incorporation however hiv  rt can eventually extend the primer blocked by the   c me dtmp analog   c methyl dttp blocks dna synthesis in a temporal sense rather than in a spatial sense a primer blocked by   c ethyl dtmp is not extended by hiv  rt and this compound acts like a conventional chain terminator despite the presence of a   oh group these compounds effectively block the replication of an hiv  based vector that replicates using wild type hiv  rt but only in the presence of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase hsv tk  these compounds are effective against many nrti drug resistant rt variants however the m  v mutant is relatively resistant
