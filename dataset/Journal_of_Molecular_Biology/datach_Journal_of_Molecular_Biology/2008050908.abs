substrate recognition mechanism of    glucosidic linkage hydrolyzing enzyme dextran glucosidase from streptococcus mutans
we have determined the crystal structure of streptococcus mutans dextran glucosidase which hydrolyzes the    glucosidic linkage of isomaltooligosaccharides from their non reducing ends to produce  glucose by using the mutant of catalytic acid glu   gln its complex structure with the isomaltotriose a natural substrate of this enzyme has been determined the enzyme has   amino acid residues and a molecular mass of     da the native and the complex structures were determined by the molecular replacement method and refined to    resolution resulting in a final r factor of    for significant reflections in the native structure and    in the complex structure the enzyme is composed of three domains a b and c and has a     barrel in domain a which is common to the  amylase family enzymes three catalytic residues are located at the bottom of the active site pocket and the bound isomaltotriose occupies subsites   to   the environment of the glucose residue at subsite   is similar to the environment of this residue in the  amylase family hydrogen bonds between asp  and arg  and o atom of the glucose unit at subsite   accomplish recognition of the non reducing end of the bound substrate the side chain atoms of glu  and lys  form hydrogen bonds with the o and o atoms of the glucose residue at subsite   the positions of atoms that compose the scissile    glucosidic linkage c  o and c atoms are identical with the positions of the atoms in the scissile    linkage c  o and c atoms of maltopentaose in the  amylase structure from bacillus subtilis the comparison with the  amylase suggests that val  of the dextran glucosidase and the corresponding residues of    hydrolyzing enzymes participate in the determination of the substrate specificity of these enzymes
