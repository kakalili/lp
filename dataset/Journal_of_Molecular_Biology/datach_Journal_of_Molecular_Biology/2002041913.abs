functional interactions of nucleocapsid protein of feline immunodeficiency virus and cellular prion protein with the viral rna
all lentiviruses and oncoretroviruses examined so far encode a major nucleic acid binding protein nucleocapsid or nc  protein  approximately   molecules of which coat the dimeric rna genome studies on hiv  and momulv using in vitro model systems and in vivo have shown that nc protein is required to chaperone viral rna dimerization and packaging during virus assembly and proviral dna synthesis by reverse transcriptase rt during infection the human cellular prion protein prp  thought to be the major component of the agent causing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tse  was recently found to possess a strong affinity for nucleic acids and to exhibit chaperone properties very similar to hiv  nc protein in the hiv  context in vitro tight binding of prp to nucleic acids is proposed to participate directly in the prion disease process to extend our understanding of lentiviruses and of the unexpected nucleic acid chaperone properties of the human prion protein we set up an in vitro system to investigate replication of the feline immunodeficiency virus fiv  which is functionally and phylogenetically distant from hiv  the results show that in the fiv model system nc protein chaperones viral rna dimerization primer trnalys  annealing to the genomic primer binding site pbs and minus strand dna synthesis by the homologous fiv rt fiv nc protein is able to trigger specific viral dna synthesis by inhibiting self priming of reverse transcription the human prion protein was found to mimic the properties of fiv nc with respect to primer trna annealing to the viral rna and chaperoning minus strand dna synthesis
