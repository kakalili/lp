selective deactivation of serum igg a general strategy for the enhancement of monoclonal antibody receptor interactions
serum igg is a potent inhibitor of monoclonal antibody mab binding to the cell surface fc  receptors fc rs  which mediate cytotoxic and phagocytic effector functions here we show that this competition can be eliminated selectively by the introduction to serum of i an enzyme that displaces fc from fc rs and ii a modification present in the therapeutic mab that renders it resistant to that enzyme specifically we show that i endos endoglycosidase s cleaves only complex type glycans of the type found on igg but ii is inactive against an engineered igg fc with oligomannose type glycans endos thus reduces fc r binding of serum igg but not that of engineered mab introduction of both the engineered mab and endoglycosidase in serum leads to a dramatic increase in fc r binding compared to the introduction of mab in serum alone antibody receptor refocusing is a general technique for boosting the effector signal of therapeutic antibodies
