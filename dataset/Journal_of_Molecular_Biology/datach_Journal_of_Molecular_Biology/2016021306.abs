allosteric communication across stat domains associated with stat function and disease causing mutation
stat is a member of stat signal transducer and activator of transcription transcription activators aberration in stat activity due to constitutive activation or mutations leads to diseases such as cancer and hyper immunoglobulin e syndrome hies  stat contains several structured domains including the src homology  domain sh  linker domain ld  dna binding domain dbd and the coiled coil domain here we report the discovery of inter domain allosteric communications in stat from studies using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and other methods we found that ptyr peptide interactions with sh cause structural and dynamics changes in ld and dbd the inter domain allosteric effect is likely mediated by the flexibility in the hydrophobic core in addition a mutation in ld found in hies i  f induces nmr chemical shift perturbation in sh  dbd and the coiled coil domain suggesting conformational changes in these domains consistent with conformational changes in sh  the i  f mutant reduces sh s binding affinity to a ptyr containing peptide this study provides an example of dynamics dependent allosteric effects and due to the structural conservation of the stat family of proteins the inter domain allosteric communication observed in stat likely occurs in other stats
