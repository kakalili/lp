an ancient autoproteolytic domain found in gain zu and nucleoporin
a large family of g protein coupled receptors gpcrs involved in cell adhesion has a characteristic autoproteolysis motif of hlt s known as the gpcr proteolysis site gps  gps is also shared by polycystic kidney disease proteins and it precedes the first transmembrane segment in both families recent structural studies have elucidated the gps to be part of a larger domain named gpcr autoproteolysis inducing gain domain here we demonstrate the remote homology relationships of gain domain to zu domain and nucleoporin  nup  c terminal domain by structural and sequence analysis sequence homology searches were performed to extend zu like domains to bacteria and archaea as well as new eukaryotic families we found that the consecutive zu upa death domain domain organization is commonly used in human cytoplasmic proteins with zu domains including card  caspase recruitment domain containing protein  and nlrp  nacht lrr and pyd domain containing protein  from the fiind function to find family another divergent family of extracellular zu like domains was identified in cartilage intermediate layer proteins and fam  proteins current diverse families of gain domain subdomain b zu and nup  c terminal domain likely evolved from an ancient autoproteolytic domain with an hfs motif the autoproteolytic site was kept intact in nup  p  induced protein with a death domain and unc c like deteriorated in many zu domains and changed in gain and fiind deletion of the strand after the cleavage site was observed in zonula occluden  and some nup  homologs these findings link several autoproteolytic domains extend our understanding of gain domain origination in adhesion gpcrs and provide insights into the evolution of an ancient autoproteolytic domain
