conformational changes in the bacterial srp receptor ftsy upon binding of guanine nucleotides and srp edited by g von heijne
in cotranslational preprotein targeting in escherichia coli the signal recognition particle srp binds to the signal peptide emerging from the ribosome and subsequently interacts with the signal recognition particle receptor ftsy at the plasma membrane both ftsy and the protein moiety of the signal recognition particle ffh are gtpases and gtp is required for the formation of the srp ftsy complex we have studied the binding of gtp gdp to ftsy as well as the srp ftsy complex formation by monitoring the fluorescence of tryptophan   in the i box of mutant ftsy thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the ftsy complexes with gdp gtp and signal recognition particle are reported upon srp ftsy complex formation in the presence of gtp the fluorescence of tryptophan   increased by   and was blue shifted by  nm we conclude that gtp dependent srp ftsy complex formation leads to an extensive conformational change in the i box insertion in the effector region of ftsy
