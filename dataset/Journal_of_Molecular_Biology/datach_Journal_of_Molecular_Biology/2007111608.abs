fatty acids can substitute the hiv fusion peptide in lipid merging and fusion an analogy between viral and palmitoylated eukaryotic fusion proteins
various fusion proteins from eukaryotes and viruses share structural similarities such as a coiled coil motif however compared with eukaryotic proteins a viral fusion protein contains a fusion peptide fp  which is an n terminal hydrophobic fragment that is primarily involved in directing fusion via anchoring the protein to the target cell membrane in various eukaryotic fusion proteins the membrane targeting domain is cysteine rich and must undergo palmitoylation prior to the fusion process here we examined whether fatty acids can replace the fp of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   thereby discerning between the contributions of the sequence versus hydrophobicity of the fp in the lipid merging process for that purpose we structurally and functionally characterized peptides derived from the n terminus of hiv fusion protein  gp  in which the fp is lacking or replaced by fatty acids we found that fatty acid conjugation dramatically enhanced the capability of the peptides to induce lipid mixing and aggregation of zwitterionic phospholipids composing the outer leaflet of eukaryotic cell membranes the enhanced effect of the acylated peptides on membranes was further supported by real time atomic force microscopy afm showing nanoscale holes in zwitterionic membranes membrane binding experiments revealed that fatty acid conjugation did not increase the affinity of the peptides to the membrane significantly furthermore all free and acylated peptides exhibited similar  helical structures in solution and in zwitterionic membranes interestingly the fusogenic active conformation of n  in negatively charged membranes composing the inner leaflet of eukaryotic cells is  sheet apparently n terminal heptad repeat nhr can change its conformation as a response to a change in the charge of the membrane head group overall the data suggest an analogy between the eukaryotic cysteine rich domains and the viral fusion peptide and mark the hydrophobic nature of fp as an important characteristic for its role in lipid merging
