cryo negative staining reveals conformational flexibility within yeast rna polymerase i
the structure of the yeast dna dependent rna polymerase i rna pol i  prepared by cryo negative staining was studied by electron microscopy a structural model of the enzyme at a resolution of   nm was determined from the analysis of isolated molecules and showed an excellent fit with the atomic structure of the rna pol ii    the high signal to noise ratio snr of the stained molecular images revealed a conformational flexibility within the image data set that could be recovered in three dimensions after implementation of a novel strategy to sort the  open  and  closed  conformations in our heterogeneous data set this conformational change mapped in the  wall flap  domain of the second largest subunit   like and allows a better accessibility of the dna binding groove this displacement of the wall flap domain could play an important role in the transition between initiation and elongation state of the enzyme moreover a protrusion was apparent in the cryo negatively stained model which was absent in the atomic structure and was not detected in previous d models of rna pol i this structure could however be detected in unstained views of the enzyme obtained from frozen hydrated d crystals indicating that this novel feature is not induced by the staining process unexpectedly negatively charged molybdenum compounds were found to accumulate within the dna binding groove which is best explained by the highly positive electrostatic potential of this region of the molecule thus suggesting that the stain distribution reflects the overall surface charge of the molecule
