novel enzymatic activity derived from the semliki forest virus capsid protein
the n terminal segment of the semliki forest virus polyprotein is an intramolecular serine protease that cleaves itself off after the invariant trp  from a viral polyprotein and generates the mature capsid protein after this autoproteolytic cleavage the free carboxylic group of trp  interacts with the catalytic triad his   asp  and ser   and inactivates the enzyme we have deleted the last    c terminal residues of the mature capsid protease to investigate whether removal of trp  regenerates enzymatic activity although the c terminally truncated polypeptides do not adopt a defined three dimensional structure and show biophysical properties observed in natively unfolded proteins they efficiently catalyse the hydrolysis of aromatic amino acid esters with higher catalytic efficiency for tryptophan compared to tyrosine esters and kcat km values up to    s   m   the enzymatic mechanism of these deletion variants is typical of serine proteases the ph enzyme activity profile shows a pka    and the ser  ala substitution destroys the enzymatic activity in addition the fast release of the first product of the enzymatic reaction is followed by a steady state second phase indicative of formation and breakdown of a covalent acyl enzyme intermediate the rates of acylation and deacylation are k      s   and k      s   respectively for a tyrosine derivative ester substrate and the amplitude of the burst phase indicates that   of the enzyme molecules are active in summary our data provide further evidence for the potential catalytic activity of natively unfolded proteins and provide the basis for engineering of alphavirus capsid proteins towards hydrolytic enzymes with novel specificities
