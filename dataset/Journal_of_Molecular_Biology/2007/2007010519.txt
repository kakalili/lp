Ribonucleic nucleic acid recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) induces innate immune responses. However, no comprehensive analysis of gene expression in human blood cells in response to unmodified and 2′-modified immunostimulatory RNAs has been reported. Using oligonucleotide microarrays, we show that around 400 genes were significantly (P&lt;0.001) altered in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in response to either single-stranded (ss) or double-stranded (ds) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Most of the upregulated genes encode proteins involved in innate and adaptive immune responses, including proinflammatory cytokines, interferons, chemokines and chemokine receptors. Genes encoding proteins involved in lymphocyte activation (e.g. CD80, CD40, and CD69) and in regulation of the immune responses (e.g. SOCS proteins) were upregulated. Also, genes encoding for antiviral proteins (Mx1, Mx2, TRIM proteins), and interferon regulatory factors (e.g. IRF7) were upregulated. Around 90% of the genes (140 out of 160) affected by R-848, a specific ligand for TLR7 and TLR8, were also affected by ss siRNAs or ds siRNAs, indicating that the signaling pathways activated by R-848 are also activated by immunostimulatory siRNAs. In addition to immunoactivation via TLRs, ss siRNAs and ds siRNAs induced TLR-independent gene alterations. Surprisingly, replacement of only uridine bases with either 2′-fluoro or 2′-O-methyl modified counterparts abrogated all the observed bystander effects. Collectively, these microarray data offer for the first time an insight into human PMBC response to immunostimulatory RNAs such as ss siRNAs and ds siRNAs. The data should help to define strategies to either enhance or avoid the non-specific effects of siRNAs in order to develop safe therapeutics.
