structural analysis of protein folding by the long chain archaeal chaperone fkbp
in the cell protein folding is mediated by folding catalysts and chaperones the two functions are often linked especially when the catalytic module forms part of a multidomain protein as in methanococcus jannaschii peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase fkbp  here we show that fkbp  chaperone activity requires both a  residue insertion in the catalytic fkbp domain also called  insert in flap  or if domain and an  residue c terminal domain we determined fkbp  structures from four crystal forms and analyzed chaperone domains in light of their ability to mediate protein  protein interactions fkbp  is a crescent shaped homodimer we reason that folding proteins are bound inside the large crescent cleft thus enabling their access to inward facing peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase catalytic sites and ipsilateral chaperone domain surfaces as these chaperone surfaces participate extensively in crystal lattice contacts we speculate that the observed lattice contacts reflect a proclivity for protein associations and represent substrate interactions by fkbp  chaperone domains finally we find that fkbp  is an exceptionally flexible molecule suggesting a mechanism for nonspecific substrate recognition
