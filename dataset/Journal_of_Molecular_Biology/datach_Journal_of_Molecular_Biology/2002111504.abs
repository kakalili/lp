the crystal structure of the epstein  barr virus protease shows rearrangement of the processed c terminus
epstein  barr virus ebv belongs to the  herpesvirinae subfamily of the herpesviridae the protease domain of the assemblin protein of herpesviruses forms a monomer  dimer equilibrium in solution the protease domain of ebv was expressed in escherichia coli and its structure was solved by x ray crystallography to    resolution after inhibition with diisopropyl fluorophosphate dfp  the overall structure confirms the conservation of the homodimer and its structure throughout the     and  herpesvirinae the substrate recognition could be modelled using information from the dfp binding from a crystal contact suggesting that the substrate forms an antiparallel  strand extending strand   and from the comparison with the structure of a peptidomimetic inhibitor bound to cytomegalovirus protease the long insert between  strands  and  which was disordered in the kshv protease structure was found to be ordered in the ebv protease and shows the same conformation as observed for proteases in the  and  herpesvirus families in contrast to previous structures the long loop located between  strands  and  is partially ordered probably due to dfp inhibition and a crystal contact it also contributes to substrate recognition the protease shows a specific recognition of its own c terminus in a binding pocket involving residue phe  of the other monomer interacting across the dimer interface this suggests conformational changes of the protease domain after its release from the assemblin precursor followed by burial of the new c terminus and a possible effect onto the monomer  dimer equilibrium the importance of the processed c terminus was confirmed using a mutant protease carrying a c terminal extension and a mutated release site which shows different solution properties and a strongly reduced enzymatic activity
