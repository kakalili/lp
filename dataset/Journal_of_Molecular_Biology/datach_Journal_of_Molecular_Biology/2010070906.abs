computational design of a pak binding protein
we describe a computational protocol called ddmi for redesigning scaffold proteins to bind to a specified region on a target protein the ddmi protocol is implemented within the rosetta molecular modeling program and uses rigid body docking sequence design and gradient based minimization of backbone and side chain torsion angles to design low energy interfaces between the scaffold and target protein iterative rounds of sequence design and conformational optimization were needed to produce models that have calculated binding energies that are similar to binding energies calculated for native complexes we also show that additional conformation sampling with molecular dynamics can be iterated with sequence design to further lower the computed energy of the designed complexes to experimentally test the ddmi protocol we redesigned the human hyperplastic discs protein to bind to the kinase domain of p  activated kinase  pak  six designs were experimentally characterized two of the designs aggregated and were not characterized further of the remaining four designs three bound to the pak with affinities tighter than    m the tightest binding design named spider roll bound with an affinity of    m nmr based structure prediction of spider roll based on backbone and  c  chemical shifts using the program cs rosetta indicated that the architecture of human hyperplastic discs protein is preserved mutagenesis studies confirmed that spider roll binds the target patch on pak  additionally spider roll binds to full length pak in its activated state but does not bind pak when it forms an auto inhibited conformation that blocks the spider roll target site subsequent nmr characterization of the binding of spider roll to pak revealed a comparably small binding  on rate  constant     m   s    the ability to rationally design the site of novel protein  protein interactions is an important step towards creating new proteins that are useful as therapeutics or molecular probes
