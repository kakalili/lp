structural classification and prediction of reentrant regions in  helical transmembrane proteins application to complete genomes
alongside the well studied membrane spanning helices   helical transmembrane tm proteins contain several functionally and structurally important types of substructures here existing d structures of transmembrane proteins have been used to define and study the concept of reentrant regions i e membrane penetrating regions that enter and exit the membrane on the same side we find that these regions can be divided into three distinct categories based on secondary structure motifs namely long regions with a helix  coil  helix motif regions of medium length with the structure helix  coil or coil  helix and regions of short to medium length consisting entirely of irregular secondary structure the residues situated in reentrant regions are significantly smaller on average compared to other regions and reentrant regions can be detected in the inter transmembrane loops with an accuracy of    based on their amino acid composition using top mod a novel method for predicting reentrant regions we have scanned the genomes of escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae and homo sapiens the results suggest that more than   of transmembrane proteins contain reentrant regions and that the occurrence of reentrant regions increases linearly with the number of transmembrane regions reentrant regions seem to be most commonly found in channel proteins and least commonly in signal receptors
