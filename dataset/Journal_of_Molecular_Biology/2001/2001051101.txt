Lysozyme from T4 bacteriophage is comprised of two domains that are both involved in binding substrate. Although wild-type lysozyme has been exclusively crystallized in a closed form that is similar to the peptidoglycan-bound conformation, a more open structure is thought to be required for ligand binding. To determine the relative arrangement of domains within T4 lysozyme in the solution state, dipolar couplings were measured in several different dilute liquid crystalline media by solution NMR methods. The dipolar coupling data were analyzed with a domain orientation procedure described previously that utilizes high-resolution X-ray structures. The cleft between the domains is significantly larger in the average solution structure than what is observed in the X-ray structure of the ligand-free form of the protein (∼17° closure from solution to X-ray structures). A comparison of the solution domain orientation with X-ray-derived structures in the protein data base shows that the solution structure resembles a crystal structure obtained for the M6I mutant. Dipolar couplings were also measured on the lysozyme mutant T21C/T142C, which was oxidized to form an inter-domain disulfide bond (T4SS). In this case, the inter-domain solution structure was found to be more closed than was observed in the crystal (∼11°). Direct refinement of lysozyme crystal structures with the measured dipolar couplings using the program CNS, establishes that this degree of closure can be accommodated whilst maintaining the inter-domain cystine bond. The differences between the average solution conformations obtained using dipolar couplings and the crystal conformations for both forms of lysozyme investigated in this study illustrate the impact that crystal packing interactions can have on the arrangement of domains within proteins and the importance of alternative methods to X-ray crystallography for evaluating inter-domain structure.
