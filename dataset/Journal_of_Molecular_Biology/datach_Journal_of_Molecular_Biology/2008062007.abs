the folding process of acylphosphatase from escherichia coli is remarkably accelerated by the presence of a disulfide bond
the acylphosphatase from escherichia coli ecoacp is the first acp so far studied with a disulfide bond a mutational variant of the enzyme lacking the disulfide bond has been produced by substituting the two cysteine residues with alanine ecoacp mutational variant c a c a mutecoacp  the native states of the two protein variants are similar as shown by far uv and near uv circular dichroism and dynamic light scattering measurements from unfolding experiments at equilibrium using intrinsic fluorescence and far uv circular dichroism as probes ecoacp shows an increased conformational stability as compared with mutecoacp the wild type protein folds according to a two state model with a very fast rate constant kfh o     s    while mutecoacp folds ca   fold slower via the accumulation of a partially folded species the correlation between the hydrophobicity of the polypeptide chain and the folding rate found previously in the acp like structural family is maintained only when considering the mutant but not the wild type protein which folds much faster than expected from this correlation similarly the correlation between the relative contact order and the folding rate holds only for mutecoacp the correlation also holds for ecoacp provided the relative contact order value is recalculated by considering the disulfide bridge as an alternate path for the backbone to determine the shortest sequence separation between contacting residues these results indicate that the presence of a disulfide bond in a protein is an important determinant of the folding rate and allows its contribution to be determined in quantitative terms
