crystal structure of extracellular human baff a tnf family member that stimulates b lymphocytes edited by i a wilson
b cell activating factor baff  a ligand belonging to the tumor necrosis factor tnf family plays a critical role in regulating survival and activation of peripheral b cell populations and has been associated with autoimmune disease baff is known to interact with three receptors bcma taci and baff r that have distant similarities with other receptors of the tnf family we have determined the crystal structure of the tnf homologous domain of baff at    resolution the structure reveals significant differences when compared to other tnf family members including an unusually long d e loop that participates in the formation of a deep concave and negatively charged region in the putative receptor binding site the baff structure was further used to generate a homology model of april a closely related tnf family ligand that also binds to bcma and taci but not baff r analysis of the putative receptor binding sites of baff and april suggests that differences in the d e loop structure and electrostatic surface potentials may be important for determining binding specificities for bcma taci and baff r
