a thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of the folding pathway of an sh domain entropically stabilised by a redesigned hydrophobic core
the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the  spectrin sh domain with a redesigned hydrophobic core have been studied the introduction of five replacements a v v l m v v i and v l resulted in an increase of   in the overall volume of the side chains forming the hydrophobic core but caused no remarkable changes to the positions of the backbone atoms judging by the scanning calorimetry data the increased stability of the folded structure of the new sh variant is caused by entropic factors since the changes in heat capacity and enthalpy upon the unfolding of the wild type and mutant proteins were identical at  k it appears that the design process resulted in an increase in burying both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces which resulted in a compensatory effect upon the changes in heat capacity and enthalpy kinetic analysis shows that both the folding and unfolding rate constants are higher for the new variant suggesting that its transition state becomes more stable compared to the folded and unfolded states the    u values found for a number of side chains are slightly lower than those of the wild type protein indicating that although the transition state ensemble tse did not change overall it has moved towards a more denatured conformation in accordance with hammond s postulate thus the acceleration of the folding  unfolding reactions is caused mainly by an improvement in the specific and or non specific hydrophobic interactions within the tse rather than by changes in the contact order experimental evidence showing that the tse changes globally according to its hydrophobic content suggests that hydrophobicity may modulate the kinetic behaviour and also the folding pathway of a protein
