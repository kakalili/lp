insights into the regioselectivity and rna binding affinity of hiv  nucleocapsid protein from linear scaling quantum methods
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  nucleocapsid protein nc plays several important roles in the viral life cycle and presents an attractive target for rational drug design here the macromolecular reactivity of nc and its binding to rna is characterized through determination of electrostatic and chemical descriptors derived from linear scaling quantum calculations in solution the computational results offer a rationale for the experimentally observed susceptibility of the cys  thiolate toward small molecule electrophilic agents and support the recently proposed stepwise protonation mechanism of the c terminal zn coordination complex the distinctive binding mode of nc to sl and sl stem  loops of the hiv  genomic rna packaging signal is studied on the basis of protein side chain contributions to the electrostatic binding energies these results indicate the importance of several basic residues in the   helical region and the n terminal zinc finger and rationalize the presence of several evolutionarily conserved residues in nc the combined reactivity and rna binding study provides new insights that may contribute toward the structure based design of anti hiv therapies
