neuregulin  induces expression of egr  and activates acetylcholine receptor transcription through an egr  binding site
localization of acetylcholine receptors achrs to neuromuscular synapses is mediated in part through selective transcription of achr genes in myofiber synaptic nuclei neuregulin  nrg  and its receptors erbbs are concentrated at synaptic sites and nrg  activates achr synthesis in cultured muscle cells suggesting that nrg  erbb signaling functions to activate synapse specific transcription previous studies have demonstrated that nrg  induced transcription is conferred by cis acting elements located within   bp of   flanking dna from the achr epsilon subunit gene and that it requires a gabp binding site within this region to determine whether additional regulatory elements have a role in nrg  responsiveness we used transcriptional reporter assays in a muscle cell line and we identified an element that is required for nrg  induced transcription neuregulin response element nre  proteins from myotube extracts bind the nre and nrg  treatment of the cells stimulates this binding the ability of nrg  to stimulate formation of a protein  dna complex with the nre requires induction of protein expression the complex contains early growth response  egr   a member of the egr family of transcription factors because proteins in the complex bind specifically to an egr consensus site and formation of the complex is inhibited by antibodies to egr  nrg  induces expression of egr  in myotubes which presumably is responsible for the ability of nrg  to stimulate protein binding to the nre these results suggest that nrg  signaling in myotubes involves induction of egr  expression which in turn serves to activate transcription of the achr epsilon subunit gene
