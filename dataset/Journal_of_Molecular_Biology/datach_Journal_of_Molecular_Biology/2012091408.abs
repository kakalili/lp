crystal structure of the coat protein of the flexible filamentous papaya mosaic virus
papaya mosaic virus papmv is a filamentous plant virus that belongs to the alphaflexiviridae family flexible filamentous viruses have defied more than two decades of effort in fiber diffraction and no high resolution structure is available for any member of the alphaflexiviridae family here we report our structural characterization of papmv by x ray crystallography and cryo electron microscopy three dimensional reconstruction we found that papmv is    in diameter with a helical symmetry of   subunits per turn crystal structure of the c terminal truncated papmv coat protein cp reveals a novel all helix fold with seven  helices thus the papmvcp structure is different from the four helix bundle fold of tobacco mosaic virus in which helix bundling dominates the subunit interface in tobacco mosaic virus and conveys rigidity to the rod virus papmv cp was crystallized as an asymmetrical dimer in which one protein lassoes the other by the n terminal peptide mutation of residues critical to the inter subunit lasso interaction abolishes cp polymerization the crystal structure suggests that papmv may polymerize via the consecutive n terminal loop lassoing mechanism the structure of papmv will be useful for rational design and engineering of the papmv nanoparticles into innovative vaccines
