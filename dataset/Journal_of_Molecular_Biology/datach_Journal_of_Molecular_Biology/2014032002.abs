rig i like receptors evolved adaptively in mammals with parallel evolution at lgp and rig i
rig i like receptors rlrs are nucleic acid sensors that activate antiviral innate immune response these molecules recognize diverse non self rna substrates and are antagonized by several viral inhibitors we performed an evolutionary analysis of rlr genes rig i mda  and lgp  in mammals results indicated that purifying selection had a dominant role in driving the evolution of rlrs however application of maximum likelihood analyses identified several positions that evolved adaptively positively selected sites are located in all domains of mda and rig i whereas in lgp they are confined to the helicase domain in both mda and rig i the linkers separating the caspase activation and recruitment domain and the helicase domain represented preferential targets of positive selection independent selective events in rig i and lgp targeted the corresponding site asp  and asp   respectively within a protruding  helix that grips the v shaped structure formed by the pincer most of the positively selected sites in mda are in regions unique to this rlr including a characteristic insertion within the helicase domain additional selected sites are located at the contact interface between mda monomers in spatial proximity to a positively selected human polymorphism arg  his and immediately external to the parainfluenza virus  v protein binding region structural analyses suggested that the positively selected his  residue is involved in parainfluenza virus  v protein binding data herein suggest that rlrs have been engaged in host virus genetic conflict leading to diversifying selection and indicate parallel evolution at the same site in rig i and lgp  a position likely to be of central importance in antiviral responses
