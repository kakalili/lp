The CD8αβ heterodimer interacts with class I pMHC on antigen-presenting cells as a co-receptor for TCR-mediated activation of cytotoxic T cells. To characterize this immunologically important interaction, we used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to either CD8α or CD8β to probe the mechanism of CD8αβ binding to pMHCI. The YTS156.7 mAb inhibits this interaction and blocks T cell activation. To elucidate the molecular basis for this inhibition, the crystal structure of the CD8αβ immunoglobulin-like ectodomains were determined in complex with mAb YTS156.7 Fab at 2.7 Å resolution. The YTS156.7 epitope on CD8β was identified and implies that residues in the CDR1 and CDR2-equivalent loops of CD8β are occluded upon binding to class I pMHC. To further characterize the pMHCI/CD8αβ interaction, binding of class I tetramers to CD8αβ on the surface of T cells was assessed in the presence of anti-CD8 mAbs. In contrast to YTS156.7, mAb YTS105.18, which is specific for CD8α, does not inhibit binding of CD8αβ to class I tetramers, indicating the YTS105.18 epitope is not occluded in the pMHCI/CD8αβ complex. Together, these data indicate a model for the pMHCI/CD8αβ interaction similar to that observed for CD8αα in the CD8αα/pMHCI complex, but in which CD8α occupies the lower orientation (membrane proximal to the antigen presenting cell), and CD8β occupies the upper position (membrane distal). The implication of this molecular assembly for the function of CD8αβ in T cell activation is discussed.
