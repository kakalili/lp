crystal structure of the carboxyltransferase domain of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase na pump from vibrio cholerae
oxaloacetate decarboxylase is a membrane bound multiprotein complex that couples oxaloacetate decarboxylation to sodium ion transport across the membrane the initial reaction catalyzed by this enzyme machinery is the carboxyl transfer from oxaloacetate to the prosthetic biotin group the crystal structure of the carboxyltransferase at     resolution shows a dimer of    barrels with an active site metal ion identified spectroscopically as zn  at the bottom of a deep cleft the enzyme is completely inactivated by specific mutagenesis of asp  his  and his   which serve as ligands for the zn  metal ion or by lys  near the active site suggesting that zn  as well as lys  are essential for the catalysis in the present structure this lysine residue is hydrogen bonded to cys   a potential role of lys  as initial acceptor of the carboxyl group from oxaloacetate is discussed
