myomesin  a novel structural component of the m band in striated muscle
the m band is the cytoskeletal structure that cross links the myosin and titin filaments in the middle of the sarcomere apart from the myosin tails and the c termini of titin only two closely related structural proteins had been detected at the m band so far myomesin and m protein however electron microscopy studies revealed structural features that do not correlate with the expression of these two proteins indicating the presence of unknown constituents in the m band using comparative sequence analysis we have identified a third member of this gene family myomesin  and characterised its biological properties myomesin  is predicted to consist of a unique head domain followed by a conserved sequence of either fibronectin or immunoglobulin like domains similarly to myomesin  and m protein while all three members of the myomesin family are localised to the m band of the sarcomere each member shows its specific expression pattern in contrast to myomesin which is ubiquitously expressed in all striated muscles and m protein whose expression is restricted to adult heart and fast twitch skeletal muscle myomesin  can be detected mainly in intermediate speed fibers of skeletal muscle in analogy to myomesin myomesin  targets to the m band region of the sarcomere via its n terminal part and forms homodimers via its c terminal domain however despite the high degree of homology no heterodimer between distinct members of the myomesin gene family can be detected we propose that each member of the myomesin family is a component of one of the distinct ultrastructures the m lines which modulate the mechanical properties of the m bands in different muscle types
