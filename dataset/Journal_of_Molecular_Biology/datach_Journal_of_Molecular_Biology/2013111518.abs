cryo em structures of the actin tropomyosin filament reveal the mechanism for the transition from c to m state
tropomyosin tm is a key factor in the molecular mechanisms that regulate the binding of myosin motors to actin filaments f actins in most eukaryotic cells this regulation is achieved by the azimuthal repositioning of tm along the actin ac tm troponin tn thin filament to block or expose myosin binding sites on ac in striated muscle including involuntary cardiac muscle tm regulates muscle contraction by coupling ca  binding to tn with myosin binding to the thin filament in smooth muscle the switch is the posttranslational modification of the myosin depending on the activation state of tn and the binding state of myosin tm can occupy the blocked closed or open position on ac using native cryogenic dem three dimensional electron microscopy  we have directly resolved and visualized cardiac and gizzard muscle tm on filamentous ac in the position that corresponds to the closed state from the   resolution structure of the reconstituted ac tm filament formed with gizzard derived tm we discuss two possible mechanisms for the transition from closed to open state and describe the role tm plays in blocking myosin tight binding in the closed state position
