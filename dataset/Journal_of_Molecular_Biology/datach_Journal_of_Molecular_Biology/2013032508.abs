sequence specific rna  protein interactions overcome electrostatic barriers preventing assembly of satellite tobacco necrosis virus coat protein
we have examined the roles of rna  coat protein cp interactions in the assembly of satellite tobacco necrosis virus stnv  the viral genomic rna encodes only the cp which comprises a  barrel domain connected to a positively charged n terminal extension in the previous crystal structures of this system the first  residues of the protein are disordered using variants of an rna aptamer sequence isolated against the cp b  we have studied the sequence specificity of rna induced assembly b consists of a stem  loop presenting the tetra loop sequence acaa there is a clear preference for rnas encompassing this loop sequence as measured by the yield of t  capsids which is indifferent to sequences within the stem the b containing virus like particle has been crystallised and its structure was determined to    a lower resolution map encompassing density for the rna has also been calculated the presence of b results in increased ordering of the n terminal helices located at the particle  fold axes which extend by roughly one and a half turns to encompass residues     including r and k  under assembly conditions stnv cp in the absence of rna is monomeric and does not self assemble these facts suggest that a plausible model for assembly initiation is the specific rna induced stabilisation of a trimeric capsomere the basic nature of the helical extension suggests that electrostatic repulsion between cps prevents assembly in the absence of rna and that this barrier is overcome by correct placement of appropriately orientated helical rna stems such a mechanism would be consistent with the data shown here for assembly with longer rna fragments including an stnv genome the results are discussed in light of a first stage of assembly involving compaction of the genomic rna driven by multiple rna packaging signal  cp interactions
