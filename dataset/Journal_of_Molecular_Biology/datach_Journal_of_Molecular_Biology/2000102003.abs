substrate recognition and induced dna deformation by transposase at the target capture stage of tn  transposition edited by m gottesman
the bacterial transposon tn  inserts preferentially into sites that conform to a  bp consensus sequence    ngctnagcn    however this sequence is not on its own sufficient to confer target specificity as the base pairs flanking this sequence also contribute significantly to target site selection we have performed a series of  contact probing experiments  to define directly the protein dna interactions that govern target site selection in the tn  system the hisg hotspot for tn  insertion was the main focus here we infer that there is a rather broad zone    bp of contact between transposase and target dna in the target capture complex this includes base specific contacts at all of the purine residues in the consensus positions of the target core and primarily backbone contacts out to    bp in the two flanking regions immediately adjacent to the core also highly localized sites of chemical hypersensitivity are identified that reveal symmetrically disposed deformations in dna structure in the target capture complex furthermore the level of strand transfer is shown to be reduced by phosphorothioate substitution of phosphate groups at or close to the sites of target dna deformation interestingly for one particular target dna a mutant form of hisg called mutf the above phosphorothioate inhibition of strand transfer is suppressed by replacing mg  with mn  based on these results a model for sequence specific target capture is proposed which attempts to define possible relationships between transposase interactions with the target core and flanking sequences transposase induced dna deformation of the target site and divalent metal ion binding to the target capture complex
