crystal structure of a subtilisin homologue tk sp from thermococcus kodakaraensis requirement of a c terminal  jelly roll domain for hyperstability
tk sp is a hyperthermostable subtilisin like serine protease from thermococcus kodakaraensis and is autoprocessed from its precursor pro tk sp with n and c propeptides the crystal structure of the active site mutant of pro tk sp lacking c propeptide pron tk s  a was determined at     resolution pron tk s  a consists of the n propeptide subtilisin and  jelly roll domains two ca  ions bind to the  jelly roll domain the overall structure of pron tk s  a without the  jelly roll domain is similar to that of the bacterial propeptide subtilisin complex except that it does not contain ca  ions to analyze the role of the  jelly roll domain of tk sp we constructed a series of the active site mutants of tk sp with tk s  a c and without tk s  a c j   jelly roll domain both tk s  c and tk s  c j exhibited protease activities in gel assay indicating that the  jelly roll domain is not required for folding or activity however the tm value of tk s  a j determined by far uv cd spectroscopy in the presence of   mm cacl was lower than that of tk s  a by     c the tm value of tk s  a was decreased by     c by the treatment with   mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid indicating that the  jelly roll domain contributes to the stabilization of tk s  a only in a ca  bound form tk sp highly resembles subtilisin like serine proteases from pyrococcus furiosus thermococcus gammatolerans and thermococcus onnurineus in size and amino acid sequence we propose that attachment of a  jelly roll domain to the c terminus is one of the strategies of the proteins from hyperthermophiles to adapt to high temperature environment
