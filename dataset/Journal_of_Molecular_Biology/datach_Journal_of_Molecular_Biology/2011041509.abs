a model for group b streptococcus pilus type  the structure of a  kda c terminal fragment of the major pilin gbs
the gram positive pathogen streptococcus agalactiae known as group b streptococcus gbs  is the leading cause of bacterial septicemia pneumonia and meningitis among neonates gbs assembles two types of pili  pilus islands pis  and   on its surface to adhere to host cells and to initiate colonization for pathogenesis the gbs pi  pilus is made of one major pilin gbs  which forms the pilus shaft and two secondary pilins gbs  and gbs  which are incorporated into the pilus at various places we report here the crystal structure of the  kda c terminal fragment from gbs  which is composed of two igg like domains n  n  the structure was solved by single wavelength anomalous dispersion using sodium iodide soaked crystals and diffraction data collected at the home source the n domain exhibits a cnaa dev igg fold with two calcium binding sites while the n domain displays a cnab igg rev fold we have built a model for full length gbs  n  n  and n  with the help of available homologous major pilin structures and we propose a model for the gbs pi  pilus shaft the n and n domains are arranged in tandem along the pilus shaft whereas the respective n domain is tilted by approximately   away from the pilus axis we have also identified a pilin like motif in the minor pilin gbs  which might aid its incorporation at the pilus base
