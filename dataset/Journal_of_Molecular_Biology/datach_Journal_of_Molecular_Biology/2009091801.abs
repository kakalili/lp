molecular geometry of csra rsma binding to rna and its implications for regulated expression
the global regulatory protein csra binds to the   untranslated leader of target transcripts and alters their translation and or stability csra is a symmetrical homodimer containing two identical rna binding surfaces gel shift assays with model rna substrates now show that csra can bind simultaneously at two target sites within a transcript bridging or dual site binding  an intersite distance of    nucleotides nt was optimal although bridging occurred with an intersite distance of  to    nt the close  nt spacing reduced the stability of dual site binding as competition for one site by a second csra dimer readily occurred both rna binding surfaces of a single csra protein were essential for efficient in vitro repression of a glgc    lacz translational fusion that contains four csra target sites within the untranslated leader heterodimeric csra hd csra containing a single r a replacement which was defective for binding at its mutant surface but bound rna normally at its wild type wt surface was    fold less effective at repression than homodimeric wt csra furthermore deletion of a csra target site of glgc that lies upstream from the shine  dalgarno sequence did not affect regulation by hd csra but decreased regulation by wt csra confirming a regulatory role of dual site binding finally we propose a mechanism whereby a globular ribonucleoprotein complex is formed between csra and its noncoding rna antagonist csrb because many target sites of csrb are located closer together than is optimal for bridging binding to nonadjacent sites should be energetically favored causing multiple csra dimers to tether csrb into the observed globular form rather than an extended csra  csrb complex
