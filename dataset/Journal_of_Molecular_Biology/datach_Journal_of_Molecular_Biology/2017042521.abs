consequences of epithelial inflammasome activation by bacterial pathogens
inflammasome signaling impinges on the activation of inflammatory caspases i e  caspase  and caspase     and endows host cells with a sentinel system to sense microbial intrusion and thereby initiate appropriate immune responses lately it has become evident that mammalian inflammasome dependent responses to infection are not confined solely to cells of hematopoietic origin epithelial cells that line the body s mucosal surfaces use inflammasome signaling to sense and counteract pathogenic microorganisms that compromise barrier integrity many of the molecular mechanisms of epithelial inflammasome signaling remain unexplored however it now seems clear that epithelial inflammasome activation has a profound impact both on the infected cell itself and on its ability to communicate with other cell types of the mucosa here we summarize current knowledge regarding the output of epithelial inflammasome activation during bacterial infection well established downstream effects include epithelial cell death release of soluble mediators and subsequent recruitment of effector cell types including nk cells mast cells and neutrophils to sites of mucosal infection we discuss the implications of recent findings for antibacterial defense in the mucosa and sketch out areas for future exploration
