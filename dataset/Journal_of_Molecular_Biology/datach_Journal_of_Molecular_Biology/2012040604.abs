structurally similar but functionally diverse zu domains in human erythrocyte ankyrin
the metazoan cell membrane is highly organized maintaining such organization and preserving membrane integrity under different conditions are accomplished through intracellular tethering to an extensive flexible protein network spectrin the principal component of this network is attached to the membrane through the adaptor protein ankyrin which directly bridges the interaction between  spectrin and membrane proteins ankyrins have a modular structure that includes two tandem zu domains the first domain zu a is directly responsible for binding  spectrin here we present a structure of the tandem zu repeats of human erythrocyte ankyrin structural and biophysical experiments show that the second zu domain zu b does not participate in spectrin binding zu b is structurally similar to the zu domain found in the netrin receptor unc b supramodule suggesting that it could interact with other domains in ankyrin comparison of several zu domains demonstrates that the zu domain represents a compact and versatile protein interaction module
