complex of a protective antibody with its ebola virus gp peptide epitope unusual features of a v x light chain
f   is a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes the heavily glycosylated mucin like domain of the ebola virus virion attached glycoprotein gp and protects animals against lethal viral challenge here we present the crystal structure at     of  f   in complex with its ebola virus gp peptide epitope the gp peptide binds in an extended conformation anchored primarily by interactions with the heavy chain two gp residues gln p  and arg p   make extensive side chain hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions with the antibody and are likely critical for recognition and affinity the  f   antibody utilizes a rare v x light chain the three light chain complementarity determining regions do not adopt canonical conformations and represent new classes of structures distinct from v  and other v  light chains in addition although v x had been thought to confer specificity all light chain contacts are mediated through germ line encoded residues this structure of an antibody that protects against the ebola virus now provides a framework for humanization and development of a postexposure immunotherapeutic
