the crystal structure of bamb suggests interactions with bama and its role within the bam complex
escherichia coli bamb is the largest of four lipoproteins in the  barrel assembly machinery bam complex it interacts with the periplasmic domain of bama an integral outer membrane protein omp essential for omp biogenesis although bamb is not essential it serves an important function in the bam complex significantly increasing the folding efficiency of some omps in vivo and in vitro to learn more about the bam complex we solved structures of bamb in three different crystal forms bamb crystallized in space groups p   i   and p    with one molecule per asymmetric unit in each case crystals from the space group i  diffracted to      resolution bamb forms an eight bladed  propeller with a central pore and is shaped like a doughnut a dali search revealed that bamb shares structural homology to several eukaryotic proteins containing wd  repeat domains which commonly have  propeller folds and often serve as scaffolding proteins within larger multi protein complexes that carry out signal transduction cell division and chemotaxis using mutagenesis data from previous studies we docked bamb onto a bama structural model and assessed known and possible interactions between these two proteins our data suggest that bamb serves as a scaffolding protein within the bam complex by optimally orienting the flexible periplasmic domain of bama for interaction with other bam components and chaperones this may facilitate integration of newly synthesized omps into the outer membrane
