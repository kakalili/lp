crystal structure at     of the dllrkn containing coiled coil domain of huntingtin interacting protein  hip  reveals a surface suitable for clathrin light chain binding
huntingtin interacting protein  hip  is a member of a family of proteins whose interaction with huntingtin is critical to prevent cells from initiating apoptosis hip  and related protein hip  r can also bind to clathrin and membrane phospholipids and hip  r links the ccv to the actin cytoskeleton hip and hip  r interact with the clathrin light chain eed regulatory site and stimulate clathrin lattice assembly here we report the x ray structure of the coiled coil domain of hip  residues      that includes residues crucial for binding clathrin light chain the dimeric hip crystal structure is partially splayed open the comparison of the hip model with coiled coil predictions revealed the heptad repeat in the dimeric trunk s path is offset relative to the register of the heptad repeat from the n terminal portion s path of the molecule furthermore surface analysis showed there is a third hydrophobic path s  running parallel with s and s  we present structural evidence supporting a role for the s path as an interaction surface for clathrin light chain finally comparative analysis suggests the mode of binding between sla p and clathrin light chain may be different in yeast
