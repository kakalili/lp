the ordering of corneal collagen fibrils with increasing ionic strength
the fixed stromal charge of bovine corneas osmotically clamped at physiological hydration was altered by regulating the amount of chloride ions bound to the matrix we measured the local fibrillar collagen order using x ray diffraction methods as the bound anions increased up to physiological values the local fibrillar order increased to an optimal value the coherence distance t approximately doubles to a maximum value   nm from  mm nacl to   mm nacl this then slowly decreased as the bathing solution increased to   mm in contrast the diameter of the collagen fibrils were minimal at physiological nacl
