crystal structure of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase  and its functional implications
pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase  pdp  catalyzes dephosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase e  in the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc  whose activity is regulated by the phosphorylation  dephosphorylation cycle by the corresponding protein kinases pdhks and phosphatases the activity of pdp is greatly enhanced through ca  dependent binding of the catalytic subunit pdp c to the l  inner lipoyl domain of dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase e  which is also integrated in pdc here we report the crystal structure of the rat pdp c at     resolution the structure reveals that pdp belongs to the ppm family of protein serine threonine phosphatases which in spite of a low level of sequence identity share the structural core consisting of the central  sandwich flanked on both sides by loops and  helices consistent with the previous studies two well fixed magnesium ions are coordinated by five active site residues and five water molecules in the pdp c catalytic center structural analysis indicates that while the central portion of the pdp c molecule is highly conserved among the members of the ppm protein family a number of structural insertions and deletions located at the periphery of pdp c likely define its functional specificity towards the pdc one notable feature of pdp c is a long insertion residues      forming a unique hydrophobic pocket on the surface that likely accommodates the lipoyl moiety of the e domain in a fashion similar to that of pdhks the cavity however appears more open than in pdhk suggesting that its closure may be required to achieve tight specific binding of the lipoic acid we propose a mechanism in which the closure of the lipoic acid binding site is triggered by the formation of the intermolecular pdp c l  ca  binding site in a manner reminiscent of the ca  induced closure of the regulatory domain of troponin c
