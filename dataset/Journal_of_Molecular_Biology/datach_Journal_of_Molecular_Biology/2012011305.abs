adenine recognition is a key checkpoint in the energy release mechanism of phage t dna packaging motor
atp is the source of energy for numerous biochemical reactions in all organisms tailed bacteriophages use atp to drive powerful packaging machines that translocate viral dna into a procapsid and compact it to near crystalline density here we report that a complex network of interactions dictates adenine recognition and atp hydrolysis in the pentameric phage t large  terminase   gp  motor the network includes residues that form hydrogen bonds at the edges of the adenine ring q  and q   base stacking interactions at the plane of the ring i  and r   and cross talking bonds between adenine triphosphate and walker a p loop y   q   and r   these interactions are conserved in other translocases such as type i type iii restriction enzymes and sf sf helicases perturbation of any of these interactions even the loss of a single hydrogen bond leads to multiple defects in motor functions adenine recognition is therefore a key checkpoint that ensures efficient atp firing only when the fuel molecule is precisely engaged with the motor this may be a common feature in the energy release mechanism of atp driven molecular machines that carry out numerous biomolecular reactions in biological systems
