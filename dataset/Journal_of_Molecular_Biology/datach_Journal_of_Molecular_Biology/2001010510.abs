folding pathway mediated by an intramolecular chaperone the structural and functional characterization of the aqualysin i propeptide edited by a r fersht
aqualysin i a thermostable homologue of subtilisin requires its propeptide proa to function as an intramolecular chaperone imc  to decipher the mechanisms through which propeptides can initiate protein folding we characterized proa in terms of its sequence structure and function our results show that in contrast to pros propeptide of subtilisin  proa can fold spontaneously reversibly and cooperatively into a stable monomeric    conformation even when isolated from its cognate protease domain proa displays an indiscernible amount of tertiary structure with a considerable solvent accessible hydrophobic surface but is not a classical molten globule folding intermediate moreover despite showing only   sequence identity with pros proa can not only inhibit enzymatic activity with a magnitude tenfold greater than pros but can also chaperone subtilisin folding albeit with a lower efficiency the structure of proa complexed with subtilisin is different from that of isolated proa hence additional interactions seem necessary to induce proa into a compact structure our results also suggest that  a propeptides that are potent inhibitors are not necessarily better imcs  b propeptides within the subtilase family appear polymorphic and  c the intrinsic instability within propeptides may be necessary for rapid activation of the cognate protein
