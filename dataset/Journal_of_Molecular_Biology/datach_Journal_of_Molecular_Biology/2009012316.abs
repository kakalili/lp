insights from xanthine and uracil dna glycosylase activities of bacterial and human smug  switching smug to udg
single strand selective monofunctional uracil dna glycosylase smug  belongs to family  of the uracil dna glycosylase udg superfamily here we report that a bacterial smug ortholog in geobacter metallireducens gme and the human smug enzyme are not only udgs but also xanthine dna glycosylases xdgs  in addition mutational analysis and molecular dynamics md simulations of gme smug identify important structural determinants in conserved motifs  and  for xdg and udg activities mutations at m  m l and h   h  g h  m and h  n  both of which are involved in interactions with the c carbonyl oxygen in uracil or xanthine cause substantial reductions in xdg and udg activities increased selectivity is achieved in the a  r mutant of gme smug  which corresponds to a position involved in base flipping this mutation results in an activity profile resembling a human smug like enzyme as exemplified by the retention of udg activity on mismatched base pairs and weak xdg activity md simulations indicate that m l increases the flexibility of the motif  loop region and specifically a   which may account for the reduced catalytic activity g y completely abolishes xdg and udg activity which is consistent with a modeled structure in which g y blocks the entry of either xanthine or uracil to the base binding pocket most interestingly a proline substitution at the g  position switches the gme smug enzyme to an exclusive udg as demonstrated by the uniform excision of uracil in both double stranded and single stranded dna and the complete loss of xdg activity md simulations indicate that a combination of a reduced free volume and altered flexibility in the active site loops may underlie the dramatic effects of the g p mutation on the activity profile of smug  this study offers insights on the important role that modulation of conformational flexibility may play in defining specificity and catalytic efficiency
