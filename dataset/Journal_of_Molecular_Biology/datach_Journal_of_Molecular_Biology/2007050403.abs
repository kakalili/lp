structural and mechanistic exploration of acid resistance kinetic stability facilitates evolution of extremophilic behavior
kinetically stable proteins are unique in that their stability is determined solely by kinetic barriers rather than by thermodynamic equilibria to better understand how kinetic stability promotes protein survival under extreme environmental conditions we analyzed the unfolding behavior and determined the structure of nocardiopsis alba protease a napase  an acid resistant kinetically stable protease and compared these results with a neutrophilic homolog   lytic protease  lp  although napase and  lp have the same number of acid titratable residues kinetic studies revealed that the height of the unfolding free energy barrier for napase is less sensitive to acid than that of  lp thereby accounting for napase s improved tolerance of low ph a comparison of the  lp and napase structures identified multiple salt bridges in the domain interface of  lp that were relocated to outer regions of napase suggesting a novel mechanism of acid stability in which acid sensitive electrostatic interactions are rearranged to similarly affect the energetics of both the native state and the unfolding transition state an acid stable variant of  lp in which a single interdomain salt bridge is replaced with a corresponding intradomain napase salt bridge shows a dramatic gt  fold increase in acid resistance providing further evidence for this hypothesis these observations also led to a general model of the unfolding transition state structure for  lp protease family members in which the two domains separate from each other while remaining relatively intact themselves these results illustrate the remarkable utility of kinetic stability as an evolutionary tool for developing longevity over a broad range of harsh conditions
