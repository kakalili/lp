a ph dependent conformational change rather than the chemical step appears to be rate limiting in the hammerhead ribozyme cleavage reaction edited by j doudna
we have investigated the chemical basis for a previously observed    conformational change in the hammerhead ribozyme that positions the substrate for in line attack we have found that the conformational change can only be observed at or above ph   in the presence of co  and requires the presence of an ionizable   oh at the cleavage site and note that this observed apparent pka of   for the conformational change is within experimental error     of the previously reported apparent kinetic pka of   for the hammerhead ribozyme in the presence of co  we have solved two crystal structures of hammerhead ribozymes having   och or   f substitutions at the cleavage site and have found that these will not undergo a conformational change equivalent to that observed for the hammerhead ribozyme having an unmodified attacking nucleophile under otherwise identical conditions we have also characterized the kinetics of cleavage in the crystal in addition to verifying that the particular sequence of rna that we crystallized cleaves faster in the crystal than in solution we also find that the extent of cleavage in the crystal is complete unlike in solution where this and most other hammerhead ribozyme substrates are cleaved only to about   completion the initial cleavage rate in the crystal obeys the expected log linear relation between cleavage rate and ph with a slope of   as has been observed for other hammerhead ribozyme sequences in solution indicating that in both the crystal and in solution the ph dependent step is rate limiting however the cleavage rate in the crystal is biphasic with the most dramatic distinction between initial slower and final faster phases appearing at ph   the initial phase corresponds to the ph dependent cleavage rate observed in solution but the second faster phase is roughly ph independent and closely parallels the cleavage rate observed at ph    minute  this result is particularly remarkable because it entails that the rapidly cleaving phase at ph  is comparable to the cleavage rate for the fastest cleaving hammerhead ribozymes at ph  based upon these observations we conclude that the ph dependent conformational change is the rate determining step under standard conditions for the hammerhead ribozyme self cleavage reaction and that an ionizable   proton at cleavage site is required for this conformational change we further hypothesize that deprotonation of the cleavage site   oxygen drives this conformational change
