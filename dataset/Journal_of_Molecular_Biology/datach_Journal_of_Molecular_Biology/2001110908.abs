crystal structure of the liganded scp  like domain of human peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type  at     resolution edited by r huber
oxidation of amino acyl coenzyme a acyl coa species in mammalian peroxisomes can occur via either multifunctional enzyme type  mfe  or type  mfe   both of which catalyze the hydration of trans  enoyl coa and the dehydrogenation of  hydroxyacyl coa but with opposite chiral specificity mfe  has a modular organization of three domains the function of the c terminal domain of the mammalian mfe  which shows similarity with sterol carrier protein type  scp   is unclear here the structure of the scp  like domain comprising amino acid residues     of human mfe  d h scp l was solved at     resolution in complex with triton x   an analog of a lipid molecule this is the first reported structure of an mfe  domain the d h scp l has an    fold consisting of five  strands and five  helices the overall architecture resembles the rabbit and human scp  structures however the structure of d h scp l shows a hydrophobic tunnel that traverses the protein which is occupied by an ordered triton x   molecule the tunnel is large enough to accommodate molecules such as straight chain and branched chain fatty acyl coas and bile acid intermediates large empty apolar cavities are observed near the exit of the tunnel and between the helices c and d in addition the c terminal peroxisomal targeting signal is ordered in the structure and solvent exposed which is not the case with unliganded rabbit scp  supporting the hypothesis of a ligand assisted targeting mechanism
