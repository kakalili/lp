structural basis for a     toxicity inhibition by a  c terminal fragments discrete molecular dynamics study
amyloid  protein a  is central to the pathology of alzheimer s disease of the two predominant a  alloforms a     and a     the latter forms more toxic oligomers c terminal fragments ctfs of a  were recently shown to inhibit a     toxicity in vitro here we studied a     assembly in the presence of three effective ctf inhibitors and an ineffective fragment a      using a discrete molecular dynamics approach that recently was shown to capture key differences between a     and a     oligomerization we compared a     oligomer formation in the absence and presence of ctfs or a     and identified structural elements of a     that correlated with a     toxicity ctfs co assembled with a     into large heterooligomers containing multiple a     and inhibitor fragments in contrast a     co assembled with a     into heterooligomers containing mostly a single a     and multiple a     fragments the ctfs but not a      decreased the  strand propensity of a     in a concentration dependent manner ctfs and a     had a high binding propensity to the hydrophobic regions of a     but only ctfs were found to bind the a     region a  f  consequently only ctfs but not a     reduced the solvent accessibility of a     in region d  r  the reduced solvent accessibility of a     in the presence of ctfs was comparable to the solvent accessibility of a     oligomers formed in the absence of a  fragments these findings suggest that region d  r  which was more exposed to the solvent in a     than in a     oligomers is involved in mediating a     oligomer neurotoxicity
