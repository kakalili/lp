roles of multiple flagellins in flagellar formation and flagellar growth post bdelloplast lysis in bdellovibrio bacteriovorus
bdellovibrio bacteriovorus cells have a single polar flagellum whose helical pitch and diameter characteristically change near the midpoint resulting in a tapered wave there are six flagellin genes in the genome flic to flic  accordingly the flagellar filament is composed of several similar flagellin species we have used knockout mutants of each gene and analyzed the mutational effects on the filament length and on the composition and localization of each flagellin species in the filament by electron microscopy and one and two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the location and amounts of flagellins in a filament were determined to be as follows a small amount of flic at the proximal end followed by a large amount of flic  a large amount of flic  a small amount of flic in this order and a large amount of flic at the distal end flic was present at a low level but the location was not determined filament lengths of newly born progeny cells increased during prolonged incubation in nutrient deficient buffer the newly formed part of the elongated filament was composed of mainly flic  reverse transcription pcr analysis of flagellar gene expression over  days in buffer showed that flic gene expression tailed off over  days in the wild type cells but in the flic mutant expression of the flic  flic  and flic genes was elevated on day  suggesting that they may be expressed to compensate for the absence of a major component flic
