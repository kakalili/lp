the first crystal structure of phosphofructokinase from a eukaryote trypanosoma brucei
the crystal structure of the atp dependent phosphofructokinase pfk from trypanosoma brucei provides the first detailed description of a eukaryotic pfk and enables comparisons to be made with the crystal structures of bacterial atp dependent and ppi dependent pfks the structure reveals that two insertions the    and     loops that are characteristic of trypanosomatid pfks but absent from bacterial and mammalian atp dependent pfks are located within and adjacent to the active site and are in positions to play important roles in the enzyme s mechanism the  residue n terminal extension forms a novel domain that includes an  embracing arm  across the subunit boundary to the symmetry related subunit in the tetrameric enzyme comparisons with the ppi dependent pfk from borrelia burgdorferi show that several features thought to be characteristic of ppi dependent pfks are present in the trypanosome atp dependent pfk these two enzymes are generally more similar to each other than to the bacterial or mammalian atp dependent pfks however there are critical differences at the active site of ppi dependent pfks that are sufficient to prevent the binding of atp this crystal structure of a eukaryotic pfk has enabled us to propose a detailed model of human muscle pfk that shows active site and other differences that offer opportunities for structure based drug discovery for the treatment of sleeping sickness and other diseases caused by the trypanosomatid family of protozoan parasites
