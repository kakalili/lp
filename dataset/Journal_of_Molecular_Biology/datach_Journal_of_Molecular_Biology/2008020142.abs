understanding the structural basis for substrate and inhibitor recognition in eukaryotic gh  xylanases
endo    xylanases xylanases hydrolyse the    glycosidic bonds in the backbone of xylan although xylanases from glycoside hydrolase family   gh  have been extensively studied several issues remain unresolved thus the mechanism by which these enzymes hydrolyse decorated xylans is unclear and the structural basis for the variation in catalytic activity within this family is unknown furthermore the mechanism for the differences in the inhibition of fungal gh  enzymes by the wheat protein xip i remains opaque to address these issues we report the crystal structure and biochemical properties of the neocallimastix patriciarum xylanase npxyn a which displays unusually high catalytic activity and is one of the few fungal gh  proteins not inhibited by xip i although the structure of npxyn a could not be determined in complex with substrates we have been able to investigate how gh  enzymes hydrolyse decorated substrates by solving the crystal structure of a second gh  xylanase enxyn a encoded by an environmental dna sample  bound to ferulic acid   arabinofuranose    xylotriose fax  the crystal structure of the enxyn a  fax complex shows that solvent exposure of the backbone xylose o and o groups at subsites   and  allow accommodation of    linked  methyl d glucuronic acid and l arabinofuranose side chains furthermore the ferulated arabinofuranose side chain makes hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions at the  subsite indicating that the decoration may represent a specificity determinant at this aglycone subsite the structure of npxyn a reveals potential   and  subsites that are kinetically significant the extended substrate binding cleft of npxyn a compared to other gh  xylanases may explain why the neocallimastix enzyme displays unusually high catalytic activity finally the crystal structure of npxyn a shows that the resistance of the enzyme to xip i is not due solely to insertions in the loop connecting  strands  and   as suggested previously but is highly complex
