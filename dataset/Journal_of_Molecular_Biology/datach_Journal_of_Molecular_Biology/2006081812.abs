arylamine n acetyltransferase aggregation and constitutive ubiquitylation
arylamine n acetyltransferases nat and nat  acetylate and detoxify arylamine carcinogens humans harboring certain genetic variations within the nat genes exhibit increased likelihood of developing various cancer types especially urinary bladder cancer such dna polymorphisms result in protein products with reduced cellular activity which is proposed to be due to their constitutive ubiquitylation and enhanced proteasomal degradation to identify the properties that lead to the reduced cellular activity of certain nat variants we introduced one such polymorphism into the human nat ortholog hamster nat  the polymorphism chosen was human nat   which results in the replacement of r  with a tryptophan residue and we demonstrate this substitution to cause hamster nat to be constitutively ubiquitylated biophysical characterization of the hamster nat r w variant revealed that its overall protein structure and thermostability are not compromised in addition we used steady state kinetics experiments to demonstrate that the r w mutation does not interfere with nat catalysis in vitro hence the constitutive ubiquitylation of this variant is not caused by its inability to be acetylated instead we demonstrate this mutation to cause the hamster nat protein to aggregate in vitro and in vivo importantly we tested and confirmed that the r w mutation also causes human nat to aggregate in cultured cells by using homology modeling we demonstrate that r  is located at a peripheral location which provides an explanation for how the nat protein structure is not significantly disturbed by its mutation to tryptophan altogether we provide fundamental information on why humans harboring certain nat variants exhibit reduced acetylation capabilities
