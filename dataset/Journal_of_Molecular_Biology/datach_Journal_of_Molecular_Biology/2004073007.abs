a multicomponent protein complex mediates environmental stress signaling in bacillus subtilis
activity of the general stress transcription factor  b of bacillus subtilis is regulated directly by a partner switching mechanism in which key protein interactions are governed by serine phosphorylation signals of energy or environmental stress are conveyed to  b by independent pathways each terminating with a differentially regulated serine phosphatase whose activity is required to control the partner switching regulators we present genetic and biochemical evidence that activation of the rsbu environmental signaling phosphatase is modulated by a second atypical partner switch that comprises redundant negative regulatory proteins in a large multicomponent signaling complex in the current model negative regulation of the rsbu phosphatase depends solely on the rsbs antagonist protein here we perform a critical genetic test that invalidates this model and demonstrates that the rsbs antagonist alone is insufficient to prevent environmental signaling also required is one of a family of four co antagonist proteins here renamed rsbra rsbrb rsbrc and rsbrd each with a carboxyl terminal domain closely resembling the entire rsbs protein because any single member of the rsbr family together with rsbs was sufficient for environmental signaling we conclude that the rsbr proteins serve as redundant co antagonists necessary for rsbs antagonist function moreover purification of rsbra from cell extracts by nickel affinity and gel filtration chromatography found a multicomponent complex containing the rsbra and rsbrb co antagonists together with the rsbs antagonist we propose that this complex serves as a machine to transmit stress signals to  b and that the properties of the complex may contribute to environmental stress sensing
