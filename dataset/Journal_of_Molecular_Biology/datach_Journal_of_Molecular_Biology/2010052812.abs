contributions of conserved tplh tetrapeptides to the conformational stability of ankyrin repeat proteins
ankyrin repeat ar proteins are one of the most abundant classes of repeat proteins and are involved in numerous physiological processes these proteins are composed of various numbers of ar motifs stacked in a nearly linear fashion to adopt an elongated and nonglobular architecture one salient feature prevalent in such a structural unit is the tplh tetrapeptide or a close variant t sxxh which initiates the helix  turn  helix conformation and presumably contributes to conformational stability through a hydrogen bonding network in the present study we investigated the roles of t sxxh motif in the stability structure and function of ar proteins by a systematic and rationalized mutagenic study on followed by biochemical and biophysical characterization of gankyrin an oncogenic protein composed of seven ars and six t sxxh tetrapeptides and p  a tumor suppressor with four ars but no tplh tetrapeptide our results showed that this tetrapeptide is ineffectual on global structure and function but contributes significantly to conformational stability when its stabilizing potentials are fully realized in the local conformation including   the intra ar hydrogen bonding involving the hydroxyl group   the intra ar and inter ar hydrogen bonds involving the imidazole ring and   the hydrophobic interaction associated with the thr methyl group considering that the capping and close to capping units tend to have more sequence diversity and more conformational variation it could be also generally true that a t sxxh motif close to the terminal repeats contributes little or even negatively to stability with respect to ala substitution but substantially stabilizes the global conformation when located in the middle of a long stretch of ars
