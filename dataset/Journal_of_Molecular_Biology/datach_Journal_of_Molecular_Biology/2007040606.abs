the catalysis of the   proton transfer by  methyl acyl coa racemase is coupled to a movement of the fatty acyl moiety over a hydrophobic methionine rich surface
methylacyl coa racemases are essential enzymes for branched chain fatty acid metabolism their reaction mechanism and the structural basis of their wide substrate specificity are poorly understood high resolution crystal structures of mycobacterium tuberculosis  methylacyl coa racemase mcr complexed with substrate molecules show the active site geometry required for catalysis of the interconversion of  s and  r methylacyl coa the thioester oxygen atom and the  methyl group are in a cis conformation with respect to each other the thioester oxygen atom fits into an oxyanion hole and the  methyl group points into a hydrophobic pocket the active site geometry agrees with a   proton transfer mechanism in which the acid base pair residues are his  and asp   the structures of the complexes indicate that the acyl chains of the s substrate and the r substrate bind in an s pocket and an r pocket respectively a unique feature of mcr is a large number of methionine residues in the acyl binding region located between the s pocket and the r pocket it appears that the s to r interconversion of the  methylacyl chiral center is coupled to a movement of the acyl group over this hydrophobic methionine rich surface when moving from its s pocket to its r pocket whereas the  methyl moiety and the coa group remain fixed in their respective pockets
