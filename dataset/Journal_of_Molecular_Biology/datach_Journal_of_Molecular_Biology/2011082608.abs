conformational plasticity and dynamics in the generic protein folding catalyst slyd unraveled by single molecule fret
the relation between conformational dynamics and chemistry in enzyme catalysis recently has received increasing attention while in the past the mechanochemical coupling was mainly attributed to molecular motors nowadays it seems that this linkage is far more general single molecule fluorescence methods are perfectly suited to directly evidence conformational flexibility and dynamics by labeling the enzyme slyd a member of peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerases of the fk  binding protein type with an inserted chaperone domain with donor and acceptor fluorophores for single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer we directly monitor conformational flexibility and conformational dynamics between the chaperone domain and the fk  binding protein domain we find a broad distribution of distances between the labels with two main maxima which we attribute to an open conformation and to a closed conformation of the enzyme correlation analysis demonstrates that the conformations exchange on a rate in the   hz range with the aid from monte carlo simulations we show that there must be conformational flexibility beyond the two main conformational states interestingly neither the conformational distribution nor the dynamics is significantly altered upon binding of substrates or other known binding partners based on these experimental findings we propose a model where the conformational dynamics is used to search the conformation enabling the chemical step which also explains the remarkable substrate promiscuity connected with a high efficiency of this class of peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerases
