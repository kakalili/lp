Several anaerobic acetogenic, methanogenic, hydrogenogenic, and sulfate-reducing microorganisms are able to use the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway to convert CO2 into biomass. The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway consists of two branches connected by the Co/Fe-containing corrinoid iron–sulfur protein (CoFeSP), which transfers a methyl group from a methyltransferase (MeTr)/methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3-H4 folate) complex to the reduced Ni–Ni–[4Fe–4S] cluster (cluster A) of acetyl-CoA synthase. We investigated the CoFeSP and MeTr couple of the hydrogenogenic bacterium Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans and show that the two proteins are able to catalyze the methyl-group transfer reaction from CH3-H4 folate to the Co(I) center of CoFeSP. We determined the crystal structures of both proteins. The structure of CoFeSP includes the previously unresolved N-terminal domain of the large subunit of CoFeSP, revealing a unique four-helix-bundle-like architecture in which a [4Fe–4S] cluster is shielded by hydrophobic amino acids. It further reveals that the corrinoid and the [4Fe–4S] cluster binding domains are mobile, which is mandatory for the postulated electron transfer between them. Furthermore, we solved the crystal structures of apo-MeTr, CH3-H4-folate-bound MeTr, and H4-folate-bound MeTr, revealing a substrate-induced closure of the CH3-H4 folate binding cavity of MeTr. We observed three different conformations of Asn200 depending on the substrate bound in the active site, demonstrating its conformational modulation by hydrogen-bonding interactions with the substrate. The observed flexibility could be essential to stabilize the transition state during methyl-group transfer. The conformational space and role of Asn200 are likely conserved in homologous cobalamin-dependent MeTrs such as methionine synthase.
