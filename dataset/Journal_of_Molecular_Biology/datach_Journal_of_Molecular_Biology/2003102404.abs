crystal structure of a family  uracil dna glycosylase from thermus thermophilus hb
uracil dna glycosylase udg ec     removes uracil from dna to initiate dna base excision repair since hydrolytic deamination of cytosine to uracil is one of the most frequent dna damaging events in all cells udg is an essential enzyme for maintaining the integrity of genomic information for the first time we report the crystal structure of a family  udg from thermus thermophilus hb  tthudg complexed with uracil solved at    resolution as opposed to udg enzymes in its other families tthudg possesses a  fe  s cluster this iron  sulfur cluster which is distant from the active site interacts with loop structures and has been suggested to be unessential to the activity but necessary for stabilizing the loop structures in addition to the iron  sulfur cluster salt bridges and ion pairs on the molecular surface and the presence of proline on loops and turns is thought to contribute to the enzyme s thermostability despite very low levels of sequence identity with escherichia coli and human udgs family  and e coli g t u mismatch specific dna glycosylase mug  family   the topology and order of secondary structures of tthudg are similar to those of these distant relatives furthermore the coordinates of the core structure formed by  strands are almost the same positive charge is distributed over the active site groove where tthudg would bind dna strands as do udg enzymes in other families tthudg recognizes uracil specifically in the same manner as does human udg family   rather than guanine in the complementary strand dna as does e coli mug family   these results suggest that the mechanism by which family  udgs remove uracils from dna is similar to that of family  enzymes
