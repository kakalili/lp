regulation of e s a role for additional ubiquitin binding sites
attachment of ubiquitin to proteins relies on a sophisticated enzyme cascade that is tightly regulated the machinery of ubiquitylation responds to a range of signals which remarkably includes ubiquitin itself thus ubiquitin is not only the central player in the ubiquitylation cascade but also a key regulator the ubiquitin e ligases provide specificity to the cascade and often bind the substrate while the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes e s have a pivotal role in determining chain linkage and length interaction of ubiquitin with the e is important for activity but the weak nature of these contacts has made them hard to identify and study by reviewing available crystal structures we identify putative ubiquitin binding sites on e s which may enhance e processivity and the assembly of chains of a defined linkage the implications of these new sites are discussed in the context of known e  ubiquitin interactions
