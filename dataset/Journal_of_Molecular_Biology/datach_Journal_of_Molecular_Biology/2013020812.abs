intrinsic dynamics of an extended hydrophobic core in the s cerevisiae rnase iii dsrbd contributes to recognition of specific rna binding sites
the saccharomyces cerevisiae rnase iii enzyme rnt p preferentially binds to double stranded rna hairpin substrates with a conserved a u gnn tetraloop fold via shape specific interactions by its double stranded rna binding domain dsrbd helix   to the tetraloop minor groove to investigate whether conformational flexibility in the dsrbd regulates the binding specificity we determined the backbone dynamics of the rnt p dsrbd in the free and agaa hairpin bound states using nmr spin relaxation experiments the intrinsic microsecond to millisecond timescale dynamics of the dsrbd suggests that helix   undergoes conformational sampling in the free state with large dynamics at some residues in the      loop      hinge  to correlate free dsrbd dynamics with structural changes upon binding we determined the solution structure of the free dsrbd used in the previously determined rna bound structures the rnt p dsrbd has an extended hydrophobic core comprising helix   the      loop and helix   analysis of the backbone dynamics and structures of the free and bound dsrbd reveals that slow timescale dynamics in the      hinge are associated with concerted structural changes in the extended hydrophobic core that govern binding of helix   to agaa tetraloops the dynamic behavior of the dsrbd bound to a longer agaa hairpin reveals that dynamics within the hydrophobic core differentiate between specific and nonspecific sites mutations of residues in the      hinge result in changes to the dsrbd stability and rna binding affinity and cause defects in small nucleolar rna processing in vivo these results reveal that dynamics in the extended hydrophobic core are important for binding site selection by the rnt p dsrbd
