delineation of the complement receptor type   c d complex by site directed mutagenesis and molecular docking
the interactions between the complement receptor type  cr  and the c complement fragments c d c dg and ic b are essential for the initiation of a normal immune response a crystal derived structure of the two n terminal short consensus repeat scr   domains of cr in complex with c d has previously been elucidated however a number of biochemical and biophysical studies targeting both cr and c d appear to be in conflict with these structural data previous mutagenesis and heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy studies directed toward the c d binding site on cr have indicated that the cr  c d cocrystal structure may represent an encounter intermediate or nonphysiological complex with regard to the cr binding site on c d mutagenesis studies by isenman and coworkers isenman d e  leung e  mackay j d  bagby s  amp van den elsen j m h     mutational analyses reveal that the staphylococcal immune evasion molecule sbi and complement receptor  cr  share overlapping contact residues on c d implications for the controversy regarding the cr c d cocrystal structure j immunol          have implicated an electronegative  concave  surface on c d in the binding process this surface is discrete from the cr  c d interface identified in the crystal structure we generated a total of  mutations targeting the two x ray crystallographic and mutagenesis based proposed cr scr  binding sites on c d using elisa analyses we were able to assess binding of mutant forms of c d to cr  mutations directed toward the concave surface of c d result in substantially compromised cr binding by contrast targeting the cr  c d interface identified in the cocrystal structure and the surrounding area results in significantly lower levels of disruption in binding molecular modeling approaches used to investigate disparities between the biochemical data and the x ray structure of the cr  c d cocrystal result in highest scoring solutions in which cr scr  is docked within the concave surface of c d
