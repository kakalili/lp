interplay between termination and translation machinery in eukaryotic selenoprotein synthesis edited by m gottesman
termination of translation in eukaryotes is catalyzed by erf  the stop codon recognition factor and erf  an erf and ribosome dependent gtpase in selenoprotein mrnas uga codons which typically specify termination serve an alternate function as sense codons selenocysteine incorporation involves a unique trna with an anticodon complementary to uga a unique elongation factor specific for this trna and cis acting secondary structures in selenoprotein mrnas termed secis elements to gain insight into the interplay between the selenocysteine insertion and termination machinery we investigated the effects of overexpressing erf and erf  and of altering uga codon context on the efficiency of selenoprotein synthesis in a transient transfection system overexpression of erf does not increase termination at naturally occurring selenocysteine codons surprisingly selenocysteine incorporation is enhanced overexpression of erf did not affect incorporation efficiency coexpression of both factors reproduced the effects with erf alone finally we show that the nucleotide context immediately upstream and downstream of the uga codon significantly affects termination to incorporation ratios and the response to erf overexpression implications for the mechanisms of selenocysteine incorporation and termination are discussed
