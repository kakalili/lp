structural and functional dynamics of an integral membrane protein complex modulated by lipid headgroup charge
we have used membrane surface charge to modulate the structural dynamics of an integral membrane protein phospholamban plb  and thereby its functional inhibition of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca atpase serca  it was previously shown by electron paramagnetic resonance in vesicles of neutral lipids that the plb cytoplasmic domain is in equilibrium between an ordered t state and a dynamically disordered r state and that phosphorylation of plb increases the r state and relieves serca inhibition suggesting that r is less inhibitory here we sought to control the t r equilibrium by an alternative means  varying the lipid headgroup charge thus perturbing the electrostatic interaction of plb s cationic cytoplasmic domain with the membrane surface we resolved the t and r states not only by electron paramagnetic resonance in the absence of serca but also by time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer from serca to plb thus probing directly the serca  plb complex compared to neutral lipids anionic lipids increased both the t population and serca inhibition while cationic lipids had the opposite effects in contrast to conventional models decreased inhibition was not accompanied by decreased binding we conclude that plb binds to serca in two distinct structural states of the cytoplasmic domain an inhibitory t state that interacts strongly with the membrane surface and a less inhibitory r state that interacts more strongly with the anionic serca cytoplasmic domain modulating membrane surface charge provides an effective way of investigating the correlation between structural dynamics and function of integral membrane proteins
