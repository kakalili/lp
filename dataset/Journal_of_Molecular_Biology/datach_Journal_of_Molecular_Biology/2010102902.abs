computational design of a chain specific tetracycline repressor heterodimer
the specificity and selectivity of protein  protein interactions are of central importance for many biological processes including signal transduction and transcription control we used the in house side chain packing program mumbo to computationally design a chain specific heterodimeric variant of the bacterial transcription regulator tetracycline repressor tetr  called t aab our goal was to engineer two different tetr chain variants a and b that no longer interact as aa or bb homodimers but selectively recombine to form heterodimers although  residues from each chain contribute to a dimer interface as large as      in wild type tetr the substitution of only three residues in one chain and two residues in a second chain sufficed for generating specificity in a t aab heterodimer variant the design was corroborated in vivo by a cell based transcription assay and in vitro by cd spectroscopy and x ray crystallography crystal structure analyses showed that while selectivity in the b chain is achieved entirely through van der waals repulsion the best selectivity in the a chain is obtained for the variant with the lowest number of atoms in the interface thus possibly leading to underpacking of the dimer interface this results in a marked decrease in thermal stability and a drastic reduction in the solubility of the t aaaa homodimer in comparison to the designed t aab heterodimer variant
