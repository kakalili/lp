l  ribosomal protein and effect of its mutation on ribosome resistance to erythromycin
the ribosomal protein l  is a core protein of the large ribosomal subunit interacting with all domains of the  s rrna the triplet met  lys  arg  deletion in l  from escherichia coli renders cells resistant to erythromycin which is known as an inhibitor of the nascent peptide chain elongation the crystal structure of the thermus thermophilus l  mutant with equivalent triplet leu  lys  arg  deletion has been determined at    resolution the superpositions of the mutant and the wild type l  structures within the  s subunits from haloarcula marismortui and deinococcus radiodurans show that the mutant  hairpin is bent inward the ribosome tunnel modifying the shape of its narrowest part and affecting the interaction between l  and  s rrna  s rrna nucleotides of domain v participating in erythromycin binding are located on the opposite sides of the tunnel and are brought to those positions by the interaction of the  s rrna with the l   hairpin the mutation in the l   hairpin affects the orientation and distances between those nucleotides this destabilizes the erythromycin binding  pocket  formed by  s rrna nucleotides exposed at the tunnel surface it seems that erythromycin while still being able to interact with one side of the tunnel but not reaching the other is therefore unable to block the polypeptide growth in the drug resistant ribosome
