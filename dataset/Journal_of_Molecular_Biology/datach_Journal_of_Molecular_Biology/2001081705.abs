high affinity dna binding of hu protein from the hyperthermophile thermotoga maritima edited by t richmond
prokaryotic genomes are compacted by association with small basic proteins generating what has been termed bacterial chromatin the ubiquitous dna binding protein hu serves this function dna binding properties of hu from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium thermotoga maritima are shown here to differ significantly from those characteristic of previously described hu homologs electrophoretic mobility shift analyses show that t maritima hu tmhu binds double stranded dna with high affinity kd      nm for  bp dna  equivalent affinity is observed between  c and   c tmhu has higher affinity for dna containing a set of  nt loops separated by  bp kd      nm  consistent with its introduction of two dna kinks using dna probes of varying length the optimal binding site for tmhu is estimated at  bp in sharp contrast to the    bp binding site reported for other hu homologs alignment of gt  hu sequences demonstrates significant sequence conservation a dna intercalating proline residue is almost universally conserved and it is preceded by arginine and asparagine in most sequences generating a highly conserved rnp motif v substitutes for r only in hu from thermotoga thermus and deinococcus a fivefold increase in dna binding affinity is observed for tmhu in which v is replaced with r tmhu v r kd      nm  but a change in the trajectory of dna flanking the sites of dna intercalation is inferred from analysis of tmhu v r binding to dna modified with  nt loops or with substitutions of  hydroxymethyluracil for thymine survival in extreme environments places unique demands on protection of genomic dna from thermal destabilization and on access of dna to the cellular machinery demands that may be fulfilled by the specific dna binding properties of hu and by the fine structure of the bacterial chromatin
