fibrillogenesis in dense collagen solutions a physicochemical study
fibrillogenesis the formation of collagen fibrils is a key factor in connective tissue morphogenesis to understand to what extent cells influence this process we systematically studied the physicochemistry of the self assembly of type i collagen molecules into fibrils in vitro we report that fibrillogenesis in solutions of type i collagen in a high concentration range close to that of living tissues      mg ml  yields strong gels over wide ph and ionic strength ranges structures of gels were described by combining microscopic observations transmission electron microscopy with small and wide angle x ray scattering analysis and the influence of concentration ph and ionic strength on the fibril size and organization was evaluated the typical cross striated pattern and the corresponding small angle x ray scattering  nm diffraction peaks were visible in all conditions in the ph  to ph   range in reference conditions ph    ionic strength   mm    c  collagen concentration greatly influences the overall macroscopic structure of the resultant fibrillar gels as well as the morphology and structure of the fibrils themselves at a given collagen concentration increasing the ionic strength from  to   mm produces larger fibrils until the system becomes biphasic we also show that fibrils can form in acidic medium ph     at very high collagen concentrations beyond   mg ml which suggests a possible cholesteric to smectic phase transition this set of data demonstrates how simple physicochemical parameters determine the molecular organization of collagen such an in vitro model allows us to study the intricate process of fibrillogenesis in conditions of molecular packing close to that which occurs in biological tissue morphogenesis
