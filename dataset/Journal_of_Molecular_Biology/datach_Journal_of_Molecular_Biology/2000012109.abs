active site determination of a pyrimidine dimer glycosylase edited by i tinoco
one mechanism for the repair of uv induced dna damage is the base excision repair pathway the initial step in this pathway and the specificity for the type of damage that is to be repaired reside in dna glycosylase abasic ap lyases cleavage of the glycosyl bond of the   pyrimidine of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer is hypothesized to occur through the destabilization of the glycosyl bond by protonation of the base or sugar with a concomitant nucleophilic attack on c   of the deoxyribose moiety based on mechanistic biochemical information from several glycosylase ap lyases and the structural information on the bacteriophage t pyrimidine dimer glycosylase t pdg  the catalytic mechanism has been investigated for the chlorella virus pyrimidine dimer glycosylase cv pdg  as predicted from modeling studies and reaction mechanisms the primary amine that initiates the nucleophilic displacement reaction could be trapped as a covalent imine intermediate and its identity determined by sequential edman degradation the primary amine was identified as the  amino group on the n terminal thr  site directed mutagenesis was subsequently used to confirm the conclusions that the  amino group of cv pdg is the active site nucleophile
