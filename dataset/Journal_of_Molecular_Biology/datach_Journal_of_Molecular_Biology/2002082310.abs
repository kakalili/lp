crystallographic structure of the k intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin conservation of free energy after photoisomerization of the retinal
the k state an early intermediate of the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle contains the excess free energy used for light driven proton transport the energy gain must reside in or near the photoisomerized retinal but in what form has long been an open question we produced the k intermediate in bacteriorhodopsin crystals in a photostationary state at  k with   yield and determined its x ray diffraction structure to    resolution in independent refinements of data from four crystals the changes are confined mainly to the photoisomerized retinal the retinal is  cis  anti as known from vibrational spectroscopy the c   c  bond is rotated nearly fully to cis from the initial trans configuration but the c   c  and c   nz bonds are partially counter rotated this strained geometry keeps the direction of the schiff base n  h bond vector roughly in the extracellular direction but the angle of its hydrogen bond with water   that connects it to the anionic asp  and asp   is not optimal weakening of this hydrogen bond may account for many of the reported features of the infrared spectrum of k and for its photoelectric signal as well as the deprotonation of the schiff base later in the cycle importantly although  cis the retinal does not assume the expected bent shape of this configuration comparison of the calculated energy of the increased angle of c   c   c  that allows this distortion with the earlier reported calorimetric measurement of the enthalpy gain of the k state indicates that a significant part of the excess energy is conserved in the bond strain at c
