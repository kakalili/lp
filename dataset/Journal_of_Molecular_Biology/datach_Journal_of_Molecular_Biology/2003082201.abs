translational standby sites how ribosomes may deal with the rapid folding kinetics of mrna
we have previously shown that stable base pairing at a translational initiation site in escherichia coli can inhibit translation by competing with the binding of ribosomes when the base pairing is not too strong this competition is won by the ribosomes resulting in efficient translation from a structured ribosome binding site rbs  we now re examine these results in the light of rna folding kinetics and find that the window during which a folded rbs is open is generally much too short to recruit a  s ribosomal subunit from the cytoplasm we argue that to achieve efficient expression a  s subunit must already be in contact with the mrna while this is still folded to shift into place as soon as the structure opens single stranded regions flanking the structure may constitute a standby site to which the  s subunit can attach non specifically we propose a steady state kinetic model for the early steps of translational initiation and use this to examine various quantitative aspects of standby binding the kinetic model provides an explanation of why the earlier equilibrium competition model predicted implausibly high  s  mrna affinities because all rna is structured to some degree standby binding is probably a general feature of translational initiation
