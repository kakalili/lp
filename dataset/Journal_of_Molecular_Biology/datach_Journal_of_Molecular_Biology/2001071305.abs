interrupting the template strand of the t promoter facilitates translocation of the dna during initiation reducing transcript slippage and the release of abortive products edited by m gottesman
we have explored the effects of a variety of structural and sequence changes in the initiation region of the phage t promoter on promoter function at promoters in which the template strand t strand is intact initiation is directed a minimal distance of  nt downstream from the binding region although the sequence of the dna surrounding the start site is not critical for correct initiation it is important for melting of the promoter and stabilization of the initiation complex at promoters in which the integrity of t strand is interrupted by nicks or gaps between   and   the enzyme continues to initiate predominately at   however under these conditions there is a decrease in the release of abortive products of   nt a decrease in the synthesis of poly g products which arise by slippage of the nascent transcript  and a defect in displacement of the rna we propose that unlinking the binding and initiation regions of the t strand changes the manner in which this strand is retained in the abortive complex reducing or eliminating the need to pack or  scrunch  the strand into the complex during initiation and lowering a thermodynamic barrier to its translocation
