molecular dissection tissue localization and ca  binding of the ryanodine receptor of caenorhabditis elegans
the ryanodine receptor of caenorhabditis elegans ceryr which contains   amino acid residues is encoded by a single gene ryr  unc   the unc  kh  mutation isolated in an animal showing abnormal response to the anesthetic ketamine has the substitution ser  asn in ceryr predicted to be a phosphorylation site to elucidate the function of the region of ceryr and to determine the localization of ceryr in this animal ten region peptides were produced in escherichia coli by using expression plasmids and eight antisera were raised against these fusion peptides one antibody against the region corresponding to the kh  mutation site enabled detection of ceryr from mutant animals both in western analysis and in situ specificity of this antiserum was demonstrated using western analysis which showed the full size and the partial size bands in wild type and in the tc induced deletion mutant animals respectively but no corresponding bands in unc  null mutant animals ceryr was detected in i bands of muscle sarcomeres by double immunostaining ceryr was found in the body wall pharyngeal vulval anal and sex muscles of adult worms and also found to be present in embryonic muscle but not in non muscle cells two ef hand motifs and the c terminus were demonstrated to be ca  binding regions on the basis of these results we propose a model for the functional domains of ceryr which agrees well with the model of mammalian skeletal ryr which is based on proteolysis and cross linking analysis we discuss the usefulness and limitations of the molecular dissection approach which uses peptides and peptide specific antibodies to determine the local structure and function of individual domains within a large molecule
