structural basis for the higher ca  activation of the regulated actin activated myosin atpase observed with dictyostelium tetrahymena actin chimeras edited by a klug
replacement of residues     or     of subdomain  in dictyostelium actin with the corresponding tetrahymena sequence qta to kay replacement half chimera  qtaas to kayke replacement full chimera leads to a higher ca  activation of the regulated acto myosin subfragment  atpase activity the ratio of atpase activation in the presence of tropomyosin troponin and ca  to that without tropomyosin troponin becomes about four times as large as the ratio for the wild type actin to understand the structural basis of this higher ca  activation we have determined the crystal structures of the   complex of dictyostelium mutant actins half chimera  and full chimera with gelsolin segment  to    and    resolution respectively together with the structure of wild type actin as a control although there were local changes on the surface of the subdomain  and the phenolic side chain of tyr  displaced the side chain of leu  from a non polar pocket to a more solvent accessible position the structures of the actin chimeras showed that the mutations in the     region did not introduce large changes in the overall actin structure this suggests that residues near position   formed part of the tropomyosin binding site on actin in actively contracting muscle the higher ca  activation observed with a  y containing mutants can be understood in terms of a three state model for thin filament regulation in which in the presence of both ca  and myosin heads the local changes of actin generated by the mutation especially its phenolic side chain facilitate the transition of thin filaments from a  closed  state to an  open  state between   and   water molecules were identified in the different structures and it was found that actin recognizes hydrated forms of the adenine base and the ca ion in the nucleotide binding site
