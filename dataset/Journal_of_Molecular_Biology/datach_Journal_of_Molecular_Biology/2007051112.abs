structural basis for the carbohydrate recognition of the sclerotium rolfsii lectin
the crystal structure of a novel fungal lectin from sclerotium rolfsii srl in its free form and in complex with n acetyl d galactosamine galnac and n acetyl d glucosamine glcnac has been determined at          and     resolution respectively the protein structure is composed of two  sheets which consist of four and six  strands connected by two  helices sequence and structural comparisons reveal that srl is the third member of a newly identified family of fungal lectins which includes lectins from agaricus bisporus and xerocomus chrysenteron that share a high degree of structural similarity and carbohydrate specificity the data for the free srl are the highest resolution data for any protein of this family the crystal structures of the srl in complex with two carbohydrates galnac and glcnac which differ only in the configuration of a single epimeric hydroxyl group provide the structural basis for its carbohydrate specificity srl has two distinct carbohydrate binding sites a primary and a secondary galnac binds at the primary site whereas glcnac binds only at the secondary site thus srl has the ability to recognize and probably bind at the same time two different carbohydrate structures structural comparison to agaricus bisporus lectin  carbohydrate complexes reveals that the primary site is also able to bind the thomsen friedenreich antigen gal    galnac   glycan structures whereas the secondary site cannot the features of the molecular recognition at the two sites are described in detail
