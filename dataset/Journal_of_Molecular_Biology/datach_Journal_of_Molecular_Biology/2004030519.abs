salt bridges can stabilize but do not accelerate the folding of the homodimeric coiled coil peptide gcn p
double mutant cycle analysis was employed to ascertain the role of intra and interchain salt bridges in the folding and stability of the dimeric coiled coil peptide gcn p  the  residue leucine zipper domain of the transcriptional activator gcn  equilibrium circular dichroism studies of the urea induced unfolding reaction at neutral ph revealed that both types of ionic interactions localized primarily in the n terminal portion of the molecule enhance the stability of the native coiled coil by contrast comparable stopped flow circular dichroism studies indicate that the salt bridge interactions with one possible exception are not well formed in the transition state for folding although the e q r a double mutant failed to fold fragmentation studies suggest that the e  r  intramolecular salt bridge may play a critical role in stabilizing c terminal nascent helices that drive the association reaction the remaining salt bridges appear to stabilize the parallel stranded coiled coil architecture of gcn p only after the peptide traverses the rate limiting dimeric transition state
