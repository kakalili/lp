fully synthetic human combinatorial antibody libraries hucal based on modular consensus frameworks and cdrs randomized with trinucleotides edited by i a wilson
by analyzing the human antibody repertoire in terms of structure amino acid sequence diversity and germline usage we found that seven vh and seven vl four v  and three v  germline families cover more than   of the human antibody diversity used a consensus sequence was derived for each family and optimized for expression in escherichia coli in order to make all six complementarity determining regions cdrs accessible for diversification the synthetic genes were designed to be modular and mutually compatible by introducing unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the cdrs molecular modeling verified that all canonical classes were present we could show that all master genes are expressed as soluble proteins in the periplasm of e coli a first set of antibody phage display libraries totalling    members was created after cloning the genes in all  combinations into a phagemid vector itself devoid of the restriction sites in question diversity was created by replacing the vh and vl cdr regions of the master genes by cdr library cassettes generated from mixed trinucleotides and biased towards natural human antibody cdr sequences the sequencing of   members of the unselected libraries indicated that the frequency of correct and thus potentially functional sequences was    selection experiments against many antigens yielded a diverse set of binders with high affinities due to the modular design of all master genes either single binders or even pools of binders can now be rapidly optimized without knowledge of the particular sequence using pre built cdr cassette libraries the small number of  master genes will allow future improvements to be incorporated quickly and the separation of the frameworks may help in analyzing why nature has evolved these distinct subfamilies of antibody germline genes
