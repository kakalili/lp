structure dynamics and electrostatics of the active site of glutaredoxin  from escherichia coli comparison with functionally related proteins edited by b honig
the chemistry of active site cysteine residues is central to the activity of thiol disulfide oxidoreductases of the thioredoxin superfamily in these reactions a nucleophilic thiolate is required but the associated pka values differ vastly in the superfamily from less than  in dsba to greater than  in trx the factors that stabilize this thiolate are however not clearly established the glutaredoxins grxs  which are members of this superfamily contain a cys pro tyr cys motif in their active site in reduced grxs the pka of the n terminal active site nucleophilic cysteine residue is lowered significantly and the stabilization of the corresponding thiolate is expected to influence the redox potential of these enzymes here we use a combination of long molecular dynamics md simulations pka calculations and experimental investigations to derive the structure and dynamics of the reduced active site from escherichia coli grx  and investigate the factors that stabilize the thiolate several different md simulations converged toward a consensus conformation for the active site cysteine residues cys  and cys   after a number of local conformational changes key features of the model were tested experimentally by measurement of nmr scalar coupling constants and determination of pka values of selected residues the pka values of the grx active site residues were calculated during the md simulations and support the underlying structural model the structure of grx  in combination with the pka calculations indicate that the pka of the n terminal active site cysteine residue in grx is intermediate between that of its counterpart in dsba and trx the pka values in best agreement with experiment are obtained with a low  lt  protein dielectric constant the calculated pka values fluctuate significantly in response to protein dynamics which underscores the importance of the details of the underlying structures when calculating pka values the thiolate of cys  is stabilized primarily by direct hydrogen bonding with the amide protons of tyr  and cys  and the thiol proton of cys  rather than by long range interactions from charged groups or from a helix macrodipole from the comparison of reduced grx with other members of the thioredoxin superfamily a unifying theme for the structural basis of thiol pka differences in this superfamily begins to emerge
