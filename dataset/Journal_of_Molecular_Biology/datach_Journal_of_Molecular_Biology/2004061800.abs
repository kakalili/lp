characteristic patterns of n oct  binding to a set of neuronal promoters
n oct  a neurospecific pou protein homodimerizes in a non cooperative fashion on the neuronal aromatic l amino acid decarboxylase gene promoter and generates heterodimers with hnf   several other neuronal gene promoters the corticotropin releasing hormone and the aldolase c gene promoters also contain overlapping binding sites for n oct  and hnf   we have demonstrated that n oct  presents a non cooperative homodimerization on these two additional targets and can also give rise to heterodimers with hnf   surprisingly despite the high degree of conservation of the respective pou subunits the ubiquitous pou protein oct  can only form monomers even in the presence of either n oct  or hnf   on these dna targets our data indicate that this difference is correlated with the specific ability of a portion of the n oct  linker to fold as an  helix a property shared by class iii pou proteins these results suggest that this novel binding pattern permits the heterodimerization of n oct  and hnf   on the neuronal promoters which could be a key issue in the development of the nervous system and possibly tumors of neural origin
