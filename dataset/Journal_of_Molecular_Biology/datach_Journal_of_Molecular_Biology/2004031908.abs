identification of new human cadherin genes using a combination of protein motif search and gene finding methods
we have combined protein motif search and gene finding methods to identify genes encoding proteins containing specific domains particularly we have focused on finding new human genes of the cadherin superfamily proteins which represent a major group of cell  cell adhesion receptors contributing to embryonic neuronal morphogenesis models for three cadherin protein motifs were generated from over   already annotated cadherin domains and used to search the complete translated human genome the genomic sequence regions containing motif  hits  were analyzed by eukaryotic genemark hmm to identify the exon  intron structure of new genes three new genes cdh j pcdh j and fat j were found the predicted proteins pcdh j and fat j were classified into protocadherin and fat like subfamilies respectively based on the number and organization of cadherin domains and presence of subfamily specific conserved amino acid residues expression of fat j was shown in almost all tested tissues the exon  intron organization of cdh j was experimentally verified by pcr with specifically designed primers and its tissue specific expression was demonstrated the described methodology can be applied to discover new genes encoding proteins from families with well characterized structural and functional domains
