binding thermodynamics of phosphorylated inhibitors to triosephosphate isomerase and the contribution of electrostatic interactions
electrostatic interactions have a central role in some biological processes such as recognition of charged ligands by proteins we characterized the binding energetics of yeast triosephosphate isomerase tim with phosphorylated inhibitors  phosphoglycollate  pg and phosphoglycolohydroxamate pgh  we determined the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process kb  gb  hb  sb and  cp with different concentrations of nacl using fluorimetric and calorimetric titrations in the conventional mode of itc and a novel method multithermal titration calorimetry mtc  which enabled us to measure  cp in a single experiment we ruled out specific interactions of na and cl  with the native enzyme and did not detect significant linked protonation effects upon the binding of inhibitors increasing ionic strength i caused kb  gb and  hb to become less favorable while  sb became less unfavorable from the variation of kb with i we determined the electrostatic contribution of tim  pg and tim  pgh to  gb at i    m and    c to be   and   respectively the greater affinity of pgh for tim is due to a more favorable  hb compared to pg by     kj mol  at    c  this difference is compatible with pgh establishing up to five more hydrogen bonds with tim both binding  cps were negative and less negative with increasing ionic strength  cps at i    m were much more negative than predicted by surface area models water molecules trapped in the interface when ligands bind to protein could explain the highly negative  cps thermodynamic binding functions for tim  pg changed more with ionic strength than those for tim  pgh this greater dependence is consistent with linked but compensated protonation equilibriums yielding the dianionic species of pg that binds to tim process that is not required for pgh
