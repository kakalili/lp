lipid chain selectivity by outer membrane phospholipase a
outer membrane phospholipase a ompla is a unique integral membrane enzyme found in gram negative bacteria and is an important virulence factor for pathogens such as helicobacter pylori this broad specificity lipase degrades a variety of lipid substrates and it plays a direct role in adjusting the composition and permeability of bacterial membranes under conditions of stress interestingly ompla shows little preference for the lipid headgroup and instead the length of the hydrophobic acyl chain is the strongest determinant for substrate selection by ompla with the enzyme strongly preferring substrates with chains equal to or longer than  carbon atoms the question remains as to how a hydrophobic protein like ompla can achieve this specificity particularly when the shorter chains can be accommodated in the binding pocket using a series of sulfonyl fluoride inhibitors with various lengths of acyl chain we show here that the thermodynamics of substrate induced ompla dimerization are guided by the acyl chain length demonstrating that ompla uses a unique biophysical mechanism to select its phospholipid substrate
