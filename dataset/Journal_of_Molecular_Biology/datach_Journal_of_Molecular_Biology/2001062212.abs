structural assembly of the active site in an aldo keto reductase by nadph cofactor edited by i a wilson
a    resolution x ray structure of the apo form of corynebacterium   diketo d gluconic acid reductase a   dkgr a  a member of the aldo keto reductase superfamily has been determined by molecular replacement using the nadph bound form of the same enzyme as the search model   dkgr a catalyzes the nadph dependent stereo specific reduction of   diketo d gluconate   dkg to  keto l gulonate a precursor in the industrial production of vitamin c an atomic resolution structure for the apo form of the enzyme in conjunction with our previously reported high resolution x ray structure for the holo enzyme and holo substrate model allows a comparative analysis of structural changes that accompany cofactor binding the results show that regions of the active site undergo coordinated conformational changes of up to    these conformational changes result in the organization and structural rearrangement of residues associated with substrate binding and catalysis thus nadph functions not only to provide a hydride ion for catalytic reduction but is also a critical structural component for formation of a catalytically competent form of dkgr a
