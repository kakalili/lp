a synthetic peptide bearing the hiv  integrase      amino acid residues mediates active nuclear import and binding to importin   characterization of a functional nuclear localization signal
in spite of recent efforts to elucidate the nuclear import pathway of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  integrase protein in  its exact route as well as the domains that mediate its import are still unknown here we show that a synthetic peptide bearing the amino acid residues      of the hiv  in is able to mediate active import of covalently attached bovine serum albumin molecules into nuclei of permeabilized cells and therefore was designated as nuclear localization signal in nls in  a peptide bearing residues      in the reversed order showed low karyophilic properties active nuclear import was demonstrated by using fluorescence microscopy and a quantitative elisa based assay system nuclear import was blocked by addition of the nls in peptide as well as by a peptide bearing the nls of the simian virus  t antigen nls sv   the nls in peptide partially inhibited nuclear import mediated by the full length recombinant hiv  in protein indicating that the sequence of the nls in is involved in mediating nuclear import of the in protein the nls in as well as the full length in protein interacted specifically with importin   binding of which was blocked by the nls in peptide itself as well as by the nls sv
