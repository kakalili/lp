the n terminal region of the recu holliday junction resolvase is essential for homologous recombination
the recu holliday junction hj resolving enzyme is highly conserved in the firmicutes phylum of bacteria in bacillus subtilis the recu gene has two putative initiation codons at positions  and   in rec cells only the full length recu polypeptide   residues    kda was detected even after different stress treatments to address the relevance of the flexible n terminus we constructed mutant variants experiments in vivo revealed that recu     which initiates at met  and encodes recu     and recu  the conserved arg  residue was substituted with alanine to give recur a are genuine recu mutants rendering cells impaired in dna repair and chromosomal segregation recu has three activities it i cleaves hjs  ii anneals complementary strands and iii modulates reca activities recur a binds and cleaves hj dna in vitro as efficiently as wild type recu but ruvb atp s mg  fails to stimulate the recur a cleavage reaction in contrast recu     forms unstable complexes with dna and fails to cleave hjs recu and its variants are capable of promoting dna strand annealing and exert a negative effect on deoxy atp dependent reca mediated dna strand exchange this study shows that the flexible n terminus of recu is essential for protein activity
