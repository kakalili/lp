solution nmr study of the interaction between ntf and nucleoporin fxfg repeats
interactions with nucleoporins containing fxfg repeat cores are crucial for the nuclear import of rangdp mediated by nuclear transport factor  ntf  we describe here a solution nmr based study that identifies primary and secondary fxfg binding sites on ntf and accounts for a range of observations on the rate of ntf nuclear trafficking we used three complementary nmr methods namely amide group chemical shift titrations noe and cross saturation measurements to show that the major fxfg binding site on the dimeric rat ntf  rntf  molecule is centred on trp and is formed by residues from both ntf chains a secondary fxfg binding site is located at the rntf hydrophobic cavity and these two sites together with a surface hydrophobic cluster centred on trp   merge into an elongated hydrophobic stripe on the rntf surface the primary site centred on trp is lost in the rntf w a mutant that has been shown to bind fxfg nucleoporins with greatly reduced affinity whereas the secondary site at the rntf hydrophobic cavity is retained the interface between ntf and fxfg nucleoporins detected by nmr is more extensive than that detected by x ray crystallography and the presence of a secondary site at the ntf hydrophobic cavity accounts for the unexpectedly rapid nuclear import of rntf w r recently observed by others the structure of the binding interfaces on these transport factors provides a rationale for the specificity of their interactions with nucleoporins that combined with their weak binding constants facilitates rapid translocation through npcs during nuclear trafficking
