examining polyglutamine peptide length a connection between collapsed conformations and increased aggregation
abnormally expanded polyglutamine domains in proteins are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases of which the best known is huntington s expansion of the polyglutamine domain facilitates aggregation of the affected protein and several studies directly link aggregation to neurotoxicity the age of onset of disease is inversely correlated with the length of the polyglutamine domain this correlation motivates an examination of the role of the length of the domain on aggregation in this investigation peptides containing  to  glutamines were synthesized and their conformational and aggregation properties were examined all peptides lacked secondary structure fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies revealed that the peptides became increasingly collapsed as the number of glutamine residues increased the effective persistence length was estimated to decrease from    to     as the number of glutamines increased from  to   a comparison of our data with theoretical results suggests that phosphate buffered saline is a good solvent for q and q  a theta solvent for q  and a poor solvent for q  and q  by dynamic light scattering we observed that q  q  and q  but not q or q  immediately formed soluble aggregates upon dilution into phosphate buffered saline at    c thus q  stands at the transition point between good and poor solvent and between stable and aggregation prone peptide examination of aggregates by transmission electron microscopy along with kinetic assays for sedimentation provided evidence indicating that soluble aggregates mature into sedimentable aggregates together the data support a mechanism of aggregation in which monomer collapse is accompanied by formation of soluble oligomers these soluble species lack regular secondary structure but appear morphologically similar to the sedimentable aggregates into which they eventually mature
