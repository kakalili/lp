Out of more than 500 sequenced cytosolic tRNAs, there is only one with an unmodified adenosine in the wobble position (position 34). The reason for this rare occurrence of A34 is that it is mostly deaminated to inosine-34 (I34). I34 is a common constituent in the wobble position of tRNAs and has a decoding capacity different from that of A34. We have isolated a mutant (proL207) of Salmonella typhimurium, in which the wobble nucleoside G34 has been replaced by an unmodified A in tRNAGGGPro, which is the only tRNA that normally reads the CCC codon. Thus, this mutant apparently has no tRNA that is considered cognate for the codon CCC. Despite this, the mutant grows normally. As expected, Pro-tRNA selection at the CCC codon in the A-site in a mutant deleted for the proL gene, which encodes the tRNAGGGPro, was severely reduced. However, in comparison this rate of selection was only slightly reduced in the proL207 mutant with its A34 containing tRNAAGGPro suggesting that this tRNA reads CCC. Moreover, measurements of the interference by a tRNA residing in the P-site on the apparent termination efficiency at the A-site indicated that indeed the A34 containing tRNA reads the CCC codon. We conclude that A34 in a cytosolic tRNA is not detrimental to the cell and that the mutant tRNAAGGPro is able to read the CCC codon like its wild-type counterpart tRNAGGGPro. We suggest that the decoding of the CCC codon by a 5′-AGG-3′ anticodon occurs by a wobble base-pair between a protonated A34 and a C in the mRNA.
