interaction with sl rna but not with hiv  genomic rna or p bodies is required for apobec f virion packaging
human cytidine deaminase apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide like f apobec f or a f  like apobec g has broad antiviral activity against diverse retroelements including vif deficient human immunodeficiency virus hiv   its antiviral functions are known to rely on its virion encapsidation and be suppressed by hiv  vif which recruits cullin based e ubiquitin ligases however the factors that mediate a f virion packaging have not yet been identified in this study we demonstrate that a f specifically interacts with cellular signal recognition particle srp rna  sl rna  which is selectively packaged into hiv  virions efficient packaging of sl rna as well as a f was mediated by the rna binding nucleocapsid domain of hiv  gag reducing sl rna packaging by overexpression of srp  protein inhibited a f virion packaging although a f has been shown to interact with p bodies and viral genomic rna our data indicated that p bodies and hiv  genomic rna were not required for a f packaging thus in addition to its well known function in srps  sl rna which is encapsidated into diverse retroviruses also participates in the innate antiviral function of host cytidine deaminases
