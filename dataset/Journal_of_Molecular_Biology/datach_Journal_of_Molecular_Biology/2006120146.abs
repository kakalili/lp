ddi  a eukaryotic protein with the retroviral protease fold
retroviral aspartyl proteases are homodimeric whereas eukaryotic aspartyl proteases tend to be large monomeric enzymes with  fold internal symmetry it has been proposed that contemporary monomeric aspartyl proteases evolved by gene duplication and fusion from a primordial homodimeric enzyme recent sequence analyses have suggested that such  fossil  dimeric aspartyl proteases are still encoded in the eukaryotic genome we present evidence for retention of a dimeric aspartyl protease in eukaryotes the x ray crystal structure of a domain of the saccharomyces cerevisiae protein ddi shows that it is a dimer with a fold similar to that of the retroviral proteases furthermore the double asp thr gly ala amino acid sequence motif at the active site of hiv protease is found with identical geometry in the ddi structure however the putative substrate binding groove is wider in ddi than in the retroviral proteases suggesting that ddi accommodates bulkier substrates ddi belongs to a family of proteins known as the ubiquitin receptors which have in common the ability to bind ubiquitinated substrates and the proteasome ubiquitin receptors contain an amino terminal ubiquitin like ubl domain and a carboxy terminal ubiquitin associated uba domain but ddi is the only representative in which the ubl and uba domains flank an aspartyl protease like domain the remarkable structural similarity between the central domain of ddi and the retroviral proteases in the global fold and in active site detail suggests that ddi functions proteolytically during regulated protein turnover in the cell
