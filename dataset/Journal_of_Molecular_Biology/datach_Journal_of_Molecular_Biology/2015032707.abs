catalytic stimulation by restrained active site floppiness  the case of high density lipoprotein bound serum paraoxonase
despite the abundance of membrane associated enzymes the mechanism by which membrane binding stabilizes these enzymes and stimulates their catalysis remains largely unknown serum paraoxonase  pon  is a lipophilic lactonase whose stability and enzymatic activity are dramatically stimulated when associated with high density lipoprotein hdl particles our mutational and structural analyses combined with empirical valence bond simulations reveal a network of hydrogen bonds that connect hdl binding residues with asn   a key catalytic residue residing gt   from the hdl contacting interface this network ensures precise alignment of n   which in turn ligates pon s catalytic calcium and aligns the lactone substrate for catalysis hdl binding restrains the overall motion of the active site and particularly of n   thus reducing the catalytic activation energy barrier we demonstrate herein that disturbance of this network even at its most far reaching periphery undermines pon s activity membrane binding thus immobilizes long range interactions via second and third shell residues that reduce the active site s floppiness and pre organize the catalytic residues although this network is critical for efficient catalysis as demonstrated here unraveling these long rage interaction networks is challenging let alone their implementation in artificial enzyme design
