cross beta order and diversity in nanocrystals of an amyloid forming peptide
the seven residue peptide gnnqqny from the n terminal region of the yeast prion protein sup  which forms amyloid fibers colloidal aggregates and highly ordered nanocrystals provides a model system for characterizing the elusively protean cross beta conformation depending on preparative conditions orthorhombic and monoclinic crystals with similar lath shaped morphology have been obtained ultra high resolution  lt    spacing electron diffraction patterns from single nanocrystals show that the peptide chains pack in parallel cross beta columns with      axial spacing mosaic striations     nm wide observed by electron microscopy indicate lateral size limiting crystal growth related to amyloid fiber formation frequently obtained orthorhombic forms with apparent space group symmetry p    have cell dimensions ranging from a         b         c       a  for wet to dried states electron diffraction data from single nanocrystals recorded in tilt series of still frames have been mapped in reciprocal space however reliable integrated intensities cannot be obtained from these series and dynamical electron diffraction effects present problems in data analysis the diversity of ordered structures formed under similar conditions has made it difficult to obtain reproducible x ray diffraction data from powder specimens and overlapping bragg reflections in the powder patterns preclude separated structure factor measurements for these data model protofilaments consisting of tightly paired half staggered beta strands related by a screw axis can be fit in the crystal lattices but model refinement will require accurate structure factor measurements nearly anhydrous packing of this hydrophilic peptide can account for the insolubility of the crystals since the activation energy for rehydration may be extremely high water excluding packing of paired cross beta peptide segments in thin protofilaments may be characteristic of the wide variety of anomalously stable amyloid aggregates
