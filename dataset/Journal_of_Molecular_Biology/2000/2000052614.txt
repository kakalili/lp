Ribosomal RNA transcription initiation requires the melting of DNA to form an open complex, formation of the first few phosphodiester bonds, commencement of RNA polymerase I movement along the DNA, clearance of the promoter, and the formation of a steady-state ternary elongation complex. We examined DNA melting and promoter clearance by using potassium permanganate, diethylpyrocarbonate and methidiumpropylEDTA·Fe(II) footprinting. In combination, these methods demonstrated: (1) TIF-IB and RNA polymerase I are the only proteins required for formation of an initial ∼9 base-pair open promoter region. This finding contradicts earlier results using diethylpyrocarbonate alone, which suggested an RNA synthesis requirement for stable melting. (2) DNA melting is temperature-dependent, with a tm between 15 and 20°C. (3) Temperature-dependency of melting, as well as stalling the polymerase at sites close to the transcription start site revealed that the melted DNA region initially opens upstream of the transcription initiation site, and enlarges in a downstream direction coordinate with initiation, eventually attaining a steady-state transcription bubble of approximately 19 base-pairs. (4) The RNA-DNA hybrid protects the template DNA from single-strand footprinting reagents. The hybrid is 9 bp in length, consistent with the longer hybrid estimated by some for the Escherichia coli polymerase and with the hybrids estimated for eukaryotic polymerases II and III.
