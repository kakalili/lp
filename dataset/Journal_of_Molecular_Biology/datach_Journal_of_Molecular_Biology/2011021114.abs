theoretical analysis of catalytic srna mediated gene silencing
small regulatory rna srna that acts by an antisense mechanism is critical for gene regulation at the posttranscriptional level recently an hfq dependent srna named micm which is related to the regulation of outer membrane protein was verified as a novel antisense srna due to its catalytic mode of regulation here we propose a simple kinetic model for the enzyme like regulation mode of srna and study in detail the noise properties of the target gene under various recycling rates of the regulator we predict that the recycling rate of srna and other relative parameters have significant influence on the noise strength of target expression in comparison with the stoichiometric regulatory mode a lesser fluctuation of target expression was observed near the threshold at which the transcription rates of both srna and target mrna equal each other we also found that the new mode is better in terms of rapid response to external signals however it needs more time to achieve target recovery if the stimulating signal disappears additionally the obtained time evolution results of the micm  ybfm interaction system based on our model are consistent with previous experimental results serving as experimental evidence to back up our theoretical analysis
