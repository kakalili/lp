photochemical intermediates of arabidopsis phototropin  lov domains associated with conformational changes
the photochemical reactions of arabidopsis phototropin  light oxygen voltage domain  lov  with the linker region lov linker  without the linker lov  and lov were studied using the time resolved transient grating tg and transient lens trl methods although the absorption spectra did not change after the formation of the adduct species a small volume expansion process with a time constant of  ms was observed for lov  for the lov linker at   k a volume contraction process with a time constant of    s was observed in addition to a volume expansion process with  ms and the diffusion coefficient change with  ms the reaction intermediate species were characterized on the basis of their thermodynamic properties such as changes in enthalpy thermal expansion and heat capacity for the first intermediate s   the values of these properties were similar to those of the ground state for both lov and lov linker a relatively large thermal expansion volume    cm mol  k   and a positive heat capacity change    kj mol  k   were detected for the intermediates of lov linker these characteristic features were interpreted in terms of structural fluctuation and exposure of hydrophobic residues in the linker domain respectively the enthalpy change of s  of the lov domain was significantly greater than changes for the lov or lov linker samples data from this study support a major conformational change of the linker region in the photochemical reaction of phototropin
