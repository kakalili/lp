phospholipid interaction induces molecular level polymorphism in apolipoprotein c ii amyloid fibrils via alternative assembly pathways
a common feature of many of the most important and prominent amyloid forming proteins is their ability to bind lipids and lipid complexes lipids are ubiquitous components of disease associated amyloid plaques and deposits in humans yet the specific roles of lipid in the process of amyloid fibril formation are poorly understood this study investigated the effect of phospholipids on amyloid fibril formation by human apolipoprotein apo c ii using phosphatidylcholine derivatives comprising acyl chains of up to  carbon atoms submicellar concentrations of short chain phospholipids increase the rate of apoc ii fibril formation in an acyl chain length and concentration dependent fashion while high micellar concentrations of phospholipids completely inhibited amyloid formation at lower concentrations of soluble phospholipid complexes fibril formation by apoc ii was only partially inhibited and under these conditions aggregation followed a two phase process electron microscopy showed that the fibrils resulting from the second phase of aggregation were straight cablelike and about   nm wide in contrast to the homogeneous twisted ribbon morphology of apoc ii fibrils formed under lipid free conditions seeding experiments showed that this alternative fibril structure could be templated both in the presence and in the absence of lipid complex suggesting that the two morphologies result from distinct assembly pathways circular dichroism spectroscopy studies indicated that the secondary structural conformation within the straight type and ribbon type fibrils were distinct further suggesting divergent assembly pathways these studies show that phospholipid complexes can change the structural architecture of mature fibrils and generate new fibril morphologies with the potential to alter the in vivo behaviour of amyloid such lipid interactions may play a role in defining the structural features of fibrils formed by diverse amyloidogenic proteins
