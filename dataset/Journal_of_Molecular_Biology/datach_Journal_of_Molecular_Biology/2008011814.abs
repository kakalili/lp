spectral characteristics of the photocycle of channelrhodopsin  and its implication for channel function
in    channelrhodopsin  chr  from chlamydomonas reinhardtii was discovered to be a light gated cation channel and since that time the channel became an excellent tool to control by light neuronal cells in culture as well as in living animals with high temporal and spatial resolution in a noninvasive manner however little is known about the spectral properties and their relation to the channel function we have expressed chr in the yeast pichia pastoris and purified the protein flash photolysis data were combined with patch clamp studies to elucidate the photocycle the protein absorbs maximally at     nm before light excitation and shows flash induced absorbance changes with at least two different photointermediates four relaxation processes can be extracted from the time course that we have analysed in a linear model for the photocycle leading to the kinetic intermediates p to p  a short lived photointermediate at   nm suggesting a deprotonation of the retinal schiff base is followed by a red shifted    nm species with a millisecond lifetime the first three kinetic intermediates in the photocycle p to p  are described mainly by the red shifted   nm species the   nm species contributes to a smaller extent to p and p  the fourth one p  is spectroscopically almost identical with the ground state and lasts into the seconds time region we compared the spectroscopic data to current measurements under whole cell patch clamp conditions on hek   cells the lifetimes of the spectroscopically and electrophysiologically determined intermediates are in excellent agreement the intermediates p and p  absorbing at   nm are identified as the cation permeating states of the channel under stationary light a modulation of the photocurrent by green light    nm was observed we conclude that the red shifted spectral species represents the open channel state and the thermal relaxation of this intermediate the transition from p to p  is coupled to channel closing
