molecular basis of the antimutagenic activity of the house cleaning inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase rdgb from escherichia coli
inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatases which are ubiquitous house cleaning enzymes hydrolyze noncanonical nucleoside triphosphates inosine triphosphate itp and xanthosine triphosphate xtp  and prevent the incorporation of hypoxanthine or xanthine into nascent dna or rna here we present the    resolution crystal structure of the inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase rdgb from escherichia coli in a free state and in complex with a substrate itp ca  or a product inosine monophosphate imp  itp binding to rdgb induced a large displacement of the   helix closing the enzyme active site this positions the conserved lys  close to the bridging oxygen between the   and  phosphates of the substrate weakening the p   o bond on the other side of the substrate the conserved asp  is proposed to act as a base coordinating the catalytic water molecule our data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the substrate selectivity and catalysis of rdgb and other itpases
