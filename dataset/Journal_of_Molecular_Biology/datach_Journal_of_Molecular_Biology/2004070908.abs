monovalent cations regulate dna sequence recognition by   repressor
the bacteriophage   repressor distinguishes between its six naturally occurring binding sites using indirect readout in indirect readout sequence dependent differences in the structure and flexibility of non contacted bases in a protein s dna binding site modulate the affinity of dna for protein the conformation and flexibility of a dna sequence can be influenced by the interaction of the dna bases or backbone with solution components we examined the effect of changing the cation type present in solution on the stability and structure of   repressor complexes with wild type and mutant or and or  binding sites that differ in their contacted and non contacted base sequences we find that the affinity of repressor for or  but not for or  depends remarkably on the type and concentration of monovalent cation moreover the formation of a stable specific repressor  or complex requires the presence of monovalent cations however repressor  or complex formation has no such requirement changing monovalent cation type alters the ability of repressor to protect or  but not or  from oh radical cleavage altering the relative length of the poly da  poly dt tract in the non contacted regions of the or and or can reverse the cation sensitivity of repressor s affinities for these two sites taken together these findings show that cation dependent alterations in dna structure underlies indirect readout of dna sequence by   repressor and perhaps other proteins
