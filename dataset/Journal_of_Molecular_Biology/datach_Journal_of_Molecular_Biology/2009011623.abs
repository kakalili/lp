crystal structure of diaminopimelate epimerase from arabidopsis thaliana an amino acid racemase critical for l lysine biosynthesis
diaminopimelate dap epimerase is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of lysine in plants lysine is an essential dietary nutrient for mammals in both plants and bacteria dap epimerase catalyzes the interconversion of ll dap and dl meso dap the absence of a mammalian homolog makes dap epimerase a promising target for the design of novel herbicides and antibacterials this enzyme requires no cofactors and it functions through an unusual mechanism involving two cysteine residues acting in concert and alternating as a base thiolate and as an acid thiol  the present study reports the crystal structures of two enzyme  inhibitor complexes of dap epimerase from arabidopsis thaliana with different isomers of the irreversible inhibitor and substrate mimic    amino  carboxybutyl aziridine  carboxylate at   and     resolution these structures provide the first atomic details of a plant amino acid racemase structural analysis reveals that ligand binding to a cleft between the two domains of the enzyme is accompanied by domain closure with two strictly conserved cysteine residues cys  and cys   optimally positioned to perform acid base catalysis via a carbanion stabilization mechanism on the stereogenic  carbon atom of the amino acid stereochemical control in catalysis is achieved by means of a highly symmetric catalytic site that can accommodate both the l and d stereogenic centers of dap at the proximal site whereas specific interactions at the distal site require only the l configuration structural comparisons of the plant enzyme with its bacterial counterpart from haemophilus influenzae reveal significant conservation of amino acid residues around the active site that extends to their three dimensional structures and catalytic mechanism
