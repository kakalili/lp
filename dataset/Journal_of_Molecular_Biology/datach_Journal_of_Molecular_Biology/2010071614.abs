regulation of pkr by hcv ires rna importance of domain ii and ns a
protein kinase r pkr is an essential component of the innate immune response in the presence of double stranded rna dsrna  pkr is autophosphorylated which enables it to phosphorylate its substrate eukaryotic initiation factor   leading to translation cessation typical activators of pkr are long dsrnas produced during viral infection although certain other rnas can also activate a recent study indicated that full length internal ribosome entry site ires  present in the   untranslated region of hepatitis c virus hcv rna inhibits pkr while another showed that it activates we show here that both activation and inhibition by full length ires are possible the hcv ires has a complex secondary structure comprising four domains while it has been demonstrated that domains iii  iv activate pkr we report here that domain ii of the ires also potently activates structure mapping and mutational analysis of domain ii indicate that while the double stranded regions of the rna are important for activation loop regions contribute as well structural comparison reveals that domain ii has multiple non watson  crick features that mimic a form dsrna the canonical and noncanonical features of domain ii cumulate to a total of    unbranched base pairs the minimum length of dsrna required for pkr activation these results provide further insight into the structural basis of pkr activation by a diverse array of rna structural motifs that deviate from the long helical stretches found in traditional pkr activators activation of pkr by domain ii of the hcv ires has implications for the innate immune response when the other domains of the ires may be inaccessible we also study the ability of the hcv nonstructural protein a ns a to bind various domains of the ires and alter activation a model is presented for how domain ii of the ires and ns a operate to control host and viral translation during hcv infection
