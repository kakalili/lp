charged amino acids in a preprotein inhibit seca dependent protein translocation
sec translocase catalyzes membrane protein insertion and translocation we have introduced stretches of charged amino acid residues into the preprotein proompa and have analyzed their effect on in vitro protein translocation into escherichia coli inner membrane vesicles both negatively and positively charged amino acid residues inhibit translocation of proompa yielding a partially translocated polypeptide chain that blocks the translocation site and no longer activates preprotein stimulated seca atpase activity stretches of positively charged residues are much stronger translocation inhibitors and suppressors of the preprotein stimulated seca atpase activity than negatively charged residues these results indicate that both clusters of positively and negatively charged amino acids are poor substrates for the sec translocase and that this is reflected by their inability to stimulate the atpase activity of seca
