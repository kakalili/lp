thiol compounds inhibit the formation of amyloid fibrils by   microglobulin at neutral ph
dialysis related amyloidosis frequently develops in patients undergoing long term hemodialysis in which the major component of fibrils is   microglobulin   m  to prevent the disease it is important to stop the formation of fibrils   m has one disulfide bond which stabilizes the native structure and amyloid fibrils here the effects of reductants i e  dithiothreitol and cysteine on the formation of   m amyloid fibrils were examined at neutral ph fibrils were generated by three methods seed dependent ultrasonication induced and salt and heat induced fibrillation thioflavin t fluorescence electron microscopy and far uv circular dichroism revealed that the addition of reductants significantly inhibits seed dependent and ultrasonication induced fibrillation for salt and heat induced fibrillation where the solution of   m was strongly agitated formation of amyloid fibrils was markedly reduced in the presence of reductants although a small number of fibrils formed even after the reduction of the disulfide bond the results suggest that reductants such as cysteine and dithiothreitol would be useful for preventing the formation of   m amyloid fibrils under physiological conditions
