killing of trypanosoma brucei by concanavalin a structural basis of resistance in glycosylation mutants
concanavalin a con a kills procyclic insect forms of trypanosoma brucei by binding to n glycans on ep procyclin a major surface glycosyl phosphatidylinositol gpi anchored protein which is rich in glu pro repeats we have previously isolated and studied two procyclic mutants cona   and cona   that are more resistant than wild type wt to con a killing although both mutants express the same altered oligosaccharides compared to wt cells cona   is considerably more resistant to lectin killing than is cona   thus we looked for other alterations to account for the differences in sensitivity using mass spectrometry together with chemical and enzymatic treatments we found that both mutants express types of ep procyclin that are either poorly expressed or not found at all in wt cells cona   expresses mainly ep   a novel procyclin that contains  ep repeats is partially n glycosylated and bears hybrid type glycans on the other hand cona   cells express almost exclusively ep   a novel non glycosylated procyclin isoform with  ep repeats and no site for glycosylation the predominance of ep  in cona   cells explains their high resistance to cona killing thus switching the procyclin repertoire a process that could be relevant to parasite development in the insect vector modulates the sensitivity of trypanosomes to cytotoxic lectins
