methylarginines within the rgg motif region of hnrnp a affect its ires trans acting factor activity and are required for hnrnp a stress granule localization and formation
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a  hnrnp a  is a stress granule associated rna binding protein that plays a role in apoptosis and cellular stress recovery hnrnp a is a major non histone target of protein arginine methyltransferase  which asymmetrically dimethylates hnrnp a at several key arginine residues within its arginine  glycine  glycine rgg motif region although arginine methylation is known to regulate general rna binding of hnrnp a in vitro the functional role of arginine methylation in hnrnp a cytoplasmic activity is unknown to test the impact of key methylarginine residues on hnrnp a cytoplasmic activity and stress granule association cytoplasmically restricted flag tagged mutants of hnrnp a were generated in which key methylarginine residues within the rgg motif region were changed to either lysine or alanine lysine substitution which mimics unmethylated arginine resulted in a   increase in internal ribosome entry site trans acting factor itaf activity and the protein readily associates with stress granules alanine substitution resulted in a loss of itaf activity and reduced mrna binding the alanine mutant also displays reduced stress granule association and suppresses stress granule formation our data suggest that arginine residues within the rgg motif region are critical for hnrnp a cytoplasmic activities and that endogenous asymmetric dimethylation of the rgg motif region suppresses hnrnp a itaf activity in cells our findings indicate that methylarginine residues within the rgg motif region of hnrnp a are important for its cytoplasmic activities and that hypomethylation and or mutation of the rgg motif region may contribute to the role of hnrnp a in diseases such as cancer
