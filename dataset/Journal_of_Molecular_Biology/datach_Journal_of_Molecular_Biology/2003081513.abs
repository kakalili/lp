structural evidence for the interaction of c protein mybp c with actin and sequence identification of a possible actin binding domain
c protein mybp c is a myosin binding protein that is usually seen in two sets of seven to nine positions in the c zones in each half of the vertebrate striated muscle a band skeletal muscle c protein is a modular structure containing ten sub domains c to c  of which seven are immunoglobulin type domains and three c  c and c  are fibronectin like domains cardiac muscle c protein has an extra n terminal domain c  and also some sequence insertions one of which provides phosphorylation sites it is conceivable that c protein has both a structural and regulatory role within the sarcomere the precise mode of binding of c protein to the myosin filament has not been determined however detailed ultrastructural studies have suggested that c protein which binds to myosin can give rise to a longer periodicity about    than the intrinsic myosin filament repeat of    the reason for this has remained a puzzle for over  years here we show by modelling and computation that the presence of this longer periodicity could be explained if the myosin binding part of c protein binds to myosin with the expected    repeat but if there are systematic interactions of the n terminal end of c protein with the neighbouring actin filaments in the hexagonal lattice of filaments in the a band we also show that if they occur these interactions would probably only arise in defined muscle states further analysis of the mybp c sequence identifies a possible actin binding domain in the pro ala rich sequence found at the n terminus of skeletal mybp c and between domains c and c in the cardiac sequence
