structure based analysis of toxoplasma gondii profilin a parasite specific motif is required for recognition by toll like receptor
profilins promote actin polymerization by exchanging adp for atp on monomeric actin and delivering atp actin to growing filament barbed ends apicomplexan protozoa such as toxoplasma gondii invade host cells using an actin dependent gliding motility toll like receptor tlr   generates an innate immune response upon sensing t gondii profilin tgprf  the crystal structure of tgprf reveals a parasite specific surface motif consisting of an acidic loop followed by a long  hairpin a series of structure based profilin mutants show that tlr  recognition of the acidic loop is responsible for most of the interleukin il   secretion response to tgprf in peritoneal macrophages deletion of both the acidic loop and the  hairpin completely abrogates il  secretion insertion of the t gondii acidic loop and  hairpin into yeast profilin is sufficient to generate tlr  dependent signaling substitution of the acidic loop in tgprf with the homologous loop from the apicomplexan parasite cryptosporidium parvum does not affect tlr  dependent il  secretion while substitution with the acidic loop from plasmodium falciparum results in reduced but significant il  secretion we conclude that the parasite specific motif in tgprf is the key molecular pattern recognized by tlr  unlike other profilins tgprf slows nucleotide exchange on monomeric rabbit actin and binds rabbit actin weakly the putative tgprf actin binding surface includes the  hairpin and diverges widely from the actin binding surfaces of vertebrate profilins
