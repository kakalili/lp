cu zn superoxide dismutase without zn is folded but catalytically inactive
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been linked to the gain of aberrant function of superoxide dismutase cu zn sod upon protein misfolding the mechanism of sod misfolding is thought to involve mutations leading to the loss of zn followed by protein unfolding and aggregation we show that the removal of zn from sod may not lead to an immediate unfolding but immediately deactivates the enzyme through a combination of subtle structural and electronic effects using quantum mechanics discrete molecular dynamics we showed that both zn less wild type wt sod and its d  n mutant that does not bind zn have at least metastable folded states in those states the reduction potential of cu increases leading to the presence of detectable amounts of cu i instead of cu ii in the active site as confirmed experimentally the cu i protein cannot participate in the catalytic cu i  cu ii cycle however even without the full reduction to cu i  the cu site in the zn less variants of sod is shown to be catalytically incompetent unable to bind superoxide in a way comparable to the wt sod  the changes are more radical and different in the d  n zn less mutant than in the zn less wt sod  suggesting d  n being perhaps not the most adequate model for zn less sod  overall zn in sod appears to be influencing the cu site directly by adjusting its reduction potential and geometry thus the role of zn in sod is not just structural as was previously thought it is a vital part of the catalytic machinery
