residue resolved stability of full consensus ankyrin repeat proteins probed by nmr
we investigated the stability determinants and the unfolding characteristics of full consensus designed ankyrin repeat proteins darpins by nmr despite the repeating sequence motifs the resonances could be fully assigned using h  n  c triple labeled proteins to remove further ambiguities we attached paramagnetic spin labels to either end of these elongated proteins which attenuate the resonances of the spatially closest residues deuterium exchange experiments of darpins with two and three internal repeats between n and c terminal capping repeats ni c ni c and ni c mut  where the c cap had been reengineered indicate that the stability of the full consensus ankyrin repeat proteins is strongly dependent on the coupling between repeats as the stabilized cap decreases the exchange rate throughout the whole protein some amide protons require more than a year to exchange at    c highlighting the extraordinary stability of the proteins denaturant induced unfolding followed by deuterium exchange chemical shift change and heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effects is consistent with an ising type description of equilibrium folding for ni c mut  while for native state deuterium exchange we postulate local fluctuations to dominate exchange as unfolding events are too slow in these very stable proteins the location of extraordinarily slowly exchanging protons indicates a very stable core structure in the darpins that combines hydrophobic shielding with favorable electrostatic interactions these investigations help the understanding of repeat protein architecture and the further design of darpins for biomedical applications where high stability is required
