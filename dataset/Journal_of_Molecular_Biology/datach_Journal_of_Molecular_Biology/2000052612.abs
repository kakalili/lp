the crystal structure of the octamer r guauaca dc  with six watson crick base pairs and two   overhang residues edited by d rees
the crystal structure of an alternating rna octamer r guauaca dc rna bases are in lower case while the only dna base is in upper case  with two   overhang residues one of them a terminal deoxycytosine and the other a ribose adenine has been determined at    resolution the refined structure has an rwork    and rfree     there are two independent duplexes molecules i and ii in the asymmetric unit cell a     b     and c       with space group p    instead of forming a blunt end duplex with two a  c mispairs and six watson crick base pairs the strands in the duplex slide towards the   direction forming a two base overhang radc and a six watson crick base paired duplex the duplexes are bent molecule i    molecule ii    and stack head to head to form a right handed superhelix the overhang residues are looped out and the penultimate adenines of the two residues at the top end a  are anti and at the bottom a  end are syn the syn adenine bases form minor groove a  g c base triples with c h   n hydrogen bonds the anti adenine in molecule ii also forms a triple and a different c h   n hydrogen bond while the other anti adenine in molecule i does not it stacks on the looped out overhang base dc the   terminal deoxycytosines form two stacked hemiprotonated trans d c c  base pairs and the pseudo dyad related molecules form four consecutive deoxyribose and ribose zipper hydrogen bonds in the minor groove
