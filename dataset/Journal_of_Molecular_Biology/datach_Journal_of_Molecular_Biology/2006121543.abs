characterization of mobr the  hydroxybenzoate responsive transcriptional regulator for the  hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase gene of comamonas testosteroni kh   s
comamonas testosteroni kh   s is an aerobic soil bacterium that utilizes  hydroxybenzoate as a sole carbon and energy source in this strain  hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase moba acts on the initial step of the degradation to produce   dihydroxybenzoate which is subsequently subjected to the meta cleavage pathway leading to tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates gene walking analysis of the upstream region of moba revealed an open reading frame mobr that encodes a transcriptional regulator of the marr family here we report that mobr negatively regulates the expression of moba and that the repression is relieved by binding of  hydroxybenzoate the substrate for moba a primer extension experiment was performed to determine the transcription start site for moba and identified it at   bp upstream of the moba start codon accompanied by a typical   type promoter the mobr gene was expressed in escherichia coli cells and the recombinant product was purified to homogeneity gel mobility shift assays and dnase i footprinting analyses indicated that mobr binds as a homodimer to an imperfect inverted repeat within the moba mobr intergenic region with an apparent dissociation constant of       nm the operator site is located between the start codon and the promoter region for moba suggesting that mobr functions as a transcriptional repressor for moba expression the results of effector binding assays indicated that mobr but not its isomers  hydroxybenzoate and salicylate is released from the operator site by the addition of  hydroxybenzoate this dissociation process is highly cooperative with a hill coefficient of    in addition cd spectroscopic studies demonstrated that mobr adopts two conformational states corresponding to the effector bound and unbound forms these results suggest that the mobr dimer possesses at least two effector binding sites and that the effector binding to mobr induces an allosteric conformational change required for dissociation of the protein  dna complex
