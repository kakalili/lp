the formation of a potential spring in the ribosome
time dependent chemical modification and cleavage results have provided intriguing insights into structural changes that occur in the distal loop of helix  in  s ribosomal rna rrna  located distant from the decoding region between proteins s  and s  the results of this study suggest that this region of rrna may act as a buffer or a spring between these two proteins during protein biosynthesis during the assembly process protein s  apparently produces the major structural deformations in this region causing it to be folded in a spring like structure base c  in this region shows erratic behavior during assembly and also shows time dependent enhancement when elongation factor g with gtp is added to  s ribosomes evidence is presented to suggest that this region of rrna may be used to allow relative motion to occur between proteins s  and s  during translocation
