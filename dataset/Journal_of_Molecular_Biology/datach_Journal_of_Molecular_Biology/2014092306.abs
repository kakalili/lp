adaptive remodelling by flin in the bacterial rotary motor
sensory adaptation in the escherichia coli chemosensory pathway has been the subject of interest for decades with investigation focusing on the receptors that process extracellular inputs recent studies demonstrate that the flagellar motors responsible for cell locomotion also play a role adding or subtracting flim subunits to maximise sensitivity to pathway signals it is difficult to reconcile this flim remodelling with the observation that partner flin subunits are relatively static fixtures in the motor by fusing a fluorescent protein internally to flin we show that there is in fact significant flin remodelling the kinetics and stoichiometry of flin in steady state and in adapting motors are investigated and found to match the behaviour of flim in all respects except for timescale where flin rates are about  times slower we notice that motor adaptation is slower in the presence of the fluorescent protein indicating a possible source for the difference the behaviour of flim and flin is consistent with a kinetic and stoichiometric model that contradicts the traditional view of a packed rigid motor architecture
