A library of random mutations in Xenopus ribosomal protein L5 was generated by error-prone PCR and used to delineate the binding domain for 5S rRNA. All but one of the amino acid substitutions that affected binding affinity are clustered in the central region of the protein. Several of the mutations are conservative substitutions of non-polar amino acid residues that are unlikely to form energetically significant contacts to the RNA. Thermal denaturation, monitored by circular dichroism (CD), indicates that L5 is not fully structured and association with 5S rRNA increases the tm of the protein by 16 °C. L5 induces changes in the CD spectrum of 5S rRNA, establishing that the complex forms by a mutual induced fit mechanism. Deuterium exchange reveals that a considerable amount of L5 is unstructured in the absence of 5S rRNA. The fluorescence emission of W266 provides evidence for structural changes in the C-terminal region of L5 upon binding to 5S rRNA; whereas, protection experiments demonstrate that the N terminus remains highly sensitive to protease digestion in the complex. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of L5 by the program PONDR predicts that the N and C-terminal regions of L5 are intrinsically disordered, but that the central region, which contains three essential tyrosine residues and other residues important for binding to 5S rRNA, is likely to be structured. Initial interaction of the protein with 5S rRNA likely occurs through this region, followed by induced folding of the C-terminal region. The persistent disorder in the N-terminal domain is possibly exploited for interactions between the L5–5S rRNA complex and other proteins.
