The structural changes of bacteriorhodopsin during its photochemical cycle, as revealed by crystal structures of trapped intermediates, have provided insights to the proton translocation mechanism. Because accumulation of the last photointermediate, O, appears to be hindered by lattice forces in the crystals, the only information about the structure of this state is from suggested analogies with the determined structures of the non-illuminated D85S mutant and wild-type bacteriorhodopsin at low pH. We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of site-directed spin labels at the extracellular protein surface in membranes to test these models. Spin–spin dipolar interactions in the authentic O state compared to the non-illuminated state revealed that the distance between helices C and F increases by ca 4 Å, there is no distance change between helices D and F, and the distance between helix D and helix B of the adjacent monomer increases. Further, the mobility changes of single labels indicate that helices E and F move outward from the proton channel at the center of the protein, and helix D tilts inward. The overall pattern of movements suggests that the model at acid pH is a better representation of the O state than D85S. However, the mobility analysis of spin-labels on the B–C interhelical loop indicates that the antiparallel β-sheet maintains its ordered secondary structure in O, instead of the predicted disorder in the two structural models. During decay of the O state, the last step of the photocycle, a proton is transferred from Asp85 to proton release complex in the extracellular proton channel. The structural changes in O suggest the need of large conformational changes to drive the Arg82 side-chain back to its initial orientation towards Asp85, and to rearrange the numerous water molecules in this region in order to conduct the proton away from Asp85.
