mixed oligomer formation between human  a crystallin and its cataract causing g r mutant structural stability and functional differences
mutation of the glycine  residue to arginine in  a crystallin has been shown to cause presenile cataract in an indian family our earlier study showed that the mutant protein exhibits folding defects that lead to aggregation and inclusion body formation in escherichia coli despite the presence of a normal copy the pathology is seen in the heterozygous individuals formation of mixed oligomers between wild type and the mutant subunits might be crucial for manifestation of such dominant negative character we have investigated the role of g r mutation in  a crystallin in its structural stability and subunit exchange g r  a crystallin unfolds at lower concentrations of urea compared to wild type  a crystallin the mutant protein is more susceptible to proteolysis than the wild type protein and transiently populates fragments that are prone to aggregation subunit exchange studies using fluorescence resonance energy transfer show that the mutant protein forms mixed oligomers with the wild type protein the mutant protein is more susceptible to thermal aggregation whereas mixed oligomer formation leads to a decreased propensity to aggregate co expression of wild type  a crystallin with g r  a crystallin in e coli rescues the mutant  a crystallin from formation of inclusion bodies these observations may underlie the molecular basis for the presenile onset not congenital cataract in spite of severe folding defect and aggregation of the mutant our study shows that the mixed oligomers of wild type and g r  a crystallin exhibit properties dominated by those of the mutant protein in structural aspects oligomeric size urea induced unfolding and more importantly the chaperone activity which may provide the molecular basis for presenile cataract formation in affected individuals
