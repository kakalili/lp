membrane structure of ctra  a copper transporting p type atpase from aquifex aeolicus
we have produced and characterized two new copper transporting atpases ctra and ctra from aquifex aeolicus that belong to the family of heavy metal ion transporting pib type atpases ctra has a cpc metal binding sequence in tm and a cxxc metal binding n terminal domain while ctra has a cph metal binding motif in tm and a histidine rich n terminal metal binding domain we have cloned both copper pumps expressed them in escherichia coli and characterized them functionally ctra is activated by ag and cu and presumably transports reduced cu  while ctra is activated by and presumably transports the oxidized copper ion both ctra and ctra are thermophilic proteins with an activity maximum at    c electron cryomicroscopy of two dimensional crystals of ctra yielded a projection map at     resolution with density peaks indicating eight membrane spanning  helices per monomer a fit of the ca atpase structure to the projection map indicates that the arrangement of the six central helices surrounding the ion binding site in the membrane is conserved and suggests the position of the two additional n terminal transmembrane helices that are characteristic of the heavy metal eight helix p b type atpases
