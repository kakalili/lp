evolution of protein binding modes in homooligomers
the evolution of protein interactions cannot be deciphered without a detailed analysis of interaction interfaces and binding modes we performed a large scale study of protein homooligomers in terms of their symmetry interface sizes and conservation of binding modes we also focused specifically on the evolution of protein binding modes from nine families of homooligomers and mapped  different binding modes and oligomerization states onto the phylogenetic trees of these families we observed a significant tendency for the same binding modes to be clustered together and conserved within clades on phylogenetic trees this trend is especially pronounced for close homologs with   sequence identity or higher some binding modes are conserved among very distant homologs pointing to their ancient evolutionary origin while others are very specific for a certain phylogenetic group moreover we found that the most ancient binding modes have a tendency to involve symmetrical isologous homodimer binding arrangements with larger interfaces while recently evolved binding modes more often exhibit asymmetrical arrangements and smaller interfaces
