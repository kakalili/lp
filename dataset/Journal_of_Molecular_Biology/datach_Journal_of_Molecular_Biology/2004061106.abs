unification of the folding mechanisms of non two state and two state proteins
we have collected the kinetic folding data for non two state and two state globular proteins reported in the literature and investigated the relationships between the folding kinetics and the native three dimensional structure of these proteins the rate constants of formation of both the intermediate and the native state of non two state folders were found to be significantly correlated with protein chain length and native backbone topology which is represented by the absolute contact order and sequence distant native pairs the folding rate of two state folders which is known to be correlated with the native backbone topology apparently does not correlate significantly with protein chain length on the basis of a comparison of the folding rates of the non two state and two state folders it was found that they are similarly dependent on the parameters that reflect the native backbone topology this suggests that the mechanisms behind non two state and two state folding are essentially identical the present results lead us to propose a unified mechanism of protein folding in which folding occurs in a hierarchical manner reflecting the hierarchy of the native three dimensional structure as embodied in the case of non two state folding with an accumulation of the intermediate apparently two state folding is merely a simplified version of hierarchical folding caused either by an alteration in the rate limiting step of folding or by destabilization of the intermediate
