structural basis of the water assisted asparagine recognition by asparaginyl trna synthetase
asparaginyl trna synthetase asnrs is a member of the class ii aminoacyl trna synthetases and is responsible for catalyzing the specific aminoacylation of trnaasn with asparagine here the crystal structure of asnrs from pyrococcus horikoshii complexed with asparaginyl adenylate asn amp  was determined at     resolution and those of free asnrs and asnrs complexed with an asn amp analog asn sa were solved at   and     resolutions respectively all of the crystal structures have many solvent molecules which form a network of hydrogen bonding interactions that surrounds the entire asnrs molecule in the asnrs asn amp complex or the asnrs asn sa  one side of the bound asn amp or asn sa is completely covered by the solvent molecules which complement the binding site in particular two of these water molecules were found to interact directly with the asparagine amide and carbonyl groups respectively and to contribute to the formation of a pocket highly complementary to the asparagine side chain thus these two water molecules appear to play a key role in the strict recognition of asparagine and the discrimination against aspartic acid by the asnrs this water assisted asparagine recognition by the asnrs strikingly contrasts with the fact that the aspartic acid recognition by the closely related aspartyl trna synthetase is achieved exclusively through extensive interactions with protein amino acid residues furthermore based on a docking model of asnrs and trna a single arginine residue arg  in the asnrs was postulated to be involved in the recognition of the third position of the trnaasn anticodon u   we performed a mutational analysis of this particular arginine residue and confirmed its significance in the trna recognition
