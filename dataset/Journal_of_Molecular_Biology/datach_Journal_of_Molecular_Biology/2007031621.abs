the rgg domain of npl p recruits sky p through docking interactions
the sr protein kinase in yeast sky p phosphorylates yeast sr like protein npl p at a single serine residue located at its c terminus we report here the x ray crystal structure of sky p bound to a substrate peptide and adp surprisingly an npl p derived substrate peptide occupies a groove    away from the kinase active site in vitro studies support the substrate docking role of this groove mutagenesis and binding studies reveal that multiple degenerate short peptide motifs located within the rgg domain of npl p serve as the substrate docking motifs however a single docking motif is sufficient for its stable interaction with the kinase methylation of the docking motifs abolishes kinase binding and phosphorylation of npl p remarkably removal of the docking groove in the kinase or the docking motifs of the substrate does not reduce the overall catalytic efficiency of the phosphorylation reaction in any significant manner we suggest that docking interaction between sky p and npl p is essential for substrate recruitment and binding specificity
