global network analysis of lipid raft related proteins reveals their centrality in the network and their roles in multiple biological processes
lipid rafts are specialized cholesterol enriched microdomains in the cell membrane they have been known as a platform for protein  protein interactions and to take part in multiple biological processes nevertheless how lipid rafts influence protein properties at the proteomic level is still an open question for researchers using traditional biochemical approaches here by annotating the lipid raft localization of proteins in human protein  protein interaction networks we performed a systematic analysis of the function of proteins related to lipid rafts our results demonstrated that lipid raft proteins and their interactions were critical for the structure and stability of the whole network and that the interactions between them were significantly enriched furthermore for each protein in the network we calculated its  lipid raft dependency lrd   which indicates how close it is topologically associated with lipid rafts and we then uncovered the connection between lrd and protein functions proteins with high lrd tended to be essential for mammalian development and malfunction of these proteins was inclined to cause human diseases coordinated with their neighbors high lrd proteins participated in multiple biological processes and targeted many pathways in diseases pathogenesis high lrd proteins were also found to have tissue specificity of expression in summary our network based analysis denotes that lipid raft proteins have higher centrality in the network and that lipid raft related proteins have multiple functions and are probably concerned with many biological processes in disease development
