use of intrinsic binding energy for catalysis by a cofactor independent dna enzyme edited by i tinoco
the concept of the circe effect according to which an enzyme  s substrate binding energy is utilized to destabilize the substrate towards the reaction transition state has been shown to be a relevant catalytic strategy for naturally occurring protein enzymes and for two ribozymes that use nucleotide based substrates and metal ion cofactors we wished to investigate whether such a catalytic strategy extends even to divergent and unevolved catalysts constructed from biopolymers we examined the properties of a small in vitro selected and cofactor independent dna enzyme ps m which catalyzes porphyrin metallation the metallation reaction is unique in that the energies for binding and for metallation of both the substrate and of a transition state analogue tsa can be measured we report that ps m originally selected for binding to the tsa displays the circe effect in channeling a significant component of entropy rich  intrinsic  binding energy to distort and to alter the basicity of the bound substrate the study demonstrates that nucleic acids are by themselves capable of creating active sites for the catalysis of chemical reactions involving non nucleotide substrates furthermore the study of the metallation of the tsa provides a quantitative estimate of the effectiveness of such a compound in mimicking the true transition state for porphyrin metallation
