characterisation of the role of zinc in the hepatitis c virus ns  auto cleavage and ns protease activities
cleavage of the hepatitis c virus polyprotein between the non structural ns and ns proteins is mediated by a poorly characterised auto proteolytic activity that maps to the c terminus of ns and the n terminus of ns  but is distinct from the ns protease activity responsible for downstream cleavages in the polyprotein we have exploited the fact that the minimal precursor residues      of the hcv polyprotein can be expressed as an insoluble protein in escherichia coli and subsequently refolded into a form active for both auto cleavage and ns protease activity to further characterise the ns  auto cleavage activity we show that both activities are zinc dependent and show an absolute requirement for cysteine residues      and   within ns  in contrast cysteine   within ns  is only required for ns  auto cleavage activity and histidine   is only required for ns activity although the complete ns protease domain including the c terminal alpha helix is required for ns  auto cleavage the activity of the ns protease is not essential lastly we show that the ns  auto cleavage activity is more sensitive to zinc chelation by   phenanthroline than the ns protease activity this observation is consistent with different conformations of the precursor competent for either ns  auto cleavage or ns protease activity these two conformations can be distinguished by their relative strength and geometry of zinc coordination
