conformer selection and induced fit in flexible backbone protein  protein docking using computational and nmr ensembles
accommodating backbone flexibility continues to be the most difficult challenge in computational docking of protein  protein complexes towards that end we simulate four distinct biophysical models of protein binding in rosettadock a multiscale monte carlo based algorithm that uses a quasi kinetic search process to emulate the diffusional encounter of two proteins and to identify low energy complexes the four binding models are as follows   key lock kl model using rigid backbone docking   conformer selection cs model using a novel ensemble docking algorithm   induced fit if model using energy gradient based backbone minimization and   combined conformer selection induced fit cs if model backbone flexibility was limited to the smaller partner of the complex structural ensembles were generated using rosetta refinement methods and docking consisted of local perturbations around the complexed conformation using unbound component crystal structures for a set of  target complexes the lowest energy structure contained gt   of the native residue  residue contacts for      and  targets for kl cs if and cs if docking respectively when applied to  targets using nuclear magnetic resonance ensembles of the smaller protein the lowest energy structure recovered at least   native residue contacts in     and  targets for kl cs if and cs if docking respectively cs if docking of the nuclear magnetic resonance ensemble performed equally well or better than kl docking with the unbound crystal structure in  of  cases the marked success of cs and cs if docking shows that ensemble docking can be a versatile and effective method for accommodating conformational plasticity in docking and serves as a demonstration for the cs theory  that binding competent conformers exist in the unbound ensemble and can be selected based on their favorable binding energies
