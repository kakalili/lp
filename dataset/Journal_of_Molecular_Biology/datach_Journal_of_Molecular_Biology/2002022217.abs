the c terminal domains of the rna polymerase  subunits contact site with fis and localization during co activation with crp at the escherichia coli prop p promoter edited by m gottesman
fis is a versatile transactivator that functions at many different promoters fis activates transcription at the rpos dependent prop p promoter when bound to a site that overlaps the    hexamer by a mechanism that requires the c terminal domain of the  subunit of rna polymerase  ctd  the region on fis responsible for activating transcription through the  ctd has been localized to a short  turn near the dna binding determinant on one subunit of the fis homodimer we report here that fis dependent activation of prop p transcription requires two discrete regions on the  ctd one region consisting of residues      and      mediates dna binding a second patch comprising amino acid residues      forms a ridge on the surface of the  ctd that we propose interacts with fis the accompanying paper shows that these same regions on  ctd are utilized for transcriptional activation at the rrnb and rrne p promoters by fis bound to a site upstream of the core promoter centered at        in addition to stimulation of prop p transcription by fis crp co activates this promoter when bound to a remote site upstream from the promoter centered at      rna polymerase preparations lacking one  ctd of the  dimer were employed to demonstrate that the    associated  iictd was utilized preferentially by fis at prop p in the presence and absence of crp these experiments define the overall architecture of the prop p initiation complex where fis and crp each function through a different  ctd
