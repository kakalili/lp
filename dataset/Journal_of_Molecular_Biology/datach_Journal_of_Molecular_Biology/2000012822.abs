dna induced  helix capping in conserved linker sequences is a determinant of binding affinity in cys his zinc fingers edited by f e cohen
high affinity sequence specific dna binding by cys his zinc finger proteins is mediated by both specific protein base interactions and non specific contacts between charged side chains and the phosphate backbone in addition in dna complexes of multiple zinc fingers protein protein interactions between the finger units contribute to the binding affinity we present nmr evidence for another contribution to high affinity binding a highly specific dna induced helix capping involving residues in the linker sequence between fingers capping at the c terminus of the  helix in each zinc finger incorporating a consensus tgekp linker sequence that follows each finger provides substantial binding energy to the dna complexes of zinc fingers    of tfiiia zf    and the four zinc fingers of the wilms  tumor suppressor protein wt    the same  helix c capping motif is observed in the x ray structures of four other protein dna complexes the structures of each of the tgekp linkers in these complexes can be superimposed on the linker sequences in the zf   complex revealing a remarkable similarity in both backbone and side chain conformations the canonical linker structures from the zinc finger dna complexes have been compared to the nmr structure of the tgekp linker connecting fingers  and  in zf   in the absence of dna this comparison reveals that additional stabilization likely arises in the dna complexes from hydrogen bonding between the backbone amide of e and the side chain o  of t in the linker we suggest that these dna induced c capping interactions provide a means whereby the multiple finger complex which must necessarily be domain flexible in the unbound state as it searches for the correct dna sequence can be  snap locked  in place once the correct dna sequence is encountered these observations provide a rationale for the high conservation of the tgekp linker sequences in cys his zinc finger proteins
