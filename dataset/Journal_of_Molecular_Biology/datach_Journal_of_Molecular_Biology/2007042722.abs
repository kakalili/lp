kinetic and structural characterisation of escherichia coli nitroreductase mutants showing improved efficacy for the prodrug substrate cb
escherichia coli nitroreductase ntr is a flavoprotein that reduces a variety of quinone and nitroaromatic substrates among these substrates is the prodrug  aziridin  yl   dinitrobenzamide cb   that is activated by ntr to form two products one of which is highly cytotoxic ntr in combination with cb   has entered clinical trials for virus directed enzyme  prodrug therapy of cancer enhancing the catalytic efficiency of ntr for cb   is likely to improve the therapeutic potential of this system we previously identified a number of mutants at six positions around the active site of ntr that showed enhanced sensitisation to cb   in an e coli cell killing assay in this study we have purified improved mutants at each of these positions and determined their steady state kinetic parameters for cb   and for the antibiotic nitrofurazone we have also made a double mutant combining two of the most beneficial single mutations all the mutants show enhanced specificity constants for cb   and apart from n s the enhancement is selective for cb   over nitrofurazone one mutant t l also shows an increase in selectivity for reducing the  nitro group of cb   rather than the  nitro group we have determined the three dimensional structures of selected mutants bound to the substrate analogue nicotinic acid using x ray crystallography the n s mutation affects interactions of the fmn cofactor while mutations at t  and f  affect the interactions with nicotinic acid the structure of double mutant n s f  k combines the effects of the two individual single mutations but it gives a greater selective enhancement of activity with cb   over nitrofurazone than either of these and the highest specificity constant for cb   of all the mutations studied
