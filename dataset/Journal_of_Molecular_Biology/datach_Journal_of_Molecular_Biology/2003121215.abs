the crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of the glycoprotein sorting receptor p  ergic  reveals an unpredicted metal binding site and conformational changes associated with calcium ion binding
p  ergic  is a calcium dependent animal lectin that acts as a cargo receptor binding to a set of glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum er and transporting them to the golgi complex it is similar in structure to calcium dependent leguminous lectins we have determined the structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of p  ergic  in its calcium bound form the structure reveals localized but large conformational changes in relation to the previously determined metal ion free structure mapping mostly to the ligand binding site it reveals the presence of two calcium ion binding sites located   apart one of which has no equivalent in the plant lectins the second metal ion binding site present in that class of lectins binding mn  is absent from p  ergic   the absence of a short loop in the ligand binding site in this protein suggests that it has adapted to optimally bind the high mannose man glcnac  glycan common to glycoproteins at the er exit stage
