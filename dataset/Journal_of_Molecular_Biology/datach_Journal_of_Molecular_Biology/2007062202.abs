structure of the fh domain of daam  implications for formin regulation of actin assembly
daam  dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis  is a diaphanous related formin first studied as a novel dishevelled binding protein and shown to be crucial for the planar cell polarity pcp pathway in xenopus daam  like other formins directs nucleation and elongation of new actin filaments using its conserved formin homology  fh  domain here we report the crystal structure of a large c terminal fragment of human daam containing the fh domain the structure determined at     resolution using the single wavelength anomalous diffraction sad phasing method reveals a  tethered dimer  architecture that is similar to that previously described for the fh domain of the yeast formin bni  which shares    sequence identity with daam  despite the overall similarity with the dimeric fh domain of bni and with a truncated monomeric structure of mdia  the daam fh structure reveals a number of differences in secondary structure elements and in the  lasso post  dimerization interface that may be functionally important most strikingly the two halves of the crystallographic dimer pack together in a manner that occludes their actin binding surfaces this  locked  conformation is stabilized by two novel interacting  strands formed by the ends of the linkers that connect the two sides of the dimer the daam fh domain has weak actin assembly activity as compared with other mammalian formins but mutations that disrupt the  strand lock increase activity about tenfold to a level comparable to other formins suggesting that this occluded conformation may represent an auto inhibited conformation of the daam fh domain
