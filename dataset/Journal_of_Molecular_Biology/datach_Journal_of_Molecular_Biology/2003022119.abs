functional sites in protein families uncovered via an objective and automated graph theoretic approach
we report a method for detection of recurring side chain patterns drespat using an unbiased and automated graph theoretic approach we first list all structural patterns as sub graphs where the protein is represented as a graph the patterns from proteins are compared pair wise to detect patterns common to a protein pair based on content and geometry criteria the recurring pattern is then detected using an automated search algorithm from the all against all pair wise comparison data of proteins intra protein pattern comparison data are used to enable detection of patterns recurring within a protein a method has been proposed for empirical calculation of statistical significance of recurring pattern the method was tested on  protein sets of varying size composed of non redundant representatives from scop superfamilies recurring patterns in serine proteases cysteine proteases lipases cupredoxin ferredoxin ferritin cytochrome c aspartoyl proteases peroxidases phospholipase a  endonuclease sh domain ef hand and lectins show additional residues conserved in the vicinity of the known functional sites on the basis of the recurring patterns in ferritin ef hand and lectins we could separate proteins or domains that are structurally similar yet different in metal ion binding characteristics in addition novel recurring patterns were observed in glutathione s transferase phospholipase a and ferredoxin with potential structural functional roles the results are discussed in relation to the known functional sites in each family between   and    patterns were enumerated from each protein with between ten and   patterns detected as common to an evolutionarily related protein pair our results show that unbiased extraction of functional site pattern is not feasible from an evolutionarily related protein pair but is feasible from protein sets comprising five or more proteins the drespat method does not require a user defined pattern size or location of the pattern and therefore has the potential to uncover new functional sites in protein families
