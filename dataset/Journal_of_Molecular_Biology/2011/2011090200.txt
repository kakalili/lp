We report a set of atomistic folding/unfolding simulations for the hairpin ribozyme using a Monte Carlo algorithm. The hairpin ribozyme folds in solution and catalyzes self-cleavage or ligation via a specific two-domain structure. The minimal active ribozyme has been studied extensively, showing stabilization of the active structure by cations and dynamic motion of the active structure. Here, we introduce a simple model of tertiary-structure formation that leads to a phase diagram for the RNA as a function of temperature and tertiary-structure strength. We then employ this model to capture many folding/unfolding events and to examine the transition-state ensemble (TSE) of the RNA during folding to its active “docked” conformation. The TSE is compact but with few tertiary interactions formed, in agreement with single-molecule dynamics experiments. To compare with experimental kinetic parameters, we introduce a novel method to benchmark Monte Carlo kinetic parameters to docking/undocking rates collected over many single molecular trajectories. We find that topology alone, as encoded in a biased potential that discriminates between secondary and tertiary interactions, is sufficient to predict the thermodynamic behavior and kinetic folding pathway of the hairpin ribozyme. This method should be useful in predicting folding transition states for many natural or man-made RNA tertiary structures.
