adaptable molecular interactions guide phosphorylation of the sr protein asf sf by srpk
the sr arginine serine rich protein asf sf  also called human alternative splicing factor  an essential splicing factor contains two functional modules consisting of tandem rna recognition motifs rrms rrm  rrm  and a c terminal arginine serine repeat region rs domain a domain rich in arginine serine repeats  the sr specific protein kinase srpk  phosphorylates the rs domain at multiple serines using a directional c terminal to n terminal and processive mechanism  a process that directs the sr protein to the nucleus and influences protein  protein interactions associated with splicing function to investigate how srpk accomplishes this feat the enzyme  substrate complex was analyzed using single turnover and multiturnover kinetic methods deletion studies revealed that while recognition of the rs domain by a docking groove on srpk is sufficient to initiate the processive and directional mechanism continued processive phosphorylation in the presence of building repulsive charge relies on the fine tuning of contacts with the rrm  rrm module an electropositive pocket in srpk that stabilizes newly phosphorylated serines enhanced processive phosphorylation of later serines these data indicate that srpk uses stable yet highly flexible protein  protein interactions to facilitate both early and late phases of the processive phosphorylation of sr proteins
