structural basis of importin  mediated nuclear transport for ku  and ku
ku  and ku  form a heterodimeric complex involved in multiple nuclear processes this complex plays a key role in dna repair due to its ability to bind dna double strand breaks and facilitate repair by the nonhomologous end joining pathway ku  and ku  have been proposed to contain bipartite and monopartite nuclear localization sequences nlss  respectively that allow them to be translocated to the nucleus independently of each other via the classical importin   imp  importin  mediated nuclear import pathway to determine the structural basis of the recognition of ku  and ku  proteins by imp  we solved the crystal structures of the complexes of imp  with the peptides corresponding to the ku  and ku  nlss our structural studies confirm the binding of the ku  nls as a classical monopartite nls but reveal an unexpected binding mode for ku  nls with only one basic cluster bound to the receptor both ku  and ku  therefore contain monopartite nlss and sequences outside the basic cluster make favorable interactions with imp  suggesting that this may be a general feature in monopartite nlss we show that the ku  nls has a higher affinity for imp  than the ku  nls consistent with more extensive interactions in its n terminal region the prospect of nuclear import of ku  and ku  independently of each other provides a powerful regulatory mechanism for the function of the ku  ku  heterodimer and independent functions of the two proteins
