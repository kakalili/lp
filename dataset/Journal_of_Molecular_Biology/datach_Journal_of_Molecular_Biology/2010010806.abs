structure dynamics and thermodynamics of the human centrin  hsfi complex
centrin an ef hand calcium binding protein has been shown to be involved in the duplication of centrosomes and sfi  suppressor of fermentation induced loss of stress resistance protein  is one of its centrosomal targets there are three isoforms of human centrin but here we only considered centrin  hscen  this protein has the ability to bind to any of the    repeats of human sfi  hsfi  with more or less affinity in this study we mainly focused on the  th repeat r  hsfi    which presents the highest level of similarity with a well studied  residue peptide p  xpc from human xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group c protein another centrin target for dna repair the only known structure of hscen was resolved in complex with p  xpc the  residue peptide r  hsfi   exhibits the motif l l w  which is the reverse of the xpc motif w l l  consequently the dipole of the helix formed by this motif has a reverse orientation we wished to ascertain the impact of this reversal on the structure dynamics and affinity of centrin to address this question we determined the structure of c hscen  the c terminal domain of hscen  t   y   in complex with r  hsfi   and monitored its dynamics by nmr after having verified that the n terminal domain of hscen does not interact with the peptide the structure shows that the binding mode is similar to that of p  xpc however we observed a    translation of the r  hsfi   helix along its axis inducing less anchorage in the protein and the disruption of a hydrogen bond between a tryptophan residue in the peptide and a well conserved nearby glutamate in c hscen  nmr dynamic studies of the complex strongly suggested the existence of an unusual calcium secondary binding mode in calcium binding loop iii made possible by the uncommon residue composition of this loop the secondary metal site is only populated at high calcium concentration and depends on the type of bound ligand
