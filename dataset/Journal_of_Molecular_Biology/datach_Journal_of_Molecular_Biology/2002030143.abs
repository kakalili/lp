trna   end maturation in archaea has eukaryotic features the rnase z from haloferax volcanii
here we report the first characterization and partial purification of an archaeal trna   processing activity the rnase z from haloferax volcanii the activity identified here is an endonuclease which cleaves trna precursors   to the discriminator thus trna   processing in archaea resembles the eukaryotic   processing pathway the archaeal rnase z has a kcl optimum at mm which is in contrast to the intracellular kcl concentration being as high as m kcl the archaeal rnase z does process   extended and intron containing pretrnas but with a much lower efficiency than   matured intronless pretrnas at least in vitro there is thus no defined order for   and   processing and splicing a heterologous precursor trna is cleaved efficiently by the archaeal rnase z experiments with precursors containing mutated trnas revealed that removal of the anticodon arm reduces cleavage efficiency only slightly while removal of d and t arm reduces processing effciency drastically even down to complete inhibition comparison with its nuclear and mitochondrial homologs revealed that the substrate specificity of the archaeal rnase z is narrower than that of the nuclear rnase z but broader than that of the mitochondrial rnase z
