serum dependent enhancement of coxsackievirus b induced production of ifn  il  and tnf  by peripheral blood mononuclear cells
only a few reports have been published on the interactions between coxsackievirus b  cvb  and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells pbmc but have not been extensively documented human serum containing non neutralizing anti cvb antibodies increased cvb induced synthesis of ifn  by pbmc in this study we determined if cvb and human serum have the ability to activate inflammatory cytokines in addition to ifn  in pbmc cultures pbmc from healthy donors were inoculated with infectious inactivated cvb or with cvb incubated with dilutions of human serum or polyvalent igg with anti cvb activity levels of ifn  tnf  il  il   ifn  and il  in the cell free supernatants of pbmc cultures were measured using elisa infection was assessed by real time pcr pbmc inoculated with cvb produced inflammatory cytokines but not ifn  when cvb was incubated with serum or igg ifn  was detected in the culture supernatants and high concentrations of tnf  and il  were measured the concentrations of tnf  and il  were not reduced in cultures inoculated with inactivated cvb  whereas the igg dependent enhancement of ifn  il  and tnf  production with inactivated virus was suppressed the potentiation of ifn  production was associated with a high intracellular viral load infectious and non infectious cvb can induce the production of inflammatory cytokines but not ifn  by pbmc high levels of ifn  in addition to tnf  and il  in culture supernatants were obtained when infectious cvb was combined with immune serum or igg and they were associated with high amounts of intracellular viral rna
