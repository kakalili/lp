insights into substrate binding and catalytic mechanism of human tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase tdp  from vanadate and tungstate inhibited structures
tyrosyl dna phosphodiesterase tdp  is a dna repair enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond between a tyrosine residue and a dna   phosphate the only known example of such a linkage in eukaryotic cells occurs normally as a transient link between a type ib topoisomerase and dna thus human tdp is thought to be responsible for repairing lesions that occur when topoisomerase i becomes stalled on the dna in the cell tdp has also been shown to remove glycolate from single stranded dna containing a   phosphoglycolate suggesting a role for tdp in repair of free radical mediated dna double strand breaks we report the three dimensional structures of human tdp bound to the phosphate transition state analogs vanadate and tungstate each structure shows the inhibitor covalently bound to his   confirming that this residue is the nucleophile in the first step of the catalytic reaction vanadate in the tdp vanadate structure has a trigonal bipyramidal geometry that mimics the transition state for hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond while tdp tungstate displays unusual octahedral coordination the presence of low occupancy tungstate molecules along the narrow groove of the substrate binding cleft is suggestive evidence that this groove binds ssdna in both cases glycerol from the cryoprotectant solution became liganded to the vanadate or tungstate inhibitor molecules in a bidentate   diol fashion these structural models allow predictions to be made regarding the specific binding mode of the substrate and the mechanism of catalysis
