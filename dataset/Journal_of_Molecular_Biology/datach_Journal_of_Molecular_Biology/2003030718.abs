structure and function of an archaeal homolog of survival protein e sure   an acid phosphatase with purine nucleotide specificity
the survival protein e sure family was discovered by its correlation to stationary phase survival of escherichia coli and various repair proteins involved in sustaining this and other stress response phenotypes in order to better understand this ancient and well conserved protein family we have determined the    resolution crystal structure of sure  from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon pyrobaculum aerophilum pae  this first structure of an archaeal sure reveals significant similarities to and differences from the only other known sure structure that from the eubacterium thermatoga maritima tma  both sure monomers adopt similar folds however unlike the tma sure dimer crystalline pae sure  is predominantly non domain swapped comparative structural analyses of tma and pae sure suggest conformationally variant regions such as a hinge loop that may be involved in domain swapping the putative sure active site is highly conserved and implies a model for sure bound to a potential substrate guanosine   monophosphate gmp  pae sure  has optimal acid phosphatase activity at temperatures above   c and is less specific than tma sure in terms of metal ion requirements substrate specificity also differs between pae and tma sure with a more specific recognition of purine nucleotides by the archaeal enzyme analyses of the sequences phylogenetic distribution and genomic organization of the sure family reveal examples of genomes encoding multiple sure genes and suggest that sure homologs constitute a broad family of enzymes with phosphatase like activities
