binding of argtx   in the nmda receptor ion channel
the n methyl d aspartate receptors nmdars constitute an important class of ligand gated cation channels that are involved in the majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the human brain compounds that bind in the nmdar ion channel and act as blockers are use and voltage dependent inhibitors of nmdar activity and have therapeutic potential for treatment of a variety of brain diseases or as pharmacological tools for studies of the neurobiological role of nmdars we have performed a kinetic analysis of the blocking mechanism of the prototypical polyamine toxin nmdar ion channel blocker argiotoxin   argtx   at recombinant glun  a receptors to provide detailed information on the mechanism of block the predicted binding site of argtx   is in the pore region of the nmdar ion channel formed by residues in the transmembrane m and the m pore loop segments of the glun and glun a subunits to assess the predicted binding mode in further detail we performed an alanine and glycine scanning mutational analysis of this pore loop segment to systematically probe the role of pore lining m residues in glun and glun a in the channel block by argtx   comparison of m positions in glun and glun a where mutation influences argtx   potency suggests differential contribution of the m loops of glun and glun a to binding of argtx   the results of the mutational analysis are highly relevant for the future structure based development of argiotoxin derived nmdar channel blockers
