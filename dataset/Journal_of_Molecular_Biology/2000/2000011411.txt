A high quality solution structure of the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitory N-terminal domain of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (N-TIMP-1) has been determined. For the rigidly packed residues, the average RMSD to the mean structure is 0.57 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.00 Å for all heavy atoms. Comparison of the solution structure of free N-TIMP-1 with the crystal structure of TIMP-1 bound to the catalytic domain of MMP-3 (Gomis-Rüth et al., 1997) shows that the structural core of the β barrel flanked by helices is nearly unchanged by the association with MMP-3, evident from a backbone RMSD of 1.15 Å. However, clear differences in the conformation of the MMP-binding ridge of free and MMP-bound TIMP-1 suggest induced fit throughout the ridge. The MMP-dependent conformational changes in the ridge include a dramatic bending of AB loop residues Glu28 through Leu34, moderate hinge bending of the CD-loop about residues Ala65 and Cys70, and modest bending of the Cys1 through Pro6 segment. A large number of interresidue Nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) augmented by stereospecific assignments, torsion restraints, and dipolar couplings (an average of 18 non-trivial restraints per residue) engender confidence in these structural inferences. A tight cluster of three lysine residues and one arginine residue atop β-strands A and B, and identical among TIMP sequences, form the heart of a highly conserved electropositive patch that may interact with anionic components of the extracellular matrix.
