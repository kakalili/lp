activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor involves a switch in conformation of the  subunits
the nicotinic acetylcholine ach receptor belongs to a superfamily of synaptic ion channels that open in response to the binding of chemical transmitters their mechanism of activation is not known in detail but a time resolved electron microscopic study of the muscle type ach receptor had suggested that a local disturbance in the ligand binding region and consequent rotations in the ligand binding  subunits connecting to the transmembrane portion are involved a more precise interpretation of this structural change is given here based on comparison of the extracellular domain of the ach receptor with an ach binding protein achbp to which a putative agonist is bound we find that to a good approximation there are two alternative extended conformations of the ach receptor subunits one characteristic of either  subunit before activation and the other characteristic of all three non  subunits and the protomer of achbp substitution in the three dimensional maps of  by non  subunits mimics the changes seen on activation suggesting that the structures of the  subunits are modified initially by their interactions with neighbouring subunits and switch to the non  form when ach binds this structural change which entails      rotations of the inner pore facing parts of the  subunits most likely acts as the trigger that opens the gate in the membrane spanning pore
