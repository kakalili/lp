the  scaffold of the lov domain of the brucella light activated histidine kinase is a key element for signal transduction
light  oxygen  voltage lov domains are blue light activated signaling modules present in a wide range of sensory proteins among them the histidine kinases are the largest group in prokaryotes lov hk  light modulates the virulence of the pathogenic bacteria brucella abortus through lov hk one of the striking characteristic of brucella lov hk is the fact that the protein remains activated upon light sensing without recovering the basal state in the darkness in contrast the light state of the isolated lov domain slowly returns to the dark state to gain insight into the light activation mechanism we have characterized by x ray crystallography and solution nmr spectroscopy the structure of the lov domain of lov hk in the dark state and explored its light induced conformational changes the lov domain adopts the    pas per arnt sim domain fold and binds the fmn cofactor within a conserved pocket the domain dimerizes through the hydrophobic  scaffold in an antiparallel way our results point to the  scaffold as a key element in the light activation validating a conserved structural basis for light to signal propagation in lov proteins
