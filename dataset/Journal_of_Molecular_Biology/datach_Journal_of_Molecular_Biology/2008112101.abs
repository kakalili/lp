the capsid of the small rna phage prr is stabilized by metal ions
many nonenveloped virus particles are stabilized by calcium ions bound in the interfaces between the protein subunits these ions may have a role in the disassembly process the small rna phages of the leviviridae family have t  quasi symmetry and are unique among simple viruses in that they have a coat protein with a translational repressor activity and a fold that has not been observed in other viruses the crystal structure of phage prr has been determined to     resolution the structure shows a tentative binding site for a calcium ion close to the quasi  fold axis the rna binding surface used for repressor activity is mostly conserved the structure does not show any significant differences between quasi equivalent subunits which suggests that the assembly is not controlled by conformational switches as in many other simple viruses
