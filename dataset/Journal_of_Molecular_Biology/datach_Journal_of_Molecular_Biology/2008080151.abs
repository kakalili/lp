effects of familial alzheimer  s disease mutations on the folding nucleation of the amyloid  protein
the effect of single amino acid substitutions associated with the italian e k  arctic e g  dutch e q and iowa d n familial forms of alzheimer s disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy on the structure of the     fragment of the alzheimer amyloid  protein a  is investigated by replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations the     segment has been shown in our earlier work to adopt a bend structure in solution that may serve as the folding nucleation site for a  our simulations reveal that the     bend motif is retained in all e  mutants suggesting that mutations involving residue e  may not affect the structure of the folding nucleation site of a  enhanced aggregation in a  with familial alzheimer s disease substitutions may result from the depletion of the e   k  salt bridge which destabilizes the bend structure alternately the e  mutations may affect longer range interactions outside the     segment that can impact the aggregation of a  substituting at residue d  on the other hand leads to the formation of a turn rather than a bend motif implying that in contrast to e  mutants the d n mutant may affect monomer a  folding and subsequent aggregation our simulations suggest that the mechanisms by which e  and d  mutations affect the folding and aggregation of a  are fundamentally different
