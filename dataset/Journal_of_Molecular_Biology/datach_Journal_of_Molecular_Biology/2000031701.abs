variable zinc coordination in endostatin edited by r huber
endostatin is a proteolytic fragment of collagen xviii that potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumour growth human endostatin contains a zinc ion bound near the n terminus which was not observed in the original structure of mouse endostatin at ph  controversial data exist on the role of this zinc ion in the anti tumour activity we report two new crystal structures of mouse endostatin at ph   with bound zinc one crystal form shows a metal ion coordination similar to that in human endostatin his   his   his   asp   but the conformation of the n terminal segment is different in the other crystal form asp  replaces his  as a zinc ligand site directed mutagenesis of zinc binding residues demonstrates that both coordination geometries occur in solution the large degree of structural heterogeneity of the zinc binding site has implications for endostatin function we conclude that zinc is likely to play a structural rather than a critical functional role in endostatin
