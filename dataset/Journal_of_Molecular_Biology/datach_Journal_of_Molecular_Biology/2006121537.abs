antibody buffering in the brain
the efficacy of chemotherapy on brain tumors is often hindered by the presence of the blood brain barrier this barrier keeps many systemically administered substances from entering the cerebrospinal fluid csf  while allowing intrathecally administered drugs free passage out of that compartment therefore achieving a therapeutic concentration of a cell cycle inhibitor in the csf for a time long enough to have a cytotoxic effect on slow growing tumor cells has proven difficult the ability of an antibody to prolong ligand half life and bioactivity has been previously described occurring in the plasma this phenomenon has not yet been described or exploited for use in the csf compartment antibodies often have a longer residence time in the csf than small molecule drugs so antibody buffering administration of a drug with its specific antibody can prolong the bioactive lifetime of a drug in the csf here we describe antibody buffering of the small molecule hapten  phenyl oxazol  one methylene  amino butyrate in the csf of a rats not only does the presence of an antibody buffer increase the half life of both total and free hapten in the csf but the antibody can be re charged in situ with fresh hapten even days after the initial antibody infusion antibody buffering may provide a viable option for delivering a stable bio available concentration of a drug that is normally rapidly eliminated from the csf
