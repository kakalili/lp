mouse dnmt a preferentially methylates linker dna and is inhibited by histone h
in mammals dna methylation is crucial for embryonic development and germ cell differentiation the dna methylation patterns are created by de novo type dna methyltransferases dnmts  a and b dnmt a is crucial for global methylation including that of imprinted genes in germ cells in eukaryotic nuclei genomic dna is packaged into multinucleosomes with linker histone h  which binds to core nucleosomes simultaneously making contacts in the linker dna that separates adjacent nucleosomes in the present study we prepared oligonucleosomes from hela nuclei with or without linker histone h and used them as a substrate for dnmt a removal of histone h enhanced the dna methylation activity furthermore dnmt a preferentially methylated the linker between the two nucleosome core regions of reconstituted dinucleosomes and the binding of histone h inhibited the dna methylation activity of dnmt a towards the linker dna since an identical amount of histone h did not inhibit the activity towards naked dna the inhibitory effect of histone h was not on the dnmt a catalytic activity but on its preferential location in the linker dna of the dinucleosomes the central globular domain and c terminal tail of the histone h molecule were indispensable for inhibition of the dna methylation activity of dnmt a we propose that the binding and release of histone h from the linker portion of chromatin may regulate the local dna methylation of the genome by dnmt a which is expressed ubiquitously in somatic cells in vivo
