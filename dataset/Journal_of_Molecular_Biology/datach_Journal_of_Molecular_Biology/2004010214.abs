crystal structure of the rlud pseudouridine synthase catalytic module an enzyme that modifies  s rrna and is essential for normal cell growth of escherichia coli
pseudouridine    d ribofuranosyluracil   is the most commonly found modified base in rna conversion of uridine to  is performed enzymatically in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes by pseudouridine synthases ec      the escherichia coli  synthase rlud modifies uridine to  at positions      and   within  s rrna rlud also possesses a second function related to proper assembly of the  s ribosomal subunit that is independent of  synthesis here we report the crystal structure of the catalytic module of rlud residues       rlud refined at    to a final r factor of    rfree      rlud is a monomeric enzyme having an overall mixed    fold the  rlud molecule consists of two subdomains a catalytic subdomain and c terminal subdomain with the rna binding cleft formed by loops extending from the catalytic sub domain the catalytic sub domain of  rlud has a similar fold as in trua trub and rsua with the location of the rna binding cleft active site and conserved catalytic asp residue superposing in all four structures superposition of the crystal structure of trub bound to a t stem loop with rlud reveals that similar rna  protein interactions for the flipped out uridine base would exist in both structures implying that base flipping is necessary for catalysis this observation also implies that the specificity determinants for site specific rna binding and recognition likely reside in parts of rlud beyond the active site
