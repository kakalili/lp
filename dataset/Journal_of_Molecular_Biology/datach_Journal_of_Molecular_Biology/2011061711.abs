the nmr structure of flik the trigger for the switch of substrate specificity in the flagellar type iii secretion apparatus
the flagellar cytoplasmic protein flik controls hook elongation by two successive events by determining hook length and by stopping the supply of hook protein these two distinct roles are assigned to different parts of flik the n terminal half flikn determines length and the c terminal half flikc switches secretion from the hook protein to the filament protein the interaction of flikc with flhb the switchable secretion gate triggers the switch by nmr spectroscopy we demonstrated that flik is largely unstructured and determined the structure of a compact domain in flikc the compact domain denoted the flikc core domain consists of two  helices a  sheet with two parallel and two antiparallel strands and several exposed loops based on the functional data obtained by a series of deletion mutants of the flikc core domain we constructed a model of the complex between the flikc core domain and flhbc the model suggested that one of the flikc loops has a high probability of interacting with the c terminal domain of flhb flhbc as the flik molecule enters the secretion gate we suggest that the autocleaved npth sequence in flhb contacts loop  of flikc to trigger the switching event this contact is sterically prevented when npth is not cleaved thus the structure of flik provides insight into the mechanism by which this bifunctional protein triggers a switch in the export of substrates
