a mitotic kinase topk enhances cdk cyclin b dependent phosphorylation of prc and promotes cytokinesis
a mapkk like mitotic kinase topk implies the formation of mitotic spindles and spindle midzone and accomplishing cytokinesis however its underlying mechanism remains unclear a microtubule bundling protein prc  plays a pivotal role in the formation of mitotic spindles and spindle midzone because of their functional resemblance we attempted to clarify the links between these two molecules topk supported mitotic advance via the cdk cyclin b dependent phosphorylation of prc  topk induced the phosphorylation of prc at t  in vivo however topk did not phosphorylate prc in vitro topk induced the phosphorylation of prc at t  only when the cdk cyclin b existed simultaneously in vitro both the enzymatic activity of topk and association competence of topk with prc were mandatory for this phosphorylation topk binds to cdk cyclin b  microtubules and prc via its unique region near the c terminus topk co localized closely with cdk throughout the cell cycle in vivo collectively these data indicate that topk which makes a kinase substrate complex with cdk cyclin b and prc on microtubules during mitosis enhances the cdk cyclin b dependent phosphorylation of prc and thereby strongly promotes cytokinesis
