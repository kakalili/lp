solution structure of hanatoxin  a gating modifier of voltage dependent k channels common surface features of gating modifier toxins edited by p e wright
the three dimensional structure of hanatoxin  hatx  was determined by using nmr spectroscopy hatx is a  amino acid residue peptide toxin that inhibits the drk voltage gated k channel not by blocking the pore but by altering the energetics of gating both the amino acid sequence of hatx and its unique mechanism of action distinguish this toxin from the previously described k channel inhibitors unlike most other k channel blocking toxins hatx adopts an  inhibitor cystine knot  motif and is composed of two  strands strand i for residues     and strand ii for residues     connected by four chain reversals a comparison of the surface features of hatx with those of other gating modifier toxins of voltage gated ca  and na channels suggests that the combination of a hydrophobic patch and surrounding charged residues is principally responsible for the binding of gating modifier toxins to voltage gated ion channels
