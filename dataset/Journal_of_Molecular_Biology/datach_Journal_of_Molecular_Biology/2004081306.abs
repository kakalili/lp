in vivo selection of combinatorial libraries and designed affinity maturation of polydactyl zinc finger transcription factors for icam  provides new insights into gene regulation
zinc finger dna binding domains can be combined to create new proteins of desired dna binding specificity by shuffling our repertoire of modified zinc finger domains to create randomly generated polydactyl zinc finger proteins with transcriptional regulatory domains we developed large combinatorial libraries of zinc finger transcription factors tfzfs  millions of tfzfs can then be simultaneously screened in mammalian cells here we successfully isolated specific tfzfs that significantly positively and negatively modulate the transcription of the icam  gene in primary and cancer cells which are relevant to icam  biology and tumor development we show that tfzfs can work in a general and in a cell type specific manner depending on the regulatory domain and the zinc finger protein we show that a tfzf that interacts directly with the icam  promoter at an overlapping nf  b binding enhancer can overcome or synergistically cooperate with nf  b induction of icam  for this tfzf rational design was used to optimize the binding of the zinc finger protein to its dna element and the resulting tfzf demonstrated a direct correlation between increased affinity and efficiency of target gene regulation thus combining library and affinity maturation approaches generated superior tfzfs that may find further applications in therapeutic research and in icam  biology and also provided novel mechanistic insights into the biology of transcription factors transcription factor libraries provide genome wide approaches that can be applied towards the development of tfzfs specific for virtually any gene or desired phenotype and may lead to the discovery of new genetic functions and pathways
