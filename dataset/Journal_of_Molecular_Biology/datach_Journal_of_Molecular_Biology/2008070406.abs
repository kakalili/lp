physiological sites of deamidation and methyl esterification in sensory transducers of halobacterium salinarum
in halobacterium salinarum up to  sensory transducers htrs relay environmental stimuli to an intracellular signaling system to induce tactic responses as known from the extensively studied enterobacterial system sensory adaptation to persisting stimulus intensities involves reversible methylation of certain transducer glutamate residues some of which originate from glutamine residues by deamidation this study analyzes the in vivo deamidation and methylation of membrane bound htrs under physiological conditions electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of chromatographically separated proteolytic peptides identified  methylation sites in  of the  predicted membrane spanning htrs matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry additionally detected three sites in two soluble htrs sensory transducers contain a cytoplasmic coiled coil region composed of hydrophobic heptads seven residue repeats in which the first and the fourth residues are mostly hydrophobic all identified htr methylations occurred at glutamate residues at the second and or third position of such heptads in addition to singly methylated pairs of glutamate and or glutamine residues we identified singly methylated aspartate  glutamate and alanine  glutamate pairs and doubly methylated glutamate pairs the largest methylatable regions detected in htrs comprise six heptads along the coiled coil one methylated glutamate residue was detected outside of such a region in the signaling region of htr  our analysis produced evidence supporting the predicted methyltransferase and methylesterase activities of halobacterial cher and cheb respectively it furthermore demonstrated that cheb is required for htr deamidations at least at a specific glutamine  glutamate pair in htr and a specific aspartate  glutamine pair in htr  compared to previously reported methods the described approach significantly facilitates the identification of physiological transducer modification sites
