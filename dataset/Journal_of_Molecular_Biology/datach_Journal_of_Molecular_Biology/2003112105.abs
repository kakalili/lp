counting nucleosomes in living cells with a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and confocal imaging
although methods for light microscopy of chromatin are well established there are no quantitative data for nucleosome concentrations in vivo to establish such a method we used a hela clone expressing the core histone h b fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein h b eyfp  quantitative gel electrophoresis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy fcs of isolated oligonucleosomes show that  of the total h bs carry the fluorescent tag and an increased nucleosome repeat length of   bp for the fluorescent cells in vivo the mobility and distribution of h b eyfp were studied with a combination of fcs and confocal imaging with fcs concentration and brightness of nascent molecules were measured in the cytoplasm while in the nucleoplasm a background of mobile fluorescent histones was determined by continuous photobleaching combining these results allows converting confocal fluorescence images of nuclei into calibrated nucleosome density maps absolute nucleosome concentrations in interphase amount up to    m locally with mean values of      m suggesting that a condensation controlled regulation of site accessibility takes place at length scales well below   nm
