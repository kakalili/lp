contribution of the c terminal region of a group ii chaperonin to its interaction with prefoldin and substrate transfer
prefoldin is a molecular chaperone that captures an unfolded protein substrate and transfers it to a group ii chaperonin previous studies have shown that the interaction sites for prefoldin are located in the helical protrusions of group ii chaperonins however it does not exclude the possibility of the existence of other interaction sites in this study we constructed c terminal truncation mutants of a group ii chaperonin and examined the effects of these mutations on the chaperone s function and interaction with prefoldin whereas the mutants with up to  aa truncation from the c terminus retained more than   chaperone activities for protecting citrate synthase from thermal aggregation and refolding of green fluorescent protein and isopropylmalate dehydrogenase the truncation mutants showed decreased affinities for prefoldin consequently the truncation mutants showed reduced transfer efficiency of the denatured substrate protein from prefoldin and subsequent chaperonin dependent refolding the results clearly show that the c terminal region of group ii chaperonins contributes to their interactions with prefoldin the transfer of the substrate protein from prefoldin and its refolding
