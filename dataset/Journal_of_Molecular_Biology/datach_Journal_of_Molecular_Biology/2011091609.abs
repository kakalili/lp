kinetic recognition of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor by a specific protein target
the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor rb plays a key role in cell cycle control and is linked to various types of human cancer rb binds to the lxcxe motif present in a number of cellular and viral proteins such as ade a sv  large t antigen and human papillomavirus hpv e  all instrumental in revealing fundamental mechanisms of tumor suppression cell cycle control and gene expression a detailed kinetic study of rbab binding to the hpv e oncoprotein shows that an lxcxe containing e fragment binds through a fast two state reaction strongly favored by electrostatic interactions conversely full length e binds through a multistep process involving a pre equilibrium between e conformers a fast electrostatically driven association step guided by the lxcxe motif and a slow conformational rearrangement this kinetic complexity arises from the conformational plasticity and intrinsically disordered nature of e and from multiple interaction surfaces present in both proteins affinity differences between e n domains from high and low risk types are explained by their dissociation rates in fact since rb is at the center of a large protein interaction network fast and tight recognition provides an advantage for disruption by the viral proteins where the balance of physiological and pathological interactions is dictated by kinetic ligand competition the localization of the lxcxe motif within an intrinsically disordered domain provides the fast diffusion controlled interaction that allows viral proteins to outcompete physiological targets we describe the interaction mechanism of rb with a protein ligand at the same time an lxcxe containing model target and a paradigmatic intrinsically disordered viral oncoprotein
