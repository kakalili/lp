structural biochemical and in vivo investigations of the threonine synthase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
threonine biosynthesis is a general feature of prokaryotes eukaryotic microorganisms and higher plants since mammals lack the appropriate synthetic machinery instead obtaining the amino acid through their diet the pathway is a potential focus for the development of novel antibiotics antifungal agents and herbicides threonine synthase ts  a pyridoxal  phosphate dependent enzyme catalyzes the final step in the pathway in which l homoserine phosphate and water are converted into threonine and inorganic phosphate in the present publication we report structural and functional studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis ts the product of the rv   thrc gene the structure gives new insights into the catalytic mechanism of tss in general specifically by suggesting the direct involvement of the phosphate moiety of the cofactor rather than the inorganic phosphate product in transferring a proton from c   to c  in the formation of the   unsaturated aldimine it further provides a basis for understanding why this enzyme has a higher ph optimum than has been reported elsewhere for tss and gives rise to the prediction that the equivalent enzyme from thermus thermophilus will exhibit similar behavior a deletion of the relevant gene generated a strain of m tuberculosis that requires threonine for growth such auxotrophic strains are frequently attenuated in vivo indicating that ts is a potential drug target in this organism
