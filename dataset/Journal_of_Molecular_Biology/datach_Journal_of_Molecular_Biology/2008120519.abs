molecular basis for proline and arginine rich peptide inhibition of proteasome
pr  a naturally occurring and cell permeable proline and arginine rich peptide blocks the degradation of inhibitor of nuclear factor  b i b   thereby attenuating inflammation it is a noncompetitive and reversible inhibitor of  s proteasome to identify its basis of action we used solution nmr spectroscopy and mutational analyses of the active fragment pr  which identified amino acids required for human  s proteasome inhibiting activity we then examined pr  mediated changes in the expression of nuclear factor  b dependent genes in situ the results provide prerequisites for proteasome inhibition by proline and arginine rich peptides providing a powerful new tool to investigate inflammatory processes these findings offer new leads in developing drugs to treat heart diseases or stroke
