de novo methyltransferase osdrm  interacts with the atp dependent rna helicase oseif a in rice
domains rearranged methyltransferases drms are the de novo methyltransferases that regulate cytosine methylation in plants in a manner similar to the animal de novo methyltransferases dnmt a and dnmt b these enzymes catalyze the establishment of new methylation patterns and are guided to target sites by small rnas through the process of rna directed dna methylation rddm  in the current accepted view for rddm intricate interactions among transcription factors chromatin modifying proteins and the large subunits of plant specific polymerases pol iv and pol v regulate the  nt small interfering rna guided de novo methylation of cytosines the rna induced silencing complex assembled on pol v transcribed non coding rna finally facilitates the recruitment of drm by unknown mechanism protein interactions to chromatin sites in an attempt to determine the cellular proteins that specifically interact with drm  a yeast two hybrid screen was performed using young rice panicles we report that rice drm interacts with the atp dependent rna helicase eif a direct interaction between the two proteins is demonstrated in vivo by bimolecular fluorescence complementation method and in vitro by histidine pull down assays deletion analysis reveals that interaction between osdrm and oseif a is specifically mediated through ubiquitin associated domain of osdrm while both domains  and  of oseif a are critical for mediating strong interaction with osdrm in vivo interaction between arabidopsis eif ai and eif aii with osdrm and nuclear localization of these complexes suggests possible conservation of functional interaction between de novo methyltransferases and the translation initiation factor eif a in rddm across plant species
