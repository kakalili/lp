the structure of helix iii in xenopus oocyte  s rrna an rna stem containing a two nucleotide bulge edited by i tinoco
the solution structure of an oligonucleotide containing the helix iii sequence from xenopus oocyte  s rrna has been determined by nmr spectroscopy helix iii includes two unpaired adenosine residues flanked on either side by g c base pairs that are required for binding of ribosomal protein l  the consensus conformation of helix iii in the context provided by this oligonucleotide has the two adenosine residues located in the minor groove and stacked upon the   flanking guanosine residue consistent with biochemical studies of free  s rrna in solution a distinct break in stacking that occurs between the first adenosine residue of the bulge and the flanking   guanosine residue exposes the base of the adenosine residue in the minor groove and the base of the guanosine residue in the major groove the major groove of the helix is widened at the site of the unpaired nucleotides and the helix is substantially bent nonetheless the g c base pairs flanking the bulge are intact the data indicate that there may be conformational heterogeneity centered in the bulge region the corresponding adenosine residues in the haloarcula marismortui  s ribosomal subunit form a dinucleotide platform which is quite different from the motif seen in solution thus the conformation of helix iii probably changes when  s rrna is incorporated into the ribosome
