role of the protective antigen octamer in the molecular mechanism of anthrax lethal toxin stabilization in plasma
anthrax is caused by strains of bacillus anthracis that produce two key virulence factors anthrax toxin atx and a poly  d glutamic acid capsule atx is comprised of three proteins protective antigen pa and two enzymes lethal factor lf and edema factor ef  to disrupt cell function these components must assemble into holotoxin complexes which contain either a ring shaped homooctameric or homoheptameric pa oligomer bound to multiple copies of lf and or ef producing lethal toxin lt  edema toxin or mixtures thereof once a host cell endocytoses these complexes pa converts into a membrane inserted channel that translocates lf and ef into the cytosol lt can assemble on host cell surfaces or extracellularly in plasma we show that under physiological conditions in bovine plasma lt complexes containing heptameric pa aggregate and inactivate more readily than lt complexes containing octameric pa lt complexes containing octameric pa possess enhanced stability channel forming activity and macrophage cytotoxicity relative to those containing heptameric pa under physiological conditions multiple biophysical probes reveal that heptameric pa can prematurely adopt the channel conformation but octameric pa complexes remain in their soluble prechannel configuration which allows them to resist aggregation and inactivation we conclude that pa may form an octameric oligomeric state as a means to produce a more stable and active lt complex that could circulate freely in the blood
