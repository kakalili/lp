the densely o glycosylated muc mucin protects the intestine and provides food for the commensal bacteria
all mucins are highly o glycosylated by variable glycans depending on species histoblood group and organ this makes the intestinal main mucin muc non degradable by the host digestive system but well by both commensal and pathogenic bacteria the muc glycans are important for selection of the commensal bacteria and act as a nutritional source for the bacteria this also helps the host to recover some of the energy spent on constantly renewing the protective mucus layer glycosylation is the most diverse and common posttranslational modification of cell surfaces and secreted proteins n glycosylation is most well studied and predictable whereas o glycosylation is more diverse and less well understood o glycosylation is also often called mucin type glycosylation as it is typical for mucins that often have more than   of the mass as o glycans this review will discuss the mucin type o glycosylation and especially the o glycosylation of human and mice intestinal mucin muc in relation to bacteria and disease
