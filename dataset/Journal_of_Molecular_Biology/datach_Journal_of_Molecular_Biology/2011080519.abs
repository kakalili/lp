a concerted mechanism for opening the gdp binding pocket and release of the nucleotide in hetero trimeric g proteins
g protein hetero trimers play a fundamental role in cell function their dynamic behavior at the atomic level remains to be understood we have studied the gi hetero trimer through a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses we showed that these big proteins could undergo large amplitude conformational changes without any energy penalty and with an intrinsic dynamics centered on their gdp binding pocket among the computed collective motions one of the modes mode   was particularly able to significantly open both the base and the phosphate sides of the gdp binding pocket this mode describing mainly a motion between the ras like and the helical domains of g  was in close agreement with some available x ray data and with many other biochemical biophysical observations including the kink of helix   the use of a new protocol which allows extraction of the gdp ligand along the computed normal modes supported that the exit of gdp was largely coupled to an opening motion along mode   we propose for the first time a  concerted mechanism  model in which the opening of the gdp pocket and the kink of the   helix occur concomitantly and favor gdp release from g    complexes this model is discussed in the context of the g protein coupled receptor g protein interaction close to the cell membrane
