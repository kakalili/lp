phosphorylation dependent conformational transition of the cardiac specific n extension of troponin i in cardiac troponin
we present here the solution structure for the bisphosphorylated form of the cardiac n extension of troponin i ctni    a region for which there are no previous high resolution data using this structure the x ray crystal structure of the cardiac troponin core and uniform density models of the troponin components derived from neutron contrast variation data we built atomic models for troponin that show the conformational transition in cardiac troponin induced by bisphosphorylation in the absence of phosphorylation our nmr data and sequence analyses indicate a less structured cardiac n extension with a propensity for a helical region surrounding the phosphorylation motif followed by a helical c terminal region residues      in this conformation tni   interacts with the n lobe of cardiac troponin c ctnc and thus is positioned to modulate myofilament ca  sensitivity bisphosphorylation at ser   extends the c terminal helix residues     which results in weakening interactions with the n lobe of ctnc and a re positioning of the acidic amino terminus of ctni   for favorable interactions with basic regions likely the inhibitory region of ctni an extended poly l proline ii helix between residues  and  serves as the rigid linker that aids in re positioning the amino terminus of ctni   upon bisphosphorylation at ser    we propose that it is these electrostatic interactions between the acidic amino terminus of ctni   and the basic inhibitory region of troponin i that induces a bending of ctni at the end that interacts with ctnc this model provides a molecular mechanism for the observed changes in cross bridge kinetics upon tni phosphorylation
