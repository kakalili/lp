structures and functional implications of an amp binding cystathionine  synthase domain protein from a hyperthermophilic archaeon
cystathionine  synthase domains are found in a myriad of proteins from organisms across the tree of life and have been hypothesized to function as regulatory modules that sense the energy charge of cells here we characterize the structure and stability of pae   a dimeric tandem cystathionine  synthase domain protein from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon pyrobaculum aerophilum crystal structures of the protein in unliganded and amp bound forms determined at resolutions of   and      respectively reveal remarkable conservation of key functional features seen in the  subunit of the eukaryotic amp activated protein kinase the structures also confirm the presence of a suspected intermolecular disulfide bond between the two subunits that is shown to stabilize the protein our amp bound structure represents a first step in investigating the function of a large class of uncharacterized prokaryotic proteins in addition this work extends previous studies that have suggested that in certain thermophilic microbes disulfide bonds play a key role in stabilizing intracellular proteins and protein  protein complexes
