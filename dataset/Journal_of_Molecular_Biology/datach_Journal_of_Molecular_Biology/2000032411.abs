mechanism of dna cleavage by the dna rna non specific anabaena sp pcc   endonuclease nuca and its inhibition by nuia  edited by j karn
a structural model of the dna rna non specific endonuclease nuca from anabaena sp pcc   that has been obtained on the basis of the three dimensional structure of the related serratia nuclease suggests that the overall architecture of the active site including amino acid residues h   n  and e   corresponding to h  n  and e  in serratia nuclease is similar in both nucleases substitution of these residues by alanine leads to a large reduction in activity  lt     similarly as observed for serratia nuclease demonstrating that both enzymes share a similar mechanism of catalysis with differences only in detail nuca is inhibited by its specific polypeptide inhibitor with a ki value in the subpicomolar range while the related serratia nuclease at nanomolar concentrations is only inhibited at an approximately   fold molar excess of nuia the artificial chromophoric substrate deoxythymidine      bis p nitrophenyl phosphate is cleaved by nuca as well as by serratia nuclease cleavage of this analogue by nuca however is not inhibited by nuia suggesting that small molecules gain access to the active site of nuca in the enzyme inhibitor complex under conditions where cleavage of dna substrates is completely inhibited the active site residue e  seems to be the main target amino acid for inhibition of nuca by nuia but r  r  and r   corresponding to k  r  r  in serratia nuclease are also involved in the nuca nuia interaction nuia deletion mutants show that the structural integrity of the n and c terminal region of the inhibitor is important for complex formation with nuca and inhibition of nuclease activity based on these results a mechanism of dna cleavage by nuca and its inhibition by nuia is proposed
