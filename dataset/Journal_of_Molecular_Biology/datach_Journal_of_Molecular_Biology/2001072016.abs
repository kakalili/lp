x ray structure of escherichia coli pyridoxine   phosphate oxidase complexed with pyridoxal   phosphate at    resolution edited by r huber
escherichia colipyridoxine   phosphate oxidase catalyzes the terminal step in the biosynthesis of pyridoxal   phosphate by the fmn oxidation of pyridoxine   phosphate forming fmnh and h o  recent studies have shown that in addition to the active site pyridoxine   phosphate oxidase contains a non catalytic site that binds pyridoxal   phosphate tightly the crystal structure of pyridoxine   phosphate oxidase from e coli with one or two molecules of pyridoxal   phosphate bound to each monomer has been determined to    resolution one of the pyridoxal   phosphate molecules is clearly bound at the active site with the aldehyde at c   of pyridoxal   phosphate near n of the bound fmn a protein conformational change has occurred that partially closes the active site the orientation of the bound pyridoxal   phosphate suggests that the enzyme catalyzes a hydride ion transfer between c   of pyridoxal   phosphate and n of fmn when the crystals are soaked with excess pyridoxal   phosphate an additional molecule of this cofactor is also bound about    from the active site a possible tunnel exists between the two sites so that pyridoxal   phosphate formed at the active site may transfer to the non catalytic site without passing though the solvent
