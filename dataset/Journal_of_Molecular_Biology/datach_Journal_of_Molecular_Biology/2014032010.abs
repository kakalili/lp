multiple apobec restriction factors for hiv  and one vif to rule them all
several members of the apobec family of cellular restriction factors provide intrinsic immunity to the host against viral infection specifically apobec de apobec f apobec g and apobec h haplotypes ii v and vii provide protection against hiv  vif through hypermutation of the viral genome inhibition of reverse transcription and inhibition of viral dna integration into the host genome hiv  counteracts apobec proteins by encoding the viral protein vif which contains distinct domains that specifically interact with these apobec proteins to ensure their proteasomal degradation allowing virus replication to proceed here we review our current understanding of apobec structure editing and non editing mechanisms of apobec mediated restriction vif apobec interactions that trigger apobec degradation and the contribution of apobec proteins to restriction and control of hiv  replication in infected patients
