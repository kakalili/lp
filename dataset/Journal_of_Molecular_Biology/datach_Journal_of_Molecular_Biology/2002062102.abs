secondary structure prediction for aligned rna sequences
most functional rna molecules have characteristic secondary structures that are highly conserved in evolution here we present a method for computing the consensus structure of a set aligned rna sequences taking into account both thermodynamic stability and sequence covariation comparison with phylogenetic structures of rrnas shows that a reliability of prediction of more than   is achieved for only five related sequences as an application we show that the early noduline mrna contains significant secondary structure that is supported by sequence covariation
