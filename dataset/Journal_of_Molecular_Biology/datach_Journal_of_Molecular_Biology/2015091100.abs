folding optimization in vivo uncovers new chaperones
by employing a genetic selection that forces the cell to fold an unstable aggregation prone test protein in order to survive we have generated bacterial strains with enhanced periplasmic folding capacity these strains enhance the soluble steady state level of the test protein most of the bacterial variants we isolated were found to overexpress one or more periplasmic proteins including osmy ivy dppa oppa and hdeb of these proteins only hdeb has convincingly been previously shown to function as chaperone in vivo by giving bacteria the stark choice between death and stabilizing a poorly folded protein we have now generated designer bacteria selected for their ability to stabilize specific proteins
