the relationship between conservation thermodynamic stability and function in the sh domain hydrophobic core
to investigate the relationships between sequence conservation protein stability and protein function we have measured the thermodynamic stability folding kinetics and in vitro peptide binding activity of a large number of single site substitutions in the hydrophobic core of the fyn sh domain comparison of these data to that derived from an analysis of a large alignment of sh domain sequences revealed a very good correlation between the distinct pattern of conservation observed at each core position and the thermodynamic stability of mutants conservation was also found to correlate well with the unfolding rates of mutants but not to the folding rates suggesting that evolution selects more strongly for optimal native state packing interactions than for maximal folding rates structural analysis suggests that residue  residue core packing interactions are very similar in all sh domains which provides an explanation for the correlation between conservation and mutant stability effects studied in a single sh domain we also demonstrate a correlation between stability and the in vivo activity of mutants and between conservation and activity however the relationship between conservation and activity was very strong only for the three most conserved hydrophobic core positions the weaker correlation between activity and conservation seen at the other seven core positions indicates that maintenance of protein stability is the dominant selective pressure at these positions in general the pattern of conservation at hydrophobic core positions appears to arise from conserved packing constraints and can be effectively utilized to predict the destabilizing effects of amino acid substitutions
