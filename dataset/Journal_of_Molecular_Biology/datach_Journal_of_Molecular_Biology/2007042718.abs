from the periplasmic signaling domain to the extracellular face of an outer membrane signal transducer of pseudomonas aeruginosa crystal structure of the ferric pyoverdine outer membrane receptor
the pyoverdine outer membrane receptor fpva from pseudomonas aeruginosa translocates ferric pyoverdine across the outer membrane through an energy consuming mechanism using the proton motive force and the tonb  exbb  exbd energy transducing complex from the inner membrane we solved the crystal structure of the full length fpva bound to iron pyoverdine at     resolution signal transduction to an anti sigma protein of the inner membrane and to tonb  exbb  exbd involves the periplasmic domain which displays a     fold composed of two  helices sandwiched by two  sheets one iron pyoverdine conformer is bound at the extracellular face of fpva revealing the conformer selectivity of the binding site the loop that contains the tonb box involved in interactions with tonb and connects the signaling domain to the plug domain of fpva is not defined in the electron density following the binding of ferric pyoverdine the high flexibility of this loop is probably necessary for signal transduction through the outer membrane
