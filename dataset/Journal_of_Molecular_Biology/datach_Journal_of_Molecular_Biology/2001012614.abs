an rna domain within the   untranslated region of the tomato bushy stunt virus genome modulates viral rna replication edited by d draper
the terminal half of the   untranslated region utr in the   strand rna genome of tomato bushy stunt virus was analyzed for possible roles in viral rna replication computer aided thermodynamic analysis of secondary structure phylogenetic comparisons for base pair covariation and chemical and enzymatic solution structure probing were used to analyze the  nucleotide long   terminal sequence the results indicate that this sequence adopts a branched secondary structure containing a three helix junction core the t shaped domain tsd formed by this terminal sequence is closed by a prominent ten base pair long helix termed stem  s  deletion of either the   or   segment forming s  coordinates    or     respectively in a model subviral rna replicon i e a prototypical defective interfering di rna reduced in vivo accumulation levels of this molecule approximately  fold compensatory type mutational analysis of s within this replicon revealed a strong correlation between formation of the predicted s structure and efficient di rna accumulation rna decay studiesin vivodid not reveal any notable changes in the physical stabilities of di rnas containing disrupted s s thus implicating rna replication as the affected process further investigation revealed that destabilization of s in the   strand was significantly more detrimental to di rna accumulation than    strand destabilization therefore s mediated activity likely functions primarily via the   strand the essential role of s in di rna accumulation prompted us to examine the   proximal secondary structure of a previously identified mutant di rna rna b that lacks the   utr but is still capable of low levels of replication mutational analysis of a predicted s like element present within a cryptic   terminal tsd confirmed the importance of the former in rna b accumulation collectively these data support a fundamental role for the tsd and in particular its s subelement in tombusvirus rna replication
