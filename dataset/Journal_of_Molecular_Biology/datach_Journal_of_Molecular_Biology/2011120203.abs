disparate degrees of hypervariable loop flexibility control t cell receptor cross reactivity specificity and binding mechanism
t cell receptors tcrs recognize multiple antigenic peptides bound and presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules tcr cross reactivity has been attributed in part to the flexibility of tcr complementarity determining region cdr loops yet there have been limited direct studies of loop dynamics to determine the extent of its role here we studied the flexibility of the binding loops of the   tcr a using crystallographic spectroscopic and computational methods a significant role for flexibility in binding and cross reactivity was indicated only for the cdr  and cdr  hypervariable loops examination of the energy landscapes of these two loops indicated that cdr  possesses a broad smooth energy landscape leading to rapid sampling in the free tcr of a range of conformations compatible with different ligands the landscape for cdr  is more rugged resulting in more limited conformational sampling that leads to specificity for a reduced set of peptides as well as the major histocompatibility complex protein in addition to informing on the mechanisms of cross reactivity and specificity the energy landscapes of the two loops indicate a complex mechanism for tcr binding incorporating elements of both conformational selection and induced fit in a manner that blends features of popular models for tcr recognition
