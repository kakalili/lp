intracellular trafficking of the hcmv immunoevasin ul  depends on elements present in both its cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains
expression of the ul  glycoprotein leads to down regulation of nkg d ligands from the surface of the human cytomegalovirus hcmv infected cell the molecular elements responsible for ul  trafficking and intracellular localization were investigated by preparing various chimeric proteins and mutants using cd as a reporter molecule a yqrl motif present in ul  s cytoplasmic tail was functional for internalization but the presence of the transmembrane domain modified the fate of the molecule after internalization various elements of the transmembrane domain that affected the trafficking of the protein were identified however their influence was modified in turn by the presence of the cytoplasmic tail of ul  strikingly the extremely slow maturation rate of the native viral protein was only reproduced by the chimera that contained both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of ul  these findings add data to a topic of increasing interest and importance the role of the transmembrane domain of a protein in controlling its intracellular trafficking in addition they provide a new insight into the mechanism of action of the viral immunoevasin ul
