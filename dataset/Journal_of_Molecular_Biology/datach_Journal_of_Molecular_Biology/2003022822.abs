voltage gated k channel from mammalian brain  d structure at   of the complete      complex
voltage sensitive k channels kv serve numerous important roles e g in the control of neuron excitability and the patterns of synaptic activity here we use electron microscopy em and single particle analysis to obtain the first complete structure of kv channels purified from rat brain which contain four transmembrane channel forming  subunits and four cytoplasmically associated  subunits the   resolution structure reveals an asymmetric dumb bell shaped complex with  fold symmetry a length of    and variable width by fitting published x ray data for recombinant components to our em map the modulatory    was assigned to the innermost    end the n terminal t  domain of the  subunit to the central   moiety and the pore containing portion to the    membrane part at this resolution the selectivity filter could not be localised direct contact of the membrane component with the central t  domain occurs only via peripheral connectors permitting communication between the channel and  subunits for coupling of responses to changes in excitability and metabolic status of neurons
