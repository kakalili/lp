cooperativity in scapharca dimeric hemoglobin simulation of binding intermediates and elucidation of the role of interfacial water
cooperative binding of ligands to proteins can serve to increase their efficiency and to regulate their activity thus understanding of the mechanism of cooperativity is one of the central concerns of molecular biology for the tetrameric human hemoglobin hba  the cooperative mechanism involves a reasonably well understood combination of tertiary and quaternary changes that occur during the binding process the dimeric hemoglobin of scapharca hbi  which is composed of subunits with the same fold as in hba is also highly cooperative but the structural changes on ligand binding are small a re orientation of phe  in the binding pocket and changes in the number of interfacial water moleculess have been implicated in the cooperative mechanism to explore the role of these factors we have investigated models of partially liganded intermediate states of hbi with molecular dynamics simulation methods since unlike hba no structures for intermediates are available they were constructed by combining subunits from the unliganded and liganded dimers two structurally distinct intermediates were examined and it was shown that the transition between the two intermediates is directly coupled to the number of interfacial water molecules further it was found that there is a well defined water channel that connects the interface between the subunits to bulk water the bottleneck gate of the channel which can be open or closed is made of hydrophilic residues the implication of the present results for the cooperative mechanism of hbi is discussed
