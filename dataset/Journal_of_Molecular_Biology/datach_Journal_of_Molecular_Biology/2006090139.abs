the equilibrium unfolding intermediate observed at ph  and its relationship with the kinetic folding intermediates in green fluorescent protein
folding mechanisms of a variant of green fluorescent protein f s m  t v  a were investigated by a wide variety of spectroscopic techniques equilibrium measurements on acid induced denaturation of the protein monitored by chromophore and tryptophan fluorescence and small angle x ray scattering revealed that this protein accumulates at least two equilibrium intermediates a native like intermediate and an unfolding intermediate the latter of which exhibits the characteristics of the molten globule state under moderately denaturing conditions at ph  to elucidate the role of the equilibrium unfolding intermediate in folding a series of kinetic refolding experiments with various combinations of initial and final ph values including ph   the native condition  ph   the moderately denaturing condition where the unfolding intermediate is accumulated  and ph   the acid denaturing condition were carried out by monitoring chromophore and tryptophan fluorescence kinetic on pathway intermediates were accumulated during the folding on the refolding reaction from ph   to   however the signal change corresponding to the conversion from the acid denatured to the kinetic intermediate states was significantly reduced on the refolding reaction from ph   to ph   whereas only the signal change corresponding to the above conversion was observed on the refolding reaction from ph   to ph   these results indicate that the equilibrium unfolding intermediate is composed of an ensemble of the folding intermediate species accumulated during the folding reaction and thus support a hierarchical model of protein folding
