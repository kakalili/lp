calcium dependent homoassociation of e cadherin by nmr spectroscopy changes in mobility conformation and mapping of contact regions
cadherins are calcium dependent cell surface proteins that mediate homophilic cellular adhesion the calcium induced oligomerization of the n terminal two domains of epithelial cadherin ecad  was followed by nmr spectroscopy in solution over a large range of protein   m  mm and calcium    mm concentrations several spectrally distinct states could be distinguished that correspond to a calcium free monomeric form a calcium bound monomeric form and to calcium bound higher oligomeric forms chemical shift changes between these different states define calcium binding residues as well as oligomerization contacts information about the relative orientation and mobility of the ecad  domains in the various states was obtained from weak alignment and  n relaxation experiments the data indicate that the calcium free ecad  monomer adopts a flexible kinked conformation that occludes the dimer interface observed in the ecad  crystal structure in contrast the calcium bound monomer is already in a straight non flexible conformation where this interface is accessible this mechanism provides a rational for the calcium induced adhesiveness oligomerization induces chemical shift changes in an area of domain cad that is centered at residue trp  these shift changes extend to almost the entire surface of domain cad at high  mm protein concentrations smaller additional clusters of shift perturbations are observed around residue a  in cad and k  in cad  according to weak alignment and relaxation data the symmetry of a predominantly dimeric solution aggregate at  mm ecad  differs from the approximate c symmetry of the crystalline dimer
