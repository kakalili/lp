convergent evolution of enzyme active sites is not a rare phenomenon
since convergent evolution of enzyme active sites was first identified in serine proteases other individual instances of this phenomenon have been documented however a systematic analysis assessing the frequency of this phenomenon across enzyme space is still lacking this work uses the query d structural comparison algorithm to integrate for the first time detailed knowledge about catalytic residues available through the catalytic site atlas csa  with the evolutionary information provided by the structural classification of proteins scop database this study considers two modes of convergent evolution  i mechanistic analogues which are enzymes that use the same mechanism to perform related but possibly different reactions considered here as sharing the first three digits of the ec number  and ii transformational analogues which catalyse exactly the same reaction identical ec numbers  but may use different mechanisms mechanistic analogues were identified in     out of   of the three digit ec groups considered showing that this phenomenon is not rare furthermore  of these groups also contain transformational analogues the catalytic triad is the most widespread active site the results of the structural comparison show that this mechanism or variations thereof is present in  superfamilies transformational analogues were identified for  of the   four digit ec numbers present within the csa and about half of these were also mechanistic analogues exhibiting convergence of their active sites this analysis has also been extended to the whole protein data bank to provide a complete and manually curated list of the all the transformational analogues whose structure is classified in scop the results of this work show that the phenomenon of convergent evolution is not rare especially when considering large enzymatic families
