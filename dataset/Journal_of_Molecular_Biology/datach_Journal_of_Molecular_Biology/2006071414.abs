structural and kinetic analysis of caspase  reveals role for s binding site in substrate recognition
the molecular basis for the substrate specificity of human caspase  has been investigated using peptide analog inhibitors and substrates that vary at the p  p  and p positions crystal structures were determined of caspase  complexes with the substrate analogs at resolutions of     to     differences in the interactions of caspase  with the analogs are consistent with the ki values of   nm    nm and    nm for ac devd cho ac vdvad cho and ac dmqd cho respectively and relative kcat km values of      and   for the corresponding peptide substrates the bound peptide analogs show very similar interactions for the main chain atoms and the conserved p asp and p asp while interactions vary for p and p  p lies in a hydrophobic s groove consistent with the weaker inhibition of ac dmqd cho with polar p gln s is a surface hydrophilic site with favorable polar interactions with p glu in ac devd cho ac dmqd cho and ac vdvad cho have hydrophobic p residues that are not optimal in the polar s site consistent with their weaker inhibition a hydrophobic s site was identified for caspase  where the side chains of phe  and phe  interact with p val of ac vdvad cho and enclose the substrate binding site by conformational change the kinetic importance of hydrophobic p residues was confirmed by more efficient hydrolysis of caspase  substrates ac vdvad pna and ac ldvad pna compared with ac dvad pna in contrast caspase  showed less efficient hydrolysis of the substrates with p val or leu compared with ac dvad pna caspase  and caspase  share similar hydrophobic s sites while caspases     and  do not have structurally equivalent hydrophobic residues these caspases are likely to differ in their selectivity for the p position of substrates the distinct selectivity for p will help define the particular substrates and signaling pathways associated with each caspase
