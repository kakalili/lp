This study investigates the role of translational coupling in the expression and function of DrrA and DrrB proteins, which form an efflux pump for the export of anticancer drugs doxorubicin and daunorubicin in the producer organism Streptomyces peucetius. Interest in studying the role of translational coupling came from the initial observation that DrrA and DrrB proteins confer doxorubicin resistance only when they are expressed in cis. Because of the presence of overlapping stop and start codons in the intergenic region between drrA and drrB, it has been assumed that the translation of drrB is coupled to the translation of the upstream gene drrA even though direct evidence for coupling has been lacking. In this study, we show that the expression of drrB is indeed coupled to translation of drrA. We also show that the introduction of non-coding sequences between the stop codon of drrA and the start of drrB prevents formation of a functional complex, although both proteins are still produced at normal levels, thus suggesting that translational coupling also plays a crucial role in proper assembly. Interestingly, replacement of drrA with an unrelated gene was found to result in very high drrB expression, which becomes severely growth inhibitory. This indicates that an additional mechanism within drrA may optimize expression of drrB. Based on the observations reported here, it is proposed that the production and assembly of DrrA and DrrB are tightly linked. Furthermore, we propose that the key to assembly of the DrrAB complex lies in co-folding of the two proteins, which requires that the genes be maintained in cis in a translationally coupled manner.
