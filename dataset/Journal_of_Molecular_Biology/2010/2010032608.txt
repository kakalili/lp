βPIX (p21-activated kinase interacting exchange factor) and Shank/ProSAP protein form a complex acting as a protein scaffold that integrates signaling pathways and regulates postsynaptic structure. Complex formation is mediated by the C-terminal PDZ binding motif of βPIX and the Shank PDZ domain. The coiled-coil (CC) domain upstream of the PDZ binding motif allows multimerization of βPIX, which is important for its physiological functions. We have solved the crystal structure of the βPIX CC–Shank PDZ complex and determined the stoichiometry of complex formation. The βPIX CC forms a 76-Å-long parallel CC trimer. Despite the fact that the βPIX CC exposes three PDZ binding motifs in the C-termini, the βPIX trimer associates with a single Shank PDZ. One of the C-terminal ends of the CC forms an extensive β-sheet interaction with the Shank PDZ, while the other two ends are not involved in ligand binding and form random coils. The two C-terminal ends of βPIX have significantly lower affinity than the first PDZ binding motif due to the steric hindrance in the C-terminal tails, which results in binding of a single PDZ domain to the βPIX trimer. The structure shows canonical class I PDZ binding with a β-sheet interaction extending to position −6 of βPIX. The βB–βC loop of Shank PDZ undergoes a conformational change upon ligand binding to form the β-sheet interaction and to accommodate the bulky side chain of Trp −5. This structural study provides a clear picture of the molecular recognition of the PDZ ligand and the asymmetric association of βPIX CC and Shank PDZ.
