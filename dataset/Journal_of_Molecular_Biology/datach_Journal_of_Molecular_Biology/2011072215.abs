the role of cellular factors in promoting hiv budding
human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  becomes enveloped while budding through the plasma membrane and the release of nascent virions requires a membrane fission event that separates the viral envelope from the cell surface to facilitate this crucial step in its life cycle hiv  exploits a complex cellular membrane remodeling and fission machinery known as the endosomal sorting complex required for transport escrt pathway hiv  gag directly interacts with early acting components of this pathway which ultimately triggers the assembly of the escrt iii membrane fission complex at viral budding sites surprisingly hiv  requires only a subset of escrt iii components indicating that the membrane fission reaction that occurs during hiv  budding differs in crucial aspects from topologically related cellular abscission events
