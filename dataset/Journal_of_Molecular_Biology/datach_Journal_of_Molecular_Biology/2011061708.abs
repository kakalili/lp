the role of rna sequence and structure in rna  protein interactions
we investigate the sequence and structural properties of rna  protein interaction sites in   rna  protein chain pairs the largest set of rna  protein complexes analyzed to date statistical analysis confirms and extends earlier analyses made on smaller data sets there are    of hydrogen bonds between rna and protein that are nucleobase specific indicating the importance of both nucleobase specific and nonspecific interactions while there is no significant difference between rna base frequencies in protein binding and non binding regions distinct preferences for rna bases rna structural states protein residues and protein secondary structure emerge when nucleobase specific and nonspecific interactions are considered separately guanine nucleobase and unpaired rna structural states are significantly preferred in nucleobase specific interactions however nonspecific interactions disfavor guanine while still favoring unpaired rna structural states the opposite preferences of nucleobase specific and nonspecific interactions for guanine may explain discrepancies between earlier studies with regard to base preferences in rna  protein interaction regions preferences for amino acid residues differ significantly between nucleobase specific and nonspecific interactions with nonspecific interactions showing the expected bias towards positively charged residues irregular protein structures are strongly favored in interactions with the protein backbone whereas there is little preference for specific protein secondary structure in either nucleobase specific interaction or nonspecific interaction overall this study shows strong preferences for both rna bases and rna structural states in protein  rna interactions indicating their mutual importance in protein recognition
