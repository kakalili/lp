fast compaction of  lactalbumin during folding studied by stopped flow x ray scattering
to monitor the fast compaction process during protein folding we have used a stopped flow small angle x ray scattering technique combined with a two dimensional charge coupled device based x ray detector that makes it possible to improve the signal to noise ratio of data dramatically and measured the kinetic refolding reaction of  lactalbumin the results clearly show that the radius of gyration and the overall shape of the kinetic folding intermediate of  lactalbumin are the same as those of the molten globule state observed at equilibrium thus the identity between the kinetic folding intermediate and the equilibrium molten globule state is firmly established the present results also suggest that the folding intermediate is more hydrated than the native state and that the hydrated water molecules are dehydrated when specific side chain packing is formed during the change from the molten globule to the native state
