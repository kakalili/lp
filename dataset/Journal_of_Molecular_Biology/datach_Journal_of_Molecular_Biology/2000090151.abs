how does a symmetric dimer recognize an asymmetric substrate a substrate complex of hiv  protease edited by i wilson
the crystal structure of an actual hiv  protease substrate complex is presented at    resolution r value of     rfree     between an inactive variant d n of hiv  protease and a long substrate peptide lys ala arg val leu ala glu ala met ser which covers a full binding epitope of capsid ca p  cleavage site the substrate peptide is asymmetric in both size and charge distribution to accommodate this asymmetry the two protease monomers adopt different conformations burying a total of     of surface area at the protease substrate interface the specificity for the ca p substrate peptide is mainly hydrophobic as most of the hydrogen bonds are made with the backbone of the peptide substrate two water molecules bridge the two monomers through the loops gly  gly  gly   gly    and pro   val    pro  val   when other complexes are compared the mobility of these loops is correlated with the content of the p and p   sites interdependence of the conformational changes allows the protease to exhibit its wide range of substrate specificity
