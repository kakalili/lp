Before cleaving DNA substrates with two recognition sites, the Cfr10I, Ngo MIV, NaeI and SfiI restriction endonucleases bridge the two sites through 3D space, looping out the intervening DNA. To characterise their looping interactions, the enzymes were added to plasmids with two recognition sites interspersed with two res sites for site-specific recombination by Tn 21 resolvase, in buffers that contained either EDTA or CaCl2 so as to preclude DNA cleavage by the endonuclease; the extent to which the res sites were sequestered into separate loops was evaluated from the degree of inhibition of resolvase. With Cfr10I, a looped complex was detected in the presence but not in the absence of Ca2+; it had a lifetime of about 90 seconds. Neither Ngo MIV nor NaeI gave looped complexes of sufficient stability to be detected by this method. In contrast, SfiI with Ca2+ produced a looped complex that survived for more than seven hours, whereas its looping interaction in EDTA lasts for about four minutes. When resolvase was added to a SfiI binding reaction in EDTA followed immediately by CaCl2, the looped DNA was blocked from recombination while the unlooped DNA underwent recombination. By measuring the distribution between looped and unlooped DNA at various SfiI concentrations, and by fitting the data to a model for DNA binding by a tetrameric protein to two sites in cis, an equilibrium constant for the looping interaction was determined. The equilibrium constant was essentially independent of the length of DNA between the SfiI sites.
