crystal structure of class i acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase from pseudomonas aeruginosa
acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase ahir is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids we have determined the first crystal structure of a class i ahir from pseudomonas aeruginosa at    resolution its dodecameric architecture of  point group symmetry is assembled of six dimeric units and dimerization is essential for the formation of the active site the dimeric unit of p aeruginosa ahir partially superimposes with a three domain monomer of spinach ahir a class ii enzyme this demonstrates that the so called plant specific insert in the middle of spinach ahir is structurally and functionally equivalent to the c terminal  helical domain of p aeruginosa ahir and the c terminal  helical domain was duplicated during evolution from the shorter class i ahirs to the longer class ii ahirs the dimeric unit of p aeruginosa ahir possesses a deep figure of eight knot essentially identical with that in the spinach ahir monomer thus our work lowers the likelihood of the previous proposal that  domain duplication followed by exchange of a secondary structure element can be a source of such a knot in the protein structure  being correct
