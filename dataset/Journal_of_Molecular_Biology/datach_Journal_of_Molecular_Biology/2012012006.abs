structural studies of intermediates along the cyclization pathway of aplysia adp ribosyl cyclase
cyclic adp ribose cadpr is a calcium messenger that can mobilize intracellular ca  stores and activate ca  influx to regulate a wide range of physiological processes aplysia cyclase is the first member of the adp ribosyl cyclases identified to catalyze the cyclization of nad into cadpr the catalysis involves a two step reaction the elimination of the nicotinamide ring and the cyclization of the intermediate resulting in the covalent attachment of the purine ring to the terminal ribose aplysia cyclase exhibits a high degree of leniency towards the purine base of its substrate and the cyclization reaction takes place at either the n  or the n position of the purine ring to decipher the mechanism of cyclization in aplysia cyclase we used a crystallization setup with multiple aplysia cyclase molecules present in the asymmetric unit with the use of natural substrates and analogs not only were we able to capture multiple snapshots during enzyme catalysis resulting in either n or n linkage of the purine ring to the terminal ribose we were also able to observe for the first time the cyclized products of both n and n cyclization bound in the active site of aplysia cyclase
