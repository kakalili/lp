pathogenic mutations within the disordered palindromic region of the prion protein induce structure therein and accelerate the formation of misfolded oligomers
little is understood about how the intrinsically disordered n terminal region ntr of the prion protein modulates its misfolding and aggregation which lead to prion disease in this study two pathogenic mutations g  v and a  v in the palindromic region of the ntr are shown to have no effect on the structure stability or dynamics of native mouse prion protein moprp but nevertheless accelerate misfolding and oligomerization for wild type moprp misfolding and oligomerization appear to occur concurrently while for both mutant variants oligomerization is shown to precede misfolding kinetic hydrogen  deuterium exchange  mass spectrometry experiments show that sequence segment     from the ntr becomes structured albeit weakly during the oligomerization of both mutant variants importantly this structure formation occurs prior to structural conversion in the c terminal domain and appears to be the reason that the formation of misfolded oligomers is accelerated by the pathogenic mutations
