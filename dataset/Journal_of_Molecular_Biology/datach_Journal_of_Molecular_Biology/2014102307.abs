functional suppression of hamp domain signaling defects in the e coli serine chemoreceptor
hamp domains play key signaling roles in many bacterial receptor proteins the four helix hamp bundle of the homodimeric escherichia coli serine chemoreceptor tsr interacts with an adjoining four helix sensory adaptation bundle to regulate the histidine autokinase chea bound to the cytoplasmic tip of the tsr molecule the adaptation helices undergo reversible covalent modifications that tune the stimulus responsive range of the receptor unmodified e residues promote kinase off output and methylated e residues or q replacements at modification sites promote kinase on output we used mutationally imposed adaptational modification states and cells with various combinations of the sensory adaptation enzymes cher and cheb to characterize the signaling properties of mutant tsr receptors that had amino acid replacements in packing layer  of the hamp bundle and followed in vivo chea activity with an assay based on f rster resonance energy transfer we found that an alanine or a serine replacement at hamp residue i  effectively locked tsr output in a kinase on state abrogating chemotactic responses a second amino acid replacement in the same hamp packing layer alleviated the i  a and i  s signaling defects receptors with the suppressor changes alone mediated chemotaxis in adaptation proficient cells but exhibited altered sensitivity to serine stimuli two of the suppressors s  e and s  a shifted tsr output toward the kinase off state but two others s  g and l  f shifted output toward a kinase on state the alleviation of locked on defects by on shifted suppressors implies that tsr hamp has several conformationally distinct kinase active output states and that hamp signaling might involve dynamic shifts over a range of bundle conformations
