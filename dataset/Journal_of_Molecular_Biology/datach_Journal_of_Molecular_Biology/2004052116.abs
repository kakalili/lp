architecture and folding mechanism of the azoarcus group i pre trna
self splicing rnas must evolve to function in their specific exon context the conformation of a group i pre trnaile from the bacterium azoarcus was probed by ribonuclease t and hydroxyl radical cleavage and by native gel electrophoresis biochemical data and three dimensional models of the pre trna showed that the trna is folded and that the trna and intron sequences form separate tertiary domains models of the active site before steps  and  of the splicing reaction predict that exchange of the external g cofactor and the   terminal g is accomplished by a slight conformational change in p  of the azoarcus group i intron kinetic assays showed that the pre trna folds in minutes much more slowly than the intron alone the dependence of the folding kinetics on mg  and the concentration of urea and rnase t experiments showed that formation of native pre trna is delayed by misfolding of p  p  including mispairing beween residues in p and the trna thus although the intron and trna sequences form separate domains in the native pre trna their folding is coupled via metastable non native base pairs this could help prevent premature processing of the   and   ends of unspliced pre trna
