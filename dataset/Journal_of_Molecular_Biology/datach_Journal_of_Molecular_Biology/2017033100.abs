molecular regulation of alternative polyadenylation apa within the drosophila nervous system
alternative polyadenylation apa is a widespread gene regulatory mechanism that generates mrnas with different   ends allowing them to interact with different sets of rna regulators such as micrornas and rna binding proteins recent studies have shown that during development neural tissues produce mrnas with particularly long   utrs suggesting that such extensions might be important for neural development and function despite this the mechanisms underlying neural apa are not well understood here we investigate this problem within the drosophila nervous system focusing on the roles played by general cleavage and polyadenylation factors cpa factors  in particular we examine the model that modulations in cpa factor concentration may affect apa during development for this we first analyse the expression of the drosophila orthologues of all mammalian cpa factors and note that their expression decreases during embryogenesis in contrast to this global developmental decrease in cpa factor expression we see that cleavage factor i cfi expression is actually elevated in the late embryonic central nervous system suggesting that cfi might play a special role in neural tissues to test this we use the uas gal system to deplete cfi proteins from neural tissue and observe that in this condition multiple genes switch their apa patterns demonstrating a role of cfi in apa control during drosophila neural development furthermore analysis of genes with   utr extensions of different length leads us to suggest a novel relation between   utr length and sensitivity to cpa factor expression our work thus contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms of apa control within the developing central nervous system
