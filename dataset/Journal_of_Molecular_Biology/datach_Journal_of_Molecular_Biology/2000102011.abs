solution structure of the two n terminal rna binding domains of nucleolin and nmr study of the interaction with its rna target edited by m f summers
nucleolin is an abundant  kda nucleolar protein involved in many aspects of ribosomal rna biogenesis the central region of nucleolin contains four tandem consensus rna binding domains rbd  the two most n terminal domains rbd  bind with nanomolar affinity to an rna stem loop containing the consensus sequence ucccga in the loop we have determined the solution structure of nucleolin rbd  in its free form and have studied its interaction with a  nt rna stem loop using multidimensional nmr spectroscopy the two rbds adopt the expected       fold but the position of the   strand in both domains differs from what was predicted from sequence alignments rbd and rbd are significantly different from each others and this is likely important in their sequence specific recognition of the rna rbd has a longer  helix  and a shorter     loop than rbd  and differs from most other rbds in these respects the two rbds are separated by a  amino acid flexible linker and do not interact with one another in the free protein this linker becomes ordered when rbd  binds to the rna analysis of the observed noes between the protein and the rna indicates that both rbds interact with the rna loop via their  sheet each domain binds residues on one side of the loop specifically rbd contacts the   side and rbd contacts the
