dna melting and promoter clearance by eukaryotic rna polymerase i edited by r ebright
ribosomal rna transcription initiation requires the melting of dna to form an open complex formation of the first few phosphodiester bonds commencement of rna polymerase i movement along the dna clearance of the promoter and the formation of a steady state ternary elongation complex we examined dna melting and promoter clearance by using potassium permanganate diethylpyrocarbonate and methidiumpropyledta fe ii footprinting in combination these methods demonstrated   tif ib and rna polymerase i are the only proteins required for formation of an initial   base pair open promoter region this finding contradicts earlier results using diethylpyrocarbonate alone which suggested an rna synthesis requirement for stable melting   dna melting is temperature dependent with a tm between  and   c   temperature dependency of melting as well as stalling the polymerase at sites close to the transcription start site revealed that the melted dna region initially opens upstream of the transcription initiation site and enlarges in a downstream direction coordinate with initiation eventually attaining a steady state transcription bubble of approximately  base pairs   the rna dna hybrid protects the template dna from single strand footprinting reagents the hybrid is  bp in length consistent with the longer hybrid estimated by some for the escherichia coli polymerase and with the hybrids estimated for eukaryotic polymerases ii and iii
