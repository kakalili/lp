the course of phosphorus in the reaction of n acetyl l glutamate kinase determined from the structures of crystalline complexes including a complex with an alf   transition state mimic
n acetyl l glutamate kinase nagk  the structural paradigm of the enzymes of the amino acid kinase family catalyzes the phosphorylation of the  coo  group of n acetyl l glutamate nag by atp we determine here the crystal structures of nagk complexes with mgadp nag and the transition state analog alf   with mgadp and nag and with adp and so    comparison of these structures with that of the mgamppnp  nag complex allows to delineate three successive steps during phosphoryl transfer at the beginning when the attacking and leaving o atoms and the p atom are imperfectly aligned and the distance between the attacking o atom and the p atom is    midway at the bipyramidal intermediate with nearly perfect alignment and a distance of    and when the transfer is completed the transfer occurs in line and is strongly associative with lys and lys  stabilizing the transition state and the leaving group respectively and with lys  in contrast with an earlier proposal not being involved three water molecules found in all the complexes play together with asp  and the mg crucial structural roles two glycine rich loops     a and     b are also very important moving in the different complexes in concert with the ligands to which they are hydrogen bonded either locking them in place for reaction or stabilizing the transition state the active site is too narrow to accommodate the substrates without compressing the reacting groups and this compressive strain appears a crucial component of the catalytic mechanism of nagk and possibly of other enzymes of the amino acid kinase family such as carbamate kinase initial binding of the two substrates would require a different enzyme conformation with a wider active site and the energy of substrate binding would be used to change the conformation of the active center causing substrate strain towards the transition state
