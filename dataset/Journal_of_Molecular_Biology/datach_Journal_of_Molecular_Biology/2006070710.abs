thermodynamics reveal that helix four in the nls of nf  b p  anchors i b  forming a very stable complex
i b  is an ankyrin repeat protein that inhibits nf  b transcriptional activity by sequestering nf  b outside of the nucleus in resting cells we have characterized the binding thermodynamics and kinetics of the i b  ankyrin repeat domain to nf  b p  p  using surface plasmon resonance spr and isothermal titration calorimetry itc  spr data showed that the i b  and nf  b associate rapidly but dissociate very slowly leading to an extremely stable complex with a kd obs of approximately   pm at    c as reported previously the amino terminal dna binding domain of p  contributes little to the overall binding affinity conversely helix four of p  which forms part of the nuclear localization sequence was essential for high affinity binding this was surprising given the small size of the binding interface formed by this part of p  the nf  b p  p  heterodimer and p  homodimer bound i b  with almost indistinguishable thermodynamics except that the nf  b p  homodimer was characterized by a more favorable  hobs relative to the nf  b p  p  heterodimer both interactions were characterized by a large negative heat capacity change  cp obs  approximately half of which was contributed by the p  helix four that was necessary for tight binding this could not be accounted for readily by the small loss of buried non polar surface area and we hypothesize that the observed effect is due to additional folding of some regions of the complex
