solution nmr structure of the myosin phosphatase inhibitor protein cpi  shows phosphorylation induced conformational changes responsible for activation edited by p e wright
contractility of vascular smooth muscle depends on phosphorylation of myosin light chains and is modulated by hormonal control of myosin phosphatase activity signaling pathways activate kinases such as pkc or rho dependent kinases that phosphorylate the myosin phosphatase inhibitor protein called cpi   phosphorylation of cpi  at thr  enhances its inhibitory potency   fold creating a molecular on off switch for regulating contraction we report the solution nmr structure of the cpi  inhibitory domain residues      which retains the signature biological properties of the full length protein the final ensemble of  sets of nmr coordinates overlaid onto their mean structure with r m s d values of         for the backbone atoms the protein forms a novel four helix v shaped bundle comprised of a central anti parallel helix pair b c helices flanked by two large spiral loops formed by the n and c termini that are held together by another anti parallel helix pair a d helices stabilized by intercalated aromatic and aliphatic side chains chemical shift perturbations indicated that phosphorylation of thr  induces a conformational change involving displacement of helix a without significant movement of the other three helices this conformational change seems to flex one arm of the molecule thereby exposing new surfaces of the helix a and the nearby phosphorylation loop to form specific interactions with the catalytic site of the phosphatase this phosphorylation dependent conformational change offers new structural insights toward understanding the specificity of cpi  for myosin phosphatase and its function as a molecular switch
