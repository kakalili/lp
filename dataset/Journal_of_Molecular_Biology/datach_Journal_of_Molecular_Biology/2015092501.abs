structure within the denatured state of the helical protein domain bbl
protein denatured states are the origin of both healthy and toxic conformational species denatured states of ultrafast folding proteins are of interest in mechanistic studies because they are energetically close to the kinetic bottleneck of folding however their transient nature makes them elusive to experiment here we generated the denatured state of the helical domain bbl that is poised to fold in microseconds by a single point mutation and combined circular dichroism spectroscopy single molecule fluorescence fluctuation analysis and computer simulation to characterize its structure and dynamics circular dichroism showed a largely unfolded ensemble with marginal helix but significant  sheet content main chain structure and dynamics were unaffected by side chain interactions that stabilize the native state as revealed by site directed mutagenesis and nanosecond loop closure kinetics probed by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy replica exchange and constant temperature molecular dynamics simulations showed a highly collapsed hydrogen bonded denatured state containing turn and  sheet structure and few nucleating helices in an otherwise unfolded ensemble an irregular  hairpin element that connects helices in the native fold was poised to be formed the surprising observation of  structure in regions that form helices in the native state is reconciled by a generic low energy pathway from the northwest quadrant of ramachandran space to the helical basin present under folding conditions proposed recently our results show that indeed rapid nucleation of helix emanates from  structure formed early within a collapsed ensemble of unfolded conformers
