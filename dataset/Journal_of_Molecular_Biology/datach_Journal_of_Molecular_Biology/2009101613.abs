adaptive evolution of p  thermodynamic stability
the thermodynamic stability of a protein plays an important role during evolution and adaptation in order to maintain a folded and active conformation p  is a tumour suppressor involved in the regulation of numerous genes human p  has an unusually low thermodynamic stability and is frequently inactivated by oncogenic missense mutations here we examined the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of p  dna binding domains from selected invertebrate and vertebrate species by differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium urea denaturation there is a correlation in the apparent melting temperature of p  with the body temperature of homeotherm vertebrates we found that p  from these organisms has a half life for spontaneous unfolding at organismal body temperature of     min we also found that p  from invertebrates has higher stability bearing more resemblance towards p  and p  from humans using structure guided mutagenesis on the human p  scaffold we demonstrated that the amino acid changes on the protein surface and in the protein interior lead to the elevated stability of p  orthologs we propose a model in which the p  dna binding domain has been shaped by the complex interplay of different selective pressures and underwent adaptive evolution leading to pronounced effects on its stability p  from vertebrates has evolved to have a low thermodynamic stability and similarly short spontaneous half life at organismal body temperature which is related to function
