molecular determinants of a native state prolyl isomerization
prolyl cis trans isomerizations determine the rates of many protein folding reactions and they can serve as molecular switches and timers the energy required to shift the prolyl cis trans equilibrium during these processes originates from conformational reactions that are linked structurally and energetically with prolyl isomerization we used the n domain of the gene  protein of phage fd to elucidate how such an energetic linkage develops in the course of folding the asp   pro  bond at the tip of a  hairpin of n is cis in the crystal structure but in fact it exists as a mixture of conformers in folded n  during refolding about   kj mol   of conformational energy becomes available for a  fold shift of the cis trans equilibrium constant at pro   from   in the unfolded to    in the folded form we combined single and double mixing kinetic experiments with a mutational analysis to identify the structural origin of this proline shift energy and to elucidate the molecular path for the transfer of this energy to pro   it originates largely if not entirely from the two stranded  sheet at the base of the pro  hairpin the two strands improve their stabilizing interactions when pro  is cis and this stabilization is propagated to pro   because the connector peptides between the  strands and pro  are native like folded when pro  is cis in the presence of a trans pro   the connector peptides are locally unfolded and thus pro  is structurally and energetically uncoupled from the  sheet such interrelations between local folding and prolyl isomerization and the potential modulation by prolyl isomerases might also be used to break and reestablish slow communication pathways in proteins
