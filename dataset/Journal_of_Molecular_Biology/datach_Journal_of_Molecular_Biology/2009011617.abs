the disulfide relay system of mitochondria is required for the biogenesis of mitochondrial ccs and sod
cells protect themselves against oxygen stress and reactive oxygen species an important enzyme in this process is superoxide dismutase sod  which converts superoxide radicals into water and hydrogen peroxide the biogenesis of functional sod is dependent on its copper chaperone ccs  which introduces a disulfide bond and a copper ion into sod  ccs and sod are present in the cytosol but are also found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space ims  the compartment between the outer and the inner membrane of mitochondria ccs mediates mitochondrial localization of sod here we report on the biogenesis of the fractions of ccs and sod present in mitochondria of saccharomyces cerevisiae the ims of mitochondria harbors a disulfide relay system consisting of the import receptor mia  and the thiol oxidase erv  which drives the import of substrates with conserved cysteine residues arranged in typical twin cx c and twin cx c motifs we show that depletion of mia  results in decreased levels of ccs and sod  on the other hand overexpression of mia  increased the mitochondrial fraction of both proteins in addition the import rates of ccs were enhanced by increased levels of mia  and reduced upon depletion of mia  mia  forms mixed disulfides with ccs  suggesting a role of mia  for the generation of disulfide bonds in ccs  we suggest that the disulfide relay system transfers disulfide bonds via mia  to ccs  which then shuttles disulfide bonds to sod  in conclusion the disulfide relay system is crucial for the import of ccs  thereby affecting the transport of sod  and it can control the distribution of ccs and sod between the ims of mitochondria and the cytosol
