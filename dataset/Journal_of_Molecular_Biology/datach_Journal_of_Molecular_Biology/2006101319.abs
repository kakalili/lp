ultra high resolution crystal structure of hiv  protease mutant reveals two binding sites for clinical inhibitor tmc
tmc   darunavir is a promising clinical inhibitor of hiv  protease pr for treatment of drug resistant hiv aids we report the ultra high     resolution crystal structure of the tmc  complex with pr containing the drug resistant mutation v i prv i  and the     resolution structure of a complex with prm l these structures show tmc  bound at two distinct sites one in the active site cavity and the second on the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the pr dimer remarkably tmc  binds at these two sites simultaneously in two diastereomers related by inversion of the sulfonamide nitrogen moreover the flap site is shaped to accommodate the diastereomer with the s enantiomeric nitrogen rather than the one with the r enantiomeric nitrogen the existence of the second binding site and two diastereomers suggest a mechanism for the high effectiveness of tmc  on drug resistant hiv and the potential design of new inhibitors
