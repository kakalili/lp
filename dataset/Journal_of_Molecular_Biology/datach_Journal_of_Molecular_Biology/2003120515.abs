structure of an influenza neuraminidase  diabody complex by electron cryomicroscopy and image analysis
the structure of a complex between a bivalent diabody and its antigen influenza neuraminidase has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy of single particles and image analysis a three dimensional reconstruction has been interpreted in terms of high resolution x ray models of the component proteins the complex consists of two neuraminidase tetramers cross linked by four diabodies with   point symmetry the structure and symmetry of the complex is determined uniquely by packing constraints consistent with the maximum possible number of diabody cross links diabodies may provide a useful approach to the structure determination of small proteins by incorporating the proteins into large symmetric complexes followed by single particle electron microscopy
