structural determinants of glutathione transferases with azathioprine activity identified by dna shuffling of alpha class members
a library of alpha class glutathione transferases gsts  composed of chimeric enzymes derived from human a   a  and a   bovine a   and rat a  and a   cdna sequences was constructed by the method of dna shuffling the gst variants were screened in bacterial lysates for activity with the immunosuppressive agent azathioprine a prodrug that is transformed into its active form  mercaptopurine by reaction with the tripeptide glutathione catalyzed by gsts important structural determinants for activity with azathioprine were recognized by means of primary structure analysis and activities of purified enzymes chosen from the screening the amino acid sequences could be divided into  exchangeable segments on the basis of the primary structures of  chosen clones segments      and  were identified as primary determinants of the azathioprine activity representing two of the regions forming the substrate binding h site segments  and  are situated in the c terminal helix characterizing alpha class gsts which is instrumental in their catalytic function the study demonstrates the power of dna shuffling in identifying segments of primary structure that are important for catalytic activity with a targeted substrate gsts in combination with azathioprine have potential as selectable markers for use in gene therapy knowledge of activity determining segments in the structure is valuable in the protein engineering of glutathione transferase for enhanced or suppressed activity
