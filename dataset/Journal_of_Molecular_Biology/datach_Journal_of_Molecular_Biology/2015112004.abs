bacterial networks in cells and communities
research on the bacterial regulatory networks is currently experiencing a true revival driven by advances in methodology and by emergence of novel concepts the biannual conference bacterial networks bacnet  held in may    in sant feliu de gu xols spain covered progress in the studies of regulatory networks that control bacterial physiology cell biology stress responses metabolism collective behavior and evolution it demonstrated how interdisciplinary approaches that combine molecular biology and biochemistry with the latest microscopy developments whole cell  omics approaches and mathematical modeling can help understand design principles relevant in microbiology it further showed how current biotechnology and medical microbiology could profit from our knowledge of and ability to engineer regulatory networks of bacteria
