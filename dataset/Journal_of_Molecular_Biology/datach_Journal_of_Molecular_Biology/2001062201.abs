holliday junction resolving enzymes of archaeal viruses sirv and sirv  edited by j karn
in the final stages of genetic recombination holliday junction resolving enzymes transform the four way dna intermediate into two duplex dna molecules by introducing pairs of staggered nicks flanking the junction this fundamental process is apparently common to cells from all three domains of life two cellular resolving enzymes from extremely thermophilic representatives of both kingdoms of the domain archaea the euryarchaeon pyrococcus furiosus and the crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus have been described recently here we report for the first time the isolation purification and characterization of holliday junction cleaving enzymes hjc from two archaeal viruses both viruses sirv and sirv  infect sulfolobus islandicus their hjcs both consist of   amino acid residues aa differing only by  aa both proteins bind selectively to synthetic holliday structure analogues with an apparent dissociation constant of  nm in the presence of mg  the enzymes produce identical cleavage patterns near the junction while s islandicus shows optimal growth at about   c the nucleolytic activities of recombinant sirv hjc was highest between   c and   c based on their specificity for four way dna structures the enzymes may play a general role in genetic recombination dna repair and the resolution of replicative intermediates
