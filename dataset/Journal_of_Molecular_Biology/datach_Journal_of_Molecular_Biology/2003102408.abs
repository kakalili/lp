sites for interaction between gal p and gal p in kluyveromyces lactis structural model of galactokinase based on homology to the ghmp protein family
the induction of transcription of the galactose genes in yeast involves the galactose dependent binding of scgal p in saccharomyces cerevisiae or klgal p in kluyveromyces lactis to gal p this binding abrogates gal  s inhibitory effect on the activation domain of gal p which can then activate transcription here we describe the isolation and characterization of new interaction mutants of k lactis gal and gal  using a two hybrid screen we present the first structural model for gal p to be based on the published crystal structures of other proteins belonging to the ghmp galactokinase homoserine kinase mevalonate kinase and phosphomevalonate kinase kinase family and our own x ray diffraction data of gal p crystals at   resolution the locations of the various mutations in the modelled gal p structure identify domains involved in the interaction with gal p and provide a structural explanation for the phenotype of constitutive gal mutations
