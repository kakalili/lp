poxvirus k protein adopts a bcl  fold biochemical mapping of its interactions with human dead box rna helicase ddx
poxviruses have evolved numerous strategies to evade host innate immunity vaccinia virus k is a   residue protein with previously unknown structure that is highly conserved in the orthopoxvirus family k bears sequence and functional similarities to a  which interacts with interleukin receptor associated kinase  and tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor  to suppress nuclear factor  b activation and to stimulate the secretion of the anti inflammatory cytokine interleukin   in contrast to a  k forms a complex with dead box rna helicase ddx  thereby suppressing ddx mediated ifnb promoter induction we determined the nmr solution structure of k to provide insight into the structural basis for poxvirus antagonism of innate immune signaling the structure reveals an  helical fold belonging to the bcl  family despite an unrelated primary sequence nmr chemical shift mapping studies have localized the binding surface for ddx on a negatively charged face of k  furthermore thermodynamic studies have mapped the k binding region to a  residue n terminal fragment of ddx  ahead of the core rna helicase domains
