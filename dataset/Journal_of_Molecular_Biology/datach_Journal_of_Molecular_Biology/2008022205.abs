mim functions in an oligomeric form to facilitate the integration of tom  into the mitochondrial outer membrane
the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane tom complex is the general entry site into the organelle for newly synthesized proteins despite its central role in the biogenesis of mitochondria the assembly process of this complex is not completely understood mim  mitochondrial import protein  is a mitochondrial outer membrane protein with an undefined role in the assembly of the tom complex the protein is composed of an n terminal cytosolic domain a central putative transmembrane segment tms and a c terminal domain facing the intermembrane space here we show that mim is required for the integration of the import receptor tom  into the outer membrane we further investigated what the structural characteristics allowing mim to fulfil its function are the n and c terminal domains of mim are crucial neither for the function of the protein nor for its biogenesis thus the tms of mim is the minimal functional domain of the protein we show that mim forms homo oligomeric structures via its tms which contains two helix dimerization gxxxg motifs mim with mutated gxxxg motifs did not form oligomeric structures and was inactive with all these data taken together we propose that the homo oligomerization of mim allows it to fulfil its function in promoting the integration of tom  into the mitochondrial outer membrane
