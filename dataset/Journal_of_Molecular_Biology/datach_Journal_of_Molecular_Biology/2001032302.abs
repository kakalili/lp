core and surface mutations affect folding kinetics stability and cooperativity in il   does alteration in buried water play a role  edited by c r matthews
interleukin   il   is a cytokine and a member of the  trefoil superfamily of protein structures an interesting feature in the folding of il   shared with some other members of the same topological family is the existence of a slow step in folding to the native conformation from a discrete intermediate wanting to probe the nature of this slow step in the folding of wt il       seconds  we made ten sequence variants of il   l a t q t g c s c a n g n d l a r p and r q  where all mutations are located along strand  this strand is not protected from hydrogen exchange until late in folding most of the mutations showed little effect on the kinetics of folding for il   however c is clearly involved in both the late and the early steps in folding while sequence variants at l  and l affect only late events in folding the value of the slowest relaxation time    which is associated with the rate of native protein formation increased for the refolding of c s while c a l a and l a showed smaller but systematic increases in the value of   for both c s and c a the value of the step associated with formation of the intermediate    was independent of denaturant concentration in addition mutations in the hydrophobic core l a c a c s and l a and surprisingly along the surface t g t q and n g alter the stability the most destabilizing mutations show changes in equilibrium unfolding cooperativity which is atypical for destabilizing mutations in il   crystallographic studies indicate that mutations along strand  may alter the number of ordered water molecules within the core thus side chain replacement in this region can disrupt essential main chain interactions mediated by ordered water contacts in a highly cooperative network of hydrogen bonding
