crystal structures of two solute receptors for l cystine and l cysteine respectively of the human pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae
atp binding cassette abc transporters are integral membrane proteins that carry a variety of substrates across biological membranes at the expense of atp the here considered prokaryotic canonical importers consist of three entities an extracellular solute receptor two membrane intrinsic proteins forming a translocation pathway and two cytoplasmic atp binding subunits the ngo    and ngo    gene clusters from the human pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae were predicted by sequence homology as abc transporters for the uptake of cystine and cysteine respectively and chosen for structural characterization the structure of the receptor component ngo   was obtained in a ligand free  open  conformation and in a  closed  conformation when co crystallized with l cystine our data provide the first structural information of an l cystine abc transporter dissociation constants of  and   nm for l cystine and l selenocystine respectively were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry in contrast l cystathionine and l djenkolic acid are weak binders while no binding was detectable for s methyl l cysteine mutational analysis of two residues from the binding pocket trp  and tyr  revealed that the latter is crucial for l cystine binding the structure of the ngo   receptor was obtained in closed conformation in complex with co purified l cysteine the protein binds l cysteine with a kd of   nm comparison of the structures of both receptors and analysis of the ligand binding sites shed light on the mode of ligand recognition and provides insight into the tight binding of both substrates moreover since l cystine limitation leads to reduction in virulence of n gonorrhoeae ngo   might be suited as target for an antimicrobial vaccine
