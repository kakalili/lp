mapping the structure of folding cores in tim barrel proteins by hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry the roles of motif and sequence for the indole  glycerol phosphate synthase from sulfolobus solfataricus
to test the roles of motif and amino acid sequence in the folding mechanisms of tim barrel proteins hydrogen deuterium exchange was used to explore the structure of the stable folding intermediates for the of indole  glycerol phosphate synthase from sulfolobus solfataricus sigps  previous studies of the urea denaturation of sigps revealed the presence of an intermediate that is highly populated at     m urea and contains    of the secondary structure of the native n state kinetic studies showed that this apparent equilibrium intermediate is actually comprised of two thermodynamically distinct species ia and ib to probe the location of the secondary structure in this pair of stable on pathway intermediates the equilibrium unfolding process of sigps was monitored by hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry the intact protein and pepsin digested fragments were studied at various concentrations of urea by electrospray and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry respectively intact sigps strongly protects at least  amide protons from hydrogen deuterium exchange in the intermediate states demonstrating the presence of stable folded cores when the protection patterns and the exchange mechanisms for the peptides are considered with the proposed folding mechanism the results can be interpreted to define the structural boundaries of ia and ib comparison of these results with previous hydrogen deuterium exchange studies on another tim barrel protein of low sequence identify   tryptophan synthase  ts  indicates that the thermodynamic states corresponding to the folding intermediates are better conserved than their structures although the tim barrel motif appears to define the basic features of the folding free energy surface the structures of the partially folded states that appear during the folding reaction depend on the amino acid sequence markedly the good correlation between the hydrogen deuterium exchange patterns of sigps and  ts with the locations of hydrophobic clusters defined by isoleucine leucine and valine residues suggests that branch aliphatic side chains play a critical role in defining the structures of the equilibrium intermediates
