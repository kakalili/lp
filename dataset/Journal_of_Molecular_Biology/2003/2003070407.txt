Aberration of eukaryotic topoisomerase I catalysis leads to potentially recombinogenic pathways by allowing the joining of heterologous DNA strands. Recently, a new ligation pathway (flap ligation) was presented for vaccinia virus topoisomerase I, in which blunt end cleavage complexes ligate the recessed end of duplex acceptors having a single-stranded 3′-tail. This reaction was suggested to play an important role in the repair of topoisomerase I-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we characterize flap ligation mediated by human topoisomerase I. We demonstrate that cleavage complexes containing the enzyme at a blunt end allow invasion of a 3′-acceptor tail matching the scissile strand of the donor, which facilitates ligation of the recessed 5′-hydroxyl end. However, the reaction was strictly dependent on the length of double-stranded DNA of the donor complexes, and longer stretches of base-pairing inhibited strand invasion. The stabilization of the DNA helix was most probably provided by the covalently bound enzyme itself, since deleting the N-terminal domain of human topoisomerase I stimulated flap ligation. We suggest that stabilization of the DNA duplex upon enzyme binding may play an important role during normal topoisomerase I catalysis by preventing undesired strand transfer reactions. For flap ligation to function in a repair pathway, factors other than topoisomerase I, such as helicases, would be necessary to unwind the DNA duplex and allow strand invasion.
