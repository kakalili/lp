We have previously shown the existence of two DNA-binding sites on the globular domain of H5 (termed GH5), both of which are required for nucleosome organisation, as judged by the protection of a 166 bp chromatosome intermediate during micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin. This supports a model in which GH5 contacts two duplexes on the nucleosome. However, studies of a nucleosome assembled on the 5 S rRNA gene have argued against the requirement for two DNA-binding sites for chromatosome protection, which has implications for the role of linker histones. We have used this proposed difference in the requirement for a second site on the globular domain in the two models as a means of investigating whether bulk and reconstituted 5 S nucleosomes are indeed fundamentally different. GH5 protects a 166 bp chromatosome in both “bulk” and 5 S systems, and in both cases protection is abolished when all four basic residues in site II are replaced by alanine. Binding to four-way DNA junctions, which present a pair of juxtaposed duplexes, is also abolished. Single mutations of the basic residues did not abolish chromatosome protection in either system, or binding to four-way junctions, suggesting that the residues function as a cluster. Both bulk and 5 S nucleosomes thus require a functional second DNA-binding site on GH5 in order to bind properly to the nucleosome. This is likely to reflect a similar mode of binding in each case, in which two DNA duplexes are contacted in the nucleosome. There is no indication from these experiments that linker histones bind fundamentally differently to 5 S and bulk nucleosomes.
