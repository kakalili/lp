calculation of pkas in rna on the structural origins and functional roles of protonated nucleotides
pka calculations based on the poisson  boltzmann equation have been widely used to study proteins and more recently dna however much less attention has been paid to the calculation of pka shifts in rna there is accumulating evidence that protonated nucleotides can stabilize rna structure and participate in enzyme catalysis within ribozymes here we calculate the pka shifts of nucleotides in rna structures using numerical solutions to the poisson  boltzmann equation we find that significant shifts are predicted for several nucleotides in two catalytic rnas the hairpin ribozyme and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and that the shifts are likely to be related to their functions we explore how different structural environments shift the pkas of nucleotides from their solution values rna structures appear to use two basic strategies to shift pkas  a the formation of compact structural motifs with structurally conserved electrostatic interactions and b the arrangement of the phosphodiester backbone to focus negative electrostatic potential in specific regions
