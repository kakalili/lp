The energy dissipated during the atomic force microscopy-based mechanical unfolding and extension of proteins is typically an order of magnitude greater than their folding free energy. The vast majority of the “excess” energy dissipated is thought to arise due to backbone conformational entropy losses as the solvated, random-coil unfolded state is stretched into an extended, low-entropy conformation. We have investigated this hypothesis in light of recent measurements of the energy dissipated during the mechanical unfolding of “polyproteins” comprised of multiple, homogeneous domains. Given the assumption that backbone conformational entropy losses account for the vast majority of the energy dissipated (an assumption supported by numerous lines of experimental evidence), we estimate that ∼19(±2)J/(molKresidue) of entropy is lost during the extension of three mechanically stable β-sheet polyproteins. If, as suggested by measured peak-to-peak extension distances, pulling proceeds to near completion, this estimate corresponds to the absolute backbone conformational entropy of the unfolded state. As such, it is exceedingly close to previous theoretical and semi-empirical estimates that place this value at ∼20J/(molKresidue). The estimated backbone conformational entropy lost during the extension of two helical polyproteins, which, in contrast to the mechanically stable β-sheet polyproteins, rupture at very low applied forces, is three- to sixfold less. Either previous estimates of the backbone conformational entropy are significantly in error, or the reduced mechanical strength of the helical proteins leads to the rupture of a subsequent domain before full extension (and thus complete entropy loss) is achieved.
