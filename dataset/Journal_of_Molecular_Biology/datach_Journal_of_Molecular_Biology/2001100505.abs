the energetics of off rotamer protein side chain conformations edited by f cohen
non rotameric   off rotamer   conformations are commonly observed for the side chains of protein crystal structures this study examines whether such conformations are real or artifactual by comparing the energetics of on and off rotamer side chain conformations calculated with the charmm energy function energy based predictions of side chain orientation are carried out by rigid geometry mapping in the presence of the fixed protein environment for   non polar side chains in  proteins for which high resolution     or better structures are available for on rotamer conformations     are correctly predicted i e they correspond to the absolute minima of their local side chain energy maps generally to within    or less  by contrast for the observed off rotamer side chain conformations     are predicted correctly this difference is statistically significant p lt     and suggests that while most of the observed off rotamer conformations are real many of the erroneously predicted ones are likely to be artifacts of the x ray refinements probabilities for off rotamer conformations of the non polar side chains are calculated to be       by adaptive umbrella sampled molecular dynamics trajectories of individual amino acid residues in vacuum and in the presence of an average protein or aqueous dielectric environment these results correspond closely to the    off rotamer fraction predicted by the rigid geometry mapping studies since these values are about one half of the    off rotamer fraction observed in the x ray structures they support the conclusion that many of the latter are artifacts in both the rigid geometry mapping and the molecular dynamics studies the discrepancies between the predicted and observed fractions of off rotamer conformations are largest for leucine residues     versus     the simulations for the isolated amino acid residues indicate that the real off rotamer frequency of     is consistent with the internal side chain and local side chain backbone energetics and does not originate from shifts due to the protein the present results suggest that energy based rotation maps can be used to find side chain positional artifacts that appear in crystal structures based on refinements in the   resolution range
