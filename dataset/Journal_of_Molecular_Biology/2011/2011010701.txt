HIV-1 Tat,Fab′,intrinsically disordered protein,crystal structure,induced folding
Tat, the transcriptional activator protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), is critical for viral replication and is a potential HIV-1 vaccine candidate. This intrinsically disordered protein is present in the extracellular medium and is involved in the pathogenicity of HIV through its interaction with different cellular and viral biological partners. A monoclonal antibody termed 11H6H1, which is specific for the N-terminal region of Tat, was selected for a functional and structural study of the HIV-1 Tat protein. The equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of Tat and Tat fragments complexed with 11H6H1 were estimated by competitive ELISA. Tat contains a single tryptophan residue, Trp11, located in the N-terminal region. We show that the substitution of Trp11 by a phenylalanine completely abolishes the binding of 11H6H1, whereas the transactivating activity of Tat is preserved. The epitope recognized by 11H6H1 was restricted to the 9-mer peptide P6KLEPWKHP14 centered on Trp11. The crystal structures of this 9-mer peptide and of an overlapping 15-mer peptide were determined in complex with Fab′ 11H6H1 at 2.4 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively. Tat is intrinsically disordered and can undergo induced folding upon association with a biological partner. Our crystallographic study reveals that the two Tat peptides, which are lodged in the U-shaped groove of the Fab′ antigen-binding site, adopt a standard type I β-turn conformation. The central Trp11 that is critical for Fab′ recognition is further stabilized by π-stacking interactions. The structural and biological consequences of this induced folding in HIV pathogenesis are discussed.
