novel structures for  actinin f actin interactions and their implications for actin  membrane attachment and tension sensing in the cytoskeleton
we have applied correspondence analysis to electron micrographs of  d rafts of f actin cross linked with  actinin on a lipid monolayer to investigate  actinin f actin binding and cross linking more than   actin crossover repeats each with one to five  actinin molecules bound were selected aligned and grouped to produce class averages of  actinin cross links with   fold improvement in the stochastic signal to noise ratio measurements and comparative molecular models show variation in the distance separating actin binding domains and the angle of the  actinin cross links rafts of f actin and  actinin formed predominantly polar  d arrays of actin filaments with occasional insertion of filaments of opposite polarity unique to this study are the numbers of  actinin molecules bound to successive crossovers on the same actin filament these  monofilament  bound  actinin molecules may reflect a new mode of interaction for  actinin particularly in protein dense actin  membrane attachments in focal adhesions these results suggest that  actinin is not simply a rigid spacer between actin filaments but rather a flexible cross linking scaffolding and anchoring protein we suggest these properties of  actinin may contribute to tension sensing in actin bundles
