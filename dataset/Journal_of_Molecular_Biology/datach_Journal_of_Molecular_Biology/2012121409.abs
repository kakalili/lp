nucleotide resolution profiling of rna recombination in the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic rna virus by next generation sequencing
next generation sequencing has been used in numerous investigations to characterize and quantify the genetic diversity of a virus sample through the mapping of polymorphisms and measurement of mutation frequencies next generation sequencing has also been employed to identify recombination events occurring within the genomes of higher organisms for example detecting alternative rna splicing events and oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements here we combine these two approaches to profile rna recombination within the encapsidated genome of a eukaryotic rna virus flock house virus we detect hundreds of thousands of recombination events with single nucleotide resolution which result in diversity in the encapsidated genome rivaling that due to mismatch mutation we detect previously identified defective rnas as well as many other abundant and novel defective rnas our approach is exceptionally sensitive and unbiased and requires no prior knowledge beyond the virus genome sequence rna recombination is a powerful driving force behind the evolution and adaptation of rna viruses the strategy implemented here is widely applicable and provides a highly detailed description of the complex mutational landscape of the transmissible viral genome
