the molecular basis for different recognition of substrates by phosphodiesterase families  and
phosphodiesterases pdes are key enzymes that control the cellular concentrations of the second messengers camp and cgmp the mechanism for selective recognition of substrates camp and cgmp by individual pde families remains a puzzle to understand the mechanism for substrate recognition by pde enzymes the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of an inactive d  n mutant of pde d in complex with substrate camp has been determined at     resolution the structure shows that gln  forms only one hydrogen bond with the adenine of camp this finding provides experimental evidence against the hypothesis of two hydrogen bonds between the invariant glutamine and the substrate camp in pde  and thus suggests that the widely circulated  glutamine switch  model is unlikely the mechanism for substrate recognition by pdes a structure comparison between pde d  camp and pde a  camp reveals an anti configuration of camp in pde d but syn in pde a  in addition to different contact patterns of camp in these two structures these observations imply that individual pde families have their characteristic mechanisms for substrate recognition
