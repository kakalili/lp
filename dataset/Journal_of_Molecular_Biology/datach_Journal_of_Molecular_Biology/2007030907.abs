a structural core within apolipoprotein c ii amyloid fibrils identified using hydrogen exchange and proteolysis
plasma apolipoproteins show  helical structure in the lipid bound state and limited conformational stability in the absence of lipid this structural instability of lipid free apolipoproteins may account for the high propensity of apolipoproteins to aggregate and accumulate in disease related amyloid deposits here we explore the properties of amyloid fibrils formed by apolipoproteins using human apolipoprotein apo c ii as a model system hydrogen deuterium exchange and nmr spectroscopy of apoc ii fibrils revealed core regions between residues     and     with reduced amide proton exchange rates compared to monomeric apoc ii the c terminal core region was also identified by partial proteolysis of apoc ii amyloid fibrils using endoproteinase gluc and proteinase k complete tryptic hydrolysis of apoc ii fibrils followed by centrifugation yielded a single peptide in the pellet fraction identified using mass spectrometry as apoc ii    synthetic apoc ii   readily formed fibrils albeit with a different morphology and thioflavint fluorescence yield compared to full length apoc ii studies with smaller peptides narrowed this fibril forming core to a region within residues     we postulate that the ability of apoc ii   to independently form amyloid fibrils drives fibril formation by apoc ii these specific amyloid forming regions within apolipoproteins may underlie the propensity of apolipoproteins and their peptide derivatives to accumulate in amyloid deposits in vivo
