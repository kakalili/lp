cooperative interactions and a non native buried trp in the unfolded state of an sh domain
the presence of residual structure in the unfolded state of the n terminal sh domain of drosophila drk drkn sh domain has been investigated using far and near uv circular dichroism cd  fluorescence and nmr spectroscopy the unfolded uexch state of the drkn sh domain is significantly populated and exists in equilibrium with the folded fexch state under non denaturing conditions near physiological ph denaturation experiments have been performed on the drkn sh domain in order to monitor the change in ellipticity fluorescence intensity and chemical shift between the uexch state and chemically or thermally denatured states differences between the unfolded and chemically or thermally denatured states highlight specific areas of residual structure in the unfolded state that are cooperatively disrupted upon denaturation results provide evidence for cooperative interactions in the unfolded state involving residues of the central  sheet particularly the   strand denaturation as well as hydrogen exchange experiments demonstrate a non native burial of the trp ring within this  cooperative  core of the unfolded state these findings support the presence of non native hydrophobic clusters organised by trp rings within disordered states
