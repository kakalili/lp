pentameric assembly of potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein
we report the x ray crystal structure of human potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein  kctd  the first member of the family to be so characterized four findings were unexpected first the structure reveals assemblies of five subunits while tetramers were anticipated pentameric stoichiometry is observed also in solution by scanning transmission electron microscopy mass analysis and analytical ultracentrifugation second the same btb bric a brac tramtrack broad complex domain surface mediates the assembly of five kctd and four voltage gated k  kv channel subunits four amino acid differences appear crucial third kctd complexes have well defined n and c terminal modules separated by a flexible linker that swivels by   o the c module shows a new fold and is required to bind golgi reassembly stacking protein  with     m affinity as judged by surface plasmon resonance and ultracentrifugation fourth despite the homology reflected in its name kctd does not impact the operation of kv   kv   kv   or kv  channels
