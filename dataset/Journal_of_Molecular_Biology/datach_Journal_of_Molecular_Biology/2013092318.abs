dissecting partner recognition by an intrinsically disordered protein using descriptive random mutagenesis
in view of getting insights into the molecular determinants of the binding efficiency of intrinsically disordered proteins idps  we used random mutagenesis as a proof of concept we chose the interaction between the intrinsically disordered c terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein ntail and the x domain xd of the viral phosphoprotein and assessed how amino acid substitutions introduced at random within ntail affect partner recognition in contrast with directed evolution approaches we did not apply any selection and used the gene library approach not for production purposes but for achieving a better understanding of the ntail xd interaction for that reason and to differentiate our approach from similar approaches that make use of systematic i e  targeted mutagenesis we propose to call it  descriptive random mutagenesis   drm  ntail variants generated by error prone pcr were picked at random in the absence of selection pressure and were characterized in terms of sequence and binding abilities toward xd drm not only identified determinants of ntail xd interaction that were in good agreement with previous work but also provided new insights in particular we discovered that the primary interaction site is poorly evolvable in terms of binding abilities toward xd we also identified a critical ntail residue whose role in stabilizing the ntail xd complex had previously escaped detection and we identified ntail regulatory sites that dampen the interaction while being located outside the primary interaction site results show that drm is a valuable approach to study binding abilities of idps
