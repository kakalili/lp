crystal structure of a biliverdin ix  reductase enzyme  cofactor complex
biliverdin reductase bvr catalyzes the last step in heme degradation by reducing the  methene bridge of the open tetrapyrrole biliverdin ix  to bilirubin with the concomitant oxidation of a  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh or  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph cofactor bilirubin is the major bile pigment in mammals and has antioxidant and anticompliment activity we have determined x ray crystal structures of apo rat bvr and its complex with nadh at    and    resolution respectively in agreement with an independent structure determination of the apo enzyme bvr consists of an n terminal dinucleotide binding domain rossmann fold and a c terminal domain that contains a six stranded  sheet that is flanked on one face by several  helices the c terminal and n terminal domains interact extensively forming the active site cleft at their interface the cofactor complex structure reported here reveals that the cofactor nicotinamide ring extends into the active site cleft where it is adjacent to conserved amino acid residues and consistent with the known stereochemistry of the reaction catalyzed by bvr the si face of the ring is accessible for hydride transfer the only titratable side chain that appears to be suitably positioned to function as a general acid in catalysis is tyr  this residue however is not essential for catalysis since the tyr phe mutant protein retains   activity this finding suggests that the dominant role in catalysis may be performed by hydride transfer from the cofactor a process that may be promoted by proximity of the invariant residues glu  glu   and glu   to the nicotinamide ring
