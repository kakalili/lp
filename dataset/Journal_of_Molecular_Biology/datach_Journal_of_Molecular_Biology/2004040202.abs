interconverting the catalytic activities of     barrel enzymes from different metabolic pathways sequence requirements and molecular analysis
the     barrel enzymes n      phosphoribosyl formimino  aminoimidazole  carboxamide ribonucleotide isomerase thisa and imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase thisf from thermotoga maritima catalyze two successive reactions in the biosynthesis of histidine in both enzymes aspartate residues at the c terminal end of  strand  asp in thisa and asp  in thisf and  strand  asp  in thisa and asp  in thisf are essential for catalytic activity it was demonstrated earlier that in thisa the substitution of asp  by valine thisa d  v generates phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase trpf activity a related     barrel enzyme participating in tryptophan biosynthesis it is shown here that in thisf the corresponding substitution of asp  by valine thisf d  v also generates trpf activity to determine the effectiveness of individual amino acid exchanges in these conversions each of the  standard amino acid residues was introduced at position   of thisa and   of thisf by saturation random mutagenesis the thisa d  x and thisf d  x variants with trpf activity were identified by selection in vivo and the proteins purified and characterized the results obtained show that removal of the negatively charged carboxylate side chain at the c terminal end of  strand  is sufficient to establish trpf activity in thisa and thisf presumably because it allows the binding of the negatively charged trpf substrate phosphoribosylanthranilate in contrast the double mutants thisa d n d  v and thisf d n d  v did not show detectable activity demonstrating that the aspartate residues at the c terminal end of  strand  are essential for catalysis of the trpf reaction the ease with which trpf activity can be established on both the thisa and thisf scaffolds supports the evolutionary relationship of these three enzymes and highlights the functional plasticity of the     barrel enzyme fold
