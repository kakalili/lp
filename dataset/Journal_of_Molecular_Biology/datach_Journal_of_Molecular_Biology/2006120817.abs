hepatocyte nuclear factor  alpha ligand binding and f domains mediate interaction and transcriptional synergy with the pancreatic islet lim hd transcription factor isl
the orphan nuclear receptor hnf  and the lim homeodomain factor isl are co expressed in pancreatic  cells and are required for the differentiation and function of these endocrine cells hnf  activates numerous genes and mutations in its gene are associated with maturity onset diabetes of the young cofactors and transcription factors that interact with hnf  are crucial to modulate its transcriptional activity since the latter is not regulated by conventional ligands these transcriptional partners interact mainly through the hnf  af  module and the ligand binding domain which contains the af  module here we showed that isl could enhance the hnf   mediated activation of transcription of the hnf   ppar  and insulin i promoters isl interacted with the hnf  af  but also required the hnf  carboxy terminal f domain for optimal interaction and transcriptional synergy more specifically we found that naturally occurring hnf  isoforms differing only in their f domain exhibited different abilities to interact and synergize with isl  extending the crucial transcriptional modulatory role of the hnf  f domain hnf  interacted with both the homeodomain and the first lim domain of isl  we found that the transcriptional synergy between hnf  and isl involved an increase in hnf  loading on promoter the effect was more pronounced on the rat insulin i promoter containing binding sites for both hnf  and isl than on the human hnf  promoter lacking an isl binding site moreover isl could mediate the recruitment of the cofactor clim resulting in a further transcriptional enhancement of the hnf  promoter activity
