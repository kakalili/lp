the four canonical tpr subunits of human apc c form related homo dimeric structures and stack in parallel to form a tpr suprahelix
the anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome apc c is a large e ring cullin ubiquitin ligase composed of between  and  individual proteins a striking feature of the apc c is that only four proteins are involved in directly recognizing target proteins and catalyzing the assembly of a polyubiquitin chain all other subunits which account for gt   of the mass of the apc c provide scaffolding functions a major proportion of these scaffolding subunits are structurally related in metazoans there are four canonical tetratricopeptide repeat tpr proteins that form homo dimers apc cdc  apc cdc  apc and apc cdc   here we describe the crystal structure of the n terminal homo dimerization domain of schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc  cdc nterm  cdc nterm is composed of seven contiguous tpr motifs that self associate through a related mechanism to those of cdc  and cdc  using the cdc nterm structure we generated a model of full length cdc  the resultant  v  shaped molecule docks into the cdc  assigned density of the human apc c structure determined using negative stain electron microscopy em  based on sequence conservation we propose that apc forms a homo dimeric structure equivalent to those of cdc  cdc  and cdc  the model is consistent with the apc assigned density of the human apc c em structure the four canonical homo dimeric tpr proteins of human apc c stack in parallel on one side of the complex remarkably the uniform relative packing of neighboring tpr proteins generates a novel left handed suprahelical tpr assembly this finding has implications for understanding the assembly of other tpr containing multimeric complexes
