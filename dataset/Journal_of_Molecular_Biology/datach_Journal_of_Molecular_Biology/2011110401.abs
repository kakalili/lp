cyt aa toxin crystal structure reveals implications for its membrane perforating function
during sporulation bacillus thuringiensis subsp israelensis produces a mosquito larvicidal protein complex containing several crystalline and cytolytic cyt toxins here the activated monomeric form of cyt aa the most toxic cyt family member was isolated and crystallized and its structure was determined for the first time at     resolution cyt aa adopts a typical cytolysin fold containing a  sheet held by two surrounding  helical layers the absence of a  strand between residues v  and i  in the dimeric structure of cyt aa led us to deduce that this is the only essential segment for dimer formation and that activation of the toxin occurs by proteolytic processing of its n terminus based on the cyt aa structure we suggest that the toxicity of cyt aa and other nonrelated proteins all sharing a cytolysin fold is correlated with their ability to undergo conformational changes that are necessary prior to their membrane insertion and perforation this fold allows the  helical layers to swing away exposing the  sheet to insert into the membrane the identification of a putative lipid binding pocket between the  sheet and the helical layer of cyt aa supports this mechanism sequence based structural analysis of cyt aa revealed that the lack of activity of cyt ca may be related to the latter s inability to undergo this conformational change due to its lack of flexibility the pattern of the hemolytic activity of cyt aa presented here resembling that of pore forming agents  while differing from that imposed by ionic and nonionic detergents further supports the pore forming model by which conformational changes occur prior to membrane insertion and perforation
