protein footprinting in a complex milieu identifying the interaction surfaces of the chemotaxis adaptor protein chew
characterizing protein  protein interactions in a biologically relevant context is important for understanding the mechanisms of signal transduction most signal transduction systems are membrane associated and consist of large multiprotein complexes that undergo rapid reorganization  circumstances that present challenges to traditional structure determination methods to study protein  protein interactions in a biologically relevant complex milieu we employed a protein footprinting strategy based on isotope coded affinity tag icat reagents icat reagents are valuable tools for proteomics here we show their utility in an alternative application  they are ideal for protein footprinting in complex backgrounds because the affinity tag moiety allows for enrichment of alkylated species prior to analysis we employed a water soluble icat reagent to monitor cysteine accessibility and thereby to identify residues involved in two different protein  protein interactions in the escherichia coli chemotaxis signaling system the chemotaxis system is an archetypal transmembrane signaling pathway in which a complex protein superstructure underlies sophisticated sensory performance the formation of this superstructure depends on the adaptor protein chew which mediates a functionally important bridging interaction between transmembrane receptors and histidine kinase icat footprinting was used to map the surfaces of chew that interact with the large multidomain histidine kinase chea as well as with the transmembrane chemoreceptor tsr in native e coli membranes by leveraging the affinity tag we successfully identified chew surfaces responsible for chea  tsr interaction the proximity of the chea and tsr binding sites on chew suggests the formation of a composite chew  tsr surface for the recruitment of the signaling kinase to the chemoreceptor complex
