influence of transfer rna tertiary structure on aminoacylation efficiency by glutaminyl and cysteinyl trna synthetases edited by j doudna
the position of the tertiary levitt pair between nucleotides  and  in the transfer rna core region suggests a key role in stabilizing the joining of the two helical domains and in maintaining the relative orientations of the d and variable loops e coli trnagln possesses the canonical pu  py  trans pairing at this position g  c   while the trnacys species from this organism instead features an unusual g  g  pair to explore the structural context dependence of a g  g  levitt pair a number of trnagln species containing g  g  were constructed and evaluated as substrates for glutaminyl and cysteinyl trna synthetases the glutaminylation efficiencies of these mutant trnas are reduced by two to tenfold compared with native trnagln consistent with previous findings that the tertiary core of this trna plays a role in glnrs recognition introduction of trnacys identity nucleotides at the acceptor and anticodon ends of trnagln produced a trna substrate which was efficiently aminoacylated by cysrs even though the tertiary core region of this species contains the trnagln g  c  pair surprisingly introduction of g  g  into the non cognate trnagln tertiary core then significantly impairs cysrs recognition by contrast previous work has shown that cysrs aminoacylates trnacys core regions containing g  g  with much better efficiency than those with g  c  therefore tertiary nucleotides surrounding the levitt pair must significantly modulate the efficiency of aminoacylation by cysrs to explore the detailed nature of the structural interdependence crystal structures of two trnagln mutants containing g  g  were determined bound to glnrs these structures show that the larger purine ring of g  is accommodated by rotation into the syn position with the n nitrogen serving as hydrogen bond acceptor from several groups of g  the g  g  conformations differ significantly compared to that observed in the native trnacys structure bound to ef tu further implicating an important role for surrounding nucleotides in maintaining the integrity of the tertiary core and its consequent ability to present crucial recognition determinants to aminoacyl trna synthetases
