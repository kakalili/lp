near uv circular dichroism reveals structural transitions of vimentin subunits during intermediate filament assembly
in vitro assembly of vimentin intermediate filaments ifs proceeds from soluble reconstituted tetrameric complexes to mature filaments in three distinct stages   within the first seconds after initiation of assembly tetramers laterally associate into unit length filaments ulfs  on average   nm wide   for the next few minutes ulfs grow by longitudinal annealing into short immature filaments   almost concomitant with elongation these immature filaments begin to radially compact yielding    nm wide ifs at around   min the near uv cd signal of soluble tetramers exhibits two main peaks at   and   nm which do not change during ulf formation in contrast the cd signal of mature ifs exhibits two major changes   the   nm band denoting the transition of the tyrosines from the ground state to the first vibrational mode of the excited state is lost   a red shifted band appears at   nm indicating the emergence of a new electronic species these changes take place independently and at different time scales the   nm signal disappears within the first minute of assembly compatible with increased rigidity of the tyrosines during elongation of the ulfs the rise of the   nm band has a lifetime of    min and denotes the generation of phenolates by deprotonation of the tyrosines hydroxyl group after they relocalize into a negatively charged environment the appearance of such tyrosine binding  pockets  in the assembling filaments highlights an essential part of the molecular rearrangements characterizing the later stages of the assembly process including the radial compaction
