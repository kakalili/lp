crystal structure of the ampr effector binding domain provides insight into the molecular regulation of inducible ampc  lactamase
hyperproduction of ampc  lactamase ampc is a formidable mechanism of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins in gram negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae ampc expression is regulated by the lysr type transcriptional regulator ampr ampr and ampc genes form a divergent operon with overlapping promoters to which ampr binds and regulates the transcription of both genes ampr induces ampc by binding to one member of the family of   anhydro n acetylmuramyl peptides which are cytosolic catabolites of peptidoglycan that accumulate during  lactam challenge to gain structural insights into ampr regulation we determined the crystal structure of the effector binding domain ebd of ampr from citrobacter freundii up to     resolution the ampr ebd is dimeric and each monomer comprises two subdomains that adopt    rossmann like folds located between the monomer subdomains is a pocket that was found to bind the crystallization buffer molecule  n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid the pocket together with a groove along the surface of subdomain i forms a putative effector binding site into which a molecule of   anhydro n acetylmuramyl pentapeptide could be modeled amino acid substitutions at the base of the interdomain pocket either were found to render ampr incapable of inducing ampc thr  val ser  ala and tyr  phe or resulted in constitutive ampc expression gly  glu  while the substitutions that prevented ampc induction did not alter the overall ampr ebd structure circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the nonconservative gly  glu mutation affected ebd secondary structure confirming previous work suggesting that gly  glu induces a conformational change to result in constitutive ampc production
