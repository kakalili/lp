structural and biophysical studies of human parp  in complex with damaged dna
the enzyme poly adp ribose polymerase  parp  is a global monitor of chromatin structure and dna damage repair parp  binds to nucleosomes and poly adp ribosylates histones and several chromatin associated factors to expose specific dna sequences to the cellular machinery involved in gene transcription and or dna damage repair while these processes are critical to genomic stability the molecular mechanisms of how dna damage induces parp  activation are poorly understood we have used biochemical and thermodynamic measurements in conjunction with small angle x ray scattering to determine the stoichiometry affinity and overall structure of a human parp  construct containing the entire dna binding region the zinc ribbon domain and automodification domains residues      the interaction of this parp  protein construct with three different dna damage models dna constructs containing a nick a blunt end or a   extension was evaluated our data indicate that parp  binds each dna damage model as a monomer and with similar affinity in all cases resulting in robust activation of the catalytic domain using small angle x ray scattering we determined that the n terminal half of parp  behaves as an extended and flexible arrangement of individually folded domains in the absence of dna upon binding dna parp  undergoes a conformational change in the area surrounding the zinc ribbon domain these data support a model in which parp  upon binding dna undergoes a conformational change to become an active nuclear enzyme
