dna recognition and wrapping by escherichia coli rcnr
escherichia coli rcnr is a founding member of a recently discovered large and widespread structural family of bacterial transcription factors that are predicted to respond to a variety of environmental stresses rcnr directly regulates transcription of the gene encoding the rcna nickel and cobalt efflux protein by coordination of dna binding and metal binding activities a crystal structure of a cu i sensing homolog from mycobacterium tuberculosis did not reveal how the novel all  helical fold of this protein family interacts with dna because it lacks a well characterized dna binding motif in this study we investigated the biophysical properties of the rcnr  dna interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry and footprinting techniques we found that an rcnr tetramer recognizes a tact g n agta motif of which there are two in the rcna  rcnr intergenic region g tracts are found in many predicted binding sites of other rcnr csor proteins and here we show that they endow a form dna characteristics to the rcnr operator sites interestingly rcnr also interacts nonspecifically with the    base pairs flanking the core binding site resulting in dna wrapping and the introduction of a single negative supercoil into plasmid dna comparisons with other rcnr csor proteins reveal likely key differences in dna binding among members of this family that result from variations in the number and sequence of operator sites
