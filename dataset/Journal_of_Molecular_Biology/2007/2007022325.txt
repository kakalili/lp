We have revisited the well-studied heat and acidic amyloid fibril formation pathway (pH 1.6, 65 °C) of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) to map the barriers of the misfolding and amyloidogenesis pathways. A comprehensive kinetic mechanism is presented where all steps involving protein hydrolysis, fragmentation, assembly and conversion into amyloid fibrils are accounted for. Amyloid fibril formation of lysozyme has multiple kinetic barriers. First, HEWL unfolds within minutes, followed by irreversible steps of partial acid hydrolysis affording a large amount of nicked HEWL, the 49–101 amyloidogenic fragment and a variety of other species over 5–40 h. Fragmentation forming the 49–101 fragment is a requirement for efficient amyloid fibril formation, indicating that it forms the rate-determining nucleus. Nicked full-length HEWL is recruited efficiently into amyloid fibrils in the fibril growth phase or using mature fibrils as seeds, which abolished the lag phase completely. Mature amyloid fibrils of HEWL are composed mainly of nicked HEWL in the early equilibrium phase but go through a “fibril shaving” process, affording fibrils composed of the 49–101 fragment and 53–101 fragment during more extensive maturation (incubation for longer than ten days). Seeding of the amyloid fibril formation process using sonicated mature amyloid fibrils accelerates the fibril formation process efficiently; however, addition of intact full-length lysozyme at the end of the lag phase slows the rate of amyloidogenesis. The intact full-length protein, in contrast to nicked lysozyme, slows fibril formation due to its slow conversion into the amyloid fold, probably due to inclusion of the non-amyloidogenic 1–48/102–129 portion of HEWL in the fibrils, which can function as a “molecular bumper” stalling further growth.
