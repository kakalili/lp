confronting fusion protein based membrane protein topology mapping with reality the escherichia coli clca h cl  exchange transporter
the topology of bacterial inner membrane proteins is commonly determined using topology reporters such as alkaline phosphatase and green fluorescent protein fused to a series of c terminally truncated versions of the protein in question here we report a detailed topology mapping of the escherichia coli inner membrane h cl  exchange transporter clca since the  d structure of clca is known our results provide a critical test of the reporter fusion approach and offer new insights into the clca folding pathway
