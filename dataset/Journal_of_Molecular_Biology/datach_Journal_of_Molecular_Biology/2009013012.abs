a novel main chain motif in proteins bridged by cationic groups the niche
we have surveyed the bridging of pairs of main chain carbonyl oxygens by cations or by   hydrogens within hydrogen bonding groups a three to four residue motif which we call the niche with characteristic    angles is by far the commonest feature with this property the niche accommodates atoms or groups that offer   charges including water molecules or metal ions as well as amines guanidines and other nh groups seven percent of all residues in an average soluble protein belong to a niche another  have the niche conformation but no obvious bridging   group fifty five percent of niches occur either following a type   turn or at the c termini of  helices and niches turn out to be the most common c terminal features of  helices   of  helical c termini are niches whereas   are schellman loops   helices also frequently terminate in niches niches that bind k  na or ca  occur in some functional contexts in the cyclic peptides valinomycin and antamanide in several enzymes that are allosterically activated by na or k  and in the calcium pump where a niche is integrally involved in the ion transport
