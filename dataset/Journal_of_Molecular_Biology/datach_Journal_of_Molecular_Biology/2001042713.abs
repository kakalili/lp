formation of the single layer  sheet of borrelia burgdorferi ospa in the absence of the c terminal capping globular domain edited by p e wright
borrelia outer surface protein a ospa contains a unique single layer  sheet that connects n and c terminal globular domains this single layer  sheet segment   strands     is highly stable in solution although it is exposed to the solvent on both faces of the sheet and thus it does not contain a hydrophobic core here we tested whether interactions with the c terminal domain are essential for the formation of the single layer  sheet we characterized the solution structure dynamics and stability of an ospa fragment corresponding to  strands     termed ospa       which lacks a majority of the c terminal globular domain analyses of nmr chemical shifts and backbone nuclear overhauser effect noe connectivities showed that ospa      is folded except the  th and final  strand  h  n heteronuclear noe measurements and amide h h exchange revealed that the single layer  sheet in this fragment is more flexible than the corresponding region in full length ospa thermal denaturation experiments using differential scanning calorimetry and nmr spectroscopy revealed that the n terminal globular domain in the fragment has a conformational stability similar to that of the same region in the full length protein and that the single layer  sheet region also has a modest thermal stability these results demonstrate that the unique single layer  sheet retains its conformation in the absence of its interactions with the c terminal domain this fragment is significantly smaller than the full length ospa and thus it is expected to facilitate studies of the folding mechanism of this unusual  sheet structure
