structural basis of restoring sequence specific dna binding and transactivation to mutant p  by suppressor mutations
the tumor suppressor protein p  is mutated in more than   of invasive cancers about   of the mutations are found in six major  hot spot  codons located in its dna binding core domain to gain structural insight into the deleterious effects of such mutations and their rescue by suppressor mutations we determined the crystal structures of the p  core domain incorporating the hot spot mutation r  s the core domain incorporating r  s and a second site suppressor mutation h  r referred to as the double mutant r  s h  r and its sequence specific complex with dna and of the triple mutant r  s h  r t  a the structural studies were accompanied by transactivation and apoptosis experiments the crystal structures show that the region at the vicinity of the mutation site in the r  s mutant displays a range of conformations wild type wt and several mutant type conformations due to the loss of stabilizing interactions mediated by r  in the wt protein as a consequence the protein surface that is critical to the formation of functional p   dna complexes through protein  protein and protein  dna interactions is largely distorted in the mutant conformations thus explaining the protein s  loss of function  as a transcription factor the structure of this region is restored in both r  s h  r and r  s h  r t  a and is further stabilized in the complex of r  s h  r with dna our functional data show that the introduction of h  r as a second site suppressor mutation partially restores the transactivation capacity of the protein and that this effect is further amplified by the addition of a third site mutation t  a these findings together with previously reported data on wt and mutant p  provide a structural framework for understanding p  dysfunction as a result of oncogenic mutations and its rescue by suppressor mutations and for a potential drug design aimed at restoring wt activity to aberrant p  proteins
