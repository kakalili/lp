dhx rha binding to the pbs segment of the genomic rna during hiv  assembly bolsters virion infectivity
cellular rna binding proteins incorporated into virions during human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  assembly promote the replication efficiency of progeny virions despite its critical role in bolstering virion infectivity the molecular basis for the incorporation of dhx rna helicase a rha to virions remains unclear here cell based experiments demonstrate that the truncation of segments of the hiv    untranslated region    utr distinct from the core encapsidation sequence eliminated virion incorporation of rha indicating that rha recruitment is mediated by specific interactions with the hiv    utr in agreement with biological data isothermal titration calorimetry determined that the dimer conformation of the   utr binds one rha molecule per rna strand and the interaction is independent of nucleocapsid protein binding nmr spectra employing a deuterium labeling approach enabled resolution of the dimeric   utr in complex with the rha n terminal domain the structure of the large molecular mass complex was dependent on rha binding to a double stranded region of the primer binding site pbs segment of the   utr a single a to c substitution was sufficient to disrupt biophysical conformation and attenuate virion infectivity in cell based assays taken together our studies demonstrate the structural basis for hiv  genomic rna to recruit beneficial cellular cofactor to virions the support of progeny virion infectivity by rha is attributable to structure dependent binding at the pbs  segment of the hiv    utr during virus assembly
