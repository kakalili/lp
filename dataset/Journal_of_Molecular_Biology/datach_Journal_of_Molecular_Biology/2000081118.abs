a role for upstream rna structure in facilitating the catalytic fold of the genomic hepatitis delta virus ribozyme edited by j a doudna
hepatitis delta virus hdv has a circular rna genome that replicates by a double rolling circle mechanism the genomic and antigenomic versions of hdv contain a ribozyme that undergoes cis cleavage thereby processing the transcript into unit length monomers a genomic hdv transcript containing  nucleotides immediately upstream of the cleavage site was found to have attenuated self cleavage structure mapping and site directed mutagenesis revealed an inhibitory stretch consisting of upstream nucleotides    to    that forms a long range pairing termed alt  with the   strand of p  p    located at the very   end of the ribozyme two other alternative pairings were found alt  which involves upstream nucleotide ribozyme interactions and alt  which involves ribozyme ribozyme interactions self cleavage was rescued   to    fold by adding dna oligomers which sequester the       inhibitory stretch in trans surprisingly co transcriptional self cleavage occurs when the number of upstream nucleotides is increased to   computer prediction and structure mapping support the existence of an unusually stable upstream hairpin involving nucleotides    to    termed p   l   which sequesters the majority of the       inhibitory stretch in cis this hairpin is followed by a stretch of single stranded pyrimidine rich nucleotides termed j    sequence comparison suggests that the p   l   j    motif is conserved among known genomic hdv isolates and that the j    stretch is conserved among antigenomic hdv isolates lastly the secondary structure of the alt  containing ribozyme provides insight into possible folding intermediates of the ribozyme
