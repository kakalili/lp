ctl recognition of a protective immunodominant influenza a virus nucleoprotein epitope utilizes a highly restricted v  but diverse v  repertoire functional and structural implications
to investigate protective immunity conferred by ctl against viral pathogens we have analyzed cd  t cell responses to the immunodominant nucleoprotein epitope np      of influenza a virus in b mice during primary and secondary infections in vivo unlike the highly biased tcr v  repertoire the associated v  repertoire specific for the np     db ligand is quite diverse nonetheless certain public and conserved cdr  clonotypes with distinct molecular signatures were identified pairing of public v  and v  domains creates an   tcr heterodimer that binds efficiently to the np     db ligand and stimulates t cell activation in contrast private tcrs each comprising a distinct  chain paired with the same public  chain interact very differently molecular dynamics simulation reveals that the conformation and mobility of the shared v  cdr loops are governed largely by the associated v  domains these results provide insight into molecular principles regarding public versus private tcrs linked to immune surveillance after infection with influenza a virus
