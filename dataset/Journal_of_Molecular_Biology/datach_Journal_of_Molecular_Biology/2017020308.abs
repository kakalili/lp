arpeggio a web server for calculating and visualising interatomic interactions in protein structures
interactions between proteins and their ligands such as small molecules other proteins and dna depend on specific interatomic interactions that can be classified on the basis of atom type and distance and angle constraints visualisation of these interactions provides insights into the nature of molecular recognition events and has practical uses in guiding drug design and understanding the structural and functional impacts of mutations we present arpeggio a web server for calculating interactions within and between proteins and protein dna or small molecule ligands including van der waals  ionic carbonyl metal hydrophobic and halogen bond contacts and hydrogen bonds and specific atom  aromatic ring cation    donor    halogen    and carbon    and aromatic ring  aromatic ring      interactions within user submitted macromolecule structures pymol session files can be downloaded allowing high quality publication images of the interactions to be generated arpeggio is implemented in python and available as a user friendly web interface at http  structure bioc cam ac uk arpeggio and as a downloadable package at https  bitbucket org harryjubb arpeggio
