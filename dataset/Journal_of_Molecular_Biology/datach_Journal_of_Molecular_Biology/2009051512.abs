epstein  barr virus induced expression of a novel human vault rna
non protein coding rnas ncrnas have recently emerged on the scene of genomic research as prominent players in the regulation of gene expression many functionally characterized ncrnas have been shown to be differentially expressed in various organisms during specific environmental or developmental conditions thus establishing regulatory networks crucial for shaping cellular life here we show that the expression of vault rnas vtrnas is specifically up regulated in human lymphocytes upon infection by  herpesviruses such as the epstein  barr virus and kaposi s sarcoma virus vtrnas are ncrnas that are integral to the vault complex a gigantic   mda hollow ribonucleoprotein particle with a thus far elusive biological role stimulation of vtrna expression by the epstein  barr virus was evident for all three canonical vtrnas hvg  hvg  and also for a novel ncrna candidate initially termed cbl  this ncrna shares clear primary and secondary structure similarities with the three known vtrnas importantly cbl  co sediments with intact vault particles in density gradients of various human cell lines thus strongly indicating this ncrna as a novel fourth vault complex associated rna
