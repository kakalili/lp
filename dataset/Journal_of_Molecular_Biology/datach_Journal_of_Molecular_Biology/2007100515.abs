crystal structure of a thermally stable rhodopsin mutant
we determined the structure of the rhodopsin mutant n c d  c expressed in mammalian cells the first structure of a recombinantly produced g protein coupled receptor gpcr  the mutant was designed to form a disulfide bond between the n terminus and loop e  which allows handling of opsin in detergent solution and increases thermal stability of rhodopsin by  deg c it allowed us to crystallize a fully deglycosylated rhodopsin n c n d d  c  n  mutations are normally misfolding and cause retinitis pigmentosa in humans microcrystallographic techniques and a   m x ray beam were used to collect data along a single needle measuring   m    m    m the disulfide introduces only minor changes but fixes the n terminal cap over the  sheet lid covering the ligand binding site a likely explanation for the increased stability this work allows structural investigation of rhodopsin mutants and shows the problems encountered during structure determination of gpcrs and other mammalian membrane proteins
