utp allosterically regulates transcription by escherichia coli rna polymerase from the bacteriophage t a promoter
in the case of escherichia coli rna polymerase utp at elevated concentrations suppresses terminated transcript accumulation during multiple round transcription from a dna construct containing the t a promoter and te terminator the step that is affected by utp at elevated concentrations is promoter clearance in an attempt to understand better the mechanism by which utp regulates this step we analyzed the effect of utp on the formation of pppapu in the presence of only utp and atp at elevated concentrations utp is a non competitive inhibitor with respect to atp in the formation of pppapu this indicates that the effect of utp on the formation of pppapu is mediated through an allosteric site moreover the magnitude of the inhibition of pppapu formation is sufficient to account for the decrease in terminated transcript accumulation at elevated utp concentrations thus it appears that utp modulates terminated transcript accumulation during multiple round transcription from this dna construct by allosteric regulation of promoter clearance at the point of transcription initiation
