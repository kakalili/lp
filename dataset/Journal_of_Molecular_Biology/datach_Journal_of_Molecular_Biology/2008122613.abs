the interplay of ligand binding and quaternary structure in the diverse interactions of dynein light chain lc
dynein light chain lc is a small dimeric and very highly conserved globular protein that is an integral part of the dynein and myosin molecular motors but appears to have a broader role in multiple protein complexes unrelated to molecular motors lc binds to two families of targets those having a kxtqt sequence fingerprint and those having a giqvd fingerprint all known lc binding partners containing these fingerprints share a common binding site on lc that raises the question of what determines binding specificity here we present the crystal structure of apo lc at    resolution which when compared with the crystal structures of several lc complexes gives insight into the mechanism underlying the binding diversity of lc  peptide binding is associated with a shift in quaternary structure that expands the hydrophobic binding surface available to the ligand in addition to changes in tertiary structure and ordering of lc around the binding groove the observed quaternary shift suggests a mechanism by which binding at one of the two identical sites can influence binding at the other nmr spectra of titrations with peptides from each fingerprint family show evidence of allosteric interaction between the two binding sites to a differing degree in the two ligand families allosteric interaction between the binding sites may be a mechanism to promote simultaneous binding of ligands from the same family providing a physiological role for the two fingerprints
