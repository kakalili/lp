symmetric dna sites are functionally asymmetric within flp and cre site specific dna recombination synapses
flp and cre mediated recombination on symmetrized frt and loxp sites respectively in circular plasmid substrates yield both dna inversion and deletion however upon sequestering three negative supercoils outside the recombination complex using the resii  resiii synapse formed by tn resolvase and the ler synapse formed by phage mu transposase in the case of flp and cre respectively the reactions are channeled towards inversion at the expense of deletion the inversion product is a trefoil its unique topology being conferred by the external resolvase or ler synapse thus flp and cre assign their symmetrized substrates a strictly antiparallel orientation with respect to strand cleavage and exchange these conclusions are supported by the product profiles from tethered parallel and antiparallel native frt sites in dilution and competition assays furthermore the observed recombination bias favoring deletion over inversion in a nicked circular substrate containing two symmetrized frt sites is consistent with the predictions from monte carlo simulations based on antiparallel synapsis of the dna partners
