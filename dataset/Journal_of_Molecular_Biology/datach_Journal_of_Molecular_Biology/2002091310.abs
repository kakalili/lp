sickle hemoglobin fibers mechanisms of depolymerization
we examined the depolymerization of hemoglobin hb s fibers in the presence of co by using photolysis of cohbs to create and isolate individual fibers then removing photolysis to induce depolymerization depolymerization occurs at two sites fiber ends and fiber sides with different kinetics and by different mechanisms at low partial pressure of co pco  end depolymerization is dominant proceeding at    ms   whereas at high pco fibers vanish very rapidly in much less than one second by side depolymerization each kind of depolymerization could occur by a ligand independent path in which deoxyhb depolymerizes and then is prevented from returning to the polymer by liganding with co or by a ligand dependent path in which co binds to the polymer inducing dissociation of the newly liganded molecules from it we find that ligand independent depolymerization is the dominant path for end depolymerization and ligand dependent depolymerization dominates at least at high pco for side depolymerization on the basis of our kinetic results and electron micrographs of depolymerizing fibers we propose a model for side depolymerization in which a hole is nucleated by cooperative loss of a few molecules from fiber sides followed by rapid depolymerization from the newly created fiber ends abutting the hole potential significance of these results for the pathophysiology of sickle cell disease is discussed
