hydrophobic core malleability of a de novo designed three helix bundle protein
de novo protein design provides a tool for testing the principles that stabilize the structures of proteins recently we described the design and structure determination of  d a three helix bundle protein with a well packed hydrophobic core here we test the malleability and adaptability of this protein s structure by mutating a small ala residue a  in its core to larger hydrophobic side chains leu and ile such changes introduce strain into the structures of natural proteins and therefore generally destabilize the native state by contrast these mutations were slightly stabilizing    kcal mol   to the tertiary structure of  d the value of  cp for unfolding of these mutants was not greatly affected relative to wild type indicating that the change in solvent accessibility for unfolding was similar however two dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra indicate that the protein adjusts to the introduction of steric bulk in different ways a l  d showed serious erosion in the dispersion of both the amide backbone as well as the side chain methyl chemical shifts by contrast a i  d showed excellent dispersion of the backbone resonances and selective changes in dispersion of the aliphatic side chains proximal to the site of mutation together these data suggest that  d although folded into a unique three dimensional structure is nevertheless more malleable and flexible than most natural native proteins
