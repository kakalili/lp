crystal structure of human gm activator protein with a novel  cup topology edited by d rees
gm activator protein gm ap belongs to a small group of non enzymatic lysosomal proteins that act as cofactors in the sequential degradation of gangliosides it has been postulated that gm ap extracts single gm molecules from membranes and presents them in soluble form to  hexosaminidase a for cleavage of n acetyl d galactosamine and conversion to gm  the high affinity of gm ap for gm is based on specfic recognition of the oligosaccharide moiety as well as the ceramide lipid tail genetic defects in gm ap result in an atypical form of tay sachs disease known as variant ab gm gangliosidosis the    resolution crystal structure of gm ap reported here reveals a previously unobserved fold whose main feature is an eight stranded cup shaped anti parallel  pleated sheet the striking feature of the gm ap structure is that it possesses an accessible central hydrophobic cavity rather than a buried hydrophobic core the dimensions of this cavity              are suitable for binding  carbon lipid acyl chains flexible surface loops and a short  helix decorate the mouth of the  cup and may control lipid entry to the cavity
