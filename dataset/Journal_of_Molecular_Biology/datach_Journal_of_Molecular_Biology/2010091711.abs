structure of isoprene synthase illuminates the chemical mechanism of teragram atmospheric carbon emission
the x ray crystal structure of recombinant pcisps isoprene synthase from gray poplar hybrid populus canescens has been determined at     resolution and the structure of its complex with three mg  and the unreactive substrate analogue dimethylallyl s thiolodiphosphate has been determined at     resolution analysis of these structures suggests that the generation of isoprene from substrate dimethylallyl diphosphate occurs via a syn periplanar elimination mechanism in which the diphosphate leaving group serves as a general base this chemical mechanism is responsible for the annual atmospheric emission of   tg of isoprene by terrestrial plant life importantly the pcisps structure promises to guide future protein engineering studies potentially leading to hydrocarbon fuels and products that do not rely on traditional petrochemical sources
