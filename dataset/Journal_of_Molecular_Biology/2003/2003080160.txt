Various proteins have been shown to form various aggregated structures including the filamentous aggregates known as amyloid fibrils depending on the solution conditions. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is one of the proteins that form the amyloid fibrils. To gain insight into the mechanism of this polymorphism of the aggregated structures, we employed a model system consisting of HEWL, pure water, and ethanol, and investigated the kinetic process of the fibril formation in various salt concentrations with time-resolved neutron scattering. It was shown that by addition of NaCl in a range between 0.3 mM and 1.0 mM to HEWL solution in 90% ethanol, gelation occurred, and this gelation proceeded through a two-step process: the lateral association of the protofilaments, followed by the cross-linking of these fibrils formed. Both the structures of the fibrils and the rate of the gelation depended on NaCl concentration. The average structures of the fibrils formed at 1.0 mM NaCl were characterized by the radius of gyration of their cross-section (45.9(±0.4)Å) and the number of the protofilaments within the fibril (4.10(±0.12)), corresponding to the mature amyloid fibrils. A range of intermediate structures was formed below 1 mM NaCl. Above 2 mM NaCl, precipitation occurred because of the formation of amorphous aggregates. Here the branch point to the formation of the mature amyloid fibrils or to the amorphous aggregates was after the formation of the protofilaments. Sensitivity of the aggregated structures to salt concentration suggests that electrostatic interaction plays an essential role in the formation of these structures. The structural diversity both in the fibrils and the aggregated structures of the fibrils can be interpreted in terms of the difference in the degree of the electrostatic shielding at different salt concentrations.
