structural and thermodynamic study on aldose reductase nitro substituted inhibitors with strong enthalpic binding contribution
to prevent diabetic complications derived from enhanced glucose flux via the polyol pathway the development of aldose reductase inhibitors aris has been established as a promising therapeutic concept in order to identify novel lead compounds a virtual screening vs was performed successfully suggesting carboxylate type inhibitors of sub micromolar to micromolar affinity here we combine a structural characterization of the binding modes observed by x ray crystallography with isothermal titration calorimetry itc measurements providing insights into the driving forces of inhibitor binding particularly of the first leads from vs characteristic features of this novel inhibitor type include a carboxylate head group connected via an alkyl spacer to a heteroaromatic moiety which is linked to a further nitro substituted aromatic portion the crystal structures of two enzyme  inhibitor complexes have been determined at resolutions of     and      surprisingly the carboxylic group of the most potent vs lead occupies the catalytic pocket differently compared to the interaction geometry observed in almost all other crystal structures with structurally related ligands and obtained under similar conditions as an interstitial water molecule is picked up upon ligand binding the nitro aromatic moiety of both leads occupies the specificity pocket of the enzyme however adopting a different geometry compared to the docking prediction unexpectedly the nitro group binds to the bottom of the specificity pocket and provokes remarkable induced fit adaptations a peptide group located at the active site orients in such a way that h bond formation to one nitro group oxygen atom is enabled whereas a neighbouring tyrosine side chain performs a slight rotation off from the binding cavity to accommodate the nitro group identically constituted ligands lacking this nitro group exhibit an affinity drop of one order of magnitude in addition thermodynamic data suggest a strongly favourable contribution to binding enthalpy in case the inhibitor is equipped with a nitro group at the corresponding position to further investigate this phenomenon we determined crystal structures and thermodynamic data of two similarly constituted idd type inhibitors addressing the specificity pocket with either a nitro or halogen substituted aromatic moiety as these data suggest the nitro group provokes the enthalpic contribution in addition to the h bond mentioned above by accepting two  non classical  h bonds donated by the aromatic tyrosine side chain in summary this study provides the platform for further structure guided design hypotheses of novel drug candidates with higher affinity and selectivity
