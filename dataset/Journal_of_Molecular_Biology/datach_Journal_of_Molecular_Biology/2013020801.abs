the atomic structure of the virally encoded antifungal protein kp
killer toxins are produced by several genera of yeast and filamentous fungi a small proportion of ustilago maydis strains produce killer toxins to which they are resistant but sensitive strains are the majority in the wild populations there are three killer types p  p and p  that secrete kp  kp and kp toxins respectively which are produced only by strains persistently infected with double stranded rna viruses umv in the cell cytoplasm unlike nearly all other viruses umv are only transmitted through mitosis or meiosis as shown here kp is different from any other known cytotoxic protein kp is neutral protein composed of two subunits kp  and kp   kp  is responsible for targeting while kp  is cytotoxic neither subunit is homologous in either sequence or structure to any other toxin but they have highly similar structures to each other the major difference between the two subunits is a hydrophobic helix at the n terminus of kp  and is likely key to target recognition unlike any other toxin kp is translated as a single polypeptide with a  residue linker region in the middle of the protein from structural prediction studies this linker likely makes for a more compact kp structure that sequesters the hydrophobic helix of kp   a model whereby the protoxin undergoes a conformational activation process that exposes this helix immediately prior to secretion is presented
