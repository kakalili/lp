crystal structure of the gtp binding protein obg from thermus thermophilus hb
obg comprises a unique family of high molecular mass gtpases conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes bacterial obg is essential for cellular growth sporulation and differentiation here we report the crystal structure of the full length form of obg from thermus thermophilus hb at    resolution in the nucleotide free state it reveals a three domain arrangement composed of the n terminal domain the guanine nucleotide binding domain g domain  and the c terminal domain the n terminal and g domains have the obg fold and the ras like fold respectively these global folds are similar to those of the recently published structure of the c terminal domain truncated form of obg from bacillus subtilis on the other hand the c terminal domain of obg was found to have a novel fold the oct fold  a comparison of the t thermophilus and b subtilis nucleotide free obg structures revealed significant conformational changes in the switch i and switch ii regions of the g domain notably the n terminal domain is rotated drastically by almost    around the g domain axis in the t thermophilus obg crystal the nucleotide binding site of the g domain interacts with the c terminal domain of the adjacent molecule these data suggest a possible domain rearrangement of obg and a potential role of the c terminal domain in the regulation of the nucleotide binding state
