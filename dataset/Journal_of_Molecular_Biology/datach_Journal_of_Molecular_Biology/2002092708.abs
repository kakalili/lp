dissecting the gelsolin  polyphosphoinositide interaction and engineering of a polyphosphoinositide sensitive gelsolin c terminal half protein
gelsolin and other proteins in the villin gelsolin family are regulated by polyphosphoinositides ppis  and manipulation of cellular pip levels alters the structure of the actin cytoskeleton coincident with the dissociation of gelsolin  actin complexes this work explores the structure  function relationship of the gelsolin  ppi interaction circular dichroism experiments show that upon binding to ppis the ppi sensitive n terminal half of gelsolin undergoes significant secondary and tertiary structural changes that do not occur in the structurally homologous but ppi insensitive c terminal half secondary structure modeling algorithms predict an  helical conformation for one of the gelsolin ppi binding sites p  which differs from the conformation of p in the structure of gelsolin determined by x ray crystallography whereas structure prediction of the c terminal homolog of p agrees well with the x ray crystallography structure simulation of a change to helical conformation for p using molecular modeling indicates that such a structural transition will destabilize the f actin binding sites in domain  a hypothesis is proposed that ppis initiate conformational changes at the ppi binding site s that destabilize the protein structure and subsequently disrupt the actin binding sites to further evaluate the role of p in the gelsolin  ppi interaction a ct mutant p ct is constructed by inserting p in place of its c terminal homologous site p ct interacts with actin in the same way as the wild type protein in contrast to ct however p ct interacts strongly with ppis and its monomeric actin binding activity becomes regulated by ppis it is concluded that the p site is sufficient for ppi sensitivity in gelsolin furthermore the p site in p ct and the actin binding sites of ct do not overlap suggesting that ppis regulate actin binding of p ct through induction of structural changes rather than through direct competition
