understanding the differences between genome sequences of escherichia coli b strains rel  and bl  de  and comparison of the e coli b and k  genomes
each difference between the genome sequences of escherichia coli b strains rel  and bl  de  can be interpreted in light of known laboratory manipulations plus a gene conversion between ribosomal rna operons two treatments with  methyl  nitro  nitrosoguanidine in the rel  lineage produced at least  single base pair mutations     gc to at transitions and  single base pair gc deletions two uv treatments in the bl  de  lineage produced only  single base pair mutations but  large deletions p transductions from k  into the two b lineages produced   single base pair differences and  insertions or deletions reflecting differences between b dna in bl  de  and integrated restriction fragments of k  dna inherited by rel   two sites showed selective enrichment of spontaneous mutations no unselected spontaneous single base pair mutations were evident the genome sequences revealed that a progenitor of rel  had been misidentified explaining initially perplexing differences limited sequencing of other b strains defined characteristic properties of b and allowed assembly of the inferred genome of the ancestral b of delbr ck and luria comparison of the b and k  genomes shows that more than half of the   proteins of their basic genomes are predicted to be identical although    appear to be functional in either b or k  but not in both the ancestral basic genome appears to have had     coding sequences occupying     mbp repeated horizontal transfer from diverged escherichia coli genomes and homologous recombination may explain the observed variable distribution of single base pair differences fifteen sites are occupied by phage related elements but only six by comparable elements at the same site more than  sites are occupied by is elements in both b and k   in common and likely founding is elements are identified a signature of widespread cryptic phage p type mobile elements was identified complex deletions dense clusters of small deletions and substitutions apparently removed nonessential genes from    sites in the basic genomes
