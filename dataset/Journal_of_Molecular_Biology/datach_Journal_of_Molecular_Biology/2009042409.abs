solution and crystal structures of mrna exporter dbp p and its interaction with nucleotides
dead box protein  dbp p plays very important roles in rna metabolism from transcription to translation to rna decay it is an rna helicase and functions as an essential rna export factor from nucleus here we report the solution nmr structures of the n and c terminal domains ntd and ctd respectively of dbp p from saccharomyces cerevisiae scdbp p and x ray crystal structure of dbp p from schizosaccharomyces pombe spdbp p in the absence of nucleotides and rna the crystal structure clearly shows that spdbp p comprises two reca like domains that do not interact with each other nmr results show that the n terminal flanking region of scdpbp  m e  is intrinsically unstructured and the region y   r  including the q motif is highly dynamic on millisecond  microsecond timescales in solution the c terminal flanking region of scdbp p forms a short  strand and a long helix this helix is unique for scdbp p and has not been observed in other dead box proteins compared with other dead box proteins dbp p has an extra insert with six residues in the ctd nmr structure reveals that the insert is located in a solvent exposed loop capable of interacting with other proteins atp and adp titration experiments show that both adp and atp bind to the consensus binding site in the ntd of scdbp p but do not interact with the ctd at all binding of atp or adp to ntd induces significant conformational rearrangement too
