amino acid contribution to protein solubility asp glu and ser contribute more favorably than the other hydrophilic amino acids in rnase sa
poor protein solubility is a common problem in high resolution structural studies formulation of protein pharmaceuticals and biochemical characterization of proteins one popular strategy to improve protein solubility is to use site directed mutagenesis to make hydrophobic to hydrophilic mutations on the protein surface however a systematic investigation of the relative contributions of all  amino acids to protein solubility has not been done here   variants at the completely solvent exposed position  of ribonuclease rnase sa are made to compare the contributions of each amino acid stability measurements were also made for these variants which occur at the i  position of a type ii  turn solubility measurements in ammonium sulfate solutions were made at high positive net charge low net charge and high negative net charge surprisingly there was a wide range of contributions to protein solubility even among the hydrophilic amino acids the results suggest that aspartic acid glutamic acid and serine contribute significantly more favorably than the other hydrophilic amino acids especially at high net charge therefore to increase protein solubility asparagine glutamine or threonine should be replaced with aspartic acid glutamic acid or serine
