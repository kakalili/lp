domain structure of the red  single strand annealing protein the c terminal domain is required for fine tuning dna binding properties interaction with the exonuclease partner and recombination in vivo
red  is a component of the red recombination system of bacteriophage  that promotes a single strand annealing ssa reaction to generate end to end concatemers of the phage genome for packaging red  interacts with  exonuclease  exo  the other component of the red system to form a  synaptosome  complex that somehow integrates the end resection and annealing steps of the reaction previous work using limited proteolysis and chemical modification revealed that red  consists of an n terminal dna binding domain residues     and a flexible c terminal  tail   residues      here we quantitatively compare the binding of the full length protein red fl and the n terminal domain red    to different lengths of ssdna substrate and annealed duplex product we find that in general red fl binds more tightly to annealed duplex product than to ssdna substrate while red   binds more tightly to ssdna in addition the c terminal region of red  corresponding to residues      was purified and found to fold into an  helical domain that is required for the interaction with  exo to form the synaptosome complex deletion analysis of red  revealed that removal of just eleven residues from the c terminus disrupts the interaction with  exo as well as ssdna and dsdna recombination in vivo by contrast the determinants for self oligomerization of red  appear to reside solely within the n terminal domain the subtle but significant differences in the relative binding of red fl and red   to ssdna substrate and annealed duplex product may be important for red  to function as a ssa protein in vivo
