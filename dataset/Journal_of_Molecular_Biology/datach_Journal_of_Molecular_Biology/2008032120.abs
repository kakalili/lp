disulfide bond introduction for general stabilization of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domains
several antibody fragment engineering techniques aim at intrinsic stability enhancement but are not applied in a truly generic way here a strategy is proposed whereby consistent gain in stability is accomplished by introducing a specific disulfide bond between two opposite  strands in the hydrophobic core of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable domain of heavy chain antibodies nanobody  besides the rational design of a disulfide bond between residues  and   a nanobody harboring an extra naturally occurring cystine between residues  and  was compared to an equivalent nanobody without that cystine both novel disulfide cross links were introduced in several nanobodies in various combinations interestingly only the extra naturally occurring cystine consistently increased the conformational and thermal stabilities of wild type nanobodies without affecting antigen binding
