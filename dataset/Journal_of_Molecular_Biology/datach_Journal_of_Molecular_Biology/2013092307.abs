sco   a putative tetr transcriptional repressor from streptomyces coelicolor a   regulates transcription of sco   by multidrug recognition
sco   from streptomyces coelicolor a   is a member of the tetr family however its precise function is not yet clear in this study the crystal structure of sco   was determined at a resolution of    and its dna binding properties were analyzed crystal structure analysis showed that sco   forms an  shaped homodimer in which the monomer is composed of an n terminal dna binding domain containing a helix  turn  helix and a c terminal dimerization and regulatory domain possessing a ligand binding cavity the genomic systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment and electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that four sco   dimers bind to the two operator regions located between sco   and sco   a secondary transporter belonging to the major facilitator superfamily ligand screening analysis showed that sco   recognizes a wide range of structurally dissimilar cationic and hydrophobic compounds these results suggested that sco   is a transcriptional repressor of sco   responsible for the multidrug resistance system in s coelicolor a
