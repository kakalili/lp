the x ray crystal structure of an arthrobacter protophormiae endo  n acetylglucosaminidase reveals a     catalytic domain two ancillary domains and active site residues key for transglycosylation activity
glycoside hydrolase family gh  is a family of endo  n acetylglucosaminidases that is responsible for the hydrolysis of    linkage in the n n diacetylchitobiose core of n linked glycans the endo  n acetylglucosaminidase from arthrobacter protophormiae endo a is of particular interest given its increasing use for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of bespoke n glycans using n glycan oxazolines as glycosyl donors the e  q variant of endo a is especially attractive for synthesis as it is hydrolytically impaired but still able to catalyze n glycan synthesis by transglycosylation using activated oxazoline donors here we present the three dimensional structure of the a protophormiae endo a e  q variant solved by multiple wavelength anomalous scattering methods and refined at     resolution the structure reveals that gh  enzymes display a trimodular architecture in which a     catalytic domain occurs with two ancillary  sheet modules the active centre is fully consistent with the known neighboring group catalytic mechanism in which e  acts as the catalytic acid base for reaction via an oxazoline intermediate of note is the presence of an asparagine in the active centre in a position likely to interact with the acetyl nh group that in all other known families of glycosidase using this mechanism is an aspartate or glutamate residue the substrate binding surface reveals an open topography consistent with the ability to accept a large range of glycoprotein substrates and the ability to transglycosylate other acceptors the three dimensional structure of this important biocatalyst reveals that residues implicated in the enhancement of transglycosylation and synthetic capacity are proximal to the active centre where they may act to favor binding of acceptor substrates
