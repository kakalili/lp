janus model of the na k atpase  subunit transmembrane domain distinct faces mediate    assembly and    homo oligomerization
na k atpase is a hetero oligomer of  and  subunits the na k atpase  subunit na k   is involved in both the regulation of ion transport activity and in cell  cell adhesion by structure prediction and evolutionary analysis we identified two distinct faces on the na k  transmembrane domain tmd that could mediate protein  protein interactions a glycine zipper motif and a conserved heptad repeat here we show that the heptad repeat face is involved in the hetero oligomeric interaction of na k  with na k   and the glycine zipper face is involved in the homo oligomerization of na k   point mutations in the heptad repeat motif reduced na k  binding to na k   and na k atpase activity na k  tmd homo oligomerized in biological membranes and mutation of the glycine zipper motif affected oligomerization and cell  cell adhesion these results provide a structural basis for understanding how na k  links ion transport and cell cell adhesion
