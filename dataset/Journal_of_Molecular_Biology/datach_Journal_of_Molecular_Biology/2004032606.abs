mechanics of dna flexibility visualized by selective   amine acylation at nucleotide bulges
we used selective acylation of   amine substituted nucleotides to visualize local backbone conformations that occur preferentially at bulged sites in dna duplexes    amine acylation reports local nucleotide flexibility because unconstrained   amino nucleotides more readily reach a reactive conformation in which the amide forming transition state is stabilized by interactions between the amine nucleophile and the adjacent   phosphodiester group bulged   amine substituted cytidine nucleotides react    fold more rapidly than nucleotides constrained by base pairing at   c in contrast base paired   amine substituted nucleotides flanked by a   or   bulge react two or six fold more rapidly respectively than the perfectly paired duplex the relative lack of   amine reactivity for nucleotides adjacent to a dna bulge emphasizes first that structural perturbations do not extend significantly into the flanking duplex structure second the exquisite sensitivity towards very local perturbations in nucleic acid structure suggests that   amine acylation can be used to chemically interrogate deletion mutations in dna finally these data support the mechanical interpretation that the reactive ribose conformation for   amine acylation requires that the base lies out of the helix and in the major groove a mechanistic insight useful for designing   amine based sensors
