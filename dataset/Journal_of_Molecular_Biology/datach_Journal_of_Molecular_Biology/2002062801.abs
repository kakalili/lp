archaeal sm proteins form heptameric and hexameric complexes crystal structures of the sm and sm proteins from the hyperthermophile archaeoglobus fulgidus
proteins of largely unknown function related to the sm proteins present in the core domain of eukaryotic small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles have recently been detected in archaea in contrast to eukaryotes archaea contain maximally two distinct sm related proteins belonging to different subfamilies we refer to as sm and sm  here we report the crystal structures of the sm  and sm type proteins from the hyperthermophilic euryarchaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus af sm and af sm  at a resolution of   and     respectively while the af sm protein forms a heptameric ring structure similar to that found in other archaeal sm type proteins the af sm protein unexpectedly forms a homo hexamer in the crystals and as is evident from the mass spectrometric analysis also in solution both proteins have essentially the same monomer fold and inter subunit  sheet hydrogen bonding giving rise to a similar overall architecture of the doughnut shaped six and seven membered rings in addition a conserved uracil binding pocket identified previously in an af sm rna complex suggests a common rna binding mode for the af sm and af sm proteins in line with solution studies showing preferential binding to u rich oligonucleotides for both proteins clear differences are however seen in the charge distribution within the two structures the rough faces of the rings i e the faces not containing the base binding pockets have opposite charges in the two structures being predominantly positive in af sm and negative in af sm  differences in the ionic interactions between subunits provide an explanation for the distinctly different oligomerisation behaviour of the af sm and af sm proteins and of sm  and sm type proteins in general as well as the stability of their complexes implications for the functions of archaeal sm proteins are being discussed
