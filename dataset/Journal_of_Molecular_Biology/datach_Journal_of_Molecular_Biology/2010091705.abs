the escherichia coli pria helicase  double stranded dna complex location of the strong dna binding subsite on the helicase domain of the protein and the affinity control by the two nucleotide binding sites of the enzyme
the escherichia coli pria helicase complex with the double stranded dna dsdna  the location of the strong dna binding subsite and the effect of the nucleotide cofactors bound to the strong and weak nucleotide binding site of the enzyme on the dsdna affinity have been analyzed using the fluorescence titration analytical ultracentrifugation and photo cross linking techniques the total site size of the pria  dsdna complex is only    bp that is dramatically lower than    nucleotides occluded in the enzyme  single stranded dna ssdna complex the helicase associates with the dsdna using its strong ssdna binding subsite in an orientation very different from the complex with the ssdna the strong dna binding subsite of the enzyme is located on the helicase domain of the pria protein the dsdna intrinsic affinity is considerably higher than the ssdna affinity and the binding process is accompanied by a significant positive cooperativity association of cofactors with strong and weak nucleotide binding sites of the protein profoundly affects the intrinsic affinity and the cooperativity without affecting the stoichiometry atp analog binding to either site diminishes the intrinsic affinity but preserves the cooperativity adp binding to the strong site leads to a dramatic increase of the cooperativity and only slightly affects the affinity while saturation of both sites with adp strongly increases the affinity and eliminates the cooperativity thus the coordinated action of both nucleotide binding sites on the pria  dsdna interactions depends on the structure of the phosphate group the significance of these results for the enzyme activities in recognizing primosome assembly sites or the ssdna gaps is discussed
