mapping a  amyloid fibril secondary structure using scanning proline mutagenesis
although the amyloid fibrils formed from the alzheimer s disease amyloid peptide a  are rich in cross  sheet the peptide likely also exhibits turn and unstructured regions when it becomes incorporated into amyloid we generated a series of single proline replacement mutants of a      and determined the thermodynamic stabilities of amyloid fibrils formed from these mutants to characterize the susceptibility of different residue positions of the a  sequence to proline substitution the results suggest that the a  peptide when engaged in the amyloid fibril folds into a conformation containing three highly structured segments consisting of contiguous sequence elements          and     that are sensitive to proline replacement and likely to include the  sheet portions of the fibrils residues relatively insensitive to proline replacement fall into two groups  a residues    and     are likely to exist in relatively unstructured flexible elements extruded from the  sheet rich amyloid core  b residues      and  are likely to occupy turn positions between these three structured elements although destabilized fibrils formed from a      proline mutants are very similar in structure to wild type fibrils as indicated by hydrogen  deuterium exchange and other analysis interestingly however some proline mutations destabilize fibrils while at the same time increasing the number of amide protons protected from hydrogen exchange this suggests that the stability of amyloid fibrils rather than being driven exclusively by the formation of h bonded  sheet is achieved as in globular proteins through a balance of stabilizing and destabilizing forces the proline scanning data are most compatible with a model for amyloid protofilament structure loosely resembling the parallel  helix folding motif such that each a      core region occupies a single layer of a prismatic h bonded stack of peptides
