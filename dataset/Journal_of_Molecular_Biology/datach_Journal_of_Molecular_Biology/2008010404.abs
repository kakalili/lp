the caenorhabditis elegans protein ctbp  defines a new group of thap domain containing ctbp corepressors
the c terminal binding proteins ctbps play roles in diverse cellular processes including transcriptional regulation golgi membrane fission and synaptic ribbon formation in the context of transcriptional regulation they function as corepressors interacting with promoter bound transcription factors and recruiting a large protein complex that contains chromatin modifying enzymes we recently described the structure of a thanatos associated protein thap domain that is found in a new member of the ctbp family the caenorhabditis elegans ctbp  protein we have identified additional thap domain containing ctbps in the nematode echinoderm and cephalochordate lineages the distribution of these lineages within the animal kingdom suggests that the ancestral form of the animal ctbps may have contained a thap domain that was subsequently lost in the vertebrate and arthropod lineages we also provide functional data indicating that ctbp  represses gene expression and homodimerizes and interacts with pxdls containing partner proteins three key features of the previously characterized animal ctbps ctbp  is therefore the founding member of a new subgroup within the ctbp corepressor family the thap domain containing ctbps
