a      forms five distinct amyloid structures whose  sheet contents and fibril stabilities are correlated
the ability of a single polypeptide sequence to grow into multiple stable amyloid fibrils sets these aggregates apart from most native globular proteins the existence of multiple amyloid forms is the basis for strain effects in yeast prion biology and might contribute to variations in alzheimer s disease pathology however the structural basis for amyloid polymorphism is poorly understood we report here five structurally distinct fibrillar aggregates of the alzheimer s plaque peptide a      as well as a non fibrillar aggregate induced by zn  each of these conformational forms exhibits a unique profile of physical properties and all the fibrillar forms breed true in elongation reactions under a common set of growth conditions consistent with their defining cross  structure we find that in this series the amyloid fibrils containing more extensive  sheet exhibit greater stability at the same time side chain packing outside of the  sheet regions contributes to stability and to differences of stability between polymorphic forms stability comparison is facilitated by the unique feature that the free energy of the monomer equivalent to the unfolded state in a protein folding reaction does not vary and hence can be ignored in the comparison of  g  of elongation values for each polymorphic fibril obtained under a single set of conditions
