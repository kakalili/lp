domain combinations in archaeal eubacterial and eukaryotic proteomes edited by g von heijne
there is a limited repertoire of domain families that are duplicated and combined in different ways to form the set of proteins in a genome proteins are gene products and at the level of genes duplication recombination fusion and fission are the processes that produce new genes we attempt to gain an overview of these processes by studying the evolutionary units in proteins domains in the protein sequences of  genomes the domain and superfamily definitions in the structural classification of proteins database are used so that we can view all pairs of adjacent domains in genome sequences in terms of their superfamily combinations we find   out of the   superfamilies in scop in these genomes and the   families occur in   pairwise combinations most families are observed in combination with one or two other families while a few families are very versatile in their combinatorial behaviour   families do not make combinations with other families this type of pattern can be described as a scale free network we also study the n to c terminal orientation of domain pairs and domain repeats the phylogenetic distribution of domain combinations is surveyed to establish the extent of common and kingdom specific combinations of the kingdom specific combinations significantly more combinations consist of families present in all three kingdoms than of families present in one or two kingdoms hence we are led to conclude that recombination between common families as compared to the invention of new families and recombination among these has also been a major contribution to the evolution of kingdom specific and species specific functions in organisms in all three kingdoms finally we compare the set of the domain combinations in the genomes to those in the rcsb protein data bank and discuss the implications for structural genomics
