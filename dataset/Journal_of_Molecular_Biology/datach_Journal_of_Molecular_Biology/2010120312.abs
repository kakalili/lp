substrate specific kinetics of dicer catalyzed rna processing
the specialized ribonuclease dicer plays a central role in eukaryotic gene expression by producing small regulatory rnas  micrornas mirnas and short interfering rnas sirnas  from larger double stranded rna dsrna substrates although dicer will cleave both imperfectly base paired hairpin structures pre mirnas and perfect duplexes pre sirnas in vitro it has not been clear whether these are mechanistically equivalent substrates and how dsrna binding proteins such as trans activation response tar rna binding protein trbp influence substrate selection and rna processing efficiency we show here that human dicer is much faster at processing a pre mirna substrate compared to a pre sirna substrate under both single and multiple turnover conditions maximal cleavage rates vmax calculated by michaelis  menten analysis differed by more than   fold under multiple turnover conditions trbp was found to enhance dicing of both substrates to similar extents and this stimulation required the two n terminal dsrna binding domains of trbp these results demonstrate that multiple factors influence dicing kinetics while trbp stimulates dicing by enhancing the stability of dicer  substrate complexes dicer itself generates product rnas at rates determined at least in part by the structural properties of the substrate
