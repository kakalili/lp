molecular dynamics simulations on discoidal hdl particles suggest a mechanism for rotation in the apo a i belt model
apolipoprotein a i apo a i is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein hdl particles elevated levels of hdl in the bloodstream have been shown to correlate strongly with a reduced risk factor for atherosclerosis molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out on three separate model discoidal high density lipoprotein particles hdl containing two monomers of apo a i and   molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine popc  to a time scale of ns the starting structures were on the basis of previously published molecular belt models of hdl consisting of the lipid binding c terminal domain residues      wrapped around the circumference of a discoidal hdl particle subtle changes between two of the starting structures resulted in significantly different behavior during the course of the simulation the results provide support for the hypothesis of segrest et al that helical registration in the molecular belt model of apo a i is modulated by intermolecular salt bridges in addition we propose an explanation for the presence of proline punctuation in the molecular belt model and for the presence of two  mer helical repeats interrupting the otherwise regular pattern of  mer helical repeats in the lipid binding domain of apo a i
