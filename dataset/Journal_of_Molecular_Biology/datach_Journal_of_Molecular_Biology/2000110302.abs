the    resolution structure of phospho serine  hpr from enterococcus faecalis edited by p wright
the histidine containing phosphocarrier protein hpr is a central component of the phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase system pts  which transfers metabolic carbohydrates across the cell membrane in many bacterial species in gram positive bacteria phosphorylation of hpr at conserved serine   p ser hpr plays several regulatory roles within the cell the major regulatory effect of p ser hpr is its inability to act as a phosphocarrier substrate in the enzyme i reaction of the pts in order to investigate the structural nature of hpr regulation by phosphorylation at ser  the structure of the p ser hpr from the gram positive bacterium enterococcus faecalis has been determined x ray diffraction analysis of p ser hpr crystals provided    unique reflections with a    completeness of data to    resolution the structure was solved using molecular replacement with two p ser hpr molecules present in the asymmetric unit the final r value and rfree are    and    respectively the overall tertiary structure of p ser hpr is that of other hpr structures however the active site in both p ser hpr molecules was found to be in the  open  conformation ala  of both molecules were observed to be in a state of torsional strain similar to that seen in the structure of the native hpr from e faecalis regulatory phosphorylation at ser  does not induce large structural changes to the hpr molecule the b helix was observed to be slightly lengthened as a result of ser  phosphorylation also the water mediated met  his  interaction is maintained again similar to that of the native e faecalis hpr the major structural and thus regulatory effect of phosphorylation at ser  is disruption of the hydrophobic interactions between ei and hpr in particular the electrostatic repulsion between the phosphoryl group on ser  and glu  of ei and the prevention of a potential interaction of met  with a hydrophobic pocket of ei
