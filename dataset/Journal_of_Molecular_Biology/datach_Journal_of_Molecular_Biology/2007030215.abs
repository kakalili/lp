zebrafish mib and mib are mutual e ubiquitin ligases with common and specific delta substrates
it was already known that both mind bomb mib and mind bomb  mib  encode e ubiquitin ligases that target delta in notch activation here we further demonstrated that zebrafish mib and mib  similar to their mouse orthologs have a c terminal most ring finger dependent e ubiquitin ligase activity mib and mib are reciprocal e ubiquitin ligases and substrates they function similarly in notch signaling by using deltac as a common substrate however mib behaves differently from mib in deltad internalization in addition mib and mib bind differently to extracellular and intracellular parts of deltaa and deltac finally mutant mibs mibta b with a missense mutation in the c terminal most ring finger m  r and mibm  with a premature stop codon that leads to a deletion of three ring fingers c  stop  act dominant negatively and compete with mib in deltac ubiquitylation and internalization suggesting a molecular basis for the antimorphic phenotypes stronger than the null phenotypes observed in zebrafish mibta b and mibm  alleles
