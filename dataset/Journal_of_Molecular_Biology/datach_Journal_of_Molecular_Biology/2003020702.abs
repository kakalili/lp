high concentrations of viscogens decrease the protein folding rate constant by prematurely collapsing the coil
in several studies viscogenic osmolytes have been suggested to decrease the folding rate constant of polypeptides by slowing their motion through the solvent here we show that osmolytes may slow protein folding by prematurely collapsing the coil at low or moderate concentrations of osmolytes  lt    folding of the two state protein ci becomes faster with increasing osmolyte concentrations suggesting that the kinetics are governed by protein stability however at higher concentrations of osmolyte the coil collapses in the dead time of the refolding experiment causing a dramatic drop in the folding rate the collapsed state is non native and appears to be different for different osmolytes
