increased thermostability and fidelity of dna synthesis of wild type and mutant hiv  group o reverse transcriptases
reverse transcription coupled with dna amplification has become a well established and powerful molecular technique for studying ribonucleic acids however the efficiency of those reactions is largely dependent on the molecular properties of currently used reverse transcriptases rts  engineered and natural rt variants with improved thermostability and fidelity of dna synthesis should be of great utility in the amplification of rna targets in this study we demonstrate that the wild type wt hiv  group o o wt rt shows increased thermostability in comparison with moloney murine leukemia virus rt and a prototypic hiv  group m subtype b bh  wt rt while rendering higher yields in reverse transcription pcrs that included a cdna synthesis step performed at a high temperature range       c  in addition the o wt rt showed   fold increased accuracy in m  lacz  forward mutation assays in comparison with the bh  wt rt unlike the bh  wt enzyme o wt rt showed a very low error rate for frameshifts mutational hot spots induced by o wt rt occurred at nucleotide runs suggesting a dislocation mediated mechanism for the generation of base substitutions in hiv  group o rt substituting ile  for val rendered an enzyme that was   and   times more faithful than o wt rt and bh  wt rts respectively in forward mutation assays the mutant rt also showed increased misinsertion and mispair extension fidelity in kinetic assays however its mutational spectrum was similar to that obtained with the wt group o polymerase v i caused a loss of efficiency of reverse transcription pcr amplifications at  and    c in comparison with o wt rt however a double mutant devoid of rnase h activity v i e  q was found to reverse transcribe at temperatures as high as    c while maintaining the increased accuracy of the v i mutant
