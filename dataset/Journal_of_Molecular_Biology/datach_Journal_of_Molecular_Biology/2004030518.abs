kinetic analysis of site specific photoaptamer  protein cross linking
ssdna oligonucleotides containing bromodeoxyuridine brdu photoaptamers are rapidly emerging as specific protein capture reagents in protein microarray technologies a mathematical model for the kinetic analysis of photoaptamer  protein photocross linking reactions is presented the model is based on specific aptamer protein binding followed by laser excitation that can lead to either covalent cross linking of the photoaptamer and protein in the complex or irreversible photodamage to the aptamer two distinct kinetic regimes   frozen and   rapid equilibrium are developed analytically to model binding kinetics between laser pulses the models are used to characterize the photocross linking between three photoaptamers and their cognate protein targets photoaptamers   and   cross link human basic fibroblast growth factor and   cross links hiv mn envelope glycoprotein data for cross linking reaction yields as a function of both laser energy dose and target protein concentration are analyzed for affinity constants and cross link reaction rates the binding dissociation constants derived from the cross linking data are in good accord with independent measurements the rapid equilibrium model appears to produce results more consistent with the experimental observations although there is significant overlap between the two models for most conditions explored here the rate of photodamage for   and   is   and   times that of the specific cross link giving low maximum reaction yields of    and     whereas   cross links with a rate over five times higher than its photodamage rate and has a maximum reaction yield exceeding   quantum yields for the three systems are estimated from the data photoaptamer   has a reasonably high quantum yield of    for protein cross linking while   and   have quantum yields of   and    the work presented here provides a useful set of metrics that allow for refinement of photoaptamer properties
