tilt pair analysis of images from a range of different specimens in single particle electron cryomicroscopy
the comparison of a pair of electron microscope images recorded at different specimen tilt angles provides a powerful approach for evaluating the quality of images image processing procedures or three dimensional structures here we analyze tilt pair images recorded from a range of specimens with different symmetries and molecular masses and show how the analysis can produce valuable information not easily obtained otherwise we show that the accuracy of orientation determination of individual single particles depends on molecular mass as expected theoretically since the information in each particle image increases with molecular mass the angular uncertainty is less than   for particles of high molecular mass     mda  several degrees for particles in the range    mda and tens of degrees for particles below  mda orientational uncertainty may be the major contributor to the effective temperature factor b factor describing contrast loss and therefore the maximum resolution of a structure determination we also made two unexpected observations single particles that are known to be flexible showed a wider spread in orientation accuracy and the orientations of the largest particles examined changed by several degrees during typical low dose exposures smaller particles presumably also reorient during the exposure hence specimen movement is a second major factor that limits resolution tilt pairs thus enable assessment of orientation accuracy map quality specimen motion and conformational heterogeneity a convincing tilt pair parameter plot where   of the particles show a single cluster around the expected tilt axis and tilt angle provides confidence in a structure determined using electron cryomicroscopy
