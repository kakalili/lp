the effects of non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms nssnps on protein  protein interactions
non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms nssnps are single base changes leading to a change to the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein many of these variants are associated with disease so nssnps have been well studied with studies looking at the effects of nssnps on individual proteins for example on stability and enzyme active sites in recent years the impact of nssnps upon protein  protein interactions has also been investigated giving a greater insight into the mechanisms by which nssnps can lead to disease in this review we summarize these studies looking at the various mechanisms by which nssnps can affect protein  protein interactions we focus on structural changes that can impair interaction changes to disorder gain of interaction and post translational modifications before looking at some examples of nssnps at human  pathogen protein  protein interfaces and the analysis of nssnps from a network perspective
