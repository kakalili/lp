single residue determines the specificity of neutrophil elastase for shigella virulence factors
human neutrophil elastase ne is a key host defense protease that cleaves virulence factors of gram negative bacteria ne and cathepsin g cg are chymotrypsin like serine proteases with sequence and structural similarities and both are abundant in neutrophil granules unlike ne cg does not cleave virulence factors of enteric bacteria through structure  function analysis we identified regions in ne that are essential for cleaving shigella virulence proteins ne residues at eight different positions were replaced with analogous amino acids in cg or with alanine functional analysis of recombinant mutant proteins showed that a single residue at position  and multiple amino acid stretches in the three different regions  a         and      determine ne specificity these ne mutants cleaved the cg specific but not the ne specific synthetic peptide substrate and did not degrade shigella virulence factors interestingly exchanging the amino acid at position  in cg for the ne equivalent enabled this cg mutant to cleave shigella virulence factors analysis of the ne proteolytic products of the shigella virulence factor ipab shows that ne has specific cleavage sites these results indicate that shigella virulence factor specificity maps to a distinct region close to ne s active site
