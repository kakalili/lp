exploring the mechanical properties of single vimentin intermediate filaments by atomic force microscopy
intermediate filaments ifs  together with actin filaments and microtubules compose the cytoskeleton among other functions ifs impart mechanical stability to cells when exposed to mechanical stress and act as a support when the other cytoskeletal filaments cannot keep the structural integrity of the cells here we present a study on the bending properties of single vimentin ifs in which we used an atomic force microscopy afm tip to elastically deform single filaments hanging over a porous membrane we obtained a value for the bending modulus of non stabilized ifs between   mpa and   mpa our results together with previous ones suggest that ifs present axial sliding between their constitutive building blocks and therefore have a bending modulus that depends on the filament length measurements of glutaraldehyde stabilized filaments were also performed to reduce the axial sliding between subunits and therefore provide a lower limit estimate of the young s modulus of the filaments the results show an increment of two to three times in the bending modulus for the stabilized ifs with respect to the non stabilized ones suggesting that the young s modulus of vimentin ifs should be around   mpa or higher
