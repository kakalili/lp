a bacterial virulence factor with a dual role as an adhesin and a solute binding protein the crystal structure at     resolution of the peb a protein from the food borne human pathogen campylobacter jejuni
the peb a protein is an antigenic factor exposed on the surface of the food borne human pathogen campylobacter jejuni which has a major role in adherence and host colonisation peb a is also the periplasmic binding protein component of an aspartate glutamate abc transporter essential for optimal microaerobic growth on these dicarboxylic amino acids here we report the crystal structure of peb a at     resolution the protein has a typical two domain    structure characteristic of periplasmic extracytoplasmic solute receptors and a chain topology related to the type ii subfamily an aspartate ligand clearly defined by electron density in the interdomain cleft forms extensive polar interactions with the protein the majority of which are made with the larger domain arg  and asp  form ion pairing interactions with the main chain  carboxyl and  amino groups respectively of the ligand while arg  thr  lys  and tyr  co ordinate the ligand side chain carboxyl group lys  and arg  line a positively charged groove which favours binding of asp over the neutral asn the ligand binding cleft is of sufficient depth to accommodate a glutamate this is the first structure of an abc type aspartate binding protein and explains the high affinity of the protein for aspartate and glutamate and its much weaker binding of asparagine and glutamine stopped flow fluorescence spectroscopy indicates a simple bimolecular mechanism of ligand binding with high association rate constants sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses revealed peb a homologues in some gram positive bacteria the alignments suggest a more distant homology with glti from escherichia coli a known glutamate and aspartate binding protein but lys  and tyr  are not conserved in glti our results provide a structural basis for understanding both the solute transport and adhesin virulence functions of peb a
