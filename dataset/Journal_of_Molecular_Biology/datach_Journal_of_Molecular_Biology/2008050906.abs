structural basis for autoinhibition of escrt iii chmp
endosomal sorting complexes required for transport escrt  escrt i escrt ii and escrt iii are selectively recruited to cellular membranes to exert their function in diverse processes such as multivesicular body biogenesis enveloped virus budding and cytokinesis escrt iii is composed of members of the charged multivesicular body protein chmp family  cytosolic proteins that are targeted to membranes via yet unknown signals membrane targeting is thought to result in a membrane associated protein network that presumably acts at a late budding step here we provide structural evidence based on small angle x ray scattering data that escrt iii chmp can adopt two conformations in solution a closed globular form that most likely represents the cytosolic conformation and an open extended conformation that might represent the activated form of chmp  both the closed and open conformations of chmp interact with amsh with high affinity although the c terminal region of chmp is required for amsh interaction a peptide thereof reveals only weak binding to amsh suggesting that other regions of chmp contribute to the high affinity interaction thus amsh including its mit microtubule interacting and transport domain interacts with escrt iii chmp differently from reported vps mit domain  chmp protein interactions
