interplay between the    clamp and the    jaw domains during dna opening by the bacterial rna polymerase at   dependent promoters
the bacterial rna polymerase rnap is a multi subunit structurally flexible complex molecular machine in which activities associated with dna opening for transcription competent open promoter complex oc formation reside in the catalytic  and    subunits and the dissociable  subunit oc formation is a multi step process that involves several structurally conserved mobile modules of      and   here we present evidence that two flexible modules of    the    jaw and the    clamp and a conserved regulatory region i domain of    jointly contribute to the maintenance of stable dna strand separation around the trancription start site in ocs formed at   dependent promoters clearly regulated interplay between the mobile modules of the    and the  subunits of the rnap appears to be necessary for stable oc formation
