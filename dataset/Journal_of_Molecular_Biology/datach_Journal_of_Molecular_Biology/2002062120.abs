impact of mutations affecting nd mitochondria encoded subunits on the activity and assembly of complex i in chlamydomonas implication for the structural organization of the enzyme
the mitochondrial rotenone sensitive nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i comprises more than  subunits the majority of which are encoded by the nucleus in chlamydomonas reinhardtii only five components nd  nd  nd  nd and nd  are coded for by the mitochondrial genome here we characterize two mitochondrial mutants dum and dum  showing strong reduction or inactivation of complex i activity dum is a t deletion in the   utr of nd whereas dum  is a t deletion in the coding sequence of nd  the impact of these mutations and of mutations affecting nd  nd and nd nd genes on the assembly of complex i is investigated after separation of the respiratory complexes by blue native bn page or sucrose gradient centrifugation we demonstrate that the absence of intact nd or nd subunit prevents the assembly of the  kda whole complex whereas the loss of nd or nd nd leads to the formation of a subcomplex of  kda present in reduced amount the implications of our findings for the possible role of these nd subunits on the activity of complex i and for the structural organization of the membrane arm of the enzyme are discussed in mitochondria from all the strains analyzed we moreover detected a     kda fragment comprising the hydrophilic  kda and  kda subunits of the complex i peripheral arm and showing nadh dehydrogenase activity
