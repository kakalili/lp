insights into strand exchange in btb domain dimers from the crystal structures of fazf and miz
the btb domain is a widely distributed protein  protein interaction motif that is often found at the n terminus of zinc finger transcription factors previous crystal structures of btb domains have revealed tightly interwound homodimers with the n terminus from one chain forming a two stranded anti parallel  sheet with a strand from the other chain we have solved the crystal structures of the btb domains from fanconi anemia zinc finger fazf and miz  myc interacting zinc finger  to resolutions of     and     respectively unlike previous examples of btb domain structures the fazf btb domain is a nonswapped dimer with each n terminal  strand associated with its own chain as a result the dimerization interface in the fazf btb domain is about half as large as in the domain swapped dimers the miz btb domain resembles a typical swapped btb dimer although it has a shorter n terminus that is not able to form the interchain sheet using cysteine cross linking we confirmed that the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger plzf btb dimer is strand exchanged in solution while the fazf btb dimer is not a phylogenic tree of the btb fold based on both sequence and structural features shows that the common ancestor of the btb domain in btb zf bric  brac tramtrack broad complex zinc finger proteins was a domain swapped dimer the differences in the n termini seen in the fazf and miz btb domains appear to be more recent developments in the structural evolution of the domain
