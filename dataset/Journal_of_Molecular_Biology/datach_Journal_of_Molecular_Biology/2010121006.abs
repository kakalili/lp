crystal structure of human interferon   in complex with its high affinity receptor interferon  r
interferon ifn    also known as interleukin il   belongs to the recently discovered group of type iii ifns all type iii ifns initiate signaling processes through formation of specific heterodimeric receptor complexes consisting of ifn  r and il  r  we have determined the structure of human ifn   complexed with human ifn  r  a receptor unique to type iii ifns the overall structure of ifn   is topologically similar to the structure of il  and other members of the il  family of cytokines ifn  r consists of two distinct domains having fibronectin type iii topology the ligand  receptor interface includes helix a loop ab and helix f on the ifn site as well as loops primarily from the n terminal domain and inter domain hinge region of ifn  r  composition and architecture of the interface that includes only a few direct hydrogen bonds support an idea that long range ionic interactions between ligand and receptor govern the process of initial recognition of the molecules while hydrophobic interactions finalize it
