directed evolution of the dnak chaperone mutations in the lid domain result in enhanced chaperone activity
we improved the dnak molecular chaperone system for increased folding efficiency towards two target proteins by using a multi parameter screening procedure first we used a folding deficient c terminal truncated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase cat cd  to obtain tunable selective pressure for enhanced dnak chaperon function in vivo second we screened selected clones in vitro for cat cd activity after growth under selective pressure we then analyzed how these variants performed as compared to wild type dnak towards folding assistance of a second target protein namely chemically denatured firefly luciferase a total of  single point dnak mutants and  truncated variant were identified using cat cd as the protein target while  of the  selected variants showed improved luciferase refolding in vitro this shows that improving the dnak chaperone by using a certain target substrate protein does not necessarily result in a loss or reduction in its ability to assist other proteins of the  identified mutations half were clustered in the nucleotide binding domain and half in the lid domain ld of dnak the truncated variant is characterized by a  residue c terminal truncation cd  and exhibited the highest improvement for luciferase refolding cd  showed a  fold increase in initial refolding rate for denatured luciferase and resulted in a  fold increase in maximal luminescence as compared to wild type dnak given that the best in vitro performing mutants contained ld substitutions and that the ld is not involved in atp binding atp hydrolysis or client protein association but is involved in allosteric regulation of the chaperone cycle we propose that improved dnak variants result in changes to allosteric domain communication ultimately retuning the atp dependent chaperone cycle
