concerted dynamics link allosteric sites in the pbx homeodomain
the pbx homeodomain pbx hd cooperatively binds dna with hox transcription factors and helps to regulate gene expression during vertebrate development allostery plays an important role in these interactions dna binding on one surface of pbx hd enhances interactions with hox proteins at a different interface in addition dna binding causes a  residue extension at the c terminus of pbx hd to undergo a disorder to helix transition although this region does not directly contact the dna deletion of the c terminal extension reduces both the dna affinity of pbx hd and the cooperativity of forming the dna hox pbx hd ternary complex to better understand the mechanism underlying these allosteric interactions we used nmr relaxation dispersion dynamics experiments to characterize millisecond timescale motions in pbx hd over a range of temperatures the data show that the c terminal extension folds to form a fourth  helix to a level of     even in the absence of binding partners this suggests that pbx hd transiently preorganizes prior to binding dna reminiscent of the  conformational selection  model of molecular recognition folding of the c terminal extension in the unbound protein is accompanied by structural rearrangements in both the dna binding site and the hox binding site suggesting a possible role for these dynamics in the allosteric mechanism of pbx hd
