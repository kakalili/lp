the bpti decamer observed in acidic ph crystal forms pre exists as a stable species in solution edited by m f moody
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor bpti crystallizes under acidic ph conditions in the presence of thiocyanate chloride and sulfate ions yielding three different polymorphs in p  p   and p   space groups respectively in all three crystal forms the same decamer is found in the packing ten bpti molecules organized through two perpendicular  fold and  fold axes as a well defined and compact object in contrast to the monomeric crystal forms observed at basic ph conditions the crystallization of bpti under acidic conditions ph   was investigated by small angle x ray scattering with both under and supersaturated bpti solutions data showed the oligomerization of bpti molecules under all investigated conditions accordingly various mixtures of discrete oligomers n  to   were considered calculated scattering curves were obtained using models based on the crystallographic structures and the experimental patterns were analyzed as a linear combination of the model curves using a non linear curve fitting procedure the results confirmed by gel filtration experiments unambiguously demonstrate the co existence of two different bpti particles in solution a monomer and a decamer with no evidence of any other intermediates moreover using both approaches the fraction of decamers was found to increase with increasing salt concentration even beyond the solubility curve we therefore propose that at acidic ph bpti crystallizes following a two step process decamers are first built in under and supersaturated solutions upon which crystal growth proceeds by decamer stacking indeed those bpti crystals should best be described as  bpti decamer  crystals
