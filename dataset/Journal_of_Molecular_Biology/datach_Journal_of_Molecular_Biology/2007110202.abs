dissection of protein  protein interaction and cdk inhibition in the oncogenic versus tumor suppressing functions of gankyrin and p
protein  protein interactions usually involve a large number of residues thus it is difficult to elucidate functional and structural roles of specific residues located in the interface this problem is particularly challenging for ankyrin repeat proteins ars  which consist of linear arrays of small repeating units and play critical roles in almost every life process via protein  protein interactions because the residues involved are discontinuously dispersed in both the ars and their partners our previous studies showed that while both specific cdk inhibitor p ink a p  and gankyrin bind to cyclin dependent kinase  cdk  in similar fashion only p  inhibits the kinase activity of cdk  while this could explain why p  is a tumor suppressor and gankyrin is oncogenic the structural basis of these contrasting properties was unknown here we show that a double mutant of gankyrin l h i d inhibits the kinase activity of cdk  similar to p  and such cdk inhibtory activity is associated with the i d but not l h mutation in addition mutations at i  and l  bring about a moderate decrease in the stability of gankyrin further structural and biophysical analyses suggest that the substitution of ile  with asp leads to local conformational changes in loops i  iii of gankyrin taken together our results allow the dissection of the  protein  protein binding  and  cdk inhibition  functions of p  show that the difference between tumor suppressing and oncogenic functions of p  and gankyrin respectively mainly resides in a single residue and provide structural insight to the contrasting biological functions of the two ar proteins
