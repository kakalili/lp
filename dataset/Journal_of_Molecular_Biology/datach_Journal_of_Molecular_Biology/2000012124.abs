formation and repair of heteroduplex dna on both sides of the double strand break during mammalian gene targeting edited by m gottesman
in this study we examined homologous recombination in mammalian cells using a gene targeting assay in which the introduction of a double strand break dsb in the vector borne region of homology to the chromosome resulted in targeted vector integration the vector borne dsb was flanked with small palindromic insertions that when encompassed within heteroduplex dna hdna formed during targeted vector integration were capable of avoiding the activity of the mismatch repair mmr system when used in conjunction with an isolation procedure in which the product s of each targeted vector integration event were retained for molecular analysis information about recombination mechanisms was obtained the examination of marker segregation patterns in independent recombinants revealed the following  i hdna tracts could form simultaneously on each side of the dsb and in both participating homologous regions clonal analysis of sectored recombinants revealed that in the homologous repeats generated by the recombination event vector borne palindrome and chromosomal markers were linked in the expected way in each strand of the hdna intermediate  ii hdna tracts were subject to mmr processing that occurred on opposite sides of the dsb and iii in the majority of recombinants the vector borne marker was replaced with the corresponding marker from the chromosome bidirectional hdna formation and mmr processing of both sides of the dsb are consistent with the double strand break repair dsbr model of recombination
