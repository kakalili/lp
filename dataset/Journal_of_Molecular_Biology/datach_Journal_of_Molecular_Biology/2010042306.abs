unusual conformation of the sxn motif in the crystal structure of penicillin binding protein a from mycobacterium tuberculosis
pbpa from mycobacterium tuberculosis is a class b like penicillin binding protein pbp that is not essential for cell growth in m tuberculosis but is important for proper cell division in mycobacterium smegmatis we have determined the crystal structure of pbpa at     resolution the first published structure of a pbp from this important pathogen compared to other pbps pbpa has a relatively small n terminal domain and conservation of a cluster of charged residues within this domain suggests that pbpa is more related to class b pbps than previously inferred from sequence analysis the c terminal domain is a typical transpeptidase fold and contains the three conserved active site motifs characterisitic of penicillin interacting enzymes whilst the arrangement of the sxxk and ktg motifs is similar to that observed in other pbps the sxn motif is markedly displaced away from the active site such that its serine ser   is not involved in hydrogen bonding with residues of the other two motifs a disulfide bridge between cys   the  x  of the sxn motif and cys   which resides on an adjacent loop may be responsible for this unusual conformation another interesting feature of the structure is a relatively long connection between   and    which restricts the space available in the active site of pbpa and suggests that conformational changes would be required to accommodate peptide substrate or  lactam antibiotics during acylation finally the structure shows that one of the two threonines postulated to be targets for phosphorylation is inaccessible thr   whereas the other thr   is well placed on a surface loop near the active site
