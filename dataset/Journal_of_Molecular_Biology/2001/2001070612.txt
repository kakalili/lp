MoeA is involved in synthesis of the molybdopterin cofactor, although its function is not yet clearly defined. The three-dimensional structure of the Escherichia coli protein was solved at 2.2 Ã… resolution. The locations of highly conserved residues among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic MoeA homologs identifies a cleft in the dimer interface as the likely functional site. Of the four domains of MoeA, domain 2 displays a novel fold and domains 1 and 4 each have only one known structural homolog. Domain 3, in contrast, is structurally similar to many other proteins. The protein that resembles domain 3 most closely is MogA, another protein required for molybdopterin cofactor synthesis. The overall similarity between MoeA and MogA, and the similarities in a constellation of residues that are strongly conserved in MoeA, suggests that these proteins bind similar ligands or substrates and may have similar functions.
