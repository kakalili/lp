cholesterol a modulator of membrane associated a  fibrillogenesis and neurotoxicity edited by a klug
recent studies have suggested that cholesterol an important determinant of the physical state of biological membranes plays a significant role in the development of alzheimer  s disease we have employed in situ scanning probe microscopy fluorescence anisotropy and electron microscopy to investigate how cholesterol levels within total brain lipid bilayers effect amyloid  peptide a  assembly fluorescence anisotropy measurements revealed that the relative fluidity of the total brain lipid membranes was influenced by the level of cholesterol and the addition of a   resulted in a decrease in the overall vesicle fluidity in situ scanning probe microscopy performed on supported planar bilayers of total brain lipid revealed a correlation between membrane fluidity as influenced by cholesterol level and the extent of a  insertion and subsequent fibrillogenesis these observations were consistent with fluorescence microscopy studies of pc  and sh sy y cell lines exposed to exogenous a  which revealed an inverse correlation between membrane cholesterol level and a  cell surface binding and subsequent cell death these results collectively suggest that a  cell surface interactions are mediated by cellular cholesterol levels the distribution of cholesterol throughout the cell and membrane fluidity
