the role of steric hindrance in tc resistance of human immunodeficiency virus type  reverse transcriptase edited by a r fersht
treating hiv infections with drugs that block viral replication selects for drug resistant strains of the virus particular inhibitors select characteristic resistance mutations in the case of the nucleoside analogs tc and ftc resistant viruses are selected with mutations at amino acid residue   of reverse transcriptase rt  the initial change is usually to m  i this virus is rapidly replaced by a variant carrying the mutation m  v  tc and ftc are taken up by cells and converted into tctp and ftctp the triphosphate forms of these nucleoside analogs are incorporated into dna by hiv  rt and act as chain terminators both of the mutations m  i and m  v provide very high levels of resistance in vivo purified hiv  rt carrying m  v and m  i also shows resistance to tctp and ftctp in in vitro polymerase assays amino acid m  is part of the dntp binding site of hiv  rt structural studies suggest that the mechanism of resistance of hiv  rts carrying the m  v or m  i mutation involves steric hindrance which could either completely block the binding of tctp and ftctp or allow binding of these nucleoside triphosphate molecules but only in a configuration that would prevent incorporation the available kinetic data are ambiguous one group has reported that the primary effect of the mutations is at the level of tctp binding another at the level of incorporation we have approached this problem using assays that monitor the ability of hiv  rt to undergo a conformational change upon binding a dntp these studies show that both wild type rt and the drug resistant variants can bind tctp at the polymerase active site however the binding to m  v and m  i is somewhat weaker and is sensitive to salt we propose that the drug resistant variants bind tctp in a strained configuration that is salt sensitive and is not catalytically competent
