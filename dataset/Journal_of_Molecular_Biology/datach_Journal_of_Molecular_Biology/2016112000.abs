biochemical characterization of apobec h variants implications for their hiv  restriction activity and mc modification
apobec h a h is the most polymorphic member of the apobec family seven haplotypes hap i  vii and four mrna splicing variants sv of a h have been identified the various haplotypes differ in anti hiv activity which is attributed to differences in protein stability subcellular distribution and or rna binding and virion packaging here we report the first comparative biochemical studies of all the a h variants using highly purified proteins we show that all haplotypes were stably expressed and could be purified to homogeneity by escherichia coli expression surprisingly four out of the seven haplotypes showed high cytosine c deaminase activity with hap v displaying extremely high activity that was comparable to the highly active a a furthermore all four haplotypes that were active in c deamination were also highly active on methylated c mc  with hap ii displaying almost equal deamination efficiency on both the deamination activity of these a h variants correlates well with their reported anti hiv activity for the different haplotypes suggesting that deaminase activity may be an important factor in determining their respective anti hiv activities moreover mc deamination of a h displayed a strong preference for the sequence motif of t mcpg c g which may suggest a potential role in genomic mc modification at the characteristic  cpg  island motif
