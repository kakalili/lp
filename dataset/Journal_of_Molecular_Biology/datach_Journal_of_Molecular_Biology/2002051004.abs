substrate binding induces domain movements in orotidine   monophosphate decarboxylase
orotidine   monophosphate decarboxylase odcase catalyses the decarboxylation of orotidine   monophosphate to uridine   monophosphate ump  we have earlier determined the structure of odcase from escherichia coli complexed with the inhibitor     phospho  d ribofuranosyl barbituric acid bmp  here we present the    structure of the uncomplexed apo enzyme determined from twinned crystals a structural analysis and comparison of the two structures of the e coli enzyme show that binding of the inhibitor is accompanied by significant domain movements of approximately   around a hinge that crosses the active site hence the odcase dimer which contains two active sites may be divided in three domains a central domain that is fixed and two lids which independently move   upon binding corresponding analyses presented herein of the two saccharomyces cerevisiae odcase structures with and without bmp and the methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum odcase structures with and without  aza ump show very similar but somewhat smaller domain movements the domain movements seem to be initiated by the phosphoryl binding to the enzyme and can explain why the binding of the phosphoryl group is essential for the catalytic function
