the activation energy for insertion of transmembrane  helices is dependent on membrane composition
the physical mechanisms that govern the folding and assembly of integral membrane proteins are poorly understood it appears that certain properties of the lipid bilayer affect membrane protein folding in vitro either by modulating helix insertion or packing in order to begin to understand the origin of this effect we investigate the effect of lipid forces on the insertion of a transmembrane  helix using a water soluble alanine based peptide kkaaaiaaaaaiaawaaiaaakkkk amide this peptide binds to preformed   dioleoyl l  phosphatidylcholine dopc vesicles at neutral ph but spontaneous transmembrane helix insertion directly from the aqueous phase only occurs at high ph when the lys residues are de protonated these results suggest that the translocation of charge is a major determinant of the activation energy for insertion time resolved measurements of the insertion process at high ph indicate biphasic kinetics with time constants of ca  and   seconds the slower phase seems to correlate with formation of a predominantly transmembrane  helical conformation as determined from the transfer of the tryptophan residue to the hydrocarbon region of the membrane temperature dependent measurements showed that insertion can proceed only above a certain threshold temperature and that the arrhenius activation energy is of the order of  kjmol   the kinetics threshold temperature and the activation energy change with the mole fraction of   dioleoyl l  phosphatidylethanolamine dope introduced into the dopc membrane the activation energy increases with increasing dope content which could reflect the fact that this lipid drives the bilayer towards a non bilayer transition and increases the lateral pressure in the lipid chain region this suggests that folding events involving the insertion of helical segments across the bilayer can be controlled by lipid forces
