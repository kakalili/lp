twist and shear in  sheets and  ribbons edited by j thornton
the structures of the  sheets and the  ribbons have been analysed using high resolution protein structure data systematic asymmetries measured in both parallel and antiparallel  structures include the sheet twist and the strand shear in order to determine the origin of these asymmetries numerous interactions and correlations were examined the strongest correlations are observed for residues in antiparallel  sheets and  ribbons that form non h bonded pairs for these residues the sheet twist is correlated to the backbone  angle but not to the  angle our analysis supports the existence of an inter strand c h   o weak h bond which together with the co  hn h bond constitutes a bifurcated h bond that links neighbouring  strands residues of  sheets and  ribbons in high resolution protein structures form a distinct region of the ramachandran plot which is determined by the formation of the bifurcated h bond the formation of an intra strand o  h  non bonded polar interaction and an intra strand o  c  steric clash using  strands parameterised by    values from the allowed  sheet region of the ramachandran plot the shear and the right hand twist can be reproduced in a simple model of the antiparallel and parallel  ribbon that models the bifurcated h bonds specifically the conformations of interior residues of  sheets are shown to be subsets of the conformations of residues of  ribbons
