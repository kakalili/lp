time resolved fret detection of subtle temperature induced conformational biases in ensembles of  synuclein molecules
the  synuclein  s molecule a polypeptide of   residues is an intrinsically disordered protein that is involved in the onset of parkinson s disease we applied time resolved excitation energy transfer measurements in search of specific deviations from the disordered state in segments of the  s backbone that might be involved in the initiation of aggregation since at higher temperatures the  s molecule undergoes accelerated aggregation we studied the temperature dependence of the distributions of intramolecular segmental end to end distances and their fast fluctuations in eight labeled chain segments of the  s molecule over the temperature range of      c no temperature induced unfolding or folding was detected at the n terminal domain residues     of the  s molecule the intramolecular diffusion coefficient of the segments ends relative to each other increased monotonously with temperature a common very high upper limiting value of    a ns was reached at    c another indication of a fully disordered state three exceptions were two segments with reduced values of the diffusion coefficients the shortest segment where the excluded volume effect is dominant and the segment labeled in the nac domain and a nonlinear cooperative transition in the n terminal segment these specific subtle deviations from the common pattern of temperature dependence reflect specific structural constraints that could be critical in controlling the stability of the soluble monomer or for its aggregation such very weak effects might be dominant in determination of the fate of ensembles of disordered polypeptides either to folding or to misfolding
