mutational specificities of brominated dna adducts catalyzed by human dna polymerases
chronic inflammation is known to lead to an increased risk for the development of cancer under inflammatory condition cellular dna is damaged by hypobromous acid which is generated by myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase the reactive brominating species induced brominated dna adducts such as  bromo   deoxyguanosine  br dg   bromo   deoxyadenosine  br da  and  bromo   deoxycytidine  br dc  these dna lesions may be implicated in carcinogenesis in this study we analyzed the miscoding properties of the brominated dna adducts generated by human dna polymerases pols  site specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides containing a single  br dg  br da or  br dc were used as a template in primer extension reactions catalyzed by human pols     and   when  br dg modified template was used pol  primarily incorporated dcmp the correct base opposite the lesion along with a small amount of one base deletion     pol  also promoted one base deletion     accompanied by misincorporation of dgmp     damp     and dtmp    opposite the lesion pol   on the other hand readily bypassed the  br dg lesion in an error free manner as for  br da and  br dc all the pols bypassed the lesions and no miscoding events were observed these results indicate that only  br dg and not  br dc and  br da is a mutagenic lesion the miscoding frequency and specificity vary depending on the dna pol used thus hypobromous acid induced  br dg adduct may increase mutagenic potential at the site of inflammation
