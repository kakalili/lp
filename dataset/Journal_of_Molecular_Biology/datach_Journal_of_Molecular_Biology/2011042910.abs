design of peptide inhibitors that bind the bzip domain of epstein  barr virus protein bzlf
designing proteins or peptides that bind native protein targets can aid the development of novel reagents and or therapeutics rational design also tests our understanding of the principles underlying protein recognition this article describes several strategies used to design peptides that bind to the basic region leucine zipper bzip domain of the viral transcription factor bzlf  which is encoded by the epstein  barr virus bzlf regulates the transition of the epstein  barr virus from a latent state to a lytic state it shares some properties in common with the more studied human bzip transcription factors but also includes novel structural elements that pose interesting challenges to inhibitor design in designing peptides that bind to bzlf by forming a coiled coil structure we considered both affinity for bzlf and undesired self association which can weaken the effectiveness of an inhibitor several designed peptides exhibited different degrees of target binding affinity and self association rationally engineered molecules were more potent inhibitors of dna binding than a control peptide corresponding to the native bzlf dimerization region itself the most potent inhibitors included both positive and negative design elements and exploited interaction with the coiled coil and basic dna binding regions of bzlf
