hormonal regulation of the e  gene in drosophila identifying functional regulatory elements through computational and biological analysis
drosophila development is regulated by two hormones   hydroxyecdysone ecdysone and juvenile hormone we previously found that expression of the e  gene is induced by both hormones in cultured s cells e  occupies over   kb of genomic dna it has four alternative promoters producing isoforms e a e b e c and e d to identify hormone response elements in the  kb noncoding area upstream of the e a transcription start site we developed a novel approach combining in vitro in vivo and in silico techniques using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative real time pcr we identified five putative enhancers marked with h k monomethylation and depletion of h  four of these are ecdysone regulated enhancers which possess hormone responsive chromatin and contain sequences sufficient to confer ecdysone inducibility to a reporter gene using evoprinterhd and multiple expectation maximization for motif elicitation based computational analysis we first created a database of short sequences that are highly conserved among  drosophila species within this database we then identified a set of putative ecdysone response elements ecres  seven of these elements represent in vivo binding sites for the ecdysone receptor and are necessary for hormone mediated activation of gene expression in cultured cells we found that each ecre exhibits different binding and activation properties and at least some of them function cooperatively we propose that the presence of multiple ecres with distinct features provides flexibility to the rapid and powerful response of e a to ecdysone during drosophila development
