structural and functional studies of the rap c terminus reveal novel separation of function mutants
the yeast rap protein plays an important role in transcriptional silencing and in telomere length homeostasis rap mediates silencing at the hm loci and at telomeres by recruiting the sir and sir proteins to chromatin via a rap c terminal domain which also recruits the telomere length regulators rif and rif  we report the     resolution crystal structure of the rap c terminus which adopts an all helical fold with no structural homologues the structure was used to engineer surface mutations in rap  and the effects of these mutations on silencing and telomere length regulation were assayed in vivo our surprising finding was that there is no overlap between mutations affecting mating type and telomeric silencing suggesting that rap plays distinct roles in silencing at the silent mating type loci and telomeres we also found novel rap phenotypes and new separation of function mutants which provide new tools for studying rap function yeast two hybrid studies were used to determine how specific mutations affect recruitment of sir  rif  and rif  a comparison of the yeast two hybrid and functional data reveals patterns of protein interactions that correlate with each rap phenotype we find that sir interactions are important for telomeric silencing but not mating type silencing and that rif and rif interactions are important in different subsets of telomeric length mutants our results show that the role of rap in silencing differs between the hm loci and the telomeres and offer insight into the interplay between hm silencing telomeric silencing and telomere length regulation these findings suggest a model in which competition and multiple recruitment events modulate silencing and telomere length regulation
