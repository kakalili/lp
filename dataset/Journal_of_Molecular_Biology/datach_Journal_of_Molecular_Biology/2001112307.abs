cooperative folding of the isolated  helical domain of hen egg white lysozyme edited by c r matthews
proteins in the  lactalbumin and c type lysozyme family have been studied extensively as model systems in protein folding early formation of the  helical domain is observed in both  lactalbumin and c type lysozyme however the details of the kinetic folding pathways are significantly different the major folding intermediate of hen egg white lysozyme has a cooperatively formed tertiary structure whereas the intermediate of  lactalbumin exhibits the characteristics of a molten globule in this study we have designed and constructed an isolated  helical domain of hen egg white lysozyme called lyso   as a model of the lysozyme folding intermediate that is stable at equilibrium disulfide exchange studies show that under native conditions the cysteine residues in lyso  prefer to form the same set of disulfide bonds as in the  helical domain of full length lysozyme under denaturing conditions formation of the nearest neighbor disulfide bonds is strongly preferred in contrast to the isolated  helical domain of  lactalbumin lyso  with two native disulfide bonds exhibits a well defined tertiary structure as indicated by cooperative thermal unfolding and a well dispersed nmr spectrum thus the determinants for formation of the cooperative side chain interactions are located mainly in the  helical domain our studies suggest that the difference in kinetic folding pathways between  lactalbumin and lysozyme can be explained by the difference in packing density between secondary structural elements and support the hypothesis that the structured regions in a protein folding intermediate may correspond to regions that can fold independently
