nature disfavors sequences of alternating polar and non polar amino acids implications for amyloidogenesis edited by f e cohen
recent experiments with combinatorial libraries of de novo proteins have demonstrated that sequences designed to contain polar and non polar amino acid residues arranged in an alternating pattern form fibrillar structures resembling  amyloid this finding prompted us to probe the distribution of alternating patterns in the sequences of natural proteins analysis of a database of     protein sequences       residues for all possible binary patterns of polar and non polar amino acid residues revealed that alternating patterns occur significantly less often than other patterns with similar compositions the under representation of alternating binary patterns in natural protein sequences coupled with the observation that such patterns promote amyloid like structures in de novo proteins suggests that sequences of alternating polar and non polar amino acids are inherently amyloidogenic and consequently have been disfavored by evolutionary selection
