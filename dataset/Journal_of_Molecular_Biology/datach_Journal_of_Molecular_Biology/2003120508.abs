mechanism of repression by bacillus subtilis ccpc a lysr family regulator
bacillus subtilis ccpc is a lysr family transcriptional regulatory protein that negatively regulates genes encoding enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid branch of the krebs cycle in the present work the promoter region of the aconitase citb gene was used to investigate the mechanism of repression by ccpc the binding of ccpc to the citb promoter region was shown to depend on dna elements located near positions    and    binding to these elements induced a bend in the dna at position    introduction of mutations in the    region and the presence of citrate the inducer had similar effects in either case citb expression was derepressed in vivo the affinity of ccpc binding was reduced in vitro the angle of the bend was relaxed and rna polymerase gained greater access to the    region of the promoter
