dna binding mode transitions of escherichia coli hu   evidence for formation of a bent dna   protein complex on intact linear duplex dna
escherichia coli hu   a major nucleoid associated protein organizes chromosomal dna and facilitates numerous dna transactions using isothermal titration calorimetry fluorescence resonance energy transfer and a series of dna lengths   bp   bp   bp   bp and   bp we established that hu   interacts with duplex dna using three different nonspecific binding modes both the hu to dna molar ratio  hu  dna  and dna length dictate the dominant hu binding mode on sufficiently long dna     bp  at low hu  dna  hu populates a noncooperative   bp binding mode with a binding constant of        m   and a binding enthalpy of      kcal mol at   c and    m na  with increasing hu  dna  hu bound in the noncooperative   bp mode progressively converts to two cooperative      modes with site sizes of   bp and  bp these latter modes exhibit smaller binding constants         m   for the   bp mode         m   for the  bp mode and binding enthalpies      kcal mol for the   bp mode        kcal mol for the  bp mode  as dna length increases to   bp or more at low hu  dna  the small modes are replaced by the   bp binding mode fluorescence resonance energy transfer data demonstrate that the   bp mode bends dna by     whereas the  bp and   bp modes do not the model proposed in this study provides a novel quantitative and comprehensive framework for reconciling previous structural and solution studies of hu including single molecule force extension measurement  fluorescence and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays in particular it explains how hu condenses or extends dna depending on the relative concentrations of hu and dna
