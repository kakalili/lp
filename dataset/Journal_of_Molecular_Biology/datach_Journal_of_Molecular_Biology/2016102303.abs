compact structure patterns in proteins
globular proteins typically fold into tightly packed arrays of regular secondary structures we developed a model to approximate the compact parallel and antiparallel arrangement of  helices and  strands enumerated all possible topologies formed by up to five secondary structural elements sses  searched for their occurrence in spatial structures of proteins and documented their frequencies of occurrence in the pdb the enumeration model grows larger super secondary structure patterns ssps by combining pairs of smaller patterns a process that approximates a potential path of protein fold evolution the most prevalent ssps are typically present in superfolds such as the rossmann like fold the ferredoxin like fold and the greek key motif whereas the less frequent ssps often possess uncommon structure features such as split  sheets left handed connections and crossing loops this complete ssp enumeration model for the first time allows us to investigate which theoretically possible ssps are not observed in available protein structures all ssps with up to four sses occurred in proteins however among the ssps with five sses approximately      are absent from existing folds of these unobserved ssps   contain two or more uncommon structure features to facilitate future efforts in protein structure classification engineering and design we provide the resulting patterns and their frequency of occurrence in proteins at http  prodata swmed edu ssps
