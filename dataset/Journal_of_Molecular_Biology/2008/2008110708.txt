Mutations in the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause a subset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases. SOD1 is a homodimer in which each monomer binds one copper atom and one zinc atom. Mutation is believed to increase the conformational flexibility of SOD1, giving rise to a misfolded SOD1 population with novel cytotoxic properties. While SOD1's metal ligands affect its stability greatly, little is known about the role these metals play in the folding, unfolding, and misfolding processes. Here, we present a method by which we were able to measure the rates of metal release during SOD1 unfolding in guanidine hydrochloride. Rates of dimer dissociation, measured by a time-resolved cross-linking assay, and conformational changes in SOD1's Î²-barrel core, monitored by tryptophan fluorescence intensity, were compared with the rates of copper release and zinc release. Correlations were observed across a range of denaturant concentrations, giving rise to a more detailed model of the SOD1 unfolding process than was previously available. According to this model, the major unfolding pathway involves simultaneous dimer dissociation and zinc release as an early step that is followed by a slow conformational change in the protein's core, which, in turn, is followed by rapid copper release. This model establishes a zinc-deficient, copper-loaded SOD1 monomer as a well-populated SOD1 unfolding intermediate and a species likely to be populated under conditions of denaturational stress. Because the cytotoxicity of zinc-deficient SOD1 has been demonstrated previously, this species is a good candidate for the cytotoxic species in SOD1-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
