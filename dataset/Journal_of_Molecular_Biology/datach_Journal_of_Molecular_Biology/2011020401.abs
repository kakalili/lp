iwrap an interface threading approach with application to prediction of cancer related protein  protein interactions
current homology modeling methods for predicting protein  protein interactions ppis have difficulty in the  twilight zone   lt   of sequence identities threading methods extend coverage further into the twilight zone by aligning primary sequences for a pair of proteins to a best fit template complex to predict an entire three dimensional structure we introduce a threading approach iwrap which focuses only on the protein interface our approach combines a novel linear programming formulation for interface alignment with a boosting classifier for interaction prediction we demonstrate its efficacy on scoppi a classification of ppis in the protein databank and on the entire yeast genome iwrap provides significantly improved prediction of ppis and their interfaces in stringent cross validation on scoppi furthermore by combining our predictions with a full complex threader we achieve a coverage of   for the yeast ppis which is close to a   increase over previous methods at a higher sensitivity as an application we effectively combine iwrap with genomic data to identify novel cancer related genes involved in chromatin remodeling nucleosome organization and ribonuclear complex assembly iwrap is available at http  iwrap csail mit edu
