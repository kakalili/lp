The RNA recognition motif (RRM) is one of the most common eukaryotic protein motifs. RRM sequences form a conserved globular structure known as the RNA-binding domain (RBD) or the ribonucleoprotein domain. Many proteins that contain RRM sequences bind RNA in a sequence-specific manner. To investigate the basis for the RNA-binding specificity of RRMs, we subjected 330 aligned RRM sequences to covariance analysis. The analysis revealed a single network of covariant amino acid pairs comprising the buried core of the RBD and a surface patch. Structural studies have implicated a subset of these residues in RNA binding. The covariance linkages identify a larger set of amino acid residues, including some not directly in contact with bound RNA, that may influence RNA-binding specificity.
