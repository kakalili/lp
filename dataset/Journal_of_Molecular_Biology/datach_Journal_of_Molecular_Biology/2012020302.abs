unwinding initiation by the viral rna helicase nph ii
viral rna helicases of the ns nph ii group unwind rna duplexes by processive directional translocation on one of the duplex strands the translocation is preceded by a poorly understood unwinding initiation phase for nph ii from vaccinia virus unwinding initiation is rate limiting for the overall unwinding reaction to develop a mechanistic understanding of the unwinding initiation we studied kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of this reaction phase for nph ii in vitro using biochemical and single molecule fluorescence approaches our data show that nph ii functions as a monomer and that different stages of the atp hydrolysis cycle dictate distinct binding preferences of nph ii for duplex versus single stranded rna we further find that the nph ii  rna complex does not adopt a single conformation but rather at least two distinct conformations in each of the analyzed stages of atp hydrolysis these conformations interconvert with rate constants that depend on the stage of the atp hydrolysis cycle our data establish a basic mechanistic framework for unwinding initiation by nph ii and suggest that the various stages of the atp hydrolysis cycle do not induce single stage specific conformations in the nph ii  rna complex but primarily control transitions between multiple states
