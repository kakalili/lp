structural and functional characterization of mitochondrial endog a sugar non specific nuclease which plays an important role during apoptosis
combining sequence analysis structure prediction and site directed mutagenesis we have investigated the mechanism of catalysis and substrate binding by the apoptotic mitochondrial nuclease endog which belongs to the large family of dna rna non specific    me finger nucleases catalysis of phosphodiester bond cleavage involves several highly conserved amino acid residues namely his   asn   and glu  required for water activation and metal ion binding as well as arg  required for proper substrate binding and positioning respectively these results indicate that endog basically follows a similar mechanism as the serratia nuclease the best studied representative of the family of dna rna non specific nucleases but that differences are observed for transition state stabilisation in addition we have identified two putative dna rna binding residues of bovine endog arg  and arg   strictly conserved only among mammalian members of the nuclease family suggesting a similar mode of binding to single and double stranded nucleic acid substrates by these enzymes finally we demonstrate by ectopic expression of active and inactive variants of bovine endog in hela and cv cells that extramitochondrial active endog by itself induces cell death whereas expression of an enzymatically inactive variant does not
