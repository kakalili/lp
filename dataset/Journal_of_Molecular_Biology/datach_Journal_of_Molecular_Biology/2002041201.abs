temperature dependence of protein hydrogen bond properties as studied by high resolution nmr edited by p e wright
the temperature dependence of a large number of nmr parameters describing hydrogen bond properties in the protein ubiquitin was followed over a range from  to   c the parameters comprise hydrogen bond h bond scalar couplings h jnc   chemical shifts amide proton exchange rates  n relaxation parameters as well as covalent jnc  and jnh couplings a global weakening of the h jnc  coupling with increasing temperature is accompanied by a global upfield shift of the amide protons and a decrease of the sequential jnc  couplings if interpreted as a linear increase of the n  o distance the change in h jnc  corresponds to an average linear thermal expansion coefficient for the nh  o hydrogen bonds of       k which is in good agreement with overall volume expansion coefficients observed for proteins a residue specific analysis reveals that not all hydrogen bonds are affected to the same extent by the thermal expansion the end of  sheet     at hydrogen bond e   q appears as the most thermolabile whereas the adjacent hydrogen bond i  l  connecting  strands   and   is even stabilized slightly at higher temperatures additional evidence for the stabilization of the      hairpin at higher temperatures is found in reduced hydrogen exchange rates for strand end residue v  this reduction corresponds to a stabilizing change in free energy of   kj mol for the     hairpin the result can be linked to the finding that the     hairpin behaves as an autonomously folding unit in the a state of ubiquitin under changed solvent conditions for several amide groups the temperature dependencies of the amide exchange rates and h bond scalar couplings are uncorrelated therefore amide exchange rates are not a sole function of the hydrogen bond  strength  as given by the electronic overlap of donors and acceptors but are clearly dependent on other blocking mechanisms
