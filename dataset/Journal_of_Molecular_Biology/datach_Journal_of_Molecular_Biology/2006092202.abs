opening of holes in liposomal membranes is induced by proteins possessing the ferm domain
the destabilization of vesicles caused by interactions between lipid bilayers and proteins was studied by direct real time observation using high intensity dark field microscopy we previously reported that talin a cytoskeletal submembranous protein can reversibly open stable large holes in giant liposomes made of neutral and acidic phospholipids talin and other proteins belonging to the band   superfamily have the ferm domain at their n terminal and interact with lipid membranes via that domain here we observed that band   ezrin and moesin members of the band   superfamily are also able to open stable holes in liposomes however truncation of their c terminal domains which can interact with the n terminal ferm domain impaired their hole opening activities oligomeric states of ezrin affected the capability of the membrane hole formation phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate pip  which binds to the ferm domain and disrupts the interaction between the n and c termini of the band   superfamily down regulates their membrane opening activity these results suggest that the intermolecular interaction plays a key role in the observed membrane hole formation
