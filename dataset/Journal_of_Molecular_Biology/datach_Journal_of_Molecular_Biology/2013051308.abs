derivation of the crick  wyman equation for allosteric proteins defining the difference between the number of binding sites and the hill coefficient
in response to a   word footnote in the   article by monod wyman and changeux a detailed manuscript signed by francis crick and jeffries wyman with   words and  equations entitled  a footnote on allostery  circulated in   among a limited group of scientists interested in allosteric interactions this interesting and provocative document is published in this special issue for the first time an intriguing equation in their text relates the difference between n the number of ligand binding sites and n   the hill coefficient to the ratio of the saturation functions y  for oligomers with n   and n binding sites a compact derivation of this equation was not provided by crick and wyman but one is presented here based on a definition of y  involving the binding polynomial and its first derivative
