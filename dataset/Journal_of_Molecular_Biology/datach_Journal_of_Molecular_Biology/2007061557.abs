structural basis for the bifunctionality of the u snrnp  k protein cd bp
the bifunctional protein u  k is associated with the spliceosomal  s u snrnp and it also plays a role in immune response as cd receptor binding protein  cd bp  u  k binds to the cd receptor via its gyf domain specifically recognizing a proline rich motif on the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor the gyf domain is also mediating the interaction of the proteins u  k and u  k within the spliceosomal u snrnp here we report the crystal structure of the complex of gyf domain and u  k protein revealing the structural basis for the bifunctionality of the u  k protein the complex structure unveils novel interaction sites on both proteins as neither the polyproline binding site of the gyf domain nor the common ligand binding cleft of thioredoxin like proteins to which u  k belongs are involved in the interaction of u  k and u  k
