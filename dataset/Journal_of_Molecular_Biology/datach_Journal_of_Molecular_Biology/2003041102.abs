a specific interaction between the nbd of the abc transporter hlyb and a c terminal fragment of its transport substrate haemolysin a
a member of the family of rtx toxins escherichia coli haemolysin a is secreted from gram negative bacteria it carries a c terminal secretion signal of approximately  residues targeting the protein to the secretion or translocation complex in which the abc transporter hlyb is a central element we have purified the nucleotide binding domain of hlyb hlyb  nbd and a c terminal  kda fragment of hlya plus the his tag hlya  which contains the secretion sequence employing surface plasmon resonance we were able to demonstrate that the hlyb  nbd and hlya interact with a kd of approximately  m no interaction was detected between the hlya fragment and unrelated nbds opuaa involved in import of osmoprotectants and human tap  nbd involved in the export of antigenic peptides moreover a truncated version of hlya  lacking the secretion signal failed to interact with the hlyb  nbd in addition we showed that atp accelerated the dissociation of the hlyb  nbd hlya complex taking these results together we propose a model for an early stage of initiation of secretion in vivo in which the nbd of hlyb specifically recognizes the c terminus of the transport substrate hlya and where secretion is initiated by subsequent displacement of hlya from hlyb by atp
