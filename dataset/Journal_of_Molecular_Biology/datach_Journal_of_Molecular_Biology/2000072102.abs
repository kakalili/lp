solution structure of the cysteine rich domain of the escherichia coli chaperone protein dnaj
the solution structure of the cysteine rich cr domain of escherichia coli dnaj has been solved by nmr methods the structure of a  residue cr domain construct shows a novel fold with an overall v shaped extended  hairpin topology the cr domain is characterized by four c x x c x g x g sequence motifs that bind two zinc ions residues in these two zinc modules show strong similarities in the grouping of resonances in the  n h hsqc spectrum and display pseudo symmetry of the motifs in the calculated structures the conformation of the cysteine residues coordinated to the zinc ion resembles that of the rubredoxin knuckle but there are significant differences in hydrogen bonding patterns in the two motifs zinc  n h hsqc titrations indicate that the fold of the isolated dnaj cr domain is zinc dependent and that one zinc module folds before the other the c x x c x g x g sequence motif is highly conserved in cr domains from a wide variety of species the three dimensional structure of the e coli cr domain indicates that this sequence conservation is likely to result in a conserved structural motif
