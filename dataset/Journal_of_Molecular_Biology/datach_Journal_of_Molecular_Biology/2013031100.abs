metastasis promoting anterior gradient  protein has a dimeric thioredoxin fold structure and a role in cell adhesion
anterior gradient  agr  is a normal endoplasmic reticulum protein that has two important abnormal functions amphibian limb regeneration and human cancer metastasis promotion these normal intracellular and abnormal extracellular roles can be attributed to the multidomain structure of agr  the nmr structure shows that agr consists of an unstructured n terminal region followed by a thioredoxin fold the protein exists in monomer  dimer equilibrium with a kd of    m and intermolecular salt bridges involving e  and k  within the folded domain serve to stabilize the dimer the unstructured region is primarily responsible for the ability of agr to promote cell adhesion while dimerization is less important for this activity the structural data of agr show a separation between potential catalytic redox activity and adhesion function within the context of metastasis and development
