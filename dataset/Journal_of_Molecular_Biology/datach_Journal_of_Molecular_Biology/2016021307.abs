new ligand binding function of human cerberus and role of proteolytic processing in regulating ligand  receptor interactions and antagonist activity
cerberus is a key regulator of vertebrate embryogenesis its biological function has been studied extensively in frog and mouse embryos its ability to bind and antagonize the transforming growth factor   tgf   family ligand nodal is well established strikingly the molecular function of cerberus remains poorly understood the underlying reason is that cerberus is a complex multifunctional protein it binds and inhibits multiple tgf  family ligands it may bind and inhibit some wnt family members and two different forms with distinct activities have been described in addition sequence homology between frog and mammalian cerberus is low suggesting that previous studies which analyzed frog cerberus function may not accurately describe the function of mammalian cerberus we therefore undertook to determine the molecular activities of human cerberus in tgf  family signaling using purified proteins surface plasmon resonance and reporter gene assays we discovered that human cerberus bound and inhibited the tgf  family ligands activin b bmp  and bmp  but not the frog cerberus ligand bmp  notably full length cerberus successfully blocked ligand binding to type ii receptors but the short form was less effective in addition full length cerberus suppressed breast cancer cell migration but the short form did not thus our findings expand the roles of cerberus as tgf  family signaling inhibitor provide a molecular rationale for the function of the n terminal region and support the idea that cerberus could have regulatory activities beyond direct inhibition of tgf  family signaling
