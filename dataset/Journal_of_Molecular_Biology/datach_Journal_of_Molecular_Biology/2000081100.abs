a comparison of the yeast and rabbit  s ribosome reveals the topology of the nascent chain exit tunnel inter subunit bridges and mammalian rrna expansion segments edited by w baumesiter
protein synthesis in eukaryotes is mediated by both cytoplasmic and membrane bound ribosomes during the co translational translocation of secretory and membrane proteins eukaryotic ribosomes dock with the protein conducting channel of the endoplasmic reticulum an understanding of these processes will require the detailed structure of a eukaryotic ribosome to this end we have compared the three dimensional structures of yeast and rabbit ribosomes at    resolution in general we find that the active sites for protein synthesis and translocation have been highly conserved it is interesting that a channel was visualized in the neck of the small subunit whose entrance is formed by a deep groove by analogy with the prokaryotic small subunit this channel may provide a conserved portal through which mrna is threaded into the decoding center in addition both the small and large subunits are built around a dense tubular network our analysis further suggests that the nascent chain exit tunnel and the docking surface for the endoplasmic reticulum channel are formed by this network we surmise that many of these features correspond to rrna based on biochemical and structural data ribosomal function is critically dependent on the specific association of small and large subunits our analysis of eukaryotic ribosomes reveals four conserved inter subunit bridges with a geometry similar to that found in prokaryotes in particular a double bridge connects the small subunit platform with the interface canyon on the large subunit moreover a novel bridge is formed between the platform and the base of the l domain finally size differences between mammalian and yeast large subunit rrnas have been correlated with five expansion segments that form two large spines and three extended fingers overall we find that expansion segments within the large subunit rrna have been incorporated at positions distinct from the active sites for protein synthesis and translocation
