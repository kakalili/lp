proton affinity changes driving unidirectional proton transport in the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle
bacteriorhodopsin is the smallest autonomous light driven proton pump proposals as to how it achieves the directionality of its trans membrane proton transport fall into two categories accessibility switch models in which proton transfer pathways in different parts of the molecule are opened and closed during the photocycle and affinity switch models which focus on changes in proton affinity of groups along the transport chain during the photocycle using newly available structural data and adapting current methods of protein protonation state prediction to the non equilibrium case we have calculated the relative free energies of protonation microstates of groups on the transport chain during key conformational states of the photocycle proton flow is modeled using accessibility limitations that do not change during the photocycle the results show that changes in affinity microstate energy calculable from the structural models are sufficient to drive unidirectional proton transport without invoking an accessibility switch modeling studies for the n state relative to late m suggest that small structural re arrangements in the cytoplasmic side may be enough to produce the crucial affinity change of asp  during n that allows it to participate in the reprotonation of the schiff base from the cytoplasmic side methodologically the work represents a conceptual advance compared to the usual calculations of pka using macroscopic electrostatic models we operate with collective states of protonation involving all key groups rather than the individual group pka values traditionally used when combined with state to state transition rules based on accessibility considerations a model for non equilibrium proton flow is obtained such methods should also be applicable to other active proton transport systems
