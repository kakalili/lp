formation of the productive atp mg  bound dimer of glcv an abc atpase from sulfolobus solfataricus
the abc atpase glcv from sulfolobus solfataricus energizes an abc transporter mediating glucose uptake in abc transporters two abc atpases are believed to form a head to tail dimer with both monomers contributing conserved residues to each of the two productive active sites in contrast isolated glcv although active behaves apparently as a monomer in the presence of atp mg  amppnp mg  or atp alone to resolve the oligomeric state of the active form of glcv we analysed the effects of changing the putative catalytic base residue e   into glutamine or alanine both mutants are to different extents defective in atp hydrolysis and gel filtration experiments revealed their dimerization in the presence of atp mg  mutant e  q forms dimers also in the presence of atp alone without mg  whereas dimerization of mutant e  a requires both atp and mg  these results confirm earlier reports for other abc atpases but for the first time suggest the occurrence of a fast equilibrium between atp bound monomers and atp bound dimers we further mutated two highly conserved residues of the abc signature motif s  and g   into alanine the g  a mutant is completely inactive and fails to dimerize indicating an essential role of this residue in stabilizing the productive dimeric state mutant s  a retained considerable activity and was able to dimerize thus implying that the interaction of the serine with atp is not essential for dimerization and catalysis furthermore although the e  a and g  a mutants each alone are inactive they produce an active heterodimer showing that disruption of one active site can be tolerated our data suggest that abc atpases with partially degenerated catalytic machineries as they occur in vivo can still form productive dimers to drive transport
