structural characterization of zinc deficient human superoxide dismutase and implications for als
over   mutations to copper zinc superoxide dismutase sod are implicated in the selective death of motor neurons found in   of patients with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als  despite their widespread distribution als mutations appear positioned to cause structural and misfolding defects such defects decrease sod s affinity for zinc and loss of zinc from sod is sufficient to induce apoptosis in motor neurons in vitro to examine the importance of the zinc site in the structure and pathogenesis of human sod we determined the    resolution crystal structure of a designed zinc deficient human sod in which two zinc binding ligands have been mutated to hydrogen bonding serine residues this structure revealed a   twist of the subunits which opens the sod dimer interface and represents the largest intersubunit rotational shift observed for a human sod variant furthermore the electrostatic loop and zinc binding subloop were partly disordered the catalytically important arg  was rotated away from the active site and the normally rigid intramolecular cys   cys  disulfide bridge assumed two conformations together these changes allow small molecules greater access to the catalytic copper consistent with the observed increased redox activity of zinc deficient sod moreover the dimer interface is weakened and the cys   cys  disulfide is more labile as demonstrated by the increased aggregation of zinc deficient sod in the presence of a thiol reductant however equimolar cu zn sod rapidly forms heterodimers with zinc deficient sod t     min and prevents aggregation the stabilization of zinc deficient sod as a heterodimer with cu zn sod may contribute to the dominant inheritance of als mutations these results have general implications for the importance of framework stability on normal metalloenzyme function and specific implications for the role of zinc ion in the fatal neuropathology associated with sod mutations
