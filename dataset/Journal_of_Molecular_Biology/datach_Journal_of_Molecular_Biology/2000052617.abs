sequences within pr  gag pol affecting the selective packaging of primer trnalys into hiv  edited by j karn
the selective packaging of the primer trnalys into hiv  particles is dependent upon the viral incorporation of the pr  gag pol precursor protein in order to map a trnalys binding site within this precursor we have studied the effects of mutations in pr  gag pol upon the selective incorporation of trnalys  many of these mutations were placed in a protease negative hiv  proviral dna to prevent viral protease degradation of the mutant gag pol protein c terminal deletions of protease negative gag pol that removed the entire integrase sequence and the rnase h and connection subdomains of reverse transcriptase did not inhibit the incorporation of either the truncated gag pol or the trnalys  indicating that these regions are not required for trnalys binding on the other hand larger c terminal deletions which also remove the thumb subdomain sequence did prevent trnalys packaging without inhibiting viral incorporation of the truncated gag pol indicating a possible interaction between thumb subdomain sequences and trnalys  while point mutations k  e k  q and r  e in the primer grip region of the thumb subdomain have been reported to inhibit the in vitro interaction of mature reverse transcriptase with the anticodon loop of trnalys  we find that these mutations do not inhibit trnalys packaging into the virus which supports other work indicating that the anticodon loop of trnalys is not involved in interactions with pr  gag pol during trnalys packaging
