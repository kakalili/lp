solution structure of the third tb domain from ltbp provides insight into assembly of the large latent complex that sequesters latent tgf
almost all tgf  is secreted as part of a large latent complex this complex is formed from three molecules a latent transforming growth factor  binding protein ltbp  which plays roles in targeting and activation a latency associated peptide lap  which regulates latency and the tgf  cytokine lap is the tgf  pro peptide that is cleaved intracellularly prior to secretion and tgf  binds non covalently to lap formation of the large latent complex is important for the efficient secretion of tgf   previous studies have revealed that the ltbp  lap interaction is mediated by intracellular exchange of a single disulphide bond within the third and only the third tb domain tb  with lap we have previously reported the structure of a homologous tb domain from fibrillin  however tb contains a two amino acid insertion not found in fibrillin  tb domains which is not amenable to molecular modelling in order to clarify the basis of tb domain function we have determined the solution nmr structure of tb ltbp  comparison with the fibrillin  tb domain reveals that the two residue insertion is associated with a significant increase in solvent accessibility of one of the disulphide bonds linking the second and sixth cysteine residues  site directed mutagenesis and nmr studies indicate that this is the only disulphide bond that can be removed without perturbing the tb domain fold furthermore a ring of negatively charged residues has been identified that surrounds this disulphide bond homology modelling suggests that the surface properties of tb domains from different ltbp isoforms correlate with binding activities this research provides testable hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of complex formation between ltbps and laps
