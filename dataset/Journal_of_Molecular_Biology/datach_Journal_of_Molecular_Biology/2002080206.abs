conserved amino acid residues within the amino terminal domain of clpb are essential for the chaperone activity
clpb from escherichia coli is a member of a protein disaggregating multi chaperone system that also includes dnak dnaj and grpe the sequence of clpb contains two atp binding domains that are enclosed between the amino terminal and carboxyl terminal regions the n terminal sequence region does not contain known functional sequence motifs here we performed site directed mutagenesis of four polar residues within the n terminal domain of clpb thr  ser  asp  and glu   these residues are conserved in several clpb homologs we found that the mutations t a s a d  a and e  a did not significantly affect the secondary structure and thermal stability of clpb nor did they inhibit the self association of clpb its basal atpase activity or the enhanced rate of the atp hydrolysis by clpb in the presence of poly l lysine we observed however that three mutations t a d  a and e  a reduced the casein induced activation of the clpb atpase the same three mutant clpb variants also showed low chaperone activity in the luciferase reactivation assay we found however that the four clpb mutants as well as the wild type bound similar amounts of inactivated luciferase in summary we have identified three essential amino acid residues within the n terminal region of clpb that participate in the coupling between a protein binding signal and the atp hydrolysis and also support the chaperone activity of clpb
