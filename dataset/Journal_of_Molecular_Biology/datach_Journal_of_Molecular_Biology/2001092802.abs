internalins from the human pathogen listeria monocytogenes combine three distinct folds into a contiguous internalin domain edited by t richmond
listeria monocytogenes is an opportunistic food borne human and animal pathogen host cell invasion requires the action of the internalins a inla and b inlb  which are members of a family of listerial cell surface proteins common to these proteins are three distinctive n terminal domains that have been shown to direct host cell specific invasion for inla and inlb here we present the high resolution crystal structures of these domains present in inlb and inlh and show that they constitute a single  internalin domain   in this internalin domain a central lrr region is flanked contiguously by a truncated ef hand like cap and an immunoglobulin ig like fold the extended  sheet resulting from the distinctive fusion of the lrr and the ig like folds constitutes an adaptable concave interaction surface which we propose is responsible for the specific recognition of the host cellular binding partners during infection
