the contribution of surface residues to membrane binding and ligand transfer by the  tocopherol transfer protein   ttp
previous work has shown that the  tocopherol transfer protein   ttp can bind to vesicular or immobilized phospholipid membranes revealing the molecular mechanisms by which  ttp associates with membranes is thought to be critical to understanding its function and role in the secretion of tocopherol from hepatocytes into the circulation calculations presented in the orientations of proteins in membranes database have provided a testable model for the spatial arrangement of  ttp and other cral  trio family proteins with respect to the lipid bilayer these calculations predicted that a hydrophobic surface mediates the interaction of  ttp with lipid membranes to test the validity of these predictions we used site directed mutagenesis and examined the substituted mutants with regard to intermembrane ligand transfer association with lipid layers and biological activity in cultured hepatocytes substitution of residues in helices a  f  a and f  a and a  i  a v  a and m  a decreased the rate of intermembrane ligand transfer as well as protein adsorption to phospholipid bilayers the largest impairment was observed upon mutation of residues that are predicted to be fully immersed in the lipid bilayer in both apo open and holo closed conformations such as phe  and phe   mutation f  a and especially f  d significantly impaired  ttp assisted secretion of  tocopherol outside cultured hepatocytes mutation of selected basic residues r  h k  a and k  a had little effect on transfer rates indicating no significant involvement of nonspecific electrostatic interactions with membranes
