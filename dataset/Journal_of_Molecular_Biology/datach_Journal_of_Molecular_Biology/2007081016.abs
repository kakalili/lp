peptide aptamers expressed in the secretory pathway interfere with cellular prpsc formation
prion diseases are rare and obligatory fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by the accumulation of a misfolded isoform prpsc of the host encoded prion protein prpc  prophylactic and therapeutic regimens against prion diseases are very limited to extend such strategies we selected peptide aptamers binding to prp from a combinatorial peptide library presented on the escherichia coli thioredoxin a trxa protein as a scaffold in a yeast two hybrid screen employing full length murine prp aa      as a bait we identified three peptide aptamers that reproducibly bind to prp treatment of prion infected cells with recombinantly expressed aptamers added to the culture medium abolished prpsc conversion with an ic between   and   nm for expression in eukaryotic cells peptide aptamers were fused to an n terminal signal peptide for entry of the secretory pathway the c terminus was modified by a glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol gpi anchoring signal a kdel retention motif and the transmembrane and cytosolic domain of lamp i respectively these peptide aptamers retained their binding properties to prpc and depending on peptide sequence and c terminal modification interfered with endogenous prpscconversion upon expression in prion infected cells notably infection of cell cultures could be prevented by expression of kdel peptide aptamers for the first time we show that trxa based peptide aptamers can be targeted to the secretory pathway thereby not losing the affinity for their target protein beside their inhibitory effect on prion conversion these molecules could be used as fundament for rational drug design
