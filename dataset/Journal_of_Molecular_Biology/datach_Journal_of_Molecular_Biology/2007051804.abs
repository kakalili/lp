the mrna binding site of annexin a resides in helices c  d of its domain iv
annexin a  anxa  is a ca  binding and phospholipid binding protein involved in different intracellular processes including exocytosis endocytosis and membrane cytoskeleton movements we have previously identified anxa as an mrna binding protein present in cytoskeleton bound polysomes that binds to a specific    nucleotide region in the   untranslated region of c myc and its cognate mrna in the present study we show by uv cross linking assays and surface plasmon resonance analyses that the mrna binding site of anxa resides in its domain iv furthermore the interaction of full length anxa with the   untranslated region of anxa mrna is ca  dependent by contrast the interaction is ca  independent for the isolated domain iv of anxa  suggesting that the mrna binding site is masked in apo anxa and gains exposure through a ca  induced conformational change of anxa generating a favourable mrna binding site the anxa mrna interaction is specific and involves helices c and d in domain iv of anxa  since point mutagenesis of several charged and polar exposed residues of these helices in the full length protein strongly reduce rna binding the interaction appears to be sequential involving an initial phase of recognition dominated by electrostatic interactions most likely between lysine residues and the phosphate backbone of rna followed by a second phase contributing to the specificity of the interaction
