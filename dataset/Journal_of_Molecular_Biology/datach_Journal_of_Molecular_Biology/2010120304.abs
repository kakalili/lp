probing the periplasmic open state of lactose permease in response to sugar binding and proton translocation
based on the crystal structure of lactose permease lacy open to the cytoplasm a hybrid molecular simulation approach with self guided langevin dynamics is used to describe conformational changes that lead to a periplasmic open state this hybrid approach consists of implicit im and explicit ex membrane simulations and requires self guided langevin dynamics to enhance protein motions during the im simulations the pore radius of the lumen increases by     on the periplasmic side and decreases by     on the cytoplasmic side relative to the crystal structure  suggesting a lumen that is fully open to the periplasm to allow for extracellular sugar transport and closed to the cytoplasm based on our simulations the mechanism that triggers this conformational change to the periplasmic open state is the protonation of glu  and binding of the disaccharide then helix packing is destabilized by breaking of several side chains involved in hydrogen bonding asn   ser  glu   lys  and gln   for the periplasmic open conformations obtained from our simulations helix  helix distances agree well with experimental measurements using double electron  electron resonance fluorescence resonance energy transfer and varying sized cross linkers the periplasmic open conformations are also in compliance with various substrate accessibility reactivity measurements that indicate an opening of the protein lumen on the periplasmic side on sugar binding the comparison with these measurements suggests a possible incomplete closure of the cytoplasmic half in our simulations however the closure is sufficient to prevent the disaccharide from transporting to the cytoplasm which is in accordance with the well established alternating access model ser  gln  and phe  are determined to be important in sugar transport during the periplasmic open stage of the sugar transport cycle and the sugar is found to undergo an orientational change in order to escape the protein lumen
