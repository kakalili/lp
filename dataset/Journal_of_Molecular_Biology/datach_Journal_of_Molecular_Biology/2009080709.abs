the role of decorated sds micelles in sub cmc protein denaturation and association
we have combined spectroscopy chromatography calorimetry and small angle x ray scattering saxs to provide a comprehensive structural and stoichiometric description of the sodium dodecyl sulfate sds induced denaturation of the  residue  helical bovine acyl coenzyme a binding protein acbp  denaturation is a multistep process initial weak binding of    sds molecules per protein molecule below   mm does not perturb the tertiary structure subsequent binding of    sds molecules per acbp molecule leads to the formation of sds aggregates on the protein and changes in both tertiary and secondary structures saxs data show that at this stage a decorated micelle links two acbp molecules together leaving about half of the polypeptide chain as a disordered region protruding into the solvent further titration with sds leads to the additional uptake of  sds molecules which according to saxs forms a larger decorated micelle bound to a single acbp molecule at the critical micelle concentration we conclude from reduced mobility and increased fluorescence anisotropy that each acbp molecule becomes associated with more than one micelle at this point     sds molecules are bound per acbp molecule our data provide key structural insights into decorated micelle complexes with proteins revealing a remarkable diversity in the different conformations they can stabilize the data highlight that a minimum decorated micelle size which may be a key driving force for intermolecular protein association exists this may also provide a structural basis for the known ability of submicellar surfactant concentrations to induce protein aggregation and fibrillation
