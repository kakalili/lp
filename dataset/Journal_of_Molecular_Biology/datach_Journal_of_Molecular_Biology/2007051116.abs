comparison of the pkc  and the pkc  c b domains identification of residues critical for pkc  mediated neurite induction
we showed earlier that over expression of protein kinase c pkc   induces neurite outgrowth the effect is mediated by a region pkc psc v  encompassing the pseudosubstrate the two c domains and part of the v region and is independent of the catalytic activity of the enzyme in this region residues immediately n terminal of the c b domain are crucial for neurite outgrowth however in this study we show that the pkc  c b domain itself is necessary for neurite induction since a mutant in which the pkc  c b domain has been replaced with the c b domain from pkc  pkc psc a  c b v lacks neurite inducing capacity the molecular basis for the importance of the pkc  c b domain was investigated by mutation studies of the pkc  c b domain point mutations were done in the pkc  c b domain of the pkc psc a  c b v construct in which the pkc  residues were mutated into the corresponding residues in pkc  this highlighted residues in the c terminal part of the primary sequence of the c b domain located in the base of the c b domain as important for neurite outgrowth the mutations s p d k and l n all influenced neurite induction positively furthermore the mutation of l n alone was sufficient to make pkc psc a  c b v neuritogenic in phorbol ester stimulated cells and mutation of this residue in full length pkc  into the corresponding residue in pkc  n  l reduced the neurite inducing effect of pkc  in conclusion we have identified residues in the pkc  c b domain in particular asn  that are essential for neurite outgrowth
