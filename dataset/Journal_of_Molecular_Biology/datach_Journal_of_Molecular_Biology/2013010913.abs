structural mechanism of gaf regulated   activators from aquifex aeolicus
the  subunits of bacterial rna polymerase occur in many variant forms and confer promoter specificity to the holopolymerase members of the   family of  subunits require the action of a  transcriptional activator  protein to open the promoter and initiate transcription the activator proteins undergo regulated assembly from inactive dimers to hexamers that are active atpases these contact   directly and through atp hydrolysis drive a conformational change that enables promoter opening    activators use several different kinds of regulatory domains to respond to a wide variety of intracellular signals one common regulatory module the gaf domain is used by   activators to sense small molecule ligands the structural basis for gaf domain regulation in   activators has not previously been reported here we present crystal structures of gaf regulatory domains for aquifex aeolicus   activators nifa like homolog nlh  and nlh in three functional states  an  open   atpase inactive state a  closed   atpase inactive state and a  closed   ligand bound atpase active state we also present small angle x ray scattering data for nlh linked gaf atpase domains in the inactive state these gaf domain dimers regulate   activator proteins by holding the atpase domains in an inactive dimer conformation ligand binding of nlh dramatically remodels the gaf domain dimer interface disrupting the contacts with the atpase domains this mechanism has strong parallels to the response to phosphorylation in some two component regulated   activators we describe a structural mechanism of gaf mediated enzyme regulation that appears to be conserved among humans plants and bacteria
