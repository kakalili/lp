the dh ph region of the giant protein unc  activates rho  gtpase in caenorhabditis elegans body wall muscle
mutation of the caenorhabditis elegans gene unc  results in disorganization of muscle a bands unc  encodes a giant polypeptide    kda containing a dh domain followed by a ph domain at its n terminus which is characteristic of guanine nucleotide exchange factor proteins for rho gtpases to obtain evidence that the dh ph region has activity toward specific rho family small gtpases we conducted an experiment using the yeast three hybrid system the dh ph region of unc  has exchange activity for rho  c elegans rhoa  but not for ced   c elegans rac  mig  c elegans rhog  or cdc   c elegans cdc   the dh domain alone has similar activity for rho  an in vitro binding assay demonstrates interaction between the dh ph region of unc  and each of the c elegans rho gtpases partial knockdown of rho  in c elegans adults showed a pattern of disorganization of myosin thick filaments similar to the phenotype caused by unc   su   a mutant allele in which all of the isoforms containing the dh ph region are missing taken together we propose a model in which the dh ph region of unc  activates rho  gtpase for organization of myosin filaments in c elegans muscle cells
