structural bases of stability  function tradeoffs in enzymes
the structures of enzymes reflect two tendencies that appear opposed on one hand they fold into compact stable structures on the other hand they bind a ligand and catalyze a reaction to be stable enzymes fold to maximize favorable interactions forming a tightly packed hydrophobic core exposing hydrophilic groups and optimizing intramolecular hydrogen bonding to be functional enzymes carve out an active site for ligand binding exposing hydrophobic surface area clustering like charges and providing unfulfilled hydrogen bond donors and acceptors using ampc  lactamase an enzyme that is well characterized structurally and mechanistically the relationship between enzyme stability and function was investigated by substituting key active site residues and measuring the changes in stability and activity substitutions of catalytic residues ser  lys  tyr   asn   and lys  decrease the activity of the enzyme by      fold compared to wild type concomitantly many of these substitutions increase the stability of the enzyme significantly by up to  kcal mol to determine the structural origins of stabilization the crystal structures of four mutant enzymes were determined to between    and    resolution these structures revealed several mechanisms by which stability was increased including mimicry of the substrate by the substituted residue s d  relief of steric strain s g  relief of electrostatic strain k q  and improved polar complementarity n  h  these results suggest that the preorganization of functionality characteristic of active sites has come at a considerable cost to enzyme stability in proteins of unknown function the presence of such destabilized regions may indicate the presence of a binding site
