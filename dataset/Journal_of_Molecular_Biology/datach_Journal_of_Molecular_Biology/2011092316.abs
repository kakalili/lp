structure folding and stability of fima the main structural subunit of type  pili from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains
filamentous type  pili are responsible for attachment of uropathogenic escherichia coli strains to host cells they consist of a linear tip fibrillum and a helical rod formed by up to   copies of the main structural pilus subunit fima the subunits in the pilus interact via donor strand complementation where the incomplete immunoglobulin like fold of each subunit is complemented by an n terminal donor strand of the subsequent subunit here we show that folding of fima occurs at an extremely slow rate half life    h and is catalyzed more than   fold by the pilus chaperone fimc moreover fima is capable of intramolecular self complementation via its own donor strand as evidenced by the loss of folding competence upon donor strand deletion folded fima is an assembly incompetent monomer of low thermodynamic stability      kj mol   that can be rescued for pilus assembly at    c because fimc selectively pulls the fraction of unfolded fima molecules from the fima folding equilibrium and allows fima refolding on its surface elongation of fima at the c terminus by its own donor strand generated a self complemented variant fimaa with alternative folding possibilities that spontaneously adopts the more stable conformation      kj mol   in which the c terminal donor strand is inserted in the opposite orientation relative to that in fima the solved nmr structure of fimaa revealed extensive  sheet hydrogen bonding between the fima pilin domain and the c terminal donor strand and provides the basis for reconstruction of an atomic model of the pilus rod
