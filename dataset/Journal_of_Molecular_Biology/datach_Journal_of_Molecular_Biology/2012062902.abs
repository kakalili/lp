impacts of dystrophin and utrophin domains on actin structural dynamics implications for therapeutic design
we have used time resolved phosphorescence anisotropy tpa of actin to evaluate domains of dystrophin and utrophin with implications for gene therapy in muscular dystrophy dystrophin and its homolog utrophin bind to cytoskeletal actin to form mechanical linkages that prevent muscular damage because these proteins are too large for most gene therapy vectors much effort is currently devoted to smaller constructs we previously used tpa to show that both dystrophin and utrophin have a paradoxical effect on actin rotational dynamics  restricting amplitude while increasing rate thus increasing resilience with utrophin more effective than dystrophin here we have evaluated individual domains of these proteins we found that a  mini dystrophin   lacking one of the two actin binding domains is less effective than dystrophin in regulating actin dynamics correlating with its moderate effectiveness in rescuing the dystrophic phenotype in mice in contrast we found that a  micro utrophin   with more extensive internal deletions is as effective as full length dystrophin in the regulation of actin dynamics each of utrophin s actin binding domains promotes resilience in actin while dystrophin constructs require the presence of both actin binding domains and the c terminal domain for full function this work supports the use of a utrophin template for gene or protein therapy designs resilience of the actin  protein complex measured by tpa correlates remarkably well with previous reports of functional rescue by dystrophin and utrophin constructs in mdx mice we propose the use of tpa as an in vitro method to aid in the design and testing of emerging gene therapy constructs
