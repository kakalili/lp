studies of the collagen like peptide pro pro gly  confirm that the shape and position of the type i collagen denaturation endotherm is governed by the rate of helix unfolding
the kinetics of unfolding of a collagen like peptide  pro pro gly   has been studied under isothermal conditions to gain a better understanding of the stabilization of the collagen triple helix the formation process was third order and relatively insensitive to temperature at concentrations of  mg ml and below while the unfolding process was first order and highly temperature dependent the helix  coil transition was studied over a range of scanning rates and polymer concentrations using differential scanning calorimetry and the observations were compared with solutions of an approximate differential equation governing the process at high concentrations   mg ml and very low scanning rates     c min    the helicity f approached a quasistatic state in which it reached its equilibrium value at all temperatures under these conditions the temperature at which the endotherm peaked tmax increased with chain concentration but was independent of scanning rate while df dt max was dependent on the van t hoff enthalpy and on the order of the formation process on scanning from a low to a high temperature up scanning at low concentrations       mg ml and higher scanning rates    c min   and above  the peak in df dt was taller and narrower than for slow quasistatic scanning tmax increased linearly with the logarithm of the scanning rate and was independent of concentration while df dt max was governed by the temperature dependence of the rate of unfolding at intermediate scanning rates two peaks in df dt were apparent one peak was a nascent  quasistatic peak   the other was a nascent  rate peak   comparison of this peptide data with the properties of the collagen denaturation endotherm showed that the collagen denaturation endotherm was determined only by the rate of unfolding and not by an unobserved equilibrium
