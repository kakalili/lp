domain closure mechanism in transferrins new viewpoints about the hinge structure and motion as deduced from high resolution crystal structures of ovotransferrin n lobe edited by r huber
the crystal structure of holo hen ovotransferrin n lobe refined at     resolution has been obtained the final model gave an r factor of    in the resolution range between   and     the comparison of the structure with previous high resolution apo and fe  loaded domain opened intermediate structures provides new viewpoints on the domain closure mechanism upon fe  uptake in ovotransferrin n lobe overall conformational transition follows the common mechanism that has been first demonstrated for lactoferrin n lobe the domains  and  rotate     as rigid bodies with a translation of    around a screw axis that passes through the two interdomain  strands    and      it is generally believed that the two strands display a hinge like motion here the latter strand indeed displays an ideal hinge nature the segments     and     behave as a part of the rigid body of domain  and that of domain  respectively and a sharp bend upon the domain closure is largely accounted for by the changes in the torsion angles  and  of val   we find however that the mode of the conformational change in the first  strand is much more complex two of the five inter  strand hydrogen bonds undergo crucial exchanges from ser  n  val  o and thr  o  ala  n in the open apo and intermediate structures into tyr  n  val  o and thr  o  ala  n in the closed holo structure these exchanges which may be triggered in the intermediate state by modulation in the topological relation between the fe  ligated hinge residue tyr  oh and the anion anchor residues of helix  are accompanied by a large conformational change and extensive hydrogen bonding rearrangements in a long stretch of segment of glu  to tyr  such structural transition would work as a driving force for the domain closure which highlights a  door closer  like role in addition to the canonical hinge role for the interdomain polypeptide segment pair as an alternative hinge that secures the correct domain motion by being placed on a significant distance from the  strand hinge we point out the participation of the van der waals contacts formed between domain  residue of met  and domain  residues of trp   ile  and trp
