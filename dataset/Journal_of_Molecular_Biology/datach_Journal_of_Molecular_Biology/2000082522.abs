a ribozyme derived from the catalytic subunit of rnase p from escherichia coli is highly effective in inhibiting replication of herpes simplex virus  edited by j doudna
a sequence specific ribozyme m gs rna derived from the catalytic rna subunit of rnase p from escherichia coli was used to target the mrna encoding human herpes simplex virus  hsv  major transcription activator icp  a reduction of more than   in the expression level of icp and a reduction of about   fold in viral growth were observed in cells that stably expressed the ribozyme in contrast a reduction of less than   in icp expression and viral growth was observed in cells that either did not express the ribozyme or produced a catalytically inactive ribozyme mutant thus m gs ribozyme is highly effective in inhibiting hsv  growth and can be used as a general gene targeting agent for anti hsv applications
