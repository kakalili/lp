novel helical assembly in arginine methyltransferase
protein arginine methyltransferase  prmt  is unique among prmts as it is specifically expressed in brain and localized to the plasma membrane via n terminal myristoylation here we describe the crystal structure of human prmt  hprmt  at    resolution the crystal structure of hprmt exhibited a novel helical assembly biochemical biophysical and mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that hprmt forms an octamer in solution this octameric structure is necessary for proper localization to the plasma membrane and efficient methyltransferase activity the helical assembly might be a relevant quaternary form for hprmt  which is the predominant prmt in mammalian cells and most closely related to hprmt
