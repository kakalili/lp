nanomechanics of native thick filaments from indirect flight muscles
during flight the wings of drosophila melanogaster beat nearly   times per second the indirect flight muscle fibers that power this movement have evolved to resist the repetitive mechanical stress that results from the  ms wing beat cycle at a strain amplitude of    in order to understand how this is achieved at the sarcomere level we have analyzed the mechanical properties of native thick filaments isolated from indirect flight muscle single filaments adsorbed onto a solid support were manipulated in physiological buffer using an atomic force microscope images taken after the manipulation revealed that segments were stretched on average to    with a maximum at   extension the lateral force versus displacement curve associated with each manipulation contained information about the bending and tensile properties of each filament the bending process was dominated by shearing between myosin dimers and yielded a shear modulus between  and   mpa maximum tension along the stretched filaments was observed at     extension and varied between  and   nn based on current models of thick filament structure these variations can be attributed to cross links between myosin dimers distributed along the filament
