statistical analysis of amino acid patterns in transmembrane helices the gxxxg motif occurs frequently and in association with  branched residues at neighboring positions edited by g von heijne
to find motifs that mediate helix helix interactions in membrane proteins we have analyzed frequently occurring combinations of residues in a database of transmembrane domains our analysis was performed with a novel formalism which we call tmstat for exactly calculating the expectancies of all pairs and triplets of residues in individual sequences taking into account differential sequence composition and the substantial effect of finite length in short segments we found that the number of significantly over and under represented pairs and triplets was much greater than the random expectation isoleucine glycine and valine were the most common residues in these extreme cases the main theme observed is patterns of small residues gly ala and ser at i and i   found in association with large aliphatic residues ile val and leu at neighboring positions i e i   and i    the most over represented pair is formed by two glycine residues at i and i   gxxxg     above expectation p lt        and it is strongly associated with the neighboring  branched residues ile and val in fact the gxxxg pair has been described as part of the strong interaction motif in the glycophorin a transmembrane dimer in which the pair is associated with two val residues gvxxgv  gxxxg is also the major motif identified using toxcat an in vivo selection system for transmembrane oligomerization motifs in conjunction with these experimental observations our results highlight the importance of the gxxxg   branched motif in transmembrane helix helix interactions in addition the special role for the  branched residues ile and val suggested here is consistent with the hypothesis that residues with constrained rotameric freedom in helical conformation might reduce the entropic cost of folding in transmembrane proteins additional material is available at http  engelman csb yale edu tmstat and http  bioinfo mbb yale edu tmstat
