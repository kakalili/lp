methyl substituents at the  or  position of retinal profoundly and differentially affect photochemistry and signalling activity of rhodopsin
the c  c  double bond of the retinylidene chromophore of rhodopsin holds a central position in its light induced photoisomerization and hence the photosensory function of this visual pigment to probe the local environment of the hc  c  h element we have prepared the  methyl and  methyl derivatives of  z retinal and incorporated these into opsin to generate the rhodopsin analogs  methyl and  methyl rhodopsin these analog pigments form with much slower kinetics and lower efficiency than the native pigment the initial photochemistry and the signaling activity of the analog pigments were investigated by uv vis and ftir spectroscopy and by a g protein activation assay our data indicate that the ultrafast formation of the first photointermediate is strongly perturbed by the presence of an  methyl substituent but much less by a  methyl substituent these results support the current concept of the mechanism of the primary photoisomerization event in rhodopsin an important stronghold of this concept is an out of plane movement of the c  h element which is facilitated by torsion as well as extended positive charge delocalization into the c   c  segment of the chromophore we argue that this mechanism is maintained principally with a methyl substituent at c  in addition we show that both an  methyl and a  methyl substitutent perturb the photointermediate cascade and finally yield a low activity state of the receptor the  methyl pigment retains about   of the g protein activation rate of native rhodopsin while the  methyl chromophore behaves like an inverse agonist up to at least    c trapping the protein in a perturbed meta i like conformation we conclude that the isomerization region of the chromophore and the spatial structure of the binding site are finely tuned in order to achieve a high photosensory potential with an efficient pathway to a high activity state
