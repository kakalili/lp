arpikfyve homomeric and heteromeric interactions scaffold pikfyve and sac in a complex to promote pikfyve activity and functionality
ptdins   p  with ptdins indicating phosphatidylinositol is vital in the differentiation and development of multicellular organisms because knockout of the ptdins   p synthesizing enzyme pikfyve phosphoinositide kinase for position  containing a fyve finger domain or its associated regulator arpikfyve is lethal in previous work with endogenous proteins we identified that sac  a phosphatase that turns over ptdins   p  associates with the pikfyve  arpikfyve biosynthetic complex however whether the three proteins suffice for the organization maintenance of this complex referred to as the pas pikfyve  arpikfyve  sac  complex  how they interact with one another and what the functional relevance of this ternary association would be remained unresolved using co immunoprecipitation analyses in transfected mammalian cells with increased or decreased levels of the three proteins singly or in double versus triple combinations herein we report that the triad is sufficient to form and maintain the pas complex arpikfyve is the principal organizer interacting with both sac and pikfyve whereas sac is permissive for maximal pikfyve  arpikfyve association in the pas complex we further identified that arpikfyve scaffolds the pas complex through homomeric interactions mediated via its conserved c terminal domain introduction of the c terminal peptide fragment of the arpikfyve  arpikfyve contact sites effectively disassembled the pas complex and reduced the in vitro pikfyve lipid kinase activity exploring insulin regulated glut translocation in t l adipocytes as a functional readout a process that is positively regulated by pikfyve activity and arpikfyve levels we determined that ectopic expression of the arpikfyve c terminal peptide inhibits glut surface accumulation our data indicate that the pas complex is organized to provide optimal pikfyve functionality and is maintained via arpikfyve homomeric and heteromeric interactions
