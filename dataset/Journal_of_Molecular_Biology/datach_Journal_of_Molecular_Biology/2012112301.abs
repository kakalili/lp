serine phosphorylation suppresses huntingtin amyloid accumulation by altering protein aggregation properties
aggregation of expanded polyglutamine repeat  containing fragments of the huntingtin htt protein may play a key role in huntington s disease consistent with this hypothesis two ser  to  asp mutations in the   amino  acid n terminal httnt segment abrogate both visible brain aggregates and disease symptoms in a full  length q  htt mouse model while compromising aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology in an htt fragment in vitro gu et al     serines  and  are critical determinants of full  length human mutant huntingtin induced disease pathogenesis in hd mice neuron         the httnt segment has been shown to play a critical role in facilitating nucleation of amyloid formation in htt n terminal exon fragments we show here how these ser  to  asp mutations dramatically affect aggregation kinetics and aggregate structural integrity first these negatively charged ser replacements impair the assembly of the  helical oligomers that play a critical role in htt amyloid nucleation thus providing an explanation for reduced amyloid formation rates second these sequence modifications alter aggregate morphology decrease aggregate stability and enhance the steric accessibility of the httnt segment within the aggregates together these changes make the sequence modified peptides kinetically and thermodynamically less likely to aggregate and more susceptible if they do to posttranslational modifications and degradation these effects also show how phosphorylation of a protein might achieve cellular effects via direct impacts on the protein s aggregation properties in fact preliminary studies on exon like molecules containing phosphoryl ser residues at positions  and  show that they reduce aggregation rates and generate atypical aggregate morphologies similar to the effects of the ser  to  asp mutants
