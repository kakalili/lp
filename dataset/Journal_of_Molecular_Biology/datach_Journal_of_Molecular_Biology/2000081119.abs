the crystal structure of yeast phenylalanine trna at    resolution cleavage by mg  in  year old crystals edited by j karn
we have re determined the crystal structure of yeast trnaphe to    resolution using  year old crystals the accuracy of the new structure due both to higher resolution data and formerly unavailable refinement methods consolidates the previous structural information but also reveals novel details in particular the water structure around the tightly bound mg  is now clearly resolved and hence provides more accurate information on the geometry of the magnesium binding sites and the role of water molecules in coordinating the metal ions to the trna we have assigned a total of ten magnesium ions and identified a partly conserved geometry for high affinity mg  binding in the electron density map there is also clear density for a spermine molecule binding in the major groove of the t c arm and also contacting a symmetry related trna molecule interestingly we have also found that two specific regions of the trna in the crystals are partially cleaved the sites of hydrolysis are within the d and anticodon loops in the vicinity of mg
