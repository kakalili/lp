electron tomography of swollen rigor fibers of insect flight muscle reveals a short and variably angled s domain
subfragment  s  the segment that links the two myosin heads to the thick filament backbone may serve as a swing out adapter allowing crossbridge access to actin as the elastic component of crossbridges and as part of a phosphorylation regulated on off switch for crossbridges in smooth muscle low salt expansion increases interfilament spacing from   nm to   nm of rigor insect flight muscle fibers and exposes a tethering segment of s in many crossbridges docking an actos atomic model into em tomograms of swollen rigor fibers identifies in situ for the first time the location length and angle assignable to a segment of s  correspondence analysis of      nm crossbridge repeats grouped self similar forms from which class averages could be computed the full range of the variability in angles and lengths of exposed s was displayed by using class averages for atomic fittings of acto s  while s was modeled by fitting a length of coiled coil to unaveraged individual repeats this hybrid modeling shows that the average length of s tethers along the thick filament except near the tapered ends is    nm or   of s  s total length with an angular range encompassing   axially and    azimuthally the large range of s angles indicates that some rigor bridges produce positive force that must be balanced by others producing drag force the short tethering segment clarifies constraints on the function of s in accommodating variable myosin head access to actin we suggest that the short length of s may also favor intermolecular head  head interactions in ifm relaxed thick filaments
