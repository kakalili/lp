multiple step assembly of the transmembrane cytochrome b
we have analyzed the role of individual heme ligating histidine residues for assembly of holo cytochrome b  and we show that the two hemes bl and bh bind in two subsequent steps to the apo protein binding of the low potential heme bl is a prerequisite for binding the high potential heme bh after substitution of his  which serves as an axial ligand for heme bl the apo protein did not bind heme while substitution of the heme bl ligating residue his  still allowed binding of both hemes similarly after replacement of his   one axial ligand to heme bh binding of only heme bl was observed whereas replacement of his   the other heme bh ligand resulted in binding of both hemes these data indicate sequential heme binding during formation of the holo cytochrome and the two histidine residues which serve as axial ligands to the same heme molecule heme bl or heme bh  have different importance during heme binding and cytochrome assembly furthermore determination of the heme midpoint potentials of the various cytochrome b variants indicates a cooperative adjustment of the heme midpoint potentials in cytochrome b
