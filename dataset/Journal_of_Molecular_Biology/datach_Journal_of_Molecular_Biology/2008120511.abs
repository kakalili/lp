structural basis for the substrate specificity of bone morphogenetic protein  tolloid like metalloproteases
procollagen c peptidase also known as bone morphogenetic protein  bmp   is a multidomain zinc endopeptidase of the astacin m a family bmp  is the prototype of a small group of proteases that have key roles in extracellular matrix formation and morphogenesis bmp  its splice form mtld and the related proteases tll  and tll  are considered as promising drug targets for the treatment of excessive fibrosis and muscle wasting we report here the crystal structures of the protease domains of human bmp  and the closely related tolloid like protease  tll   the crystal structures reveal an unexpected conformation of a cysteine rich loop within the active site and suggest that a flap movement is required in order to allow substrate binding on the basis of these substantial differences between the bmp  and astacin active sites a structural basis for their differing substrate specificities is proposed
