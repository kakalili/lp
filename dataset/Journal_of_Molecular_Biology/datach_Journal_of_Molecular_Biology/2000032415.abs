constructing high complexity synthetic libraries of long orfs using in vitro selection edited by p e wright
we present a method that can significantly increase the complexity of protein libraries used for in vitro or in vivo protein selection experiments protein libraries are often encoded by chemically synthesized dna in which part of the open reading frame is randomized there are however major obstacles associated with the chemical synthesis of long open reading frames especially those containing random segments insertions and deletions that occur during chemical synthesis cause frameshifts and stop codons in the random region will cause premature termination these problems can together greatly reduce the number of full length synthetic genes in the library we describe a strategy in which smaller segments of the synthetic open reading frame are selected in vitro using mrna display for the absence of frameshifts and stop codons these smaller segments are then ligated together to form combinatorial libraries of long uninterrupted open reading frames this process can increase the number of full length open reading frames in libraries by up to two orders of magnitude resulting in protein libraries with complexities of greater than    we have used this methodology to generate three types of displayed protein library a completely random sequence library a library of concatemerized oligopeptide cassettes with a propensity for forming amphipathic  helical or  strand structures and a library based on one of the most common enzymatic scaffolds the    tim barrel
