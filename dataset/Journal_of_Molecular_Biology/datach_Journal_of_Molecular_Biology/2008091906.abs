crystal structure of glutamyl queuosine trnaasp synthetase complexed with l glutamate structural elements mediating trna independent activation of glutamate and glutamylation of trnaasp anticodon
glutamyl queuosine trnaasp synthetase glu q rs from escherichia coli is a paralog of the catalytic core of glutamyl trna synthetase glurs that catalyzes glutamylation of queuosine in the wobble position of trnaasp despite important structural similarities glu q rs and glurs diverge strongly by their functional properties the only feature common to both enzymes consists in the activation of glu to form glu amp the intermediate of transfer rna trna aminoacylation however both enzymes differ by the mechanism of selection of the cognate amino acid and by the mechanism of its activation whereas glurs selects l glu and activates it only in the presence of the cognate trnaglu glu q rs forms glu amp in the absence of trna moreover while glurs transfers the activated glu to the   accepting end of the cognate trnaglu glu q rs transfers the activated glu to q  located in the anticodon loop of the noncognate trnaasp in order to gain insight into the structural elements leading to distinct mechanisms of amino acid activation we solved the three dimensional structure of glu q rs complexed to glu and compared it to the structure of the glurs glu complex comparison of the catalytic site of glu q rs with that of glurs combined with binding experiments of amino acids shows that a restricted number of residues determine distinct catalytic properties of amino acid recognition and activation by the two enzymes furthermore to explore the structural basis of the distinct aminoacylation properties of the two enzymes and to understand why glu q rs glutamylates only trnaasp among the trnas possessing queuosine in position   we performed a trna mutational analysis to search for the elements of trnaasp that determine recognition by glu q rs the analyses made on trnaasp and trnaasn show that the presence of a c in position  is crucial for glutamylation of q  the results are discussed in the context of the evolution and adaptation of the trna glutamylation system
