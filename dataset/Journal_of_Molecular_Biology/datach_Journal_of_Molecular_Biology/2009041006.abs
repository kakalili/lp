crystallographic and cellular characterisation of two mechanisms stabilising the native fold of   antitrypsin implications for disease and drug design
the common z mutant glu  lys of   antitrypsin results in the formation of polymers that are retained within hepatocytes this causes liver disease whilst the plasma deficiency of an important proteinase inhibitor predisposes to emphysema the thr  phe and gly  phe mutations border a surface cavity identified as a target for rational drug design these mutations preserve inhibitory activity but reduce the polymerisation of wild type native   antitrypsin in vitro and increase secretion in a xenopus oocyte model of disease to understand these effects we have crystallised both mutants and solved their structures the    structure of thr  phe   antitrypsin demonstrates that the effects of the mutation are mediated entirely by well defined partial cavity blockade and allows in silico screening of fragments capable of mimicking the effects of the mutation the gly  phe mutation operates differently repacking aromatic side chains in the helix f   sheet a interface to induce a half turn downward shift of the adjacent f helix we have further characterised the effects of these two mutations in combination with the z mutation in a eukaryotic cell model of disease both mutations increase the secretion of z   antitrypsin in the native conformation but the double mutants remain more polymerogenic than the wild type m protein taken together these data support different mechanisms by which the thr  phe and gly  phe mutations stabilise the native fold of   antitrypsin and increase secretion of monomeric protein in cell models of disease
