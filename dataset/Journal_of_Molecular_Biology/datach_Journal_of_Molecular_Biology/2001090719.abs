the crystal structure of thermotoga maritima maltosyltransferase and its implications for the molecular basis of the novel transfer specificity edited by r huber
maltosyltransferase mtase from the hyperthermophile thermotoga maritima represents a novel maltodextrin glycosyltransferase acting on starch and malto oligosaccharides it catalyzes the transfer of maltosyl units from    linked glucans or malto oligosaccharides to other    linked glucans malto oligosaccharides or glucose it belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family   which represents a large group of     barrel proteins sharing a similar active site structure the crystal structures of mtase and its complex with maltose have been determined at    and    resolution respectively mtase is a homodimer each subunit of which consists of four domains two of which are structurally homologous to those of other family  enzymes the catalytic core domain has the     barrel fold with the active site cleft formed at the c terminal end of the barrel substrate binding experiments have led to the location of two distinct maltose binding sites one lies in the active site cleft covering subsites   and    the other is located in a pocket adjacent to the active site cleft the structure of mtase together with the conservation of active site residues among family  glycoside hydrolases are consistent with a common double displacement catalytic mechanism for this enzyme analysis of maltose binding in the active site reveals that the transfer of dextrinyl residues longer than a maltosyl unit is prevented by termination of the active site cleft after the   subsite by the side chain of lys  and the stretch of residues      providing an explanation for the strict transfer specificity of mtase
