Expression of the UL16 glycoprotein leads to down-regulation of NKG2D-ligands from the surface of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected cell. The molecular elements responsible for UL16 trafficking and intracellular localization were investigated by preparing various chimeric proteins and mutants, using CD8 as a reporter molecule. A YQRL motif, present in UL16's cytoplasmic tail was functional for internalization, but the presence of the transmembrane domain modified the fate of the molecule after internalization. Various elements of the transmembrane domain that affected the trafficking of the protein were identified; however, their influence was modified in turn by the presence of the cytoplasmic tail of UL16. Strikingly, the extremely slow maturation rate of the native viral protein was only reproduced by the chimera that contained both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of UL16. These findings add data to a topic of increasing interest and importance: the role of the transmembrane domain of a protein in controlling its intracellular trafficking. In addition, they provide a new insight into the mechanism of action of the viral immunoevasin UL16.
