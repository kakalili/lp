crystal structure of a conger eel galectin congerin ii at    resolution implication for the accelerated evolution of a new ligand binding site following gene duplication
the crystal structure of congerin ii a galectin family lectin from conger eel was determined at    resolution the previously determined structure of its isoform congerin i had revealed a fold evolution via strand swap however the structure of congerin ii described here resembles other prototype galectins a comparison of the two congerin genes with that of several other galectins suggests acceralated evolution of both congerin genes following gene duplication the presence of a mes   n morpholino ethanesulfonic acid molecule near the carbohydrate binding site in the crystal structure points to the possibility of an additional binding site in congerin ii the binding site consists of a group of residues that had been replaced following gene duplication suggesting that the binding site was built under selective pressure congerin ii may be a protein specialized for biological defense with an affinity for target carbohydrates on parasites cell surface
