binding of rabies virus polymerase cofactor to recombinant circular nucleoprotein  rna complexes
in rabies virus the attachment of the l polymerase l to the viral nucleocapsids ncs  a nucleoprotein n  rna complex that serves as template for rna transcription and replication  is mediated by the polymerase cofactor the phosphoprotein p  p forms dimers p  that bind through their c terminal domains pctd to the c terminal region of the n recombinant circular nm  rna complexes containing  to  protomers of n hereafter the subscript m denotes the number of n protomers served here as model systems for studying the binding of p to nc like nm  rna complexes titration experiments show that there are only two equivalent and independent binding sites for p dimers on the nm  rna rings and that each p dimer binds through a single pctd a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range      nm was measured by surface plasmon resonance indicating a strong interaction between the two partners small angle x ray scattering saxs data and small angle neutron scattering data showed that binding of two pctd had almost no effect on the size and shape of the nm  rna rings whereas binding of two p significantly increased the size of the complexes saxs data and molecular modeling were used to add flexible loops nntd loop amino acids      nctd loop amino acids      missing in the recently solved crystal structure of the circular n   rna complex and to build a model for the n   rna complex structural models for the nm  rna  pctd  complexes were then built by docking the known pctd structure onto the completed structures of the circular n   rna and n   rna complexes a multiple stage flexible docking procedure was used to generate decoys and saxs and biochemical data were used for filtering the models in the refined model the pctd is bound to the c terminal top of one n protomer ni  with the c terminal helix    of pctd lying on helix   of ni by an induced fit mechanism the nctd loop of the same protomer ni and that of the adjacent one ni   mold around the pctd making extensive protein  protein contacts that could explain the strong affinity of p for its template the structural model is in agreement with available biochemical data and provides new insights on the mechanism of attachment of the polymerase complex to the nc template
