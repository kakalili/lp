crystal structure of yeast fad synthetase fad  in complex with fad
flavin adenine dinucleotide fad synthetase is an essential enzyme responsible for the synthesis of fad by adenylation of riboflavin monophosphate fmn  we have solved the     resolution structure of fad  the yeast fad synthetase in complex with the fad product in the active site the structure of fad shows it to be a member of the pp atpase superfamily important conformational differences in the two motifs involved in binding the phosphate moieties of fad compared to the candida glabrata fmnt ortholog suggests that this loop is dynamic and undergoes substantial conformational changes during its catalytic cycle
