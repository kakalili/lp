crystal structures of the staphylococcal toxin ssl in complex with sialyl lewis x reveal a conserved binding site that shares common features with viral and bacterial sialic acid binding proteins
staphylococcus aureus is a significant human pathogen among its large repertoire of secreted toxins is a group of staphylococcal superantigen like proteins ssls  these are homologous to superantigens but do not have the same activity ssl is shown here to bind to human granulocytes and to the cell surface receptors for human iga fc ri and p selectin p selectin glycoprotein ligand  psgl   in a sialic acid sia dependent manner co crystallization of ssl with the tetrasaccharide sialyl lewis x slex  a key determinant of psgl  binding to p selectin led to crystal structures of the ssl  slex complex at resolutions of   and     for crystals at two ph values in both structures slex bound to a specific site on the surface of the c terminal domain of ssl in a conformation identical with that bound by p selectin conservation of the key carbohydrate binding residues indicates that this ability to bind human glycans is shared by a substantial subgroup of the ssls including ssl  ssl  ssl  ssl  ssl  and ssl  this indicates that the ability to target human glycans is an important property of this group of toxins structural comparisons also showed that the sia binding site in ssl contains a substructure that is shared by other sia binding proteins from bacteria as well as viruses and represents a common binding motif
