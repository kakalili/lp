nonspecific dna binding and bending by hu   interfaces of the three binding modes characterized by salt dependent thermodynamics
previous isothermal titration calorimetry itc and f rster resonance energy transfer studies demonstrated that escherichia coli hu   binds nonspecifically to duplex dna in three different binding modes a tighter binding  bp mode that interacts with dna in large  gt   bp gaps between bound proteins reversibly bending it by  o and thereby increasing its flexibility and two weaker modestly cooperative small site size modes   bp and  bp that are useful for filling gaps between bound proteins shorter than   bp here we use itc to determine the thermodynamics of these binding modes as a function of salt concentration and we deduce that dna in the  bp mode is bent around  but not wrapped on  the body of hu in contrast to specific binding of integration host factor analyses of binding isotherms  bp   bp and  bp dna and initial binding heats   bp   bp and   bp dna reveal that all three modes have similar log  log salt concentration derivatives of the binding constants ski even though their binding site sizes differ greatly the most probable values of ski on  bp dna or larger dna are       from the similarity of ski values we conclude that the binding interfaces of all three modes involve the same region of the arms and saddle of hu all modes are entropy driven as expected for nonspecific binding driven by the polyelectrolyte effect the bent dna  bp mode is most endothermic presumably because of the cost of hu induced dna bending while the  bp mode is modestly exothermic at all salt concentrations examined structural models consistent with the observed ski values are proposed
