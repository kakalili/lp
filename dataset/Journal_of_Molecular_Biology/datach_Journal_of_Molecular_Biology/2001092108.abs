mean dna bend angle and distribution of dna bend angles in the cap dna complex in solution
in order to define the mean dna bend angle and distribution of dna bend angles in the catabolite activator protein cap dna complex in solution under standard transcription initiation conditions we have performed nanosecond time resolved fluorescence measurements quantifying energy transfer between a probe incorporated at a specific site in cap and a complementary probe incorporated at each of five specific sites in dna the results indicate that the mean dna bend angle is       consistent with the mean dna bend angle observed in crystallographic structures        lifetime distribution analysis indicates that the distribution of dna bend angles is relatively narrow with lt   of dna bend angles exceeding    millisecond time resolved luminescence measurements using lanthanide chelate probes provide independent evidence that the upper limit of the distribution of dna bend angles is      the methods used here will permit mutational analysis of cap induced dna bending and the role of cap induced dna bending in transcriptional activation
