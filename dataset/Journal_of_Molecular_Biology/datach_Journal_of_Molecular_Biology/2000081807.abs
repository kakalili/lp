automatic protein design with all atom force fields by exact and heuristic optimization edited by j thorton
a fully automatic procedure for predicting the amino acid sequences compatible with a given target structure is described it is based on the charmm package and uses an all atom force field and rotamer libraries to describe and evaluate side chain types and conformations sequences are ranked by a quantity akin to the free energy of folding which incorporates hydration effects exact branch and bound and heuristic optimisation procedures are used to identifying highly scoring sequences from an astronomical number of possibilities these sequences include the minimum free energy sequence as well as all amino acid sequences whose free energy lies within a specified window from the minimum several applications of our procedure are illustrated prediction of side chain conformations for a set of ten proteins yields results comparable to those of established side chain placement programs applications to sequence optimisation comprise the re design of the protein cores of c crk sh domain the b domain of protein g and ubiquitin and of surface residues of the sh domain in all calculations no restrictions are imposed on the amino acid composition and identical parameter settings are used for core and surface residues the best scoring sequences for the protein cores are virtually identical to wild type they feature no more than one to three mutations in a total of     variable positions tests suggest that this is due to the balance between various contributions in the force field rather than to overwhelming influence from packing constraints the effectiveness of our force field is further supported by the sequence predictions for surface residues of the sh domain more mutations are predicted than in the core seemingly in order to optimise the network of complementary interactions between polar and charged groups this appears to be an important energetic requirement in absence of the partner molecules with which the sh domain interacts which were not included in the calculations finally a detailed comparison between the sequences generated by the heuristic and exact optimisation algorithms commends a note of caution concerning the efficiency of heuristic procedures in exploring sequence space
