hoxc is transcriptionally regulated via coordination of mll histone methylase and estrogen receptor in an estrogen environment
homeobox hox containing gene hoxc is a critical player in mammary gland development and milk production and is overexpressed in breast and prostate cancers we demonstrated that hoxc is transcriptionally regulated by estrogen e  hoxc promoter contains two putative estrogen response elements eres  termed as ere   and ere   promoter analysis using luciferase based reporter assay demonstrated that both eres are responsive to e  with ere   being more responsive than ere   estrogen receptors ers er  and er  bind to these eres in an e dependent manner and antisense mediated knockdown of ers suppressed the e dependent activation of hoxc expression similarly knockdown of histone methylases mll and mll decreased the e mediated activation of hoxc  however depletion of mll or mll showed no significant effect mll and mll were bound to the hoxc eres in an e dependent manner in contrast mll and mll that were bound to the hoxc promoter in the absence of e decreased upon exposure to e  mll and mll play key roles in histone h lysine  trimethylation and in the recruitment of general transcription factors and rna polymerase ii in the hoxc promoter during e dependent transactivation nuclear receptor corepressors n cor and safb were bound in the hoxc promoter in the absence of e  and that binding was decreased upon e treatment indicating their critical roles in suppressing hoxc gene expression under nonactivated conditions knockdown of either er  or er  abolished e dependent recruitment of mll and mll into the hoxc promoter demonstrating key roles of ers in the recruitment of these mixed lineage leukemias into the hoxc promoter overall our studies demonstrated that hoxc is an e responsive gene and that histone methylases mll and mll  in coordination with er  and er  transcriptionally regulate hoxc in an e dependent manner
