structural basis for activation of calcineurin by calmodulin
the highly conserved phosphatase calcineurin can plays vital roles in numerous processes including t cell activation development and function of the central nervous system and cardiac growth it is activated by the calcium sensor calmodulin cam  cam binds to a regulatory domain rd within can causing a conformational change that displaces an autoinhibitory domain aid from the active site resulting in activation of the phosphatase this is the same general mechanism by which cam activates cam dependent protein kinases previously published data have hinted that the rd of can is intrinsically disordered in this work we demonstrate that the rd is unstructured and that it folds upon binding cam ousting the aid from the catalytic site the rd is  residues long with the aid attached to its c terminal end and the  residue cam binding region toward the n terminal end this is unlike the cam dependent protein kinases that have cam binding sites and aids immediately adjacent in sequence our data demonstrate that not only does the cam binding region folds but also an    to  residue region between it and the aid folds resulting in over half of the rd adopting  helical structure this appears to be the first observation of cam inducing folding of this scale outside of its binding site on a target protein
