protein dynamics in a family of laboratory evolved thermophilic enzymes
molecular dynamics simulations were employed to study how protein solution structure and dynamics are affected by adaptation to high temperature simulations were carried out on a para nitrobenzyl esterase   residues and two thermostable variants that were generated by laboratory evolution although these variants display much higher melting temperatures than wild type up to   c higher they are both gt   identical in sequence to the wild type in simulations at  k the thermostable variants remain closer to their crystal structures than wild type however they also display increased fluctuations about their time averaged structures additionally both variants show a small but significant increase in radius of gyration relative to wild type the vibrational density of states was calculated for each of the esterases while the density of states profiles are similar overall both thermostable mutants show increased populations of the very lowest frequency modes  lt  cm    with the more stable mutant showing the larger increase this indicates that the thermally stable variants experience increased concerted motions relative to wild type taken together these data suggest that adaptation for high temperature stability has resulted in a restriction of large deviations from the native state and a corresponding increase in smaller scale fluctuations about the native state these fluctuations contribute to entropy and hence to the stability of the native state the largest changes in localized dynamics occur in surface loops while other regions particularly the active site residues remain essentially unchanged several mutations most notably l  f and h  y in variant g  are in the region showing the largest increase in fluctuations suggesting that these mutations confer more flexibility to the loops as a validation of our simulations the fluctuations of trp  were examined in detail and compared with trp  phosphorescence lifetimes that were previously measured consistent with expectations from the theory of phosphorescence an inverse correlation between out of plane fluctuations on the picosecond time scale and phosphorescence lifetime was observed
