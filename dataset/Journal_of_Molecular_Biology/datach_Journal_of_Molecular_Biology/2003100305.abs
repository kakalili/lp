the escherichia coli outer membrane cobalamin transporter btub structural analysis of calcium and substrate binding and identification of orthologous transporters by sequence structure conservation
gram negative bacteria possess specialized active transport systems that function to transport organometallic cofactors or carriers such as cobalamins siderophores and porphyrins across their outer membranes the primary components of each transport system are an outer membrane transporter and the energy coupling protein tonb in escherichiacoli the tonb dependent outer membrane transporter btub carries out active transport of cobalamin cbl substrates across its outer membrane cobalamins bind to btub with nanomolar affinity previous studies implicated calcium in high affinity binding of cyanocobalamin cn cbl to btub we previously solved four structures of btub or btub complexes an apo structure of a methionine substitution mutant used to obtain experimental phases by selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous diffraction studies  an apo structure of wild type btub a binary complex of calcium and wild type btub and a ternary complex of calcium cn cbl and wild type btub we present an analysis of the binding of calcium in the binary and ternary complexes and show that calcium coordination changes upon substrate binding high affinity cn cbl binding and calcium coordination are coupled we also analyze the binding mode of cn cbl to btub and compare and contrast this binding to that observed in other proteins that bind cbl btub binds cn cbl in a manner very different from cbl utilizing enzymes and the periplasmic cbl binding protein btuf homology searches of bacterial genomes structural annotation based on the presence of conserved cbl binding residues identified by analysis of our btub structure and detection of homologs of the periplasmic cbl binding binding protein btuf enable identification of putative btub orthologs in enteric and non enteric bacterial species
