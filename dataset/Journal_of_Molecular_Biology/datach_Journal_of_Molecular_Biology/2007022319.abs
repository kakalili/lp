dimeric core structure of modular stator subunit e of archaeal h atpase
archaeal h atpase a atpase is composed of an a region that hydrolyzes atp and an integral membrane part ao that conducts protons subunit e is a component of peripheral stator s that physically links a and ao parts of the a atpase here we report the first crystal structure of subunit e of a atpase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot at     resolution the protomer structure of subunit e represents a novel fold the quaternary structure of subunit e is a homodimer which may constitute the core part of the stator to investigate the relationship with other stator subunit h the complex of subunits eh was prepared and characterized using electrophoresis mass spectrometry n terminal sequencing and circular dichroism spectroscopy which revealed the polymeric and highly helical nature of the eh complex with equimolar stoichiometry of both the subunits on the basis of the modular architecture of stator subunits it is suggested that both cytoplasm and membrane sides of the eh complex may interact with other subunits to link a and ao parts
