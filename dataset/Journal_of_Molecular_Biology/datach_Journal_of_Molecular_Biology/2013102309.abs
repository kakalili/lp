trna binding positioning and modification by the pseudouridine synthase pus
pus  is the most recently identified pseudouridine synthase found in archaea and higher eukaryotes it modifies uridine  in the t c arm of trnas here we report the first quantitative biochemical analysis of trna binding and pseudouridine formation by pyrococcus furiosus pus  the affinity of pus  for both substrate and product trna is high kd of  nm  and product formation occurs with a km of  nm and a kcat of  s   site directed mutagenesis was used to demonstrate that the thumb loop in the catalytic domain is important for efficient catalysis we propose that the thumb loop positions the trna within the active site furthermore a new catalytic arginine residue was identified arginine    which is likely responsible for triggering flipping of the target uridine into the active site of pus  lastly our data support the proposal that the thump containing domain found in the n terminus of pus  contributes to binding of trna together our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that trna binding by pus  occurs through an induced fit mechanism which is a prerequisite for efficient pseudouridine formation
