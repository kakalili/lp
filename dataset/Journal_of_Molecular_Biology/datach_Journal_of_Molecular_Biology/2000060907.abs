dimethylsulfoxide reductase an enzyme capable of catalysis with either molybdenum or tungsten at the active site edited by p e wright
dmso reductase dmsor from rhodobacter capsulatus well characterised as a molybdoenzyme will bind tungsten protein crystallography has shown that tungsten in w dmsor is ligated by the dithiolene group of the two pyranopterins the oxygen atom of ser  plus another oxygen atom and is located in a very similar site to that of molybdenum in mo dmsor these conclusions are consistent with w liii edge x ray absorption epr and uv visible spectroscopic data w dmsor is significantly more active than mo dmsor in catalysing the reduction of dmso but in contrast to the latter shows no significant ability to catalyse the oxidation of dms
