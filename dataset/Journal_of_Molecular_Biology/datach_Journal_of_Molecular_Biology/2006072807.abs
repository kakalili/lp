variations in the unstructured c terminal tail of interferons contribute to differential receptor binding and biological activity
type i interferons ifns elicit antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties in cells all of them bind to the same receptor proteins ifnar and ifnar  with different affinities while the  known ifn s are highly conserved the c terminal unstructured tail was found to have large variation in its net charge from neutral to   this led us to speculate that the tail may have a role in modulation of the ifn biological activity through fine tuning the binding to ifnar  to evaluate this hypothesis we replaced the tail of ifn  with that of ifn  and ifn  tails or deleted the last five residues of this segment mutations to the more positively charged tail of ifn  resulted in a  fold higher affinity to ifnar  which results in a higher antiviral and antiproliferative activity double and multiple mutant cycle analysis placed the tail near a negatively charged loop on ifnar  comprising of residues glu      deleting the tail resulted in only twofold reduction in binding compared to the wild type next we modeled the location of the tail using a two step procedure first we generated   models of the tail docked on ifnar using haddock second the models were scored according to the fit between experimentally determined rates of association of nine mutant complexes and their calculated rates using the pare software from the results we suggest that the unstructured tail of ifn  is gaining a specific structure in the bound state binding to a groove below the      loop in ifnar
