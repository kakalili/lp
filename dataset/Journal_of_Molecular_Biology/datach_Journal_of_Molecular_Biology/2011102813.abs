conserved glycine residues in the p loop of atp synthases form a doorframe for nucleotide entrance
the phosphate binding loop gxxxxgkt s  is conserved in several mononucleotide binding proteins with similar three dimensional structures although variations in other amino acids have been noted the first glycine and glycine  lysine residues are highly conserved in all enzymes whose role is yet to be understood alanine substitutions for critically positioned glycines  g   g   and g   were generated for the catalytic a subunit of a atp synthase from pyrococcus horikoshii ot  and their crystal structures were determined they showed altered conformation for the phosphate binding loop with g  a and g  a becoming flat and with g  a taking an intermediate conformation resulting in the active site region being closed to nucleotide entry furthermore the essential amino acids s  and k   which normally interact with the nucleotide become inaccessible these mutant structures demonstrate the role of the strictly conserved glycine residues in guarding the active site region for nucleotide entrance in archaea type atp synthases
