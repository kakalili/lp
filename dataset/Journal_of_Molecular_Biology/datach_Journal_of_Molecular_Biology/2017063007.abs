the histone variant h  in transcriptional regulation and human disease
histone proteins wrap around dna to form nucleosomes which further compact into the higher order structure of chromatin in addition to the canonical histones there are also variant histones that often have pivotal roles in regulating chromatin dynamics and in the accessibility of the underlying dna h  is the most common non centromeric variant of histone h that differs from the canonical h by just    aa here we discuss the current knowledge of h  in transcriptional regulation and the recent discoveries and molecular mechanisms of h  mutations in human cancer
