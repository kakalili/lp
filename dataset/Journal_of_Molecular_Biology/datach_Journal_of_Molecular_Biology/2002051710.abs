the structural basis of riboflavin binding to schizosaccharomyces pombe   dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase
riboflavin is an essential cofactor in all organisms its direct biosynthetic precursor   dimethyl  ribityllumazine is synthesised by the enzyme   dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase recently we have found that the enzyme from schizosaccharomyces pombe binds riboflavin the final product of the pathway with a relatively high affinity with a kd of   m here we report on the crystal structure of lumazine synthase from s pombe with bound riboflavin and compare the binding mode with those of the substrate analogue inhibitor  nitro  d ribitylamino    h h pyrimidinedione and of the product analogue  carboxyethyl  oxo  ribityllumazine in all complexes the pyrimidinedione moieties of each respective ligand bind in a very similar orientation binding of riboflavin additionally involves a stacking interaction of the dimethylbenzene moiety with the side chain of his  a highly conserved residue in all lumazine synthases the enzyme from bacillus subtilis showed a kd of at least mm whereas the very homologous enzyme from saccharomyces cerevisiae had a comparable kd of   m structural comparison of the s cerevisiae the s pombe and the mutant enzymes suggests that fine tuning of affinity is achieved by influencing this stacking interaction
