msh mlh complexes formed at a dna mismatch are disrupted by the pcna sliding clamp edited by m gottesman
in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae mismatch repair mmr is initiated by the binding of heterodimeric muts homolog msh complexes to mismatches that include single nucleotide and loop insertion deletion mispairs in in vitro experiments the mismatch binding specificity of the msh msh heterodimer is eliminated if atp is present however addition of the mutl homolog complex mlh pms to binding reactions containing msh msh  atp and mismatched substrate results in the formation of a stable ternary complex the stability of this complex suggests that it represents an intermediate in mmr that is subsequently acted upon by other mmr factors in support of this idea we found that the replication processivity factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna  which plays a critical role in mmr at step s prior to dna resynthesis disrupted preformed ternary complexes these observations in conjunction with experiments performed with streptavidin end blocked mismatch substrates suggested that pcna interacts with an msh mlh complex formed on dna mispairs
