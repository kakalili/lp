dna binding of a non sequence specific hmg d protein is entropy driven with a substantial non electrostatic contribution
the thermal properties of two forms of the drosophila melanogaster hmg d protein with and without its highly basic  residue c terminal tail d  and d  and the thermodynamics of their non sequence specific interaction with linear dna duplexes were studied using scanning and titration microcalorimetry spectropolarimetry fluorescence anisotropy and fret techniques at different temperatures and salt concentrations it was shown that the c terminal tail of d  is unfolded at all temperatures whilst the state of the globular part depends on temperature in a rather complex way being completely folded only at temperatures close to   c and unfolding with significant heat absorption at temperatures below those of the gross denaturational changes the association constant and thus gibbs energy of binding for d  is much greater than for d  but the enthalpies of their association are similar and are large and positive i e dna binding is a completely entropy driven process the positive entropy of association is due to release of counterions and dehydration upon forming the protein dna complex ionic strength variation showed that electrostatic interactions play an important but not exclusive role in the dna binding of the globular part of this non sequence specific protein whilst binding of the positively charged c terminal tail of d  is almost completely electrostatic in origin this interaction with the negative charges of the dna phosphate groups significantly enhances the dna bending an important feature of the non sequence specific association of these hmg boxes with dna is that the binding enthalpy is significantly more positive than for the sequence specific association of the hmg box from sox  despite the fact that these proteins bend the dna duplex to a similar extent this difference shows that the enthalpy of dehydration of apolar groups at the hmg d dna interface is not fully compensated by the energy of van der waals interactions between these groups i e the packing density at the interface must be lower than for the sequence specific sox  hmg box
