analysis at the experimental limits mechanism of  hairpin formation
the  residue formin binding protein fbp  is a canonical three stranded  sheet ww domain because of its small size it is so insensitive to chemical denaturation that it is barely possible to determine accurately a denaturation curve as the transition spans    m guanidinium hydrochloride gdmcl  it is also only marginally stable with a free energy of denaturation of just   kcal mol at    c so only small changes in energy upon mutation can be tolerated but these properties and relaxation times for folding of    s     s conspire to allow the rapid acquisition of accurate and reproducible kinetic data for  analysis using classical temperature jump methods the transition state for folding is highly polarized with some regions having  values of  and others  as readily seen in chevron plots with  values of  having the refolding arms overlaying and those of  the unfolding arms superimposable good agreement is seen with transition state structures identified from independent molecular dynamics md simulations at     and    c which allows us to explore further the details of the folding and unfolding pathway of fbp  the first  turn is near native like in the transition state for folding experimental and unfolding md and experiment  the simulations show that there are transient contacts between the aromatic side chains of the  strands in the denatured state and that these interactions provide the driving force for folding of the first  hairpin of this three stranded sheet only after the backbone hydrogen bonds are formed between   and   does a hydrogen bond form to stabilize the intervening turn or the first  turn
