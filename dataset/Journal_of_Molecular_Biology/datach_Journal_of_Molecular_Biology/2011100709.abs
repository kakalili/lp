molecular insights into the control of transcription initiation at the staphylococcus aureus agr operon
the accessory gene regulatory agr operon of the opportunistic human pathogen staphylococcus aureus is a prime pathogenesis factor in this bacterium the agr operon consists of two transcription units rnaii and rnaiii which are transcribed from divergent promoters p and p  respectively rnaii encodes a quorum sensing system including agra the master transcription activator of the agr operon rnaiii is the effector rna molecule that regulates the expression of many virulence genes owing to the atypical spacer lengths of p and p  it is widely considered that transcription from p and p only occurs in a strictly agra dependent manner here using a fully native s aureus in vitro transcription system we provide the first molecular and mechanistic characterisation of the regulation of transcription initiation at the agr operon surprisingly the results demonstrate that rna polymerase rnap can interact with p and p equally well in the absence of agra however formation of a transcription competent open promoter complex rpo occurs more readily at p than at p when agra is absent reducing the atypical p spacer region length to the optimal length of  nucleotides significantly improves promoter activity by facilitating the isomerisation of the initial rnap  p complexes to rpo and the extended    like element of p is required for optimal promoter activity agra increases the occupancy of both promoters by rnap and thereby increases the amount of transcription initiated at p and p  however the agra mediated effect on transcription initiation is more prominent at p that at p  the effect of agra at p and p appears to be restricted to events leading to the formation of rpo the relevance of agra independent and agra dependent transcription initiation at p and p is presented in the context of our current understanding of the role of the agr operon in the pathobiology of s aureus
