conserved c terminal charge exerts a profound influence on the aggregation rate of  synuclein
synuclein   syn is the major component of filamentous lewy bodies found in the brains of patients diagnosed with parkinson s disease pd  recent studies demonstrate that in addition to the wild type sequence   syn is found in several modified forms including truncated and phosphorylated species although the mechanism by which the neuronal loss in pd occurs is unknown aggregation and fibril formation of  syn are considered to be key pathological features in this study we analyze the rates of fibril formation and the monomer  fibril equilibrium for eight disease associated truncated and phosphorylated  syn variants comparison of the relative rates of aggregation reveals a strong monotonic relationship between the c terminal charge of  syn and the lag time prior to the observation of fibril formation with truncated species exhibiting the fastest aggregation rates moreover we find that a decrease in c terminal charge shifts the equilibrium to favor the fibrillar species an analysis of these findings in the context of linear growth theories suggests that the loss of the charge mediated stabilization of the soluble state is responsible for the enhanced aggregation rate and increased extent of fibril fraction therefore c terminal charge is kinetically and thermodynamically protective against  syn polymerization and may provide a target for the treatment of pd
