structural plasticity of the flp  holliday junction complex
the flp recombinase a member of the lambda integrase or tyrosine based family of site specific recombinases is an interesting example of an enzyme whose catalytic activity is regulated by protein  protein contacts it exhibits half of the sites activity throughout its catalytic cycle flp is unique among these recombinases in that it assembles each active site in trans through the interaction of two protein monomers within the catalytic tetramer with isomerization of interacting pairs being essential to complete a full reaction we report here the structure of a dna bound tetramer of flpe a variant of flp that is more active at   c than the wild type recombinase this new structure includes the first observation of a tyrosine recombinase with an invading   oh poised to attack the covalent phosphotyrosine residue comparison with the previously determined flp structure highlights differences in flexibility between the two types of protein  protein interfaces in the tetramer and better defines the range of conformations available to this remarkably flexible complex these results suggest a steric occlusion model for enforcement of half of the sites activity
