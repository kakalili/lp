detailed architecture of a dna translocating machine the high resolution structure of the bacteriophage   connector particle edited by r huber
the three dimensional crystal structure of the bacteriophage   connector has been solved and refined to    resolution this   kda oligomeric protein connects the head of the phage to its tail and translocates the dna into the prohead during packaging each monomer has an elongated shape and is composed of a central mainly  helical domain that includes a three helix bundle a distal    domain and a proximal six stranded sh like domain the protomers assemble into a  mer propeller like super structure with a    wide central channel the surface of the channel is mainly electronegative but it includes two lysine rings    apart on the external surface of the particle a hydrophobic belt extends to the concave area below the sh like domain which forms a crown that retains the particle in the head the lipophilic belt contacts the non matching symmetry vertex of the capsid and forms a bearing for the connector rotation the structure suggests a translocation mechanism in which the longitudinal displacement of the dna along its axis is coupled to connector spinning
