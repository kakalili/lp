functional analysis of the hsp  associated human peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases fkbp  fkbp  and cyp  edited by r huber
large peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases ppiases are important components of the hsp  chaperone complex in mammalian cells either cyp  fkbp  or fkbp  is incorporated into these complexes it has been suggested that members of this protein family exhibit both prolyl isomerase and chaperone activity here we define the structural and functional properties of the three mammalian large ppiases we find that in all cases two ppiase monomers bind to an hsp  dimer however the affinities of the ppiases are different with fkbp  exhibiting the strongest interaction and cyp  the weakest furthermore in the mammalian system in contrast to the yeast system the catalytic activity of prolyl isomerization corresponds well to that of the respective small ppiases interestingly cyp  and fkbp  are the more potent chaperones thus it seems that both the affinity for hsp  and the differences in their chaperone properties which may reflect their interaction with the non native protein in the hsp  complex are critical for the selective incorporation of a specific large ppiase
