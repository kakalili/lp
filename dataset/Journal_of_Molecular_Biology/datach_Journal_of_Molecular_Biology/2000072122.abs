major groove recognition by three stranded  sheets affinity determinants and conserved structural features
we present the results of a rational mutagenesis and binding affinity study of the three stranded  sheet dna interface in the complex formed by the amino terminal dna binding domain of the tn  integrase protein and its cognate binding site the relative importance of interfacial contacts present in its nmr derived solution structure have been tested through mutagenesis fluorescence anisotropy and intrinsic quenching dna binding assays we find that seven protein dna hydrogen bonds two base specific and five to phosphate groups significantly contribute to the level of affinity these interactions span the entire dna binding surface on the protein but primarily originate from residues in only two strands of the sheet and loop l  interestingly we show that highly populated precisely defined intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the ensemble of conformers are invariably important for dna binding implying that nmr derived solution structures provide direct insight into the energetics of recognition unusual three stranded  sheet dna interfaces have recently been discovered in three unrelated protein dna complexes a comparative analysis of these structures reveals similar sheet positioning the presence of two invariant interfacial contacts to the phosphodiester backbone and two semi conserved base specific hydrogen bonds two of these conserved contacts significantly contribute to the affinity of the integrase dna complex suggesting that the three stranded  sheet dna binding motif exhibits conserved principles of recognition
