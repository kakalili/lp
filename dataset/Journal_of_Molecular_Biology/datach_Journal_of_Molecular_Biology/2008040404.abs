miscoding properties of   deoxyinosine a nitric oxide derived dna adduct during translesion synthesis catalyzed by human dna polymerases
chronic inflammation involving constant generation of nitric oxide no by macrophages has been recognized as a factor related to carcinogenesis at the site of inflammation nitrosatively deaminated dna adducts such as   deoxyinosine di and   deoxyxanthosine are primarily formed by no and may be associated with the development of cancer in this study we explored the miscoding properties of the di lesion generated by y family dna polymerases pols using a new fluorescent method for analyzing translesion synthesis an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a single di lesion was used as a template in primer extension reaction catalyzed by human dna pols to explore the miscoding potential of the di adduct primer extension reaction catalyzed by pol  was slightly retarded prior to the di adduct site most of the primers were extended past the lesion pol  and pol   c a truncated form of pol   readily bypassed the di lesion the fully extended products were analyzed by using two phased page to quantify the miscoding frequency and specificity occurring at the lesion site all pols that is pol   pol   and pol   c promoted preferential incorporation of   deoxycytidine monophosphate dcmp  the wrong base opposite the di lesion surprisingly no incorporation of   deoxythymidine monophosphate the correct base was observed opposite the lesion steady state kinetic studies with pol   pol   and pol   c indicated that dcmp was preferentially incorporated opposite the di lesion these pols bypassed the lesion by incorporating dcmp opposite the lesion and extended past the lesion these relative bypass frequencies past the dc di pair were at least  orders of magnitude higher than those for the dt di pair thus the di adduct is a highly miscoding lesion capable of generating a  g transition this no induced adduct may play an important role in initiating inflammation driven carcinogenesis
