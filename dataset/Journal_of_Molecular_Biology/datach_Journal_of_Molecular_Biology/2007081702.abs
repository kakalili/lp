crystal structure of the bovine lactadherin c domain a membrane binding motif shows similarity to the c domains of factor v and factor viii
lactadherin a glycoprotein secreted by a variety of cell types contains two egf domains and two c domains with sequence homology to the c domains of blood coagulation proteins factor v and factor viii like these proteins lactadherin binds to phosphatidylserine ps containing membranes with high affinity we determined the crystal structure of the bovine lactadherin c domain residues  to   at     the lactadherin c structure is similar to the c domains of factors v and viii rmsd of c  atoms of     and     and sequence identities of   and   respectively  the lactadherin c domain has a discoidin like fold containing two  sheets of five and three antiparallel  strands packed against one another the n and c termini are linked by a disulfide bridge between cys and cys   one  turn and two loops containing solvent exposed hydrophobic residues extend from the c domain  sandwich core in analogy with the c domains of factors v and viii some or all of these solvent exposed hydrophobic residues trp  leu  phe  and phe  likely participate in membrane binding the c domain of lactadherin may serve as a marker of cell surface phosphatidylserine exposure and may have potential as a unique anti thrombotic agent
