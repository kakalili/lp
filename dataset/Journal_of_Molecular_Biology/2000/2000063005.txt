The DNA in the core of spores of Bacillus species is saturated with a group of small, acid-soluble proteins (SASP) that protect DNA from a variety of harsh treatments and play a major role in spore resistance and long-term spore survival. During spore germination, SASPs are rapidly degraded to amino acids and this degradation is initiated by a sequence-specific protease called germination protease (GPR), which exhibits no obvious mechanistic or amino acid sequence similarity to any known class of proteases. GPR is synthesized during sporulation as an inactive tetrameric zymogen termed P46, which later autoprocesses to a smaller form termed P41, which is active only during spore germination. Here, we report the crystal structure of P46 from Bacillus megaterium at 3.0 Å resolution and the fact that P46 monomer adopts a novel fold. The asymmetric unit contains two P46 monomers and the functional tetramer is a dimer of dimers, with an ∼9 Å channel in the center of the tetramer. Analysis of the P46 structure and site-directed mutagenesis studies have provided some insight into the mechanism of zymogen activation as well as the zymogen’s lack of activity and the inactivity of P41 in the mature spore.
