destabilization of the hiv  complementary sequence of tar by the nucleocapsid protein through activation of conformational fluctuations
the nucleocapsid protein ncp of hiv  possesses nucleic acid chaperone properties that are critical for the two obligatory strand transfer reactions required for the synthesis of a complete proviral dna by reverse transcriptase the first dna strand transfer relies on the destabilization by ncp of double stranded segments of the transactivation response region tar sequence at the   end of the genomic rna and the complementary sequence ctar at the   terminus of minus strong stop dna the early product of reverse transcription in order to determine the dynamics of ncp mediated nucleic acid destabilization we investigated by time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and two photon fluorescence correlation spectroscopy the interaction of a doubly labeled ctar sequence with nc     containing ncp cchc zinc fingers and flanking basic amino acid residues from the chemical rates and the activation energy associated with the conformational fluctuations observed in the absence of nc it is concluded that such fluctuations are associated with the opening and closing of the double stranded terminal segments of ctar the destabilizing activity of nc     occurs mainly through a major increase of the opening rate constant of ctar moreover nc appears to augment the number of pathways between the open and closed states of ctar suggesting that it initiates melting of base pairs at different locations within the terminal segments of ctar this activity of nc on the dynamics of ctar secondary structure is thought to be critical for the formation of the ctar  tar complex which is essential for the specificity and extent of proviral dna synthesis by reverse transcriptase
