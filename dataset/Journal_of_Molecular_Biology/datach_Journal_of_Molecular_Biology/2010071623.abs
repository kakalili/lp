discoidin i from dictyostelium discoideum and interactions with oligosaccharides specificity affinity crystal structures and comparison with discoidin ii
discoidin i disci and discoidin ii discii are n acetylgalactosamine galnac binding proteins from dictyostelium discoideum they consist of two domains an n terminal discoidin domain and a c terminal h type lectin domain they were cloned and expressed in high yield in recombinant form in escherichia coli although both lectins bind galactose gal and galnac glycan array experiments performed on the recombinant proteins displayed strong differences in their specificity for oligosaccharides disci and discii bind preferentially to gal galnac    gal galnac containing and gal galnac    glcnac    gal galnac containing glycans respectively the affinity of the interaction of disci with monosaccharides and disaccharides was evaluated using isothermal titration calorimetry experiments the three dimensional structures of native disci and its complexes with galnac galnac    gal and gal    galnac were solved by x ray crystallography disci forms trimers with involvement of calcium at the monomer interface the n terminal discoidin domain presents a structural similarity to f type lectins such as the eel agglutinin where an amphiphilic binding pocket suggests possible carbohydrate binding activity in the c terminal h type lectin domain the galnac residue establishes specific hydrogen bonds that explain the observed affinity kd      m  the different specificities of disci and discii for oligosaccharides were rationalized from the different structures obtained by either x ray crystallography or molecular modeling
