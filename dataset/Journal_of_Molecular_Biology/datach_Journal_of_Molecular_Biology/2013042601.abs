solution structure of the wnk autoinhibitory domain a wnk specific pf domain
wnk  with no lysine k   is a   kda serine threonine protein kinase involved in the maintenance of cellular salt levels and is directly linked to a hereditary form of hypertension here we report the solution nmr structure of the autoinhibitory domain of wnk  wnk ai  a small regulatory subunit that lies immediately c terminal of the kinase domain we show that this domain is a homolog of the rfxv binding pask fray homology  pf  domain found in osr oxidative stress responsive and spak serine threonine proline  alanine rich kinases which are substrates of wnk  the wnk ai has a circularly permuted topology relative to the osr  pf domain nevertheless like pf domains wnk ai binds peptides that contain an rfxv motif with micromolar affinities as assessed by changes in h  n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra mutations to the wnk ai and binding peptides confirm a similar binding mode
