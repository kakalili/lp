structural basis for the broad substrate range of the udp sugar pyrophosphorylase from leishmania major
nucleotide sugars and the enzymes that are responsible for their synthesis are indispensable for the production of complex carbohydrates and thus for elaboration of a protective cellular coat for many organisms such as the protozoan parasite leishmania these activated sugars are synthesized de novo or derived from salvaged monosaccharides in addition to udp glucose udp glc pyrophosphorylase which catalyzes the formation of udp glc from substrates utp and glucose  phosphate leishmania major and plants express a udp sugar pyrophosphorylase usp that exhibits broad substrate specificity in vitro the enzyme likely involved in monosaccharide salvage preferentially generates udp glc and udp galactose but it may also activate other hexose or pentose  phosphates such as galacturonic acid  phosphate or arabinose  phosphate in order to gain insight into structural features governing the differences in substrate specificity we determined the crystal structure of the l major usp in the apo  utp  and udp sugar bound conformations the overall tripartite structure of usp exhibits a significant structural homology to other nucleotidyldiphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylases the obtained usp structures reveal the structural rearrangements occurring during the stepwise binding process of the substrates moreover the different product complexes explain the broad substrate specificity of usp which is enabled by structural changes in the sugar binding region of the active site
