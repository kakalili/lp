mutations enhance the aggregation propensity of the alzheimer  s a  peptide
aggregation of the amyloid   a  peptide plays a key role in the molecular etiology of alzheimer  s disease despite the importance of this process the relationship between the sequence of a  and the propensity of the peptide to aggregate has not been fully elucidated the sequence determinants of aggregation can be revealed by probing the ability of amino acid substitutions mutations to increase or decrease aggregation numerous mutations that decrease aggregation have been isolated by laboratory based studies in contrast very few mutations that increase aggregation have been reported and most of these were isolated from rare individuals with early onset familial alzheimer  s disease to augment the limited data set of clinically derived mutations we developed an artificial genetic screen to isolate novel mutations that increase aggregation propensity the screen relies on the expression of a   green fluorescent protein fusion in escherichia coli in this fusion the ability of the green fluorescent protein reporter to fold and fluoresce is inversely correlated with the aggregation propensity of the a  sequence implementation of this screen enabled the isolation of  mutant versions of a  with amino acid substitutions at  positions in the  residue sequence of a  biophysical studies of synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences isolated by the screen confirm the increased aggregation propensity and amyloidogenic behavior of the mutants the mutations were isolated using an unbiased screen that makes no assumptions about the sequence determinants of aggregation nonetheless all  of the most aggregating mutants contain substitutions that reduce charge and or increase hydrophobicity these findings provide compelling evidence supporting the hypothesis that sequence hydrophobicity is a major determinant of a  aggregation
