mechanisms of nlrp mediated autoinflammatory disease in humans and mice
nlrp was the first nod like receptor described to form an inflammasome recruiting asc to activate caspase  which processes interleukin   and interleukin  to their active form a wealth of new genetic information has now redefined our understanding of this innate immune sensor specifically rare loss of function variants in the n terminal pyrin domain indicate that this part of nlrp is autoinhibitory and normally acts to prevent a familial autoinflammatory skin disease associated with cancer in the absence of a ligand to trigger human nlrp  these mutations have now confirmed the requirement of nlrp autolytic cleavage within the fiind domain which had previously been implicated in nlrp activation autolytic cleavage generates a c terminal fragment of nlrp containing the card domain which then forms an asc dependent inflammasome the card domain as an inflammasome linker is consistent with the observation that under some conditions particularly for mouse nlrp  caspase  can be engaged directly and although it is no longer processed it is still capable of producing mature il   additional rare variants in a linker region between the lrr and fiind domains of nlrp also cause autoinflammatory disease in both humans and mice this new genetic information is likely to provide for more mechanistic insight in the years to come contributing to our understanding of how nlrp functions as an innate immune sensor of infection and predisposes to autoimmune or autoinflammatory diseases
