characterization of conserved motifs in hiv  vif required for apobec g and apobec f interaction
apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide like g apobec g or a g and related cytidine deaminases such as apolipoprotein b mrna editing catalytic polypeptide like f apobec f or a f are potent inhibitors of retroviruses formation of infectious human immunodeficiency virus hiv  requires suppression of multiple cytidine deaminases by vif hiv  vif suppresses various apobec proteins through a common mechanism by recruiting cullin  elonginb and elonginc e ubiquitin ligase to induce target protein polyubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation domains in vif that mediate apobec recognition have not been fully characterized in the present study we identified a vxiplx   lx x ywxl motif in hiv  vif which is required for efficient interaction between vif and a g vif mediated a g degradation and virion exclusion and functional suppression of the a g antiviral activity amino acids  to  of hiv  vif including the vxiplx   lx x ywxl motif alone could mediate interaction with a g and this interaction was abolished by mutations of two hydrophobic amino acids in this region we have also observed that a vif mutant was ineffective against a g yet it retained the ability to interact with cullin  e ubiquitin complex and a g suggesting that interaction with a g is necessary but not sufficient to inhibit its antiviral function unlike the previously identified motif of hiv  vif amino acids  to   which is only important for a g suppression the vxiplx   lx x ywxl motif is also required for efficient a f interaction and suppression on the other hand another motif tgerxw of hiv  vif amino acids  to  was found to be mainly important for a f interaction and inhibition both the vxiplx   lx x ywxl and tgerxw motifs are highly conserved among hiv  hiv  and various simian immunodeficiency virus vif proteins our data suggest that primate lentiviral vif molecules recognize their autologous apobec proteins through conserved structural features that represent attractive targets for the development of novel inhibitors
