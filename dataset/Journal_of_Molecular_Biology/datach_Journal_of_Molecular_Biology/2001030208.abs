functional cooperation between topoisomerase i and single strand dna binding protein edited by j karn
protein protein interactions play important role in cell biochemistry by favorably or adversely influencing major molecular events in most documented cases the interaction is direct between the partner molecules influence of activity in the absence of direct physical interaction between dna transaction proteins is another important means of modulation we show here that single strand binding protein stimulates dna topoisomerase i activity without direct protein protein interactions the stimulation is specific to topoisomerase i as dna gyrase activity is unaffected by ssb we propose that such cases of functional collaboration between dna transaction proteins play important roles in vivo
