linkage of ecori dissociation from its specific dna recognition site to water activity salt concentration and ph separating their roles in specific and non specific binding edited by r ebright
we have measured the dependencies of both the dissociation rate of specifically bound ecori endonuclease and the ratio of non specific and specific association constants on water activity salt concentration and ph in order to distinguish the contributions of these solution components to specific and non specific binding for proteins such as ecori that locate their specific recognition site efficiently by diffusing along non specific dna the specific site dissociation rate can be separated into two steps an equilibrium between non specific and specific binding of the enzyme to dna and the dissociation of non specifically bound protein we demonstrated previously that the osmotic dependence of the dissociation rate is dominated by the equilibrium between specific and non specific binding that is independent of the osmolyte nature the remaining osmotic sensitivity linked to the dissociation of non specifically bound protein depends significantly on the particular osmolyte used indicating a change in solute accessible surface area in contrast the dissociation of non specifically bound enzyme accounts for almost all the ph and salt dependencies we observed virtually no ph dependence of the equilibrium between specific and non specific binding measured by the competition assay the observed weak salt sensitivity of the ratio of specific and non specific association constants is consistent with an osmotic rather than electrostatic action the seeming lack of a dependence on viscosity suggests the rate limiting step in dissociation of non specifically bound protein is a discrete conformational change rather than a general diffusion of the protein away from the dna
