three rna recognition motifs participate in rna recognition and structural organization by the pro apoptotic factor tia
t cell intracellular antigen  tia  regulates developmental and stress responsive pathways through distinct activities at the levels of alternative pre mrna splicing and mrna translation the tia  polypeptide contains three rna recognition motifs rrms  the central rrm and c terminal rrm associate with cellular mrnas the n terminal rrm enhances interactions of a c terminal q rich domain of tia  with the u c splicing factor despite linear separation of the domains in the tia  sequence given the expanded functional repertoire of the rrm family it was unknown whether tia  rrm contributes to rna binding as well as documented protein interactions to address this question we used isothermal titration calorimetry and small angle x ray scattering to dissect the roles of the tia  rrms in rna recognition notably the fas rna exhibited two binding sites with indistinguishable affinities for tia  analyses of tia  variants established that rrm was dispensable for binding au rich fas sites yet all three rrms were required to bind a polyu rna with high affinity small angle x ray scattering analyses demonstrated a  v  shape for a tia  construct comprising the three rrms and revealed that its dimensions became more compact in the rna bound state the sequence selective involvement of tia  rrm in rna recognition suggests a possible role for rna sequences in regulating the distinct functions of tia  further implications for u c recruitment by the adjacent tia  binding sites of the fas pre mrna and the bent tia  shape which organizes the n and c termini on the same side of the protein are discussed
