structural basis for electron and methyl group transfer in a methyltransferase system operating in the reductive acetyl coa pathway
several anaerobic acetogenic methanogenic hydrogenogenic and sulfate reducing microorganisms are able to use the reductive acetyl coa wood  ljungdahl pathway to convert co into biomass the reductive acetyl coa pathway consists of two branches connected by the co fe containing corrinoid iron  sulfur protein cofesp  which transfers a methyl group from a methyltransferase metr methyltetrahydrofolate ch h folate complex to the reduced ni  ni   fe  s cluster cluster a of acetyl coa synthase we investigated the cofesp and metr couple of the hydrogenogenic bacterium carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans and show that the two proteins are able to catalyze the methyl group transfer reaction from ch h folate to the co i center of cofesp we determined the crystal structures of both proteins the structure of cofesp includes the previously unresolved n terminal domain of the large subunit of cofesp revealing a unique four helix bundle like architecture in which a  fe  s cluster is shielded by hydrophobic amino acids it further reveals that the corrinoid and the  fe  s cluster binding domains are mobile which is mandatory for the postulated electron transfer between them furthermore we solved the crystal structures of apo metr ch h folate bound metr and h folate bound metr revealing a substrate induced closure of the ch h folate binding cavity of metr we observed three different conformations of asn  depending on the substrate bound in the active site demonstrating its conformational modulation by hydrogen bonding interactions with the substrate the observed flexibility could be essential to stabilize the transition state during methyl group transfer the conformational space and role of asn  are likely conserved in homologous cobalamin dependent metrs such as methionine synthase
