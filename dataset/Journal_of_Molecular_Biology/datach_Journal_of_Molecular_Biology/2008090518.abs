structural and energetic analysis of activation by a cyclic nucleotide binding domain
mlotik is a prokaryotic homolog of cyclic nucleotide dependent ion channels that contains an intracellular c terminal cyclic nucleotide binding cnb domain x ray structures of the cnb domain have been solved in the absence of ligand and bound to camp both the full length channel and cnb domain fragment are easily expressed and purified making mlotik a useful model system for dissecting activation by ligand binding we have used x ray crystallography to determine three new mlotik cnb domain structures a second apo configuration a cgmp bound structure and a second camp bound structure in combination the five mlotik cnb domain structures provide a unique opportunity for analyzing within a single protein the structural differences between the apo state and the bound state and the structural variability within each state with this analysis as a guide we have probed the nucleotide selectivity and importance of specific residue side chains in ligand binding and channel activation these data help to identify ligand  protein interactions that are important for ligand dependence in mlotik and more globally in the class of nucleotide dependent proteins
