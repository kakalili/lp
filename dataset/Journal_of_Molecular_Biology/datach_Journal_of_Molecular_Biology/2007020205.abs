the transition state of the ras binding domain of raf is structurally polarized based on  values but is energetically diffuse
the ras binding domain rbd of the ser thr kinase c raf raf  spans  residues and adopts a structure characteristic of the  grasp ubiquitin like topology recently the primary sequence of raf rbd has been nearly exhaustively mutated experimentally by insertion of stretches of degenerate codons which revealed sequence conservation and hydrophobic core organization similar to that found in an alignment of  grasp ubiquitin like proteins these results now allow us to examine the relationship between sequence conservation and the folding process particularly viewed through the analysis of transition state ts structure specifically we present herein a protein engineering study combining classic truncation ala gly and atypical mutants to predict folding ts ensemble properties based on classical  value analysis raf rbd ts structure is particularly polarized around the n terminal  hairpin however all residues constituting the inner layer of the hydrophobic core are involved in ts stabilization although they are clearly found in a less native like environment the ts structure can also be probed by a direct measure of its destabilization upon mutation   gu   viewed through this analysis raf rbd ts is a more diffuse structure in which all residues of the hydrophobic core including  strands     and  and the major  helix play similar roles in ts stabilization in addition   values and   gu   reveal striking similarities in the ts of raf rbd and ubiquitin a structural analogue displaying insignificant sequence identity  lt    however ubiquitin ts appears more denatured like and polarized around the n terminal  hairpin we suggest that analysis of  values should also consider the direct impact of mutations on differences in free energy between the unfolded and ts   gu   to ensure that the description of ts properties is accurate finally the impact of these findings on the modeling of protein folding is discussed
