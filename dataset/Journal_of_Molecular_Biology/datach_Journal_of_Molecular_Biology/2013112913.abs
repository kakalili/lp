trashing of single stranded dna generated during processing of arrested replication fork in e coli
we analyzed formation of single stranded dna ssdna related to sos induction in nalidixilate nal treated escherichia coli using immunofluorescence microscopy accompanied by computer analysis we found enhancement of both ssdna concentrations and cells having ssdna foci that often localized around cellpoles analyzing several mutants deficient in dna repair or replication we found after nal treatment that recn reca uvrd and dnab failed to increase ssdna concentration and that recg and particularly ruva only partially enhanced it in nal treated recb mutant despite its failure in sos induction ssdna foci positive cells increased with a slight enhancement of its concentration these observations suggest the existence of a cellular process that sequesters genotoxic ssdna as inert form offering a new concept for sos suppressor genes action
