sheet structured  amyloid    perturbs phosphatidylcholine model membranes
the disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis plays a central role in the pathology of alzheimer s disease which is also characterized by accumulation of the amyloid  peptides a   and a   these amphipathic peptides may become associated with neuronal membranes and affect their barrier function resulting in the loss of calcium homeostasis this suggestion has been extensively investigated by exposing protein free model membranes either vesicles or planar bilayers to soluble a  primarily unstructured a  has been shown to undergo a membrane induced conformational change to either primarily  structure or helical structure depending among other factors on the model membrane composition association of a  renders lipid bilayers permeable to ions but there is dispute whether this is due to the formation of discrete transmembrane ion channels of a  peptides or to a non specific perturbation of bilayer integrity by lipid head group associated a  here we have attempted incorporation of a  in the hydrophobic core of zwitterionic bilayers the most simple model membrane system by preparing proteoliposomes by hydration of a mixed film of a  peptides and phosphatidylcholine pc lipids despite the use of a solvent mixture in which a   and a   are almost entirely helical the a  analogs were  structured in the resulting vesicle dispersions when a   containing vesicles were fused into a zwitterionic planar bilayer the typical irregular  single channel like  conductance of a  was observed the maximum conductance increased with additional vesicle fusion while still exhibiting single channel like behavior supported bilayers formed from a   pc vesicles did not exhibit any channel like topological features but the bilayer destabilized in time a   was present primarily as  sheets in supported multilayers formed from the same vesicles the combined observations argue for a non specific perturbation of zwitterionic bilayers by surface association of small amphipathic a   assemblies
