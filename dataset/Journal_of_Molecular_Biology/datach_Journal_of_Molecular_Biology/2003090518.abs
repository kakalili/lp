mutational analysis defines the roles of conserved amino acid residues in the predicted catalytic pocket of the rrna m a methyltransferase ermc
methyltransferases mtases from the erm family catalyze s adenosyl l methionine dependent modification of a specific adenine residue in bacterial  s rrna thereby conferring resistance to clinically important macrolide lincosamide and streptogramin b antibiotics despite the available structural data and functional analyses on the level of the rna substrate still very little is known about the mechanism of rrna adenine n methylation only predictions regarding various aspects of this reaction have been made based on the analysis of the crystal structures of methyltransferase ermc   without the rna and their comparison with the crystallographic and biochemical data for better studied dna m a mtases to validate the structure based predictions of presumably essential residues in the catalytic pocket of ermc   we carried out the site directed mutagenesis and studied the function of the mutants in vitro and in vivo our results indicate that the active site of rrna m a mtases is much more tolerant to amino acid substitutions than the active site of dna m a mtases only the y  residue implicated in stabilization of the target base was found to be indispensable remarkably the n  residue from the  catalytic  motif iv and two conserved residues that form the floor f   and one of the walls n  of the base binding site are not essential for catalysis in ermc   this somewhat surprising result is discussed in the light of the available structural data and in the phylogenetic context of the erm family
