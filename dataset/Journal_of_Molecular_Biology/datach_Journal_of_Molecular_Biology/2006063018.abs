self association of the transmembrane domain of an anthrax toxin receptor
protective antigen pa  lethal factor lf and edema factor ef are secreted individually by bacillus anthracis these components of anthrax toxin must then assemble into complexes to intoxicate mammalian cells toxin assembly initiates when molecules of pa bind mammalian receptors antxr  and are cleaved by surface proteases into   kda and   kda fragments after pa  dissociates receptor bound pa  homo oligomerizes into heptamers oligomeric pa  binds ef and lf and these complexes are internalized into an acidic compartment where the two enzymatic components are translocated across the membrane by a channel formed by heptameric pa  since oligomerization of pa  is required to bind and translocate the enzymatic components we sought to determine whether interactions between toxin receptors could facilitate the assembly process in the present work we performed a co immunoprecipitation experiment to demonstrate that antxr is oligomeric in mammalian cells computer modeling predicted the self association of the antxr transmembrane domain and we detected oligomerization of antxr transmembrane domain peptides in the membrane mimetic environment of sds micelles using fluorescence resonance energy transfer furthermore the antxr transmembrane domain mediated oligomerization of a reporter protein construct in a bacterial membrane in both assays mutations that disrupted the interaction were consistent with the interaction being mediated through an asymmetric binding interface mutations that impaired self association of the transmembrane domain reduced the rate of pa  heptamer formation on the mammalian cell surface our findings indicate that antxr transmembrane domains self associate and that these interactions may stabilize intermediate oligomerization states of antxr pa  complexes
