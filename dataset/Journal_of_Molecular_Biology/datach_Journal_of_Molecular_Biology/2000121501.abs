interaction of the e coli dna g t mismatch endonuclease vsr protein with oligonucleotides containing its target sequence
the escherichia coli vsr endonuclease recognises g t base pair mismatches in double stranded dna and initiates a repair pathway by hydrolysing the phosphate group   to the incorrectly paired t the enzyme shows a preference for g t mismatches within a particular sequence context derived from the recognition site of the e coli dcm dna methyltransferase cc a t gg  thus the preferred substrate for the vsr protein is ct a t gg  where the underlined t is opposed by a dg base this paper provides quantitative data for the interaction of the vsr protein with a number of oligonucleotides containing g t mismatches evaluation of specificity constant kst kd kst rate constant for single turnover kd equilibrium dissociation constant confirms vsr s preference for a g t mismatch within a hemi methylated dcm sequence i e the best substrate is a duplex both strands written in the      orientation composed of ct a t gg and c mec t a gg conversion of the mispaired t underlined to du or the d mec to dc gave poorer substrates no interaction was observed with oligonucleotides that lacked a g t mismatch or did not possess a dcm sequence an analysis of the fraction of active protein by  reverse titration   i e adding increasing amounts of dna to a fixed amount of protein followed by gel mobility shift analysis showed that less than  of the vsr endonuclease was able to bind to the substrate this was confirmed using  competitive titrations   where competitor oligonucleotides are used to displace a  p labelled nucleic acid from the vsr protein and burst kinetic analysis this result is discussed in the light of previous in vitro and in vivo data which indicate that the mutl protein may be needed for full vsr activity
