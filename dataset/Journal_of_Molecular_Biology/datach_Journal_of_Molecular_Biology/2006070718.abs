sequential release of promoter contacts during transcription initiation to elongation transition
bacteriophage t rna polymerase undergoes major conformational changes as transcription proceeds from initiation to elongation using limited trypsin digestion and stopped flow fluorescence kinetic methods we have monitored promoter release initial bubble collapse and refolding of the      region subdomain h  the latter being important for rna channel formation the kinetic studies show that the conformational changes are temporally coupled commencing at the synthesis of  nt and completing by the synthesis of  nt of rna the temporal coupling of initial bubble collapse and rna channel formation is proposed to facilitate proper binding of the rna dissociated from the late initiation complexes into the rna channel using promoter mutations we have determined that promoter contacts are broken sequentially during transition from initiation to elongation the specificity loop interactions are broken after synthesis of  nt or  nt of rna whereas the upstream promoter contacts persists up to synthesis of  nt of rna both promoter contacts need to be broken for transition into elongation the a  c mutation resulted in efficient transition to elongation by synthesis of  nt of rna whereas the c a mutation resulted in early transition to elongation by synthesis of    nt of rna the effect of early promoter clearance in the mutant promoters was observed as reduced production of long abortive products
