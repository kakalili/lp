interactions of phage mu enhancer and termini that specify the assembly of a topologically unique interwrapped transpososome
the higher order dna  protein complex that carries out the chemical steps of phage mu transposition is organized by bridging interactions among three dna sites the left l and right r ends of mu and an enhancer element e  mediated by the transposase protein mua a subset of the six subunits of mua associated with their cognate sub sites at l and r communicate with the enhancer to trigger the stepwise assembly of the functional transpososome the dna follows a well defined path within the transpososome trapping five supercoil nodes comprising two e r crossings one e l crossing and two l r crossings the enhancer is a critical dna element in specifying the unique interwrapped topology of the three site ler synapse in this study we used multiple strategies to characterize mu end  enhancer interactions to extend modify and refine those inferred from earlier analyses directed placement of transposase subunits at their cognate sub sites at l and r analysis of the protein composition of transpososomes thus obtained and their characterization using topological methods define the following interactions r  e interaction is essential to promote transpososome assembly r  e interaction contributes to the native topology of the transpososome and l  e and r  e interactions are not required for assembly the data on l  e and l  e interactions are not unequivocal if they do occur either one is sufficient to support the assembly process our results are consistent with two r  e and perhaps one l  e being responsible for the three dna crossings between the enhancer and the left and right ends of mu a d representation of the interwrapped complex iw obtained by modeling is consistent with these results the model reveals straightforward geometric and topological relationships between the iw complex and a more relaxed enhancer independent v form of the transpososome assembled under altered reaction conditions
