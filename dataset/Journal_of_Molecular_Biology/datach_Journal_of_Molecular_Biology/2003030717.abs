efficient conformational sampling of local side chain flexibility
side chain flexibility of ligand binding sites needs to be considered in the rational design of novel inhibitors we have developed a method to generate conformational ensembles that efficiently sample local side chain flexibility from a single crystal structure the rotamer based approach is tested here for the s   pocket of human collagenase  mmp   which is known to undergo conformational changes in multiple side chains upon binding of certain inhibitors first a raw ensemble consisting of a large number of conformers of the s   pocket was generated using an exhaustive search of rotamer combinations on a template crystal structure a combination of principal component analysis and fuzzy clustering was then employed to successfully identify a core ensemble consisting of a low number of representatives from the raw ensemble the core ensemble contained geometrically diverse conformers of stable nature as indicated in several cases by a relative energy lower than that of the minimised template crystal structure through comparisons with x ray crystallography and nmr structural data we show that the core ensemble occupied a conformational space similar to that observed under experimental conditions the synthetic inhibitor rs    is known to induce a conformational change in the side chains of the s   pocket of mmp  and could not be docked in the template crystal structure however the experimental binding mode was reproduced successfully using members of the core ensemble as the docking target establishing the usefulness of the method in drug design
