crystal structure of human pyrroline  carboxylate reductase
pyrroline  carboxylate reductase p cr is a universal housekeeping enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of   pyrroline  carboxylate p c to proline using nad p h as the cofactor the enzymatic cycle between p c and proline is very important for the regulation of amino acid metabolism intracellular redox potential and apoptosis here we present the     resolution structure of the p cr apo enzyme its     resolution ternary complex with nad p h and substrate analog the refined structures demonstrate a decameric architecture with five homodimer subunits and ten catalytic sites arranged around a peripheral circular groove mutagenesis and kinetic studies reveal the pivotal roles of the dinucleotide binding rossmann motif and residue glu  in the human enzyme human p cr is thermostable and the crystals were grown at    c the enzyme is implicated in oxidation of the anti tumor drug thioproline
