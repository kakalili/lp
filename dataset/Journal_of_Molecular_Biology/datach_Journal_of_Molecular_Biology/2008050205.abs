mir  gene expression triggered by ap  is sustained through a double negative feedback mechanism
mir  has been reported to be highly expressed in various cancers and to be inducible in a human promyelocytic cell line hl   after phorbol  myristate  acetate pma treatment to examine molecular mechanisms involved in mir  expression we analyzed the structure of the mir  gene by determining its promoter and primary transcripts we show that activation protein  ap  activates the mir  transcription in conjugation with the swi snf complex after pma stimulation through the conserved ap  and pu  binding sites in the promoter identified here the previous findings of enhanced mir  expression in several cancers may therefore reflect the elevated ap  activity in these carcinomas a single precursor rna containing mir  was transcribed just downstream from the tata box in this promoter which is located in an intron of a coding gene tmem  more important expression of this overlapping gene is completely pma independent and all its transcripts are polyadenylated before reaching the mir  hairpin embedding region indicating that mirnas could have their own promoter even if overlapped with other genes by available algorithms that predict mirna target using a conservation of sequence complementary to the mirna seed sequence we next predicted and confirmed that the nfib mrna is a target of mir   nfib protein usually binds the mir  promoter in hl  cells as a negative regulator and is swept off from the mir  promoter during pma induced macrophage differentiation of hl   the translational repression of nfib mrna by mir  accelerates clearance of nfib in parallel with the simultaneous mir  independent transcriptional repression of nfib after pma stimulation since exogenous mir  expression moderately induced endogenous mir   an evolutionarily conserved double negative feedback regulation would be operating as a mechanism to sustain mir  expression
