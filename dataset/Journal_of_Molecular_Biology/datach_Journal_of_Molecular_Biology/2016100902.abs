a small number of residues can determine if linker histones are bound on or off dyad in the chromatosome
linker histones bind to the nucleosome and regulate the structure and function of chromatin we have previously shown that the globular domains of chicken h and drosophila h linker histones bind to the nucleosome with on or off dyad modes respectively to explore the determinant for the distinct binding modes we investigated the binding of a mutant globular domain of h to the nucleosome this mutant termed gh pmut includes substitutions of five globular domain residues of h with the corresponding residues in the globular domain of drosophila h  the residues at these five positions play important roles in nucleosome binding by either h or drosophila h  nmr and spin labeling experiments showed that gh pmut bound to the nucleosome off the dyad we further found that the nucleosome array condensed by either the gh pmut or the globular domain of drosophila h displayed a similar sedimentation coefficient whereas the same nucleosome array condensed by the wild type globular domain of h showed a much larger sedimentation coefficient moreover nmr and spin labeling results from the study of the nucleosome in complex with the full length human linker histone h   whose globular domain shares high sequence conservation with the corresponding globular domain of h  are consistent with an on dyad binding mode taken together our results suggest that a small number of residues in the globular domain of a linker histone can control its binding location on the nucleosome and higher order chromatin structure
