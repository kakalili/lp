experimental evidence for the existence of a stable half barrel subdomain in the     barrel fold
the     barrel is one of the most common folds functioning as enzymes the emergence of two     barrel enzymes involved in histidine biosynthesis each of which has a twofold symmetric structure has been proposed to be a consequence of tandem duplication and fusion of a     half barrel however little evidence has been found for the existence of an ancestral half barrel in the evolution of other     barrel proteins in order to detect remnants of an ancestral half barrel in the     barrel structure of escherichia coli n    phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase we engineered three potential half barrel units               and        among these three arrangements only       is stable it exists in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms thus the central segment of n    phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase from e coli can serve as a half barrel precursor a tandem duplication of       yielded predominantly monomeric structures that were quite stable this result exemplified that the structural characteristics of noncovalently assembled half barrels could be improved by duplication and fusion moreover our results may provide information regarding the local structural units that encompass interactions important for the early folding events of this ubiquitous protein conformation
