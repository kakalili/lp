structural and functional analysis of the c terminal domain of nup  ranbp
the nuclear pore complex is the sole mediator of bidirectional transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm nup  is a metazoan specific nucleoporin that localizes to the cytoplasmic filaments and provides several binding sites for the mobile nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery here we present the crystal structure of the c terminal domain ctd of nup  at    resolution the structure reveals that the ctd adopts a cyclophilin like fold with a non canonical active site configuration we determined biochemically that the ctd possesses weak peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity and show that the active site cavity mediates a weak association with the human immunodeficiency virus  capsid protein supporting its role in viral infection overall the surface is evolutionarily conserved suggesting that the ctd serves as a protein  protein interaction platform however we demonstrate that the ctd is dispensable for nuclear envelope localization of nup   suggesting that the ctd does not interact with other nucleoporins
