bacterial and yeast aaa disaggregases clpb and hsp  operate through conserved mechanism involving cooperation with hsp
escherichia coli clpb and saccharomyces cerevisiae hsp  are members of the hsp  family of ring forming hexameric aaa chaperones that promote the solubilization of aggregated proteins and the propagation of prions clpb and hsp  cooperate with cognate hsp  chaperones for substrate targeting and activation of atpase and substrate threading achieved by transient hsp  binding to the repressing clpb hsp  m domain fundamental differences in atpase regulation and disaggregation mechanisms have been reported however these differences are raising doubts regarding the working principle of this aaa chaperone in particular unique functional plasticity was suggested to specifically enable hsp  to circumvent hsp  requirement for derepression in protein disaggregation and prion propagation we show here that both clpb and hsp  cooperation with hsp  is crucial for efficient protein disaggregation and in contrast to earlier claims cannot be circumvented by activating m domain mutations activation of clpb and hsp  requires two signals relief of m domain repression and substrate binding leading to increased atpase subunit coupling these data demonstrate that clpb and hsp  operate by the same basic mechanism underscore a dominant function of hsp  in regulating clpb hsp  activity and explain a plethora of in vivo studies showing a crucial function of hsp  in proteostasis and prion propagation
