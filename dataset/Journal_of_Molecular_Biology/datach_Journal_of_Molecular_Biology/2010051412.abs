characterising the binding specificities of the subunits associated with the kmt set histone lysine methyltransferase
kmt set is the catalytic subunit of the complex of proteins associated with set  compass that is responsible for the methylation of lysine  of histone h  h k  in saccharomyces cerevisiae whereas monomethylated h k  h k me  is found throughout the genome di  h k me  and tri  h k me  methylated h k are enriched at specific loci which correlates with the promoter and   ends of actively transcribed genes in the case of h k me  the compass subunits contain a number of domains that are conserved in homologous complexes in higher eukaryotes and are reported to interact with modified histones however the exact organization of these subunits and their role within the complex have not been elucidated in this study we showed that   subunits swd and swd form a stable heterodimer that dissociates upon binding to a modified h k me tail peptide suggesting a regulatory role in compass   the affinity of the subunit spp for modified histone h substrates is much higher than that of swd and swd    spp has a preference for h k me  methylation state and   spp contains a high affinity dna binding domain in the previously uncharacterised c terminal region these data allow us to suggest a mechanism for the regulation of compass activity at an actively transcribed gene
