periodic accumulation of cdc  mrna is not necessary for septation in schizosaccharomyces pombe edited by j karn
analysis of schizosaccharomyces pombe mutants that are defective in septum formation and cytokinesis has identified the product of the cdc  gene as a key element in formation of a division septum s pombe cells lacking cdc p function cannot assemble a functional medial ring and do not make a division septum cdc  mrna accumulates periodically during the cell cycle peaking after entry into mitosis and increased expression of the gene in g arrested cells can promote f actin ring formation here we have investigated the effects of mutations that block cell division upon the expression of cdc  in synchronised cell populations and analysed the expression of cdc  when septum formation is induced by ectopic activation of the septation signalling network we concluded the following  i the septation signalling network genes are not required for periodic accumulation of cdc  mrna  ii induction of septum formation in g arrested cells by activation of the septation signalling network does not result in accumulation of cdc  mrna which is therefore not a prerequisite for septum formation  iii failure to turn off septum formation at the end of mitosis results in continued expression of cdc  and iv periodic accumulation of cdc  mrna is mediated by a  bp region   to the mrna start site
