two alternative conformations of a voltage gated sodium channel
activation and inactivation of voltage gated sodium channels navs are well studied yet the molecular mechanisms governing channel gating in the membrane remain unknown we present two conformations of a nav from caldalkalibacillus thermarum reconstituted into lipid bilayers in one crystal at   resolution based on electron crystallography despite a voltage sensor arrangement identical with that in the activated form we observed two distinct pore domain structures a prominent form with a relatively open inner gate and a closed inner gate conformation similar to the first prokaryotic nav structure structural differences together with mutational and electrophysiological analyses indicated that widening of the inner gate was dependent on interactions among the s  s linker the n terminal part of s and its adjoining part in s  and on interhelical repulsion by a negatively charged c terminal region subsequent to s  our findings suggest that these specific interactions result in two conformational structures
