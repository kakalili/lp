structure of the bamc two domain protein obtained by rosetta with a limited nmr data set
the cs rdc noe rosetta program was used to generate the solution structure of a  kda fragment of the escherichia coli bamc protein from a limited set of nmr data the bamc protein is a component of the essential five protein  barrel assembly machine in e coli the first   residues in bamc were disordered in solution the rosetta calculations showed that bamc     forms two well defined domains connected by an    residue linker where the relative orientation of the domains was not defined both domains adopt a helix  grip fold previously observed in the bet v  superfamily  n relaxation data indicated a high degree of conformational flexibility for the linker connecting the n terminal domain and the c terminal domain in bamc the results here show that cs rdc noe rosetta is robust and has a high tolerance for misassigned nuclear overhauser effect restraints greatly simplifying nmr structure determinations
