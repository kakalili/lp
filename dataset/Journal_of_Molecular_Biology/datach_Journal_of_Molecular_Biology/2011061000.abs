structure of the dimeric autoinhibited conformation of dapk  a pro apoptotic protein kinase
the death associated protein kinase dapk family has been characterized as a group of pro apoptotic serine threonine kinases that share specific structural features in their catalytic kinase domain two of the dapk family members dapk and dapk  are calmodulin dependent protein kinases that are regulated by oligomerization calmodulin binding and autophosphorylation in this study we have determined the crystal and solution structures of murine dapk in the presence of the autoinhibitory domain with and without bound nucleotides in the active site the crystal structure shows dimers of dapk in a conformation that is not permissible for protein substrate binding two different conformations were seen in the active site upon the introduction of nucleotide ligands the monomeric and dimeric forms of dapk were further analyzed for solution structure and the results indicate that the dimers of dapk are indeed formed through the association of two apposed catalytic domains as seen in the crystal structure the structures can be further used to build a model for dapk autophosphorylation and to compare with closely related kinases of which especially dapk is an actively studied drug target our structures also provide a model for both homodimerization and heterodimerization of the catalytic domain between members of the dapk family the fingerprint of the dapk family the basic loop plays a central role in the dimerization of the kinase domain
