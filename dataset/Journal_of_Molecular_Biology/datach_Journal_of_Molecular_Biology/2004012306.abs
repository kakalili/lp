the rad  signature motif essential to atp binding and biological function
the repair of double strand breaks in dna is an essential process in all organisms and requires the coordinated activities of evolutionarily conserved protein assemblies one of the most critical of these is the mre  rad  m r complex which is present in all three biological kingdoms but is not well understood at the biochemical level previous structural analysis of a rad  homolog from archaebacteria illuminated the catalytic core of the enzyme an atp binding domain related to the abc transporter family of atpases here we present the crystallographic structure of the rad  mutant s  r this missense signature motif mutation changes the key serine residue in the signature motif that is conserved among rad  homologs and abc atpases the s  r mutation is analogous to the mutation s  r in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr that results in cystic fibrosis we show here that the serine to arginine change in the rad  protein prevents atp binding and disrupts the communication among the other atp binding loops this structural change in turn alters the communication between rad  monomers and thus prevents rad  dimerization the equivalent mutation was made in the human rad  gene and the resulting mutant protein did form a complex with mre  and nbs  but was specifically deficient in all atp dependent enzymatic activities this signature motif structure  function homology extends to yeast because the same mutation introduced into the saccharomyces cerevisiae rad  gene generated an allele that failed to complement a rad  deletion strain in dna repair assays in vivo these structural and biochemical results extend our understanding of the rad  catalytic domain and validate the use of the signature motif mutant to test the role of rad  atp binding in diverse organisms
