Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major serine/threonine-specific phosphatase playing central roles in development, cell growth and transformation. Regulation is largely accomplished by the regulatory B subunits, which determine substrate specificity, subcellular localisation and catalytic activity. The B′ family, also known as the PR61 family, is the most diverse, consisting of five genes (α,β,γ,δ and ε) that give rise to a number of splice variants. We deduced the sequences of the different PR61 proteins in mice and found evidence for the expression of PR61α, β1, γ1, γ2, γ3, δ1 and ε. We report the genomic organisation and localisation of the murine PR61 genes (Ppp2r5a-Ppp2r5e). This information will be useful for the future realisation of PR61 knockouts. Using Northern blotting, we examined the expression of the five PR61 isoforms in different tissues. A brain-specific function can be expected for the PR61β protein based on the high expression levels observed in murine brain. In situ hybridisation analysis of the adult brain revealed a distinct and partially overlapping pattern of mRNA expression of the various PR61 isoforms. The PR61 mRNA expression during embryonic development was examined by Northern blotting. The PR61 transcripts were differentially expressed, suggesting a specific function for each of the PR61 proteins during embryonic development and/or adult life.
