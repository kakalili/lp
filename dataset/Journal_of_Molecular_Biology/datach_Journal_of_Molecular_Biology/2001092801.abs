multiple procyclin isoforms are expressed differentially during the development of insect forms of trypanosoma brucei edited by i b holland
transmission of trypanosoma brucei by the tsetse fly entails several rounds of differentiation as the parasite migrates through the digestive tract to the salivary glands of its vector differentiation of the bloodstream to the procyclic form in the fly midgut is accompanied by the synthesis of a new coat consisting of ep and gpeet procyclins there are three closely related ep isoforms two of which ep and ep  contain n glycans to identify the individual ep isoforms that are expressed early during synchronous differentiation in vitro we exploited the selective extraction of gpi anchored proteins and mass spectrometry unexpectedly we found that gpeet and all isoforms of ep were coexpressed for a few hours at the onset of differentiation at this time the majority of ep and ep molecules were already glycosylated within  hours gpeet became the major surface component to be replaced in turn by glycosylated forms of ep principally ep  at a later phase of development transient transfection experiments using reporter genes revealed that each procyclin   untranslated region contributes to differential expression as the procyclic form develops we postulate that programmed expression of other procyclin species will accompany further rounds of differentiation enabling the parasite to progress through the fly
