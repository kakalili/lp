in vitro and in silico design of   antitrypsin mutants with different conformational stabilities
antitrypsin a protein belonging to the serine protease inhibitor serpin superfamily is characterized by the ability to undergo dramatic conformational changes leading to inactive polymers serpin polymerization which causes a range of diseases such as emphysema thrombosis and dementia occurs through a process in which the reactive center loop residues of one serpin molecule insert into the a  sheet of another popmusic a program that uses database derived mean force potentials to predict changes in folding free energy resulting from single site mutations was used to modulate rationally the polymerization propensity of   antitrypsin this was accomplished by generating mutants with a stabilized active form and destabilized polymerized form or the converse of these mutants five were expressed and characterized experimentally in agreement with the predictions three of them k  f k  i and k  v were shown to stabilize the active form and decrease the polymerization rate and one of them s  r to destabilize the active form and to increase polymerization only one mutant k  t did not display the expected behavior thus strikingly the adjacent positions   and   which are located at the beginning of the  strand next to the additionally inserted  strand in the polymerized form have opposite effects on the conformational change these residues therefore appear to play a key role in inducing or preventing such conformational change
