the g quadruplex specific rna helicase dhx  regulates p  pre mrna   end processing following uv induced dna damage
pre mrna   end processing the process through which almost all eukaryotic mrnas acquire a poly a tail is generally inhibited during the cellular dna damage response leading to a profound impact on the level of protein expression since unprocessed transcripts at the   end will be degraded or unable to be transported to the cytoplasm however a compensatory mechanism involving the binding of the hnrnp h f family of rna binding proteins to an rna g quadruplex g  structure located in the vicinity of a polyadenylation site has previously been described to allow the transcript encoding the p  tumour suppressor protein to be properly processed during dna damage and to provide the cells with a way to react to dna damage here we report that the deah asp glu ala his box rna helicase dhx  rhau g r  which specifically binds to and resolves parallel stranded g  is necessary to maintain p  pre mrna   end processing following uv induced dna damage dhx  binds to the p  rna g  while mutation of the g impairs the ability of dhx  to maintain pre mrna   end processing stabilization of the p  rna g with two different g ligands pnadotasq and phendc  which is expected from previous studies to prevent dhx  from binding and unwinding g s also impairs p  pre mrna   end processing following uv our work identifies dhx  as a new actor in the compensatory mechanisms that are in place to ensure that the mrnas encoding p  are still processed following uv
