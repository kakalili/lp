thermodynamically stable aggregation resistant antibody domains through directed evolution
protein aggregates are usually formed by interactions between unfolded or partially unfolded species and often occur when a protein is denatured by for example heat or low ph in earlier work we used a darwinian selection strategy to create human antibody variable domains that resisted heat aggregation the repertoires of domains were displayed on filamentous phage and denatured at    c in ph    and folded domains were selected by binding to a generic ligand after cooling this process appeared to select for domains with denatured states that resisted aggregation but the domains only had low free energies of folding  gn  do     kj mol at    c in ph    here using the same phage repertoire we have extended the method to the selection of domains resistant to acid aggregation in this case however the thermodynamic stabilities of selected domains were higher than those selected by thermal denaturation under both neutral and acidic conditions  gn  do     kj mol at    c in ph    or  gn  do     kj mol in ph    furthermore we identified a key determinant arg  that increased the aggregation resistance of the denatured states of the domains at low ph without compromising their thermodynamic stabilities thus the selection process yielded domains that combined thermodynamic stability and aggregation resistant unfolded states we suggest that changes to these properties are controlled by the extent to which the folding equilibrium is displaced during the process of selection
