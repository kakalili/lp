trpm regulates myosin iia filament stability and protein localization by heavy chain phosphorylation
deregulation of myosin ii based contractility contributes to the pathogenesis of human diseases such as cancer which underscores the necessity for tight spatial and temporal control of myosin ii activity recently we demonstrated that activation of the mammalian  kinase trpm inhibits myosin ii based contractility in a ca  and kinase dependent manner however the molecular mechanism is poorly defined here we demonstrate that trpm phosphorylates the cooh termini of both mouse and human myosin iia heavy chains  the cooh terminus being a region that is critical for filament stability phosphorylated residues were mapped to thr   ser   and ser   mutation of these residues to alanine and that to aspartic acid lead to an increase and a decrease respectively in myosin iia incorporation into the actomyosin cytoskeleton and accordingly affect subcellular localization in conclusion our data demonstrate that trpm regulates myosin iia filament stability and localization by phosphorylating a short stretch of amino acids within the  helical tail of the myosin iia heavy chain
