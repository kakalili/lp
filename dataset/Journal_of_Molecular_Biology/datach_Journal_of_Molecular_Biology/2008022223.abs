molecular characterization of two homologs of the caenorhabditis elegans cadmium responsive gene cdr  cdr  and cdr
a novel cadmium inducible gene cdr  was previously identified and characterized in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans and found to mediate resistance to cadmium toxicity subsequently six homologs of cdr  were identified in c elegans here we describe two homologs cdr  which is metal inducible and cdr  which is noninducible both cdr  and cdr  mrnas contain open reading frames of   nt and encode predicted  kda integral membrane proteins which are similar to cdr  cdr  expression is induced by arsenic cadmium mercury and zinc exposure as well as by hypotonic stress in contrast cdr  is constitutively expressed at a high level in c elegans and expression is not affected by these stressors both cdr  and cdr  are transcribed in postembryonic pharyngeal and intestinal cells in c elegans in addition cdr  is transcribed in developing embryos like cdr  cdr  is targeted to intestinal cell lysosomes in vivo inhibition of cdr  and or cdr  expression does not render c elegans more susceptible to cadmium toxicity however there is a significant decrease in their lifespan in the absence of metal although nematodes in which cdr  and or cdr  expression is knocked down accumulate fluid in the pseudocoelomic space exposure to hypertonic conditions did not significantly affect growth or reproduction in these nematodes these results suggest that cdr expression is required for optimal viability but does not function in osmoregulation
