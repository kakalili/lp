a conformational switch in the ligand binding domain regulates the dependence of the glucocorticoid receptor on hsp
steroid hormone receptors srs are transcription factors that act as regulatory switches by altering gene expression in response to ligands the highly conserved ligand binding domain of srs is a precise but versatile molecular switch that can adopt distinct conformations differential stabilization of these conformations by ligands dna response elements and transcriptional coregulators controls the activity of srs in a gene specific and cell specific manner in the case of the glucocorticoid receptor gr  high affinity ligand binding requires the interaction of the lbd with the heat shock protein   hsp   here we show that the dependence of the ligand binding ability of gr on hsp  can be modified by the replacement of single amino acids within an allosteric network that connects the buried ligand binding pocket and a solvent exposed coregulator interaction surface each of the identified mutations altered the equilibrium between alternative gr conformations distinctively indicating that the hsp  dependence of srs may correlate with differences in the conformational dynamics of these receptors our results suggest that hsp  stabilizes the gr ligand binding pocket indirectly by utilizing the allosteric network while allowing the receptor to remain structurally uncommitted thus in addition to ensuring the accessibility of the gr ligand binding pocket to ligands hsp  seems to enable hormones and coregulators to act as allosteric effectors which forms the basis for gene specific and cell specific responses of gr to ligands
