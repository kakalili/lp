characterization of mutations in not indicates that it plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the ccr  not complex
the not protein is a component of the ccr  not complex that plays multiple roles in the regulation of mrna production in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae we have identified four novel not mutations and have characterized these and two previously described alleles as to the means by which they affect ccr  not function while two of the not alleles not   carrying a g r alteration and not  l p resulted in severe growth defects and caused a not phenotype at the his locus these phenotypes appear to arise from partially different effects the not  l p mutation resulted in complete loss of the     da   mda ccr  not complex and the not  l p protein displayed increased ability to associate with the not protein in contrast the not  allele destabilized the ccr  not complex to a lesser extent and had no effect on not association with not  instead as previously reported it displayed defective interactions with ada  a component of the saga complex the not  r  g also abrogated not ability to interact with ada but had little effect on the integrity of the ccr  not complex alterations in not contacts to ada  therefore do not necessarily result in effects on the ccr  not complex nor result in severe growth defects we also observed that the four not n terminal mutations affected not association with the ccr  not complexes suggesting that it is the n terminus of not that contacts and stabilizes not interactions these results indicate that it is the loss of the integrity of the ccr  not complex which leads to severe not phenotypes and that the not contacts to ada play a lesser role in not function
