structural analysis of a novel class of r  m controller proteins c csp  i from citrobacter sp rfl
controller proteins play a key role in the temporal regulation of gene expression in bacterial restriction  modification r  m systems and are important mediators of horizontal gene transfer they form the basis of a highly cooperative concentration dependent genetic switch involved in both activation and repression of r  m genes here we present biophysical biochemical and high resolution structural analysis of a novel class of controller proteins exemplified by c csp  i in contrast to all previously solved c protein structures each protein subunit has two extra helices at the c terminus which play a large part in maintaining the dimer interface the dna binding site of the protein is also novel having largely aaaa tracts between the palindromic recognition half sites suggesting tight bending of the dna the protein structure shows an unusual positively charged surface that could form the basis for wrapping the dna completely around the c protein dimer
