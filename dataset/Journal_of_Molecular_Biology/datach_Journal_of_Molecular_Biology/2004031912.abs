crystal structures of the catalytic domain of phosphodiesterase b complexed with amp  br amp and rolipram
phosphodiesterase catalyzes the hydrolysis of the intracellular second messenger      cyclic amp camp into the corresponding   nucleotide phosphodiesterase  pde  the major camp specific pde in inflammatory and immune cells is an attractive target for the treatment of asthma and copd we have determined crystal structures of the catalytic domain of pde b complexed with amp      br amp     and the potent inhibitor rolipram     all the ligands bind in the same hydrophobic pocket and can interact directly with the active site metal ions the identity of these metal ions was examined using x ray anomalous difference data the structure of the amp complex confirms the location of the catalytic site and allowed us to speculate about the detailed mechanism of catalysis the high resolution structures provided the experimental insight into the nucleotide selectivity of phosphodiesterase  br amp binds in the syn conformation to the enzyme and demonstrates an alternative nucleotide binding mode rolipram occupies much of the amp binding site and forms two hydrogen bonds with gln  similar to the nucleotides
