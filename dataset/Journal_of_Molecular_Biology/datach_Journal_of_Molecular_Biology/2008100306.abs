truncated cockayne syndrome b protein represses elongation by rna polymerase i
mutations in the cockayne syndrome b csb gene result in the human form of cockayne syndrome csb protein has been shown to be a component of rna polymerase i pol i transcription in this study we have analyzed at which step of the transcription cycle csb influences in vitro transcription by rna pol i we demonstrate that csb stimulates elongation of rna pol i in an atp independent manner moreover csb can be cross linked to the rdna promoter and gene internal sequences partial deletion mutants of csb strongly repress pol i in vitro transcription indicating an inhibitory function of truncated csb in addition evidence that mutant csb inhibits the elongation step of pol i transcription is presented lack of csb expression does not impair pol i transcription showing that csb is not essential for ribosomal transcription our results implicate that repressed pol i transcription could be one factor contributing to the cockayne syndrome phenotype
