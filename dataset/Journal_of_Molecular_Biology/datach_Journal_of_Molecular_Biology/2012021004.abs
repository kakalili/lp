the transition of human estrogen sulfotransferase from generalist to specialist using directed enzyme evolution
broad specificity is believed to be a property of primordial enzymes that diverged during natural protein evolution to produce highly specific and efficient enzymes human estrogen sulfotransferase sult e  is a broad specificity enzyme that detoxifies a variety of chemicals including estrogens by the transfer of sulfate to study the molecular basis for the broad specificity of this enzyme and to investigate the process of sult e specialization we have adopted a directed enzyme evolution approach using two iterative rounds of evolution we generated sult e mutants with increased thermostability and narrower specificity from the broadly specific wild type enzyme to identify mutants with enhanced specificity we developed an unbiased screening assay to assess sulfate transfer to three different acceptors in parallel such an assay enabled the isolation of sult e mutants with enhanced or wild type activity toward an estrogen acceptor and significantly reduced activity for phenol or coumarin type of acceptors leading to up to  orders of magnitude increase in specificity we found that mutations conferring novel specificity are located in the vicinity of the active site and thus may play a direct role in reshaping the acceptor binding site finally such mutations resulted in reduced sult e thermostability revealing a trade off between sult e thermostability and acquisition of novel function
