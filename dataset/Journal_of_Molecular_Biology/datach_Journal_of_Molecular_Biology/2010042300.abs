cysteine as a modulator residue in the active site of xenobiotic reductase a a structural thermodynamic and kinetic study
xenobiotic reductase a xena from pseudomonas putida  catalyzes the nadh nadph dependent reduction of various substrates including  cyclohexenone and  hydroxycoumarin xena is a member of the old yellow enzyme oye family of flavoproteins and is structurally and functionally similar to other bacterial members of this enzyme class a characteristic feature of xena is the presence of a cysteine residue cys  in the active site where in most members of the oye family a threonine residue is found that modulates the reduction potential of the fmn fmnh  couple we investigated the role of cys  by studying two variants in which the residue has been exchanged for a serine and an alanine residue while the exchange against alanine has a remarkably small effect on the reduction potential the reactivity and the structure of xena the exchange against serine increases the reduction potential by   mv increases the rate constant of the reductive half reaction and decreases the rate constant in the oxidative half reaction we determined six crystal structures at high to true atomic resolution dmin         of the three xena variants with and without the substrate coumarin bound in the active site the atomic resolution structure of xena in complex with coumarin reveals a compressed active site geometry in which the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between coumarin and the protein backbone the structures further reveal that the conformation of the active site and substrate interactions are preserved in the two variants indicating that the observed changes are due to local effects only we propose that cys  and the residues in its place determine which of the two half reactions is rate limiting depending on the substrate couple this might help to explain why the genome of pseudomonas putida encodes multiple xenobiotic reductases containing either cysteine threonine or alanine in the active site
