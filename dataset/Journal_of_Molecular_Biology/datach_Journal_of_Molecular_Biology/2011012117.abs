stabilizing the eif g   helix increases its binding affinity with eif e implications for peptidomimetic design strategies
eukaryotic initiation factor eif e is overexpressed in many types of cancer such as breast head and neck and lung a consequence of increased levels of eif e is the preferential translation of pro tumorigenic proteins such as c myc cyclin d  and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition of eif e is therefore a potential therapeutic target for human cancers a novel peptide based on the eif e binding peptide eif g  where the  helix was stabilized by the inclusion of  helix inducers as shown by cd measurements was synthesized the helically stabilized peptide binds with an apparent kd of       nm which is     fold more potent than the template peptide from which it is designed the helically stabilized peptide showed significant biological activity at a concentration of    m unlike the naturally occurring eifg peptide when measured in cell based cap dependent translational reporter and wst      iodophenyl    nitrophenyl  h  tetrazolio   benzene disulfonate assays fusion of the template peptide and the stabilized peptide to the cell penetrating peptide tat produced more active but equally potent inhibitors of cap dependent translation in cell lines they also equally disrupted cell metabolism as measured in a wst  assay propidium iodide staining revealed that the tat fused helically stabilized peptide caused more cell death than the tat fused eif g template peptide with substantial decreases in the g and g cell populations annexin staining experiments also indicated that the tat fused eif g derivative peptides caused cell death by apoptosis the results presented should offer further insight into peptidomimetics development for eif e
