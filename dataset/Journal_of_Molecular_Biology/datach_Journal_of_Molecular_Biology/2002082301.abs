mutational analysis of the uracil dna glycosylase inhibitor protein and its interaction with escherichia coli uracil dna glycosylase
uracil dna glycosylase inhibitor ugi  a protein of  kda consists of a five stranded antiparallel  sheet flanked on either side by single  helices forms an exclusive complex with uracil dna glycosylases udgs that is stable in m urea we report on the mutational analysis of various structural elements in ugi two of which hydrophobic pocket and the   edge establish key interactions with escherichia coli udg the point mutations in helix   amino acid residues     do not affect the stability of the udg  ugi complexes in urea and while the complex of the  n  mutant with udg is stable in only   m urea its overall structure and thermostability are maintained the identity of p  stacked between p  and w  was not important for the maintenance of the hydrophobic pocket or for the stability of the complex however the m k mutation at the rim of the hydrophobic pocket lowered the stability of the complex in m urea on the other hand non conservative mutations e g d g cancels the only ionic interaction with udg and n k in three of the loops connecting the  strands conferred no such phenotype the l r and s p mutations   edge at the udg  ugi interface and the n d mutation far from the interface resulted in poor stability of the complex however the stability of the complexes was restored in the l a s t and n a mutations these analyses and the studies on the exchange of ugi mutants in preformed complexes with the substrate or the native ugi have provided insights into the two step mechanism of udg  ugi complex formation finally we discuss the application of the ugi isolates in overproduction of udg mutants toxic to cells
