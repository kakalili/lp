helix packing moments reveal diversity and conservation in membrane protein structure
helical membrane proteins are more tightly packed and the packing interactions are more diverse than those found in helical soluble proteins based on a linear correlation between amino acid packing values and interhelical propensity we propose the concept of a helix packing moment to predict the orientation of helices in helical membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes we show that the helix packing moment correlates with the helix interfaces of helix dimers of single pass membrane proteins of known structure helix packing moments are also shown to help identify the packing interfaces in membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane helices where a single helix can have multiple contact surfaces analyses are described on class a g protein coupled receptors gpcrs with seven transmembrane helices we show that the helix packing moments are conserved across the class a family of gpcrs and correspond to key structural contacts in rhodopsin these contacts are distinct from the highly conserved signature motifs of gpcrs and have not previously been recognized the specific amino acid types involved in these contacts however are not necessarily conserved between subfamilies of gpcrs indicating that the same protein architecture can be supported by a diverse set of interactions in gpcrs as well as membrane channels and transporters amino acid residues with small side chains gly ala ser cys allow tight helix packing by mediating strong van der waals interactions between helices closely packed helices in turn facilitate interhelical hydrogen bonding of both weakly polar ser thr cys and strongly polar asn gln glu asp his arg lys amino acid residues we propose the use of the helix packing moment as a complementary tool to the helical hydrophobic moment in the analysis of transmembrane sequences
