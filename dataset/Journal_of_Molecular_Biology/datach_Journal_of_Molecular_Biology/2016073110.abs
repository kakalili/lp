an aromatic cap seals the substrate binding site in an ecf type s subunit for riboflavin
ecf transporters are a family of active membrane transporters for essential micronutrients such as vitamins and trace metals found exclusively in archaea and bacteria these transporters are composed of four subunits an integral membrane substrate binding subunit ecfs  a transmembrane coupling subunit ecft  and two atp binding cassette atpases ecfa and ecfa   we have characterized the structural basis of substrate binding by the ecfs subunit for riboflavin from thermotoga maritima tmribu tmribu binds riboflavin with high affinity and the protein  substrate complex is exceptionally stable in solution the crystal structure of riboflavin bound tmribu reveals an electronegative binding pocket at the extracellular surface in which the substrate is completely buried analysis of the intermolecular contacts indicates that nearly every available substrate hydrogen bond is satisfied a conserved aromatic residue at the extracellular end of tm  tyr   caps the binding site to generate a substrate bound occluded state and non conservative mutation of tyr  reduces the stability of this conformation using a novel fluorescence binding assay we find that an aromatic residue at this position is essential for high affinity substrate binding comparison with other s subunit structures suggests that tm and loop  contain a dynamic conserved motif that plays a key role in gating substrate entry and release by s subunits of ecf transporters
