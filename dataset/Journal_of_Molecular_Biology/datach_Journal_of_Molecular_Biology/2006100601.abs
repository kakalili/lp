crystal structures of human tissue kallikrein  activity modulation by a specific zinc binding site
human tissue kallikrein  hk  belongs to a  member family of closely related serine proteinases hk is predominantly expressed in prostate activates hk psa and is up regulated in prostate and ovarian cancer we have identified active monomers of recombinant hk besides inactive oligomers in solution hk crystallised in the presence of zinc nickel and cobalt ions in three crystal forms containing cyclic tetramers and octamers these structures display a novel metal site between his  and glu  that links the     loop with the n terminal segment micromolar zinc as present in prostatic fluid inhibits the enzymatic activity of hk against fluorogenic substrates in our measurements wild type hk exhibited a zinc inhibition constant ic  of    m including a permanent residual activity in contrast to the zinc independent mutants h a and e a since the ile  n terminus of wild type hk becomes more accessible for acetylating agents in the presence of zinc we propose that zinc affects the hk active site via the salt bridge formed between the n terminus and asp  required for a functional active site hk possesses an unusual  loop that creates a groove like acidic s subsite these findings explain the observed specificity of hk for the p to p substrate residues moreover hk shows a negatively charged surface patch which may represent an exosite for prime side substrate recognition
