is polyproline ii helix the killer conformation a raman optical activity study of the amyloidogenic prefibrillar intermediate of human lysozyme edited by a r fersht
the amyloidogenic prefibrillar partially denatured intermediate of human lysozyme prepared by heating the native protein to   c at ph   was studied using raman optical activity roa  a positive band in the room temperature roa spectrum of the native protein at     cm   assigned to a hydrated form of  helix is not present in that of the prefibrillar intermediate where a new strong positive band at     cm   appears instead that is assigned to the poly l proline ii ppii helical conformation a sharp negative band at     cm   in the native protein assigned to  strand shows little change in the roa spectrum of the prefibrillar intermediate the disappearance of a positive roa band at     cm   assigned to vibrations of tryptophan side chains indicates that major conformational changes have occurred among the five tryptophan residues present in human lysozyme four of which are located in the  domain the various roa data suggest that a substantial loss of tertiary structure has occurred in the prefibrillar intermediate and that this is located more in the  domain than in the  domain there is no evidence for any increase in  structure the roa spectrum of hen lysozyme which does not form amyloid fibrils so readily remains much more native like on heating to   c at ph   the thermal behaviour of the alanine rich  helical peptide ak  in aqueous solution was found to be similar to that of human lysozyme hydrated  helix therefore appears to readily undergo a conformational change to ppii structure on heating which may be a key step in the conversion of  helix into  sheet in the formation of amyloid fibrils in human lysozyme since it is extended flexible lacks intrachain hydrogen bonds and is fully hydrated in aqueous solution ppii helix has the appropriate characteristics to be implicated as a critical conformational element in many conformational diseases disorder of the ppii type may be a sine qua non for the formation of regular fibrils whereas the more dynamic disorder of the random coil may lead only to amorphous aggregates
