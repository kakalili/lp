the solution nmr structure of antheraea polyphemus pbp provides new insight into pheromone recognition by pheromone binding proteins
pheromone binding proteins pbps located in the antennae of male moth species play an important role in olfaction they are carrier proteins believed to transport volatile hydrophobic pheromone molecules across the aqueous sensillar lymph to the membrane bound g protein coupled olfactory receptor proteins the roles of pbps in molecular recognition and the mechanisms of pheromone binding and release are poorly understood here we report the nmr structure of a pbp from the giant silk moth antheraea polyphemus this is the first structure of a pbp with specific acetate binding function in vivo the protein consists of nine  helices   a residues      b       c               a        b                     and         held together by three disulfide bridges          and      a large hydrophobic cavity is located inside the protein lined with side chains from all nine helices the acetate binding site is located at the narrow end of the cavity formed by the helices  b and   the pheromone can enter this cavity through an opening between the helix  a the c terminal end of the helix   and the loop between   and  a we suggest that trp  may play an important role in the initial interaction with the ligand our analysis also shows that asn  plays the key role in recognition of acetate pheromones specifically while phe  phe  trp  phe  and phe  are responsible for non specific binding and leu and ser may play a role in ligand chain length recognition
