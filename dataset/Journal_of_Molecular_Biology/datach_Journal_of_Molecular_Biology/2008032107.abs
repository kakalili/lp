analysis of spontaneous gene conversion tracts within and between mammalian chromosomes
in the present study we report the first characterization of gene conversion tract length continuity and fidelity for pathways of gene targeting ectopic and intrachromosomal homologous recombination using the same locus and mammalian somatic cell type in this isogenic cell system the vast majority of recombinants  gt   are generated by homologous recombination and display a high degree of fidelity in the gene conversion process individual gene conversion tracts are highly likely to involve single independent recombination events and proceed through a heteroduplex dna intermediate in all recombination pathways gene conversion tracts are long extending up to    kb most gene conversion tracts are continuous in favor of donor region sequences but in a small fraction of recombinants    discontinuous gene conversion tracts are observed in most cases the recombination donor sequence is unaltered although in two cases of intrachromosomal recombination both recombination donor and recipient sequences bear gene conversion tracts overall gene conversion events are similar both qualitatively and quantitatively for homologous recombination within and between mammalian chromosomes
