structure of a gdp alf complex of the srp gtpases ffh and ftsy and identification of a peripheral nucleotide interaction site
the signal recognition particle srp gtpases ffh and ftsy play a central role in co translational targeting of proteins assembling in a gtp dependent manner to generate the srp targeting complex at the membrane a suite of residues in ftsy have been identified that are essential for the hydrolysis of gtp that accompanies disengagement we have argued previously on structural grounds that this region mediates interactions that serve to activate the complex for disengagement and term it the activation region we report here the structure of a complex of the srp gtpases formed in the presence of gdp alf  this complex accommodates the putative transition state analog without undergoing significant change from the structure of the ground state complex formed in the presence of the gtp analog gmppcp however small shifts that do occur within the shared catalytic chamber may be functionally important remarkably an external nucleotide interaction site was identified at the activation region revealed by an unexpected contaminating gmp molecule bound adjacent to the catalytic chamber this site exhibits conserved sequence and structural features that suggest a direct interaction with rna plays a role in regulating the activity of the srp targeting complex
