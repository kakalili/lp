deep sequencing of systematic combinatorial libraries reveals  lactamase sequence constraints at high resolution
in this study combinatorial libraries were used in conjunction with ultrahigh throughput sequencing to comprehensively determine the impact of each of the  possible amino acid substitutions at each residue position in the tem   lactamase enzyme the libraries were introduced into escherichia coli and mutants were selected for ampicillin resistance the selected colonies were pooled and subjected to ultrahigh throughput sequencing to reveal the sequence preferences at each position the depth of sequencing provided a clear statistically significant picture of what amino acids are favored for ampicillin hydrolysis for all   positions of the enzyme in one experiment although the enzyme is generally tolerant of amino acid substitutions several surface positions far from the active site are sensitive to substitutions suggesting a role for these residues in enzyme stability solubility or catalysis in addition information on the frequency of substitutions was used to identify mutations that increase enzyme thermodynamic stability finally a comparison of sequence requirements based on the mutagenesis results versus those inferred from sequence conservation in an alignment of   class a  lactamases reveals significant differences in that several residues in tem  do not tolerate substitutions and yet extensive variation is observed in the alignment and vice versa an analysis of the tem  and other class a structures suggests that residues that vary in the alignment may nevertheless make unique but important interactions within individual enzymes
