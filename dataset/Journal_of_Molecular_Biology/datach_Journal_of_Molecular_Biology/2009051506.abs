structural basis for the activation of muscle contraction by troponin and tropomyosin
the molecular regulation of striated muscle contraction couples the binding and dissociation of ca  on troponin tn to the movement of tropomyosin on actin filaments in turn this process exposes or blocks myosin binding sites on actin thereby controlling myosin crossbridge dynamics and consequently muscle contraction using d electron microscopy we recently provided structural evidence that a c terminal extension of tni is anchored on actin at low ca  and competes with tropomyosin for a common site to drive tropomyosin to the b state location a constrained relaxing position on actin that inhibits myosin crossbridge association here we show that release of this constraint at high ca  allows a second segment of troponin probably representing parts of tnt or the troponin core domain to promote tropomyosin movement on actin to the ca  induced c state location with tropomyosin stabilized in this position myosin binding interactions can begin tropomyosin appears to oscillate to a higher degree between respective b and c state positions on troponin free filaments than on fully regulated filaments suggesting that tropomyosin positioning in both states is troponin dependent by biasing tropomyosin to either of these two positions troponin appears to have two distinct structural functions in relaxed muscles at low ca  troponin operates as an inhibitor while in activated muscles at high ca  it acts as a promoter to initiate contraction
