full length structures of benm and two variants reveal different oligomerization schemes for lysr type transcriptional regulators
benm a lysr type transcriptional regulator lttr from the bacterium acinetobacter baylyi responds synergistically to benzoate and cis cis muconate with these effectors benm activates gene expression during benzoate consumption without effectors benm represses transcription here x ray crystallography was used to determine the full length structures of benm and two variants that activate transcription without benzoate or cis cis muconate benm r  h and benm e  k  previous studies indicate that these regulators function as tetramers here interconnections between subunits in the crystals prevented the formation of a closed oligomer and highlighted the inherent flexibility of this multidomain regulator nevertheless analysis of subunit interfaces suggested the functional significance of key interactions the structures of benm and its variants were nearly identical implying that transcriptional differences rely on factors beyond major conformational changes defined solely by sequence comparisons of benm with other lttrs including unpublished structures in the protein data bank revealed extensive variation in the relative orientations of dna binding domains dbds and effector binding domains ebds  to form dimers different lttrs used similar interfaces between two ebds each containing two subdomains ebd i and ebd ii surprisingly the dimers used three substantially different schemes to form higher order oligomers in one scheme used by benm oligomer assembly involved contacts between the ebd ii regions and the dbd regions of adjacent subunits in another scheme there were no contacts between the ebds only the dbds were involved in tetramer formation in the third scheme the oligomer interface involved dbd and ebd i ebd ii contacts these diverse schemes demonstrate novel variation in the oligomeric structures of individual lttrs within this large and important family
