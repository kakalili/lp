p  blocks ruvab promoted branch migration and modulates resolution of holliday junctions by ruvc edited by m gottesman
the holliday junction is the central intermediate in homologous recombination branch migration of this four stranded dna structure is a key step in genetic recombination that affects the extent of genetic information exchanged between two parental dna molecules here we have constructed synthetic holliday junctions to test the effects of p  on both spontaneous and ruvab promoted branch migration as well as the effect on resolution of the junction by ruvc we demonstrate that p  blocks branch migration and that cleavage of the holliday junction by ruvc is modulated by p  these findings suggest that p  can block branch migration promoted by proteins such as ruvab and modulate the cleavage by holliday junction resolution proteins such as ruvc these results suggest that p  could have similar effects on eukaryotic homologues of ruvabc and thus have a direct role in recombinational dna repair
