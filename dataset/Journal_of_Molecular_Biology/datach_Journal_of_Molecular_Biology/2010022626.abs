the electrostatics of vdac implications for selectivity and gating
the voltage dependent anion channel vdac is the major pathway mediating the transfer of metabolites and ions across the mitochondrial outer membrane two hallmarks of the channel in the open state are high metabolite flux and anion selectivity while the partially closed state blocks metabolites and is cation selective here we report the results from electrostatics calculations carried out on the recently determined high resolution structure of murine vdac  mvdac  poisson  boltzmann calculations show that the ion transfer free energy through the channel is favorable for anions suggesting that mvdac represents the open state this claim is buttressed by poisson  nernst  planck calculations that predict a high single channel conductance indicative of the open state and an anion selectivity of    nearly a twofold selectivity for anions over cations these calculations were repeated on mutant channels and gave selectivity changes in accord with experimental observations we were then able to engineer an in silico mutant channel with three point mutations that converted mvdac into a channel with a preference for cations finally we investigated two proposals for how the channel gates between the open and the closed state both models involve the movement of the n terminal helix but neither motion produced the observed voltage sensitivity nor did either model result in a cation selective channel which is observed experimentally thus we were able to rule out certain models for channel gating but the true motion has yet to be determined
