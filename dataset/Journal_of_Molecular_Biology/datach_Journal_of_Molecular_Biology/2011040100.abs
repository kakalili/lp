structures of iron dependent alcohol dehydrogenase  from zymomonas mobilis zm with and without nad cofactor
the ethanologenic bacterium zymomonas mobilis zm is of special interest because it has a high ethanol yield this is made possible by the two alcohol dehydrogenases adhs present in z mobilis zm  zmadhs  which shift the equilibrium of the reaction toward the synthesis of ethanol they are metal dependent enzymes zinc for zmadh and iron for zmadh  however zmadh is inactivated by oxygen thus implicating zmadh as the component of the cytosolic respiratory system in z mobilis here we show crystal structures of zmadh in the form of an apo enzyme and an nad  cofactor complex the overall folding of the monomeric structure is very similar to those of other functionally related adhs with structural variations around the probable substrate and nad cofactor binding region a dimeric structure is formed by the limited interactions between the two subunits with the bound nad at the cleft formed along the domain interface the catalytic iron ion binds near to the nicotinamide ring of nad  which is likely to restrict and locate the ethanol to the active site together with the oxidized cys residue and several nonpolar bulky residues the structures of the zmadh from the proficient ethanologenic bacterium z mobilis with and without nad cofactor and modeling ethanol in the active site imply that there is a typical metal dependent catalytic mechanism
