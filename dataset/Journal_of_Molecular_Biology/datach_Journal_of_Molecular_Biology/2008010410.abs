how do chemical denaturants affect the mechanical folding and unfolding of proteins
we present the first single molecule atomic force microscopy study on the effect of chemical denaturants on the mechanical folding unfolding kinetics of a small protein gb  the b immunoglobulin binding domain of protein g from streptococcus  upon increasing the concentration of the chemical denaturant guanidinium chloride gdmcl  we observed a systematic decrease in the mechanical stability of gb  indicating the softening effect of the chemical denaturant on the mechanical stability of proteins this mechanical softening effect originates from the reduced free energy barrier between the folded state and the unfolding transition state which decreases linearly as a function of the denaturant concentration chemical denaturants however do not alter the mechanical unfolding pathway or shift the position of the transition state for mechanical unfolding we also found that the folding rate constant of gb is slowed down by gdmcl in mechanical folding experiments by combining the mechanical folding unfolding kinetics of gb in gdmcl solution we developed the  mechanical chevron plot  as a general tool to understand how chemical denaturants influence the mechanical folding unfolding kinetics and free energy diagram in a quantitative fashion this study demonstrates great potential in combining chemical denaturation with single molecule atomic force microscopy techniques to reveal invaluable information on the energy landscape underlying protein folding unfolding reactions
