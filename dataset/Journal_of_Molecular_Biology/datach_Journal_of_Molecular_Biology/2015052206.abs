yeast rvb and rvb proteins oligomerize as a conformationally variable dodecamer with low frequency
rvb and rvb are conserved aaa  atpases associated with diverse cellular activities proteins found at the core of large multicomponent complexes that play key roles in chromatin remodeling integrity of the telomeres ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis and other essential cellular processes these proteins contain an aaa domain for atp binding and hydrolysis and an insertion domain proposed to bind dna rna yeast rvb and rvb proteins oligomerize primarily as heterohexameric rings the six aaa core domains form the body of the ring and the insertion domains protrude from one face of the ring conversely human rvbs form a mixture of hexamers and dodecamers made of two stacked hexamers interacting through the insertion domains human dodecamers adopt either a contracted or a stretched conformation here we found that yeast rvb rvb complexes when assembled in vivo mainly form hexamers but they also assemble as dodecamers with a frequency lower than   yeast dodecamers adopt not only the stretched and contracted structures that have been described for human rvb rvb dodecamers but also intermediate conformations in between these two extreme states the orientation of the insertion domains of rvb and rvb proteins in these conformers changes as the dodecamer transitions from the stretched structure to a more contracted structure finally we observed that for the yeast proteins oligomerization as a dodecamer inhibits the atpase activity of the rvb rvb complex these results indicate that although human and yeast rvb and rvb proteins share high degree of homology there are significant differences in their oligomeric behavior and dynamics
