projection structure of dtpd ybgh  a prokaryotic member of the peptide transporter family
cellular uptake of di and tripeptides has been characterized in numerous organisms and various transporters have been identified in contrast structural information on peptide transporters is very sparse here we have cloned overexpressed purified and biochemically characterized dtpd ybgh from escherichia coli a prokaryotic member of the peptide transporter family its homologues in mammals pept  slc a  and pept  slc a  not only transport peptides but also are of relevance for uptake of drugs as they accept a large spectrum of peptidomimetics such as  lactam antibiotics antivirals peptidase inhibitors and others as substrates uptake experiments indicated that dtpd functions as a canonical peptide transporter and is therefore a valid model for structural studies of this family of proteins blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel filtration and transmission electron microscopy of single dtpd particles suggest that the transporter exists in a monomeric form when solubilized in detergent two dimensional crystallization of dtpd yielded first tubular crystals that allowed the determination of a projection structure at better than    resolution this structure of dtpd represents the first structural view of a member of the peptide transporter family
