structure of native and expanded sobemoviruses by electron cryo microscopy and image reconstruction edited by w baumeister
rice yellow mottle virus rymv and southern bean mosaic virus cowpea strain scpmv are members of the sobemovirus genus of rna containing viruses we used electron cryo microscopy cryo em and icosahedral image analysis to examine the native structures of these two viruses at    resolution both viruses have a single tightly packed capsid layer with   subunits assembled on a t  icosahedral lattice distinctive crown like pentamers emanate from the   fold axes of symmetry the exterior face of scpmv displays deep valleys along the  fold axes and protrusions at the quasi  fold axes while having a similar topography the surface of rymv is comparatively smooth two concentric shells of density reside beneath the capsid layer of rymv and scpmv which we interpret as ordered regions of genomic rna in the presence of divalent cations scpmv particles swell and fracture whereas the expanded form of rymv is stable we previously proposed that the cell to cell movement of rymv in xylem involves chelation of ca  from pit membranes of infected cells thereby stabilizing the capsid shells and allowing a pathway for spread of rymv through destabilized membranes in the context of this model we propose that the expanded form of rymv is an intermediate in the in vivo assembly of virions
