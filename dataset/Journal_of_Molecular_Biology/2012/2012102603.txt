Mutations in the second EF-hand (D61N, D63N, D65N, and E72A) of S100B were used to study its Ca2+ binding and dynamic properties in the absence and presence of a bound target, TRTK-12. With D63NS100B as an exception (D63NKD=50±9μM), Ca2+ binding to EF2-hand mutants were reduced by more than 8-fold in the absence of TRTK-12 (D61NKD=412±67μM, D65NKD=968±171μM, and E72AKD=471±133μM), when compared to wild-type protein (WTKD=56±9μM). For the TRTK-12 complexes, the Ca2+-binding affinity to wild type (WT+TRTKKD=12±10μM) and the EF2 mutants was increased by 5- to 14-fold versus in the absence of target (D61N+TRTKKD=29±1.2μM, D63N+TRTKKD=10±2.2μM, D65N+TRTKKD=73±4.4μM, and E72A+TRTKKD=18±3.7μM). In addition, Rex, as measured using relaxation dispersion for side‐chain 15N resonances of Asn63 (D63NS100B), was reduced upon TRTK-12 binding when measured by NMR. Likewise, backbone motions on multiple timescales (picoseconds to milliseconds) throughout wild type, D61NS100B, D63NS100B, and D65NS100B were lowered upon binding TRTK-12. However, the X-ray structures of Ca2+-bound (2.0Å) and TRTK-bound (1.2Å) D63NS100B showed no change in Ca2+ coordination; thus, these and analogous structural data for the wild-type protein could not be used to explain how target binding increased Ca2+-binding affinity in solution. Therefore, a model for how S100B–TRTK‐12 complex formation increases Ca2+ binding is discussed, which considers changes in protein dynamics upon binding the target TRTK-12.
