structure of avian thymic hormone a high affinity avian  parvalbumin in the ca  free and ca  bound states
originally isolated on the basis of its capacity to stimulate t cell maturation and proliferation avian thymic hormone ath is nevertheless a parvalbumin one of two  lineage isoforms expressed in birds we recently learned that addition of ca  free ath to a solution of  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonate ans markedly increases ans emission this behavior not observed in the presence of ca  suggests that apolar surface area buried in the ca  bound state becomes solvent accessible upon ca  removal in order to elucidate the conformational alterations that accompany ca  binding we have obtained the solution structure of the ca  free protein using nmr spectroscopy and compared it to the ca  loaded protein solved by x ray crystallography although the metal ion binding cd  ef domains are largely coincident in the superimposed structures a major difference is observed in the ab domains the tight association of helix b with the e and f helices in the ca  bound state is lost upon removal of ca  producing a deep hydrophobic cavity the b helix also undergoes substantial rotation exposing the side chains of f  y  f  and f  to solvent presumably the increase in ans emission observed in the presence of unliganded ath reflects the interaction of these hydrophobic residues with the fluorescent probe the increased solvent exposure of apolar surface area in the ca  free protein is consistent with previously collected scanning calorimetry data which indicated an unusually low change in heat capacity upon thermal denaturation the ca  free structure also provides added insight into the magnitude of ligation linked conformational alteration compatible with a high affinity metal ion binding signature the exposure of substantial apolar surface area suggests the intriguing possibility that ath could function as a reverse ca  sensor
