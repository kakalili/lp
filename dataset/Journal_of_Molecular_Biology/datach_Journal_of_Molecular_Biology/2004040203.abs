conformational changes modulate the activity of human rad  protein
homologous recombination provides a major pathway for the repair of dna double strand breaks in mammalian cells defects in homologous recombination can lead to high levels of chromosomal translocations or deletions which may promote cell transformation and cancer development a key component of this process is rad  in comparison to reca the bacterial homologue human rad  protein exhibits low level strand exchange activity in vitro this activity can however be stimulated by the presence of high salt here we have investigated the mechanistic basis for this stimulation we show that high ionic strength favours the co aggregation of rad   single stranded dna ssdna nucleoprotein filaments with naked duplex dna to form a complex in which the search for homologous sequences takes place high ionic strength allows differential binding of rad  to ssdna and double stranded dna dsdna  such that ssdna  rad  interactions are unaffected whereas those between rad  and dsdna are destabilised most importantly high salt induces a conformational change in rad  leading to the formation of extended nucleoprotein filaments on ssdna these extended filaments mimic the active form of the escherichia coli reca  ssdna filament that exhibits efficient strand exchange activity
