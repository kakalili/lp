protein  protein and protein  dna interactions of   region  involved in transcription activation by  ci
the ci protein of bacteriophage    ci activates transcription from promoter prm through an acidic patch on the surface of its dna binding domain genetic evidence suggests that this acidic patch stimulates transcription from prm through contact with the c terminal domain region  of the   subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase here we identify two basic residues in region  of   that are critical for  ci mediated activation of transcription from prm on the basis of structural modeling we propose that one of these   residues k   facilitates the interaction between  ci and region  of   by inducing a bend in the dna upstream of the    element whereas the other r   interacts directly with a critical acidic residue within the activating patch of  ci residue r  of   has been shown to play an important role in promoter recognition our findings suggest that the r  side chain has a dual function at prm facilitating the interaction of region  with the promoter    element and participating directly in the protein  protein interaction with  ci
