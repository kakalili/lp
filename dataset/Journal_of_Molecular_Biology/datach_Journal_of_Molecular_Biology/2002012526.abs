mistranslation induced by streptomycin provokes a recabc ruvabc dependent mutator phenotype in escherichia coli cells edited by m gottesman
translational stress induced mutagenesis tsm refers to the mutator phenotype observed in escherichia coli cells expressing a mutant allele muta or mutc of the glycine trna gene glyv or glyw  because of an anticodon mutation expression of the muta allele results in low levels of asp   gly mistranslation the muta phenotype does not require lexa regulated sos mutagenesis functions and appears to be suppressed in cells defective for recabc dependent homologous recombination functions to test the hypothesis that the tsm response is mediated by non specific mistranslation rather than specific asp   gly misreading we asked if streptomycin str  an aminoglycoside antibiotic known to promote mistranslation can provoke a mutator phenotype we report that str induces a strong mutator phenotype in cells bearing certain alleles of rpsl the gene encoding s  an essential component of the ribosomal  s subunit the phenotype is strikingly similar to that observed in muta cells in its mutational specificity as well as in its requirement for recabc mediated homologous recombination functions expression of str inducible mutator phenotype correlates with mistranslation efficiency in response to str thus mistranslation in general is able to induce the tsm response the str inducible mutator phenotype described here defines a new functional class of rpsl alleles and raises interesting questions on the mechanism of action of str and on bacterial response to antibiotic stress
