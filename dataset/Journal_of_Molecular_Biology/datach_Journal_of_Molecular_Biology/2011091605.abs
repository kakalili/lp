structure guided activity restoration of the silkworm glutathione transferase omega gsto
glutathione transferases gsts are ubiquitous detoxification enzymes that conjugate hydrophobic xenobiotics with reduced glutathione the silkworm bombyx mori encodes four isoforms of gst omega gsto  featured with a catalytic cysteine except that bmgsto  has an asparagine substitution of this catalytic residue here we determined the     crystal structure of bmgsto   which shares a typical gst overall structure however the extended c terminal segment that exists in all the four bmgstos occupies the g site of bmgsto  and makes it unworkable as shown by the activity assays upon mutation of asn  to cys and truncation of the c terminal segment the in vitro gst activity of bmgsto  could be restored these findings provided structural insights into the activity regulation of gstos
