lipidic cubic phase crystal structure of the photosynthetic reaction centre from rhodobacter sphaeroides at    resolution
well ordered crystals of the bacterial photosynthetic reaction centre from rhodobacter sphaeroides were grown from a lipidic cubic phase here we report the type i crystal packing that results from this crystallisation medium for which d crystals grow as stacked d crystals and the reaction centre x ray structure is refined to    resolution in this crystal form the location of the membrane bilayer could be assigned with confidence a cardiolipin binding site is found at the protein  protein interface within the membrane spanning region shedding light on the formation of crystal contacts within the membrane a chloride binding site was identified in the membrane spanning region which suggests a putative site for interaction with the light harvesting complex i the cytochrome bc complex or pufx comparisons with the x ray structures of this reaction centre deriving from detergent based crystals are drawn indicating that a slight compression occurs in this lipid rich environment
