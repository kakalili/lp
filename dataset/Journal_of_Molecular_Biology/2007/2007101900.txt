Many green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants have been developed for use as fluorescent tags, and recently a superfolder GFP (sfGFP) has been developed as a robust folding reporter. This new variant shows increased stability and improved folding kinetics, as well as 100% recovery of native protein after denaturation. Here, we characterize sfGFP, and find that this variant exhibits hysteresis as unfolding and refolding equilibrium titration curves are non-coincident even after equilibration for more than eight half-lives as estimated from kinetic unfolding and refolding studies. This hysteresis is attributed to trapping in a native-like intermediate state. Mutational studies directed towards inhibiting chromophore formation indicate that the novel backbone cyclization is responsible for the hysteresis observed in equilibrium titrations of sfGFP. Slow equilibration and the presence of intermediates imply a rough landscape. However, de novo folding in the absence of the chromophore is dominated by a smoother energy landscape than that sampled during unfolding and refolding of the post-translationally modified polypeptide.
