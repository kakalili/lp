n terminal domain of the dual targeted pea glutathione reductase signal peptide controls organellar targeting efficiency
import of nuclear encoded proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts is generally organelle specific and its specificity depends on the n terminal signal peptide yet a group of proteins known as dual targeted proteins have a targeting peptide capable of leading the mature protein to both organelles we have investigated the domain structure of the dual targeted pea glutathione reductase gr signal peptide by using n terminal truncations a mutant of the gr precursor pgr starting with the second methionine residue of the targeting peptide pgr    directed import into both organelles negating the possibility that dual import was controlled by the nature of the n terminus the deletion of the  n terminal residues pgr    inhibited import efficiency into chloroplasts substantially and almost completely into mitochondria whereas the removal of only  n terminal amino acid residues pgr    resulted in the strongly stimulated mitochondrial import without significantly affecting chloroplast import furthermore n terminal truncations of the signal peptide pgr    and pgr    greatly stimulated the mitochondrial processing activity measured with the isolated processing peptidase these results suggest a domain structure for the dual targeting peptide of pgr and the existence of domains controlling organellar import efficiency therein
