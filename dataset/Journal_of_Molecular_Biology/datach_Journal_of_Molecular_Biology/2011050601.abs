modulation of k  linkage formation by variable loop residues within ubch a
ubiquitination refers to the covalent addition of ubiquitin ub to substrate proteins or other ub molecules via the sequential action of three enzymes e  e  and e  recent advances in mass spectrometry proteomics have made it possible to identify and quantify ub linkages in biochemical and cellular systems we used these tools to probe the mechanisms controlling linkage specificity for ubch a ubch a is a promiscuous e enzyme with an innate preference for forming polyubiquitin chains through lysine   k   lysine   k   and lysine   k  of ub we present the crystal structure of a noncovalent complex between ub and ubch a this structure reveals an interaction between the ub surface flanking k  and residues adjacent to the e catalytic cysteine and suggests a possible role for this surface in formation of k  linkages structure guided mutagenesis in vitro ubiquitination and quantitative mass spectrometry have been used to characterize the ability of residues in the vicinity of the e active site to direct synthesis of k  and k  linked polyubiquitin mutation of critical residues in the interface modulated the linkage specificity of ubch a resulting in generation of more k  linked chains at the expense of k  linkage synthesis this study provides direct evidence that the linkage specificity of e enzymes may be altered through active site mutagenesis
