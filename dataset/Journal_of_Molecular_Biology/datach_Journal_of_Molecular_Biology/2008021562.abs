mechanism of t rnap pausing and termination at the t concatemer junction a local change in transcription bubble structure drives a large change in transcription complex architecture
the t rna polymerase rnap elongation complex ec pauses and is destabilized at a unique  nucleotide nt sequence found at the junction of the head to tail concatemers of t genomic dna generated during t dna replication the paused ec may recruit the t dna processing machinery which cleaves the concatemerized dna within this  nt concatemer junction cj  pausing of the ec at the cj involves structural changes in both the rnap and transcription bubble however these structural changes have not been fully defined nor is it understood how the cj sequence itself causes the ec to change its structure to pause and to become less stable here we use solution and rnap tethered chemical nucleases to probe the cj transcript and changes in the ec structure as the polymerase pauses and terminates at the cj together with extensive mutational scanning of regions of the polymerase that are likely to be involved in recognition of the cj we are able to develop a description of the events that occur as the ec transcribes through the cj and subsequently pauses in this process a local change in the structure of the transcription bubble drives a large change in the architecture of the ec this altered ec structure may then serve as the signal that recruits the processing machinery to the cj
