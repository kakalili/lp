crystal structures of the class d  lactamase oxa  in the native form and in complex with meropenem edited by r huber
the therapeutic problems posed by class d  lactamases a family of serine enzymes that hydrolyse  lactam antibiotics following an acylation deacylation mechanism are increased by the very low level of sensitivity of these enzymes to  lactamase inhibitors to gain structural and mechanistic insights to aid the design of new inhibitors we have determined the crystal structure of oxa  from pseudomonas aeruginosa in the apo form and in complex with the carbapenem meropenem the native form consisted of a dimer displaying an overall organisation similar to that found in the closely related enzyme oxa   in the acyl enzyme complex the positioning of the antibiotic appeared to be ensured mainly by i the covalent acyl bond and ii a strong salt bridge involving the carboxylate moiety of the drug comparison of the structures of oxa  in the apo form and in complex with meropenem revealed an unsuspected flexibility in the region of the essential serine   residue with possible consequences for the catalytic properties of the enzyme in the apo form the ser  side chain is oriented outside the active site whereas the general base lys  adopts a conformation that seems to be incompatible with the activation of the catalytic water molecule required for the deacylation step in the oxa  meropenem complex a    movement of the backbone of the      loop towards the side chain of lys  was observed which seems to be driven by a displacement of the neighbouring     loop and which results in the repositioning of the side chain hydroxyl group of ser  toward the catalytic centre concomitantly the side chain of lys  is forced to curve in the direction of the deacylating water molecule which is then strongly bound and activated by this residue however a distance of ca   separates the catalytic water molecule from the acyl carbonyl group of meropenem a structural feature that accounts for the inhibition of oxa  by this drug finally the low level of penicillinase activity revealed by the kinetic analysis of oxa  could be related to the specific presence in position  of a serine residue located close to the general base lys  which results in a decrease of the number of hydrogen bonding interactions stabilising the catalytic water molecule
