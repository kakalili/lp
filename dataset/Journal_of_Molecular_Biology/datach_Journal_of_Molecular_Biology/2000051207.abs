effects of phosphorothioate modifications on precursor trna processing by eukaryotic rnase p enzymes  edited by a r fersht
the cleavage mechanism has been studied for nuclear rnase p from saccharomyces cerevisiae homo sapiens sapiens and dictyostelium discoideum representing distantly related branches of the eukarya this was accomplished by using precursor trnas ptrnas carrying a single rp or sp phosphorothioate modification at the normal rnase p cleavage site position      all three eukaryotic rnase p enzymes cleaved the sp diastereomeric ptrna exclusively one nucleotide upstream position      of the modified canonical cleavage site rp diastereomeric ptrna was cleaved with low efficiency at the modified     site by human rnase p at both the      and     site by yeast rnase p and exclusively at the      site by d discoideum rnase p the presence of mn and particularly cd  inhibited the activity of all three enzymes nevertheless a mn rescue of cleavage at the modified     site was observed with yeast rnase p and the rp diastereomeric ptrna consistent with direct metal ion coordination to the pro rp substituent during catalysis as observed for bacterial rnase p enzymes in summary our results have revealed common active site constraints for eukaryotic and bacterial rnase p enzymes in all cases an rp as well as an sp phosphorothioate modification at the rnase p cleavage site strongly interfered with the catalytic process whereas substantial functional interference is essentially restricted to one of the two diastereomers in other rna and protein catalyzed hydrolysis reactions such as those catalyzed by the tetrahymena ribozyme and nuclease p
