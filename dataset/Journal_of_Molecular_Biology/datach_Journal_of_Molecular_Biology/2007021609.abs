the solution structure of antigen mpt  from mycobacterium tuberculosis defines a new family of beta grasp proteins
the mpt  protein and its homologs form a highly conserved family of secreted proteins with unknown function that are found within the pathogenic mycobacteria genus the founding member of this family from mycobacterium tuberculosis mpt  or protein rv  c is expressed only when mycobacteria cells are actively dividing by virtue of this relatively unique expression profile rv  c is currently under phase iii clinical trials to evaluate its potential to replace tuberculin or purified protein derivative as the rapid diagnostic of choice for detection of active tuberculosis infection we describe here the nmr solution structure of rv  c this structure reveals a previously undescribed fold that is based upon a variation of a  grasp motif most commonly found in protein  protein interaction domains examination of this structure in conjunction with multiple sequence alignments of mpt  homologs identifies a candidate ligand binding site which may help guide future studies of rv  c function the work presented here also suggests structure based approaches for increasing the antigenic potency of a rv  c based diagnostic
