The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the Escherichia coli RecA protein has been recognized for more than two decades. Yet, the role of ATP hydrolysis in the RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis is required as part of a proofreading process during homology recognition. It enables the RecA-ssDNA complex, after determining that the strand-exchanged duplex is mismatched, to dissociate from the synaptic complex, which allows it to re-initiate the search for a “true” homologous region. Furthermore, the results suggest that when non-homologous sequences are present at the proximal end, ATP hydrolysis is required to allow ssDNA-RecA to reinitiate the strand exchange from an internal homologous region.
