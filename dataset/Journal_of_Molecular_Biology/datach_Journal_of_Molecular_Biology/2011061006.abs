amphioxus connectin exhibits merged structure as invertebrate connectin in i band region and vertebrate connectin in a band region
connectin is an elastic protein found in vertebrate striated muscle and in some invertebrates as connectin like proteins in this study we determined the structure of the amphioxus connectin gene and analyzed its sequence based on its genomic information amphioxus is not a vertebrate but phylogenetically the lowest chordate analysis of gene structure revealed that the amphioxus gene is approximately   kb in length and consists of regions with exons of repeatedly aligned immunoglobulin ig domains and regions with exons of fibronectin type  and ig domain repeats with regard to this sequence although the region corresponding to the i band is homologous to that of invertebrate connectin like proteins and has an ig  pevk region similar to that of the neanthes sp   k protein the region corresponding to the a band has a super repeat structure of ig and fibronectin type  domains and a kinase domain near the c terminus which is similar to the structure of vertebrate connectin these findings revealed that amphioxus connectin has the domain structure of invertebrate connectin like proteins at its n terminus and that of vertebrate connectin at its c terminus thus amphioxus connectin has a novel structure among known connectin like proteins this finding suggests that the formation and maintenance of the sarcomeric structure of amphioxus striated muscle are similar to those of vertebrates however its elasticity is different from that of vertebrates being more similar to that of invertebrates
