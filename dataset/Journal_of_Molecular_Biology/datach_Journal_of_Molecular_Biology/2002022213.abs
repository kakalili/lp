x ray diffraction of heavy atom labelled two dimensional crystals of rhodopsin identifies the position of cysteine   in helix  and cysteine   in helix  edited by w baumeister
we have used site specific heavy atom labelling and x ray diffraction to localize single amino acid residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the integral membrane protein rhodopsin the dim light photoreceptor of retinal vertebrate rod cells two dimensional orthorhombic crystals of the space group p    a        and b          were produced from detergent solubilized partially delipidated rhodopsin to obtain milligram amounts of two dimensional crystals which are required for x ray diffraction the yield of the crystalline material was significantly increased by reconstitution of rhodopsin in the presence of cholesterol   to   mol mol and by adding polar organic solvents to the dialysis buffer the native cysteine residues c  and c  were then selectively labelled with mercury using the sulphydryl specific reagent p chloromercuribenzoate      mol hg per mol rhodopsin  the labelling did not affect the unit cell dimensions optical absorption spectra of labelled and native two dimensional rhodopsin crystals showed the characteristic  cis retinal peak at   nm which corresponds to the dark state of rhodopsin the in plane position of the mercury label was calculated at    resolution from the intensity differences in the x ray diffraction patterns of labelled and native crystals using fourier difference methods and the phase information from electron crystallography the label positions were in excellent agreement with the positions of c  at the cytoplasmic end of helix  and of c  in the cytoplasmic helix  recently obtained from three dimensional rhodopsin crystals whereas these high resolution diffraction studies were performed under cryogenic conditions   k  our results were obtained at room temperature with fully hydrated membranes and in the absence of loop loop crystal contacts to study the structural changes of the cytoplasmic loops involved in activation and signal transduction our more physiological conditions offer important advantages furthermore the localization of c  is the first direct proof that the electron density on top of helix  observed by cryo electron microscopy is a part of the c terminal loop our approach is of particular interest for investigations of other membrane proteins for which d crystals are not available structural constraints from heavy atom labels at strategic sites enable the assignment of a position in the amino acid sequence to features visible in a low resolution density map and the study of conformational changes associated with different functional states of the membrane protein
