selection characterization and x ray structure of anti ampicillin single chain fv fragments from phage displayed murine antibody libraries
single chain fv scfv antibody libraries were constructed from mice immunized with an ampicillin bovine serum albumin conjugate several antibodies with specificity for intact ampicillin were selected by phage display and characterized the antibody scfv fragment al binds to intact ampicillin and shows no detectable cross reactivity with hydrolyzed ampicillin we determined the x ray structures of two crystal forms of w t al  which differ mainly in the side chain conformation of trp h   according to a new consensus nomenclature kabat residue number h  in the extremely short three residues cdr h and the presence or absence of a well resolved molecule of  methyl pentane   diol in the bottom of the binding pocket attempts to co crystallize al with its antigen or to diffuse ampicillin into the wild type al crystals were unsuccessful since crystal contacts obstruct the binding pocket however a mutant with two point mutations near the n terminus gln h replaced by glu and ala h  kabat h  replaced by gly crystallized in a form compatible with antigen binding although the mutations affect the conformation of framework i the conformations of the binding pocket of the uncomplexed wild type al and of the mutant complex were almost identical the structure explains the specificity of the antibody for intact ampicillin and the degree of cross reactivity of al with a wide variety of ampicillin analogs this antibody system will be very useful as a diagnostic reagent for antibiotics use and abuse as a model for the effect of expression of antibiotic binding molecules in escherichia coli and for directed evolution towards high antibiotic resistance
