the structure of the regulatory domain of the adenylyl cyclase rv   from mycobacterium tuberculosis with bound oleic acid
the universal secondary messenger camp is produced by adenylyl cyclases acs  most bacterial and all eukaryotic acs belong to class iii of six divergent classes a class iii characteristic is formation of the catalytic pocket at a dimer interface and the presence of additional regulatory domains mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses  class iii acs including rv   which is activated at acidic ph due to ph dependent structural transitions of the rv   dimer it has been shown by x ray crystallography that the n terminal regulatory and c terminal catalytic domains of rv   interact in completely different ways in the active and inhibited states here we report an in depth structural and functional analysis of the regulatory domain of rv   the     resolution crystal structure shows the protein in a tight disk shaped dimer formed around a helical bundle and involving a protein chain crossover to understand ph regulation we determined structures at acidic and basic ph values and employed structure based mutagenesis in the holoenzyme to elucidate regulation using an ac activity assay it has been shown that regulatory and catalytic domains must be linked in a single protein chain the new studies demonstrate that the length of the linker segment is decisive for regulation several amino acids on the surface of the regulatory domain when exchanged altered the ph dependence of ac activity however these residues are not conserved amongst a number of related acs the closely related mycobacterial rv   but not rv   is strongly activated by the addition of fatty acids the structure resolved the presence of a deeply embedded fatty acid characterised as oleic acid by mass spectrometry which may serve as a hinge from these data we conclude that the regulatory domain is a structural scaffold used for distinct regulatory purposes
