sequence and crystal structure determination of a basic phospholipase a from common krait bungarus caeruleus at    resolution identification and characterization of its pharmacological sites edited by r huber
this is the first phospholipase a  pla  structure from the family of kraits the protein was isolated from bungarus caeruleus common krait and the primary sequence was determined using cdna approach three dimensional structure of this presynaptic neurotoxic pla from group i has been determined by molecular replacement method using the model of pla component of   bungarotoxin bungarus multicinctus and refined using cns package to a final r factor of    for all the data in resolution range        the final refined model comprises   protein atoms and  water molecules the overall framework of krait phospholipase a with three long helices and two short antiparallel  strands is extremely similar to those observed for other group i pla s however the critical parts of pla folding are concerned with its various functional loops the conformations of these loops determine the efficiency of enzyme action and presence absence of various pharmacological functions in the present structure calcium binding loop is occupied by a sodium ion with a  fold co ordination the conformation of loop     in krait pla corresponds to a very high activity of the enzyme a comparison of its sequence with multimeric pla s clearly shows the absence of critical residues such as tyr  trp  and phe  which are involved in the multimerization of pla molecules the protein shows anticoagulant and neurotoxic activities
