complete cdna sequence of sap like pentraxin from limulus polyphemus implications for pentraxin evolution edited by a klug
the serum amyloid p component sap like pentraxin limulus polyphemus sap is a recently discovered distinct pentraxin species of known structure which does not bind phosphocholine and whose n terminal sequence has been shown to differ markedly from the highly conserved n terminus of all other known horseshoe crab pentraxins the complete cdna sequence of limulus sap and the derived amino acid sequence the first invertebrate sap like pentraxin sequence have been determined two sequences were identified that differed only in the length of the   untranslated region limulus sap is synthesised as a precursor protein of   amino acid residues the first  residues encoding a signal peptide that is absent from the mature protein phylogenetic analysis clusters limulus sap pentraxin with the horseshoe crab c reactive proteins crps rather than the mammalian saps which are clustered with mammalian crps the deduced amino acid sequence shares   identity with both human sap and crp which are   identical and      with horseshoe crab crps these analyses indicate that gene duplication of crp or sap  followed by sequence divergence and the evolution of crp and or sap function occurred independently along the chordate and arthropod evolutionary lines rather than in a common ancestor they further indicate that the crp sap gene duplication event in limulus occurred before both the emergence of the limulus crp variants and the mammalian crp sap gene duplication limulus sap which does not exhibit the crp characteristic of calcium dependent binding to phosphocholine is established as a pentraxin species distinct from all other known horseshoe crab pentraxins that exist in many variant forms sharing a high level of sequence homology
