the c elegans ceh  gene encodes a putative homemodomain transcription factor involved in chemosensory functions of ase and awc neurons
chemotaxis to water soluble chemicals such as sodium ion is an important behavior of caenorhabditis elegans for seeking food and ase chemosensory neurons have a major role in this behavior we isolated mutants defective in chemotaxis to sodium acetate we show here that among them ks  had a mutation in the ceh  gene ceh   gfp reporter constructs were expressed in ase and awc neurons in a mutant of the che  gene which encodes another transcription factor and is required for specification of ase neurons expression of the ceh   gfp reporter in ase is lost this indicates that the ceh  gene functions downstream of the che  gene in ase in the ceh  ks  mutant expression of the tax  gene encoding a cyclic nucleotide gated channel was reduced in ase and awc this affords an explanation for defects of the ceh  mutant in the chemotaxis mediated by ase and awc when a ceh  cdna was expressed in an adult ceh  mutant by a heat shock promoter chemotaxis to sodium acetate was recovered these results suggest that ceh  is required for functions and not for development of ase
