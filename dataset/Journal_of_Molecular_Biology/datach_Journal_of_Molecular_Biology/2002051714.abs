amino acid modification in the hiv  tat basic domain insights from molecular dynamics and in vivo functional studies
tat is an essential protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   it activates transcription by specifically binding a stem  loop element in the viral long terminal repeat through its highly basic arginine rich domain conserved lysine residues at positions  and  inside this domain have been recently reported to be the targets of post translational modification by acetylation and mutation of these residues has pointed out its relevance to protein function in an attempt to shed light on the molecular basis of the functional differences found for tat mutants we have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations on wt tat lys    arg    lys    ala   and acetylated lys  from hiv  strain z  theoretical results are compared with a homogeneous set of in vivo transactivation assays on the corresponding tat mutants from the strain b  which exhibits high structural similarity with tat from hiv  strain z  remarkable correlation is found between the degree of structure conservation and the transactivation capabilities of tat mutants
