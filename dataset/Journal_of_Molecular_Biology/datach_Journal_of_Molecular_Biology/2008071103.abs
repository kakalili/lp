crystal structures of the conserved trna modifying enzyme gida implications for its interaction with mnme and substrate
gida is a flavin adenine dinucleotide fad binding protein that is conserved among bacteria and eucarya together with mnme it is involved in the addition of a carboxymethylaminomethyl group to the uridine base in the wobble position nucleotide   of trnas that read split codon boxes here we report the crystal structures of the gida proteins from both escherichia coli and chlorobium tepidum the structures show that the protein can be divided into three domains a first fad binding domain showing the classical rossmann fold a second    domain inserted between two strands of the rossmann fold and an  helical c terminal domain the domain inserted into the rossmann fold displays structural similarity to the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate binding domains of phenol hydroxylase and  hydroxy  methylglutaryl coa reductase and correspondingly we show that gida binds nadh with high specificity as an initial donor of electrons gida behaves as a homodimer in solution as revealed by the crystal structures homodimerization is mediated via both the fad binding domain and the nadh binding domain finally a large patch of highly conserved positively charged residues on the surface of gida leading to the fad binding site suggests a trna binding surface we propose a model for the interaction between gida and mnme which is supported by site directed mutagenesis our data suggest that this interaction is modulated and potentially regulated by the switch function of the g domain of mnme
