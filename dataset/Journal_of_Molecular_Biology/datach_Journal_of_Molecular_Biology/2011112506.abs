structure of the lsm  complex an assembly intermediate of the lsm   and lsm   rings
the nuclear lsm    like sm complex and the cytoplasmic lsm   complex play a central role in mrna splicing and degradation respectively the lsm proteins are related to the spliceosomal sm proteins that form a heteroheptameric ring around small nuclear rna the assembly process of the heptameric sm complex is well established and involves several smaller sm assembly intermediates the assembly of the lsm complex however is less well studied here we solved the    resolution structure of the lsm assembly intermediate that contains lsm  lsm  and lsm  the three monomers display the canonical sm fold and arrange into a hexameric lsm     ring we show that the order of the lsm proteins within the ring is consistent with the order of the related sme smf and smg proteins in the heptameric sm ring nonetheless differences in rna binding pockets prevent the prediction of the nucleotide binding preferences of the lsm complexes using high resolution nmr spectroscopy we confirm that lsm  lsm  and lsm also assemble into a   kda hexameric ring in solution with a combination of pull down and nmr experiments we show that the lsm  complex can incorporate lsm  in order to assemble further towards native lsm rings interestingly we find that the nmr spectra of the lsm  lsm      and lsm     complexes differ significantly suggesting that the angles between the lsm building blocks change depending on the ring size of the complex in summary our results identify lsm  as a plastic and functional building block on the assembly route towards the lsm   and lsm   complexes
