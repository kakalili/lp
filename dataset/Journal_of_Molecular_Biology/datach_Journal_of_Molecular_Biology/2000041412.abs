the structure of antirrhinum centroradialis protein cen suggests a role as a kinase regulator edited by i a wilson
expression of the plant protein centroradialis cen leads to a morphological switch between shoot growth and the development of flower structures inflorescence  we have determined the crystal structure of antirrhinum cen to    resolution this structure confirms the cen proteins as a subset of the family of phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins pebp  as predicted from sequence homology mammalian forms of pebp have been found to act as inhibitors of map kinase signalling a central signalling cascade regulating cell differentiation cen and pebp proteins share a similar topology dominated by a large central  sheet the strong conservation of a binding pocket at one end of this sheet which is capable of binding phosphoryl ligands suggests the biological effects of cen like pebp arise from the ability of this region to form complexes with phosphorylated ligands hence interfering with kinases and their effectors
