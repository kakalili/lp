three dimensional structure of a type iii glutamine synthetase by single particle reconstruction
glnn the type iii glutamine synthetase gsiii from the medically important anaerobic opportunistic pathogen bacteroides fragilis has    kda subunits that share only  sequence identity with the type i glutamine synthetases gsi  the only family for which a structure is known active glnn was found predominantly in a single peak that eluted from a calibrated gel filtration chromatography column at a position equaivalent to       mda negative stain electron microscopy enabled the identification of double ringed particles and single hexameric rings   pinwheels   resulting from partial staining a d average of these pinwheels showed marked similarity to the corresponding structures found in preparations of gsi except that the arms of the subunits were   longer reconstructions from particles embedded in vitreous ice showed that glnn has a double ringed dodecameric structure with a  fold dihedral space group d  symmetry and dimensions of    nm parallel with the  fold axis and    nm parallel with the  fold axes the structures combined with a sequence alignment based on structural principles showed how many aspects of the structure of gsi and most notably the    barrel fold active site were preserved there was evidence for the presence of this structure in the reconstructed volume thus identifying the indentations between the pinwheel spokes as putative active sites and suggesting conservation of the overall molecular geometry found in gsi despite their low level of global homology furthermore docking of gsi into the reconstruction left sufficient plausibly located unoccupied density to account for the additional residues in gsiii thus validating the structure
