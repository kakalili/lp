The rate constants for the binding interaction between thrombin and a fully active fragment of its anticoagulant cofactor, thrombomodulin, have been determined by surface plasmon resonance. At physiological ionic strength, the ka was 6.7 × 106 M−1 s−1 and the dissociation rate constant was 0.033 s−1. These extremely fast association and dissociation rates resulted in an overall binding equilibrium constant of 4.9 nM, which is similar to previously reported values. Changing the ionic strength from 100 mM to 250 mM NaCl caused a tenfold decrease in the association rate while the dissociation rate did not change significantly. A similar effect was observed with tetramethylammonium chloride. A Debye-Hückel plot of the data had a slope of −6 and an intercept at 0 ionic strength of 109 M−1 s−1. The same slope and intercept were obtained for data that was collected in the presence of glycerol to slow the association rates. These results show that the thrombin-TM456 interaction is extremely rapid and nearly completely electrostatically steered. An association model is presented in which TM456 approaches thrombin along the direction of the thrombin molecular dipole.
