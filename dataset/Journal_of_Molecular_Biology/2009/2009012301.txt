Protein import into mitochondria requires unfolding of the folded mature domain of precursor proteins. Here we compared the effects of amino-acid replacement between the core region and the N-terminal region of the titin I27 domain (the 27th Ig domain of human titin) on its import into isolated mitochondria when attached to a short presequence (pb2(35)). We found that several mutations in the core region around Trp34 of the I27 domain enhanced the import rates of the fusion proteins, while the N-terminal K6P mutation, which increases mechanical stability around the N-terminal region, decreases the import rate. When the K6P mutation is combined with core-destabilizing mutations, the import rates of the fusion proteins still decrease, unless a long segment is deleted. These results suggest that mutations in the core region could destabilize the transition state for unfolding from the intermediate with the detached N-terminal segment during import, leading to enhanced unfolding rates, although stabilization of the N-terminal region masks these effects. In other words, the rate-limiting step of the global unfolding upon import into mitochondria switches, depending on the balance between the stability of the N-terminal structure and the stability of the core region of the I27 domain.
