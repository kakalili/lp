guided selection of a pan carcinoma specific antibody reveals similar binding characteristics yet structural divergence between the original murine antibody and its human equivalent edited by i a wilson
antibody engineering provides an excellent tool for the generation of human immunotherapeutics for the targeted treatment of solid tumours we have engineered and selected a completely human antibody to epithelial glycoprotein  egp   a transmembrane glycoprotein present on virtually all human simple epithelia and abundantly expressed on a variety of human carcinomas we chose to use the procedure of  guided selection  to rebuild a high affinity murine antibody into a human antibody using two consecutive rounds of variable domain shuffling and phage library selection as a starting antibody the murine antibody moc  was used after the first round of guided selection where the vh of moc  was combined in fab format with a human vlcl library a small panel of human light chains was identified originating from a segment of the v iii family whereas the moc  vl is more homologous to the v ii family nevertheless one of the chimaeric fabs c  displayed an off rate similar to moc  scfv combining the vl of c with a human vh library while retaining the vh cdr of moc   clones were selected using human vh genes originating from the rarely used vh family the best clone  e shows over  amino acid mutations from the germline sequence has an off rate comparable to the original antibody and specifically binds to the  moc    epitope on egp  in specificity and competition elisa facs analysis and immunohistochemistry in both vl and vh of antibody e three germline mutations were found creating the moc  homologue residue structural modelling of both murine and human antibodies reveals that one of the germline mutations  y in vh cdr  is likely to be involved in antigen binding we conclude that although they may bind the same epitope and have similar binding affinity to the antigen as the original murine antibody human antibodies derived by guided selection unlike cdr grafted antibodies may retain only some of the original key elements of the binding site chemistry the selected human anti egp  antibody will be a suitable reagent for tumour targeting
