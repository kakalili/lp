crystallographic structures of the m and n intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin assembly of a hydrogen bonded chain of water molecules between asp  and the retinal schiff base
an m intermediate of wild type bacteriorhodopsin and an n intermediate of the v a mutant were accumulated in photostationary states at ph   and   k and their crystal structures determined to    and    resolution respectively they appear to be m and n  in the sequence m  m  m    n  n   o  br where m  m  and m   contain an unprotonated retinal schiff base before and after a reorientation switch and after proton release to the extracellular surface while n and n  contain a reprotonated schiff base before and after reprotonation of asp  from the cytoplasmic surface in m  we detect a cluster of three hydrogen bonded water molecules at asp  not present in the br state in m  whose structure we reported earlier one of these water molecules intercalates between asp  and thr  in n   the cluster is transformed into a single file hydrogen bonded chain of four water molecules that connects asp  to the schiff base we find a network of three water molecules near residue   in the crystal structure of the non illuminated f  l mutant where the residue replacement creates a cavity this suggests that the hydration of the cytoplasmic region we observe in n  might have occurred spontaneously beginning at an existing water molecule as nucleus in the cavities from residue rearrangements in the photocycle
