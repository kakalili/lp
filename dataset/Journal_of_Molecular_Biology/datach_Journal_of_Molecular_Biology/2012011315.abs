dynamical characterization of two differentially disease associated mhc class i proteins in complex with viral and self peptides
major histocompatibility complex mhc class i proteins are expressed on the cell surface where they present foreign and self peptides to effector cells of the immune system while an understanding of the structural prerequisites for antigen presentation has already been achieved insight into subtype or peptide dependent dynamical characteristics of a peptide  mhc antigen is so far largely obscure we approached this problem by employing   ns molecular dynamics simulations with two human mhc class i subtypes as model systems the ankylosing spondylitis associated hla b     and the non ankylosing spondylitis associated hla b     both proteins differ only by a micropolymorphism at the floor of the peptide binding groove asp  his  a viral plmp  and three self peptides pvipr pgr and tis were evaluated the stability of the binding grooves was found to be both subtype dependent and peptide dependent a detachment from the c and or n terminal pockets was observed for all peptides except tis resulting in a stabilization of the   helix in both tis displaying subtypes estimates of the entropy associated with the bound peptides showed an increased entropy for plmp presented by b     as compared to b     in contrast to the self peptides additionally the flexibility of the   helix that is probably important for receptor binding to the b  peptide epitope is significantly enhanced for b     these in silico results show that the dynamic properties of peptide  mhc complexes are affected both by the bound peptide and by micropolymorphisms of the heavy chain our findings suggest a role for the conformational flexibility of mhc class i molecules in the context of recognition by receptors on effector cells
