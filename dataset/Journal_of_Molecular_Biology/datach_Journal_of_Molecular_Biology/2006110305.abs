structural determinants involved in the regulation of cxcl  brak expression by the  s proteasome
the chemokine cxcl  brak participates in immune surveillance by recruiting dendritic cells cxcl  gene expression is altered in a number of cancers but protein expression levels have not been investigated here we report that cxcl  protein can be expressed in primary epithelial cells however in several immortalized and cancer cell lines this protein is targeted for polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation we determined the nmr structure of cxcl  to identify motifs controlling its expression cxcl  adopts the canonical chemokine tertiary fold but contains a unique five amino acid insertion  vsryr  relative to other cxc chemokines deletion or substitution of key residues within this insertion prevented proteasomal degradation furthermore we defined a  amino acid fragment of cxcl  that is sufficient to induce proteasomal degradation this study elucidates a post translational mechanism for the loss of cxcl  in cancer and a novel mode of chemokine regulation
