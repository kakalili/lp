formation of fibrillar multimers of oat  glucosidase isoenzymes is mediated by the as glu monomer edited by w baumeister
oat  glucosidase ec      exists in two isomeric forms of homomultimer type i and heteromultimer type ii  which are comprised of two  kda monomers of as glu and as glu  the cdna of as glu was cloned in this study whereas as glu was previously cloned as as p  the as glu cdna encodes a plastid directing transit peptide of  amino acid residues and a mature protein of   amino acid residues the amino acid sequence of as glu is highly homologous to that of as glu  except for their c terminal portions when the two cdnas of the mature proteins were expressed as t tag fused proteins in escherichia coli they produced soluble and enzymatically active t tag as glu and t tag as glu proteins the t tag as glu was assembled into a donut shaped hexamer ring which was in turn stacked in integer numbers to form long fibrillar homomultimers of different lengths with a molecular mass of up to several million daltons on the other hand the t tag as glu primarily formed a dimer rather than a multimer when both cdnas of as glu and as glu were co expressed as t tag fused mature proteins they were also assembled into a hexamer ring comprised of the two monomers in a   stoichiometry the heteromeric hexamer was stacked in smaller numbers to form the heteromultimer of t tag as glu and as glu  the results indicate that the as glu monomer plays a crucial role in the formation of both the as glu homomultimer and the as glu and as glu heteromultimer we describe here a unique structure for the oat  glucosidase fibrillar multimer that is formed by stacking the hexamer rings composed of as glu and or as glu
