functional requirement for symmetric assembly of archaeal box c d small ribonucleoprotein particles
box c d small ribonucleoprotein particles srnps are archaeal homologs of small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles snornps in eukaryotes that are responsible for site specific   o methylation of ribosomal and transfer rnas the function of box c d srnps is characterized by step wise assembly of three core proteins around a box c d rna that include fibrillarin nop p and l ae the most distinct structural feature in all box c d rnas is the presence of two conserved box c d motifs accompanied by often a single and sometimes two antisense elements located immediately upstream of either the d or d  box despite this asymmetric distribution of antisense elements the bipartite feature of the box c d motifs appears to be in pleasing agreement with a recently reported three dimensional structure of the core protein complex between fibrillarin and nop p this investigates functional implications of the symmetric features both in box c d rnas and in the fibrillarin  nop p complex site directed mutagenesis was employed to generate box c d rnas lacking one of the two box c d motifs and a mutant fibrillarin  nop p complex deficient in self association the ability of the mutated components to assemble and to direct methyl transfer reactions was assessed by gel mobility shift analytical ultracentrifugation and in vitro catalysis studies the results presented here suggest that while a box c d srnp is capable of asymmetrical assembly the symmetries in both the box c d rna and in the fibrillarin  nop p complex are required for efficient catalysis these findings underscore the importance of functional assembly in methyl transfer reactions
