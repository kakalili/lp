ca  induces an extended conformation of the inhibitory region of troponin i in cardiac muscle troponin edited by m f moody
the inhibitory region of troponin i tni plays a central regulatory role in the contraction and relaxation cycle of skeletal and cardiac muscle through its ca  dependent interaction with actin detailed structural information on the interface between tnc and this region of tni has been long in dispute we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret to investigate the global conformation of the inhibitory region of a full length tni mutant from cardiac muscle ctni in the unbound state and in reconstituted complexes with the other cardiac troponin subunits the mutant contained a single tryptophan residue at the position   which was used as an energy transfer donor and a single cysteine residue at the position   labeled with iaedans as energy acceptor the sequence between trp  and cys  in ctni brackets the inhibitory region residues       and the distance between the two sites was found to be     in free ctni this distance was insensitive to reconstitution of ctni with cardiac troponin t ctnt  ctnc or ctnc and ctnt in the absence of bound regulatory ca  in ctnc an increase of   in the trp  cys  separation was observed upon saturation of the ca  regulatory site of ctnc in the complexes this large increase suggests an extended conformation of the inhibitory region in the interface between ctnc and ctni in holo cardiac troponin this extended conformation is different from a recent model of the ca  saturated skeletal tni tnc complex in which the inhibitory region is modeled as a  turn the observed ca  induced conformational change may be a switch mechanism by which movement of the regulatory region of ctni to the exposed hydrophobic patch of the open regulatory n domain of ctnc pulls the inhibitory region away from actin upon ca  activation in cardiac muscle
