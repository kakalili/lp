compass a tool for comparison of multiple protein alignments with assessment of statistical significance
we present a novel method for the comparison of multiple protein alignments with assessment of statistical significance compass  the method derives numerical profiles from alignments constructs optimal local profile  profile alignments and analytically estimates e values for the detected similarities the scoring system and e value calculation are based on a generalization of the psi blast approach to profile  sequence comparison which is adapted for the profile  profile case tested along with existing methods for profile  sequence psi blast and profile  profile prof sim comparison compass shows increased abilities for sensitive and selective detection of remote sequence similarities as well as improved quality of local alignments the method allows prediction of relationships between protein families in the pfam database beyond the range of conventional methods two predicted relations with high significance are similarities between various rossmann type folds and between various helix turn helix containing families the potential value of compass for structure function predictions is illustrated by the detection of an intricate homology between the dna binding domain of the ctf nfi family and the mh domain of the smad family
