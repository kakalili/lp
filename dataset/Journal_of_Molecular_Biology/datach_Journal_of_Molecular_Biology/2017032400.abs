understanding the molecular basis of multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome  mmds   impact of a disease causing gly  cys substitution on structure and activity of nfu in the fe s cluster biosynthetic pathway
iron  sulfur fe s cluster containing proteins constitute one of the largest protein classes with varied functions that include electron transport regulation of gene expression substrate binding and activation and radical generation consequently the biosynthetic machinery for fe s clusters is evolutionarily conserved and mutations in a variety of putative intermediate fe s cluster scaffold proteins can cause disease states including multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome mmds  sideroblastic anemia and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy herein we have characterized the impact of defects occurring in the mmds disease state that result from a point mutation gly  cys near the active site of nfu  an fe s scaffold protein via an in vitro investigation into the structural and functional consequences analysis of protein stability and oligomeric state demonstrates that the mutant increases the propensity to dimerize and perturbs the secondary structure composition these changes appear to underlie the severely decreased ability of mutant nfu to accept an fe s cluster from physiologically relevant sources therefore the point mutation on nfu impairs downstream cluster trafficking and results in the disease phenotype because there does not appear to be an alternative in vivo reconstitution path most likely due to greater protein oligomerization from a minor structural change
