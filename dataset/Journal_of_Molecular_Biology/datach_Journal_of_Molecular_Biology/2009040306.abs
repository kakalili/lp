the role of the n terminus of the myosin essential light chain in cardiac muscle contraction
to study the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction by the myosin essential light chain elc and the physiological significance of its n terminal extension we generated transgenic tg mice by partially replacing the endogenous mouse ventricular elc with either the human ventricular elc wild type tg wt or its  amino acid n terminal truncation mutant tg    in the murine hearts the mutant protein is similar in sequence to the short elc variant present in skeletal muscle and the elc protein distribution in tg   ventricles resembles that of fast skeletal muscle cardiac muscle preparations from tg   mice demonstrate reduced force per cross sectional area of muscle which is likely caused by a reduced number of force generating myosin cross bridges and or by decreased force per cross bridge as the mice grow older the contractile force per cross sectional area further decreases in tg   mice and the mutant hearts develop a phenotype of nonpathologic hypertrophy while still maintaining normal cardiac performance the myocardium of older tg   mice also exhibits reduced myosin content our results suggest that the role of the n terminal elc extension is to maintain the integrity of myosin and to modulate force generation by decreasing myosin neck region compliance and promoting strong cross bridge formation and or by enhancing myosin attachment to actin
