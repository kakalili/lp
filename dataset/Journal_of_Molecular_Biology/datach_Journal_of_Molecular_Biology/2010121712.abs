sam recognition and conformational switching mechanism in the bacillus subtilis yitj s box sam i riboswitch
s box sam i riboswitches are a widespread class of riboswitches involved in the regulation of sulfur metabolism in gram positive bacteria we report here the    crystal structure of the aptamer domain of the bacillus subtilis yitj s box sam i riboswitch bound to s adenosyl l methionine sam  the rna folds into two sets of helical stacks spatially arranged by tertiary interactions including a k turn and a pseudoknot at a four way junction the tertiary structure is further stabilized by metal coordination extensive ribose zipper interactions and sam mediated tertiary interactions despite structural differences in the peripheral regions the sam binding core of the b subtilis yitj riboswitch is virtually superimposable with the previously determined thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis yitj riboswitch structure suggesting that a highly conserved ligand recognition mechanism is utilized by all s box riboswitches shape selective   hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension chemical probing analysis further revealed that the alternative base pairing element in the expression platform controls the conformational switching process in the absence of sam the apo yitj aptamer domain folds predominantly into a pre binding conformation that resembles but is not identical with the sam bound state we propose that sam enters the ligand binding site through the  j   j    gate and  locks  down the sam bound conformation through an induced fit mechanism temperature dependent shape revealed that the tertiary interaction stabilized sam binding core is extremely stable likely due to the cooperative rna folding behavior mutational studies revealed that certain modifications in the sam binding region result in loss of sam binding and constitutive termination which suggests that these mutations lock the rna into a form that resembles the sam bound form in the absence of sam
