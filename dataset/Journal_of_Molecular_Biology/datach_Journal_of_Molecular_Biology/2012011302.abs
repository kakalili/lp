uhrf double tudor domain and the adjacent phd finger act together to recognize k me containing histone h tail
human multi domain containing protein uhrf has recently been extensively characterized as a key epigenetic regulator for maintaining dna methylation patterns uhrf sra domain preferentially binds to hemimethylated cpg sites and double tudor domain has been implicated in recognizing h k me mark but the role of the adjacent phd finger remains unclear here we report the high resolution crystal structure of uhrf phd finger in complex with n terminal tail of histone h  we found that the preceding zinc cys knuckle is indispensable for the phd finger of uhrf to recognize the first four unmodified residues of histone h n terminal tail quantitative binding studies indicated that uhrf phd finger including the preceding zinc cys knuckle acts together with the adjacent double tudor domain to specifically recognize the h k me mark combinatorial recognition of h k me containing histone h tail by uhrf phd finger and double tudor domain may play a role in establishing and maintaining histone h k methylation patterns during the cell cycle
