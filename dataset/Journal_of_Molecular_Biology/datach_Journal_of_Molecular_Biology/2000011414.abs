synergism of mutations in bacteriophage q  rna affecting host factor dependence of q  replicase edited by m yaniv
we have recently shown that escherichia coli cells deficient in hfq protein i e the q   host factor   support bacteriophage q  replication inefficiently but that the phage evolves rapidly in the mutant host to become essentially host factor independent an identical set of four point mutations was identified as being responsible for the adapted phenotype in each of three independent adaptation experiments here we report the effects of the single mutations and of some of their combinations on host factor dependence of phage multiplication in vivo and of phage rna replication by q  replicase in vitro we find that each single substitution produces only small effects but that in combination the four mutations synergistically account for most of the observed adaptation of the evolved phages surprisingly a reanalysis of the   terminal sequence of the adapted phages resulted in the discovery of a fifth mutation in all three independently evolved phage populations namely a c to u residue transition at nucleotide    this mutation had been missed previously because of its location only three nucleotides from the   end it appears to contribute little to the hfq independence but may enhance rna stability by re establishing the possibility of forming a long range base pairing interaction involving the immediate   terminal sequence
