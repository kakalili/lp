the molecular organization of the fungal prion het s in its amyloid form
the prion hypothesis states that it is solely the three dimensional structure of the polypeptide chain that distinguishes the prion and nonprion forms of the protein for het s the atomic resolution structure of the isolated prion domain het s       consisting of a highly ordered triangular cross  arrangement is known here we present a solid state nmr study of fibrils of the full length het s prion in which we compare their spectra with spectra from isolated c terminal prion domain fibrils and the crystalline n terminal globular domain het s      the spectra reveal unequivocally that the highly ordered structure of the isolated prion domain het s      is conserved in the context of the full length fibrils investigated here however the globular domain loses much of its tertiary structure while partly retaining its secondary structure thus exhibiting behavior reminiscent of a molten globule flexible residues that may constitute the linker connecting the two domains are detected using inept insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer spectroscopy based on our data we propose a structural model that is in line with a general model developed for amyloid fibrils built from a cross  core decorated with globular domains the loss of structure in the het s globular domain sharply contrasts with the behavior observed for fibrils of ure p and suggests that there is considerable structural diversity in the fibrils of globular domain containing prions despite their similar appearances at the microscopic level
