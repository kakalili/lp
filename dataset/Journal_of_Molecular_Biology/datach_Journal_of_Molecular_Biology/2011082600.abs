roadblock repression of transcription by bacillus subtilis cody
cody is a global transcriptional regulator that is known to control directly or indirectly expression of more than   genes and operons in bacillus subtilis using a combination of mutational analysis and dnase i footprinting experiments we identified two high affinity cody binding sites that contribute to repression of the ybge gene and appear to act independently one of these sites located   bp downstream of the transcription start site accounted for the bulk of ybge repression using in vitro transcription experiments we demonstrated that in the presence of cody a shorter than expected ybge transcript that terminates at the downstream cody binding site was synthesized thus cody binding to the downstream site represses transcription by a roadblock mechanism similar premature termination of transcription was observed for bcap and yufn two other cody regulated genes with binding sites downstream of the promoter in accord with the roadblock mechanism cody mediated repression at downstream sites was partly relieved if the transcription  repair coupling factor mfd was inactivated
