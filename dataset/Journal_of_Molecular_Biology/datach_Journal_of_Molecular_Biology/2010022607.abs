estrogen increases expression of the human prostacyclin receptor within the vasculature through an er  dependent mechanism
prostacyclin and the prostacyclin receptor ip are implicated in mediating many of the atheroprotective effects of estrogen in both humans and in animal models but through unknown mechanisms hence herein the influence of estrogen on ip gene expression in endothelial ea hy   human erythroleukemia    and primary human aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated estrogen increased hip mrna levels promoter prmip directed reporter gene expression and cicaprost dependent camp generation in all cell types effects that were abrogated by actinomycin d and the general estrogen receptor er   er  antagonist ici     furthermore the er  selective agonist        propyl  h pyrazole    triyl trisphenol ppt  but not the er  agonist   bis  hydroxyphenyl propionitrile significantly increased hip mrna and prmip directed gene expression deletional and mutational analysis of prmip uncovered an evolutionary conserved estrogen response element while electrophoretic mobility shift antibody supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitations assays confirmed the direct binding of er  but not er  to prmip both in vitro and in vivo moreover immunofluorescence microscopy corroborated that estrogen and ppt increased hip expression in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells in conclusion the hip gene is directly regulated by estrogen that largely occurs through an er  dependent transcriptional mechanism and thereby provides critical insights into the role of prostacyclin hip in mediating the atheroprotective effects of estrogen within the human vasculature
