negative regulation of hiv  transcription by a heterodimeric nf  b p  and c terminally truncated stat complex
signal transducers and activator of transcription stat proteins are often constitutively activated in leukocytes of hiv  individuals which frequently show a dominant expression of a c terminally truncated isoform of stat  stat   stat  can act as a negative regulator of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  expression in both cd depleted primary leukocytes and chronically infected promonocytic u cells stimulated with granulocyte  macrophage colony stimulating factor gm csf  activated stat  can directly bind to two consensus sequences in the hiv  long terminal repeat ltr promoter binding impairs recruitment of rna polymerase ii crotti a  lusic m  lupo r  lievens p m  liboi e  della chiara g  et al     naturally occurring c terminally truncated stat is a negative regulator of hiv  expression blood           one of the stat consensus sequences overlaps with one nuclear factor  b nf  b binding site interestingly nf  b p  homodimers frequently detected in monocytic cells are negative regulators of hiv transcription here we show that gm csf stimulation of u cells while not inducing nf  b activation leads to stat  phosphorylation and binding to the nf  b stat target sequence in the hiv ltr promoter which already associates with p  under unstimulated conditions stat  was found to associate with p  but not with rela p  in both u cells expressing endogenous proteins and  t cells overexpressing these factors furthermore gm csf stimulation promoted concurrent binding of stat  and p  at the hiv ltr promoter in u cells immunoprecipitation of chromatin from gm csf stimulated u cells confirmed in vivo binding of p  to the viral promoter together with stat   thus cytokine activated stat  p  complexes can contribute to the maintenance of hiv  latency in monocytic cells
