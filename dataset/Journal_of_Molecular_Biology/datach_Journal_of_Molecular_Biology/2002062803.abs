a novel bacteriophage encoded rna polymerase binding protein inhibits transcription initiation and abolishes transcription termination by host rna polymerase
xp  is a lytic bacteriophage of xanthomonas oryzae a gram negative bacterium that causes rice blight we purified an xp  protein p  that binds to and inhibits x oryzae rna polymerase rnap  p is a novel  amino acid long protein it does not bind to and hence does not affect transcription by escherichia coli rnap analysis of e coli x oryzae rnap hybrids locates the p binding site to the largest x oryzae rnap subunit     binding of p to x oryzae rnap holoenzyme prevents large conformational change that places the  subunit region  into the correct position for interaction with the    promoter element as a result open promoter complex formation on the       class promoters is inhibited inhibition of promoter complex formation on the extended    class promoters is less efficient the p protein also abolishes factor independent transcription termination by x oryzae rnap by preventing the release of nascent rna at terminators further physiological and mechanistic studies of this novel transcription factor should provide additional insights into its biological role and the processes of promoter recognition and transcription termination
