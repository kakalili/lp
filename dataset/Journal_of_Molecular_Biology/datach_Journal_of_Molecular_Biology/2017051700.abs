sumo in the dna double stranded break response similarities differences and cooperation with ubiquitin
in recent years our knowledge of the varied role that ubiquitination plays in promoting signal amplification novel protein interactions and protein turnover has progressed rapidly this is particularly remarkable in the examination of how dna double stranded breaks dsbs are repaired with many components of the ubiquitin ub conjugation de conjugation and recognition machinery now identified as key factors in dsb repair in addition a member of the ub like family small ub like modifier sumo  has also been recognised as integral for efficient repair here we summarise our emerging understanding of sumoylation both as a distinct modification and as a cooperative modification with ub using the cellular response to dna dsbs as the primary setting to compare these modifications
