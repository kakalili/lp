crp binding and transcription activation at crp s sites
in haemophilus influenzae as in escherichia coli the camp receptor protein crp activates transcription from hundreds of promoters by binding symmetrical dna sites with the consensus half site   a a a t g t g a t c t  we have previously identified  h influenzae crp sites that differ from canonical crp n sites in the following features   both half sites of these noncanonical crp s sites have c instead of t  although they otherwise have an unusually high level of identity with the binding site consensus   only promoters with crp s sites require both the crp and sxy proteins for transcription activation to study the functional significance of crp s site sequences we purified h influenzae hi crp and compared its dna binding properties to those of the well characterized e coli ec crp all eccrp residues that contact dna are conserved in hicrp and both proteins demonstrated a similar high affinity for the crp n consensus sequence however whereas eccrp bound specifically to crp s sites in vitro hicrp did not by systematically substituting base pairs in native promoters and in the crp n consensus sequence we confirmed that hicrp is highly specific for the perfect core sequence t g t g a and is more selective than eccrp at other positions in crp sites even though converting c  t greatly enhanced hicrp binding to a crp s site this had the unexpected effect of nearly abolishing promoter activity a t rich sequences upstream of crp s sites were also found to be required for promoter activation raising the possibility that sxy binds these a t sequences to simultaneously enable crp  dna binding and assist in rna polymerase recruitment
