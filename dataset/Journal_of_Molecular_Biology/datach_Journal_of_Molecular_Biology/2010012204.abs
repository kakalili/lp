molecular switch in the glucocorticoid receptor active and passive antagonist conformations
mifepristone is known to induce mixed passive antagonist active antagonist and agonist effects via the glucocorticoid receptor gr pathway part of the antagonist effects of mifepristone are due to the repression of gene transcription mediated by the nuclear receptor corepressor ncor  here we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex of the gr ligand binding domain gr lbd with mifepristone and a receptor interacting motif of ncor the structures of three different conformations of the gr lbd mifepristone complex show in the oxosteroid hormone receptor family how helix  modulates lbd corepressor and coactivator binding differences in ncor binding and in helix  conformation reveal how the   substituent in mifepristone triggers the helix  molecular switch to reshape the coactivator site into the corepressor site two observed conformations exemplify the active antagonist state of gr with ncor bound in another conformation helix  completely blocks the coregulator binding site and explains the passive antagonistic effect of mifepristone on gr
