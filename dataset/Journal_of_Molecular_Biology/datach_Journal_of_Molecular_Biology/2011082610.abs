multiple factors insulate msh  msh mismatch repair activity from defects in msh domain i
dna mismatch repair mmr is a highly conserved mutation avoidance mechanism that corrects dna polymerase misincorporation errors in initial steps in mmr msh  msh binds mispairs and small insertion deletion loops and msh  msh binds larger insertion deletion loops the msh   mutation which deletes the conserved dna binding domain i of msh  does not dramatically affect msh  msh dependent repair in contrast msh   mutants show strong defects in msh  msh functions interestingly several mutations identified in patients with hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer map to domain i of msh  none have been found in msh  to understand the role of msh domain i in mmr we examined the consequences of combining the msh   mutation with mutations in two distinct regions of msh and those that increase cellular mutational load pol   and rad   these experiments reveal msh   specific phenotypes in msh  msh repair with significant effects on mutation rates in vitro assays demonstrate that msh    msh dna binding is less specific for dna mismatches and produces an altered footprint on a mismatch dna substrate together these results provide evidence that in vivo multiple factors insulate mmr from defects in domain i of msh and provide insights into how mutations in msh domain i may cause hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer
