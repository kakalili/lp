exon skipping is correlated with exon circularization
circular rnas are found in a wide range of organisms and it has been proposed that they perform disparate functions however how rna circularization is connected to alternative splicing remains largely unexplored here we stimulated primary human endothelial cells with tumor necrosis factor  or tumor growth factor   purified rna generated gt   billion rna seq reads and used a custom pipeline to characterize circular rnas derived from coding exons we find that circularization of exons is widespread and correlates with exon skipping a feature that adds considerably to the regulatory complexity of the human transcriptome
