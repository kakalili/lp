insights into the alkyl peroxide reduction pathway of xanthomonas campestris bacterioferritin comigratory protein from the trapped intermediate  ligand complex structures
considerable insights into the oxidoreduction activity of the xanthomonas campestris bacterioferritin comigratory protein xcbcp have been obtained from trapped intermediate ligand complex structures determined by x ray crystallography multiple sequence alignment and enzyme assay indicate that xcbcp belongs to a subfamily of atypical  cys peroxiredoxins prxs  containing a strictly conserved peroxidatic cysteine cp  and an unconserved resolving cysteine cr   crystals at different states i e free sh state intra ss state and inter ss state were obtained by screening the xcbcp proteins from a double c s c s mutant a wild type and a c a mutant respectively a formate or an alkyl analog with two water molecules that mimic an alkyl peroxide substrate was found close to the active site of the free sh or inter ss state respectively their global structures were found to contain a novel substrate binding pocket capable of accommodating an alkyl chain of no less than  carbons in addition in the intra ss or inter ss state substantial local unfolding or complete unfolding of the cr helix was detected with the cp helix remaining essentially unchanged this is in contrast to the earlier observation that the cp helix exhibits local unfolding during disulfide bond formation in typical  cys prxs these rich experimental data have enabled us to propose a pathway by which xcbcp carries out its oxidoreduction activity through the alternate opening and closing of the substrate entry channel and the disulfide bond pocket
