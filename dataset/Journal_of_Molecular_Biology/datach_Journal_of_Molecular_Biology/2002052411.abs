structural differences in the noe derived structure of g  t mismatched dna relative to normal dna are correlated with differences in  c relaxation based internal dynamics
detailed description of the characteristics of mismatched dna that are distinct from normal dna is vital to the understanding of how mismatch repair proteins are able to recognize and repair these dna lesions to this end we have used nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy noesy based distance restraints and  c relaxation measurements to solve the solution structures and measure some of the internal dynamics of the g  t mismatched dna oligomer d ccatgcgtgg  gt and its parent dna sequence d ccacgcgtgg  gc  in gt the mismatched g is structurally perturbed much more than the mismatched t relative to their corresponding bases in gc the degree of g displacement differs from previous high resolution structures of g  t mismatch containing b dna suggesting a dependence of g  t mismatch induced structural perturbation on sequence context the internal dynamics of gc and gt differ on multiple timescales the mismatched g of gt contains spins that decrease significantly in order in gt compared to gc while spins in c  t  and a have significantly higher order in gt compared to gc linear correlations between helical parameters of gc and gt and the order of c   and aromatic methine carbon atoms relate differences in internal dynamics to the structures quantitatively the dynamic differences between the normal and mismatched dna signify changes in local flexibility that may be exploited by the mismatch repair system to bind mismatched dna preferentially while ignoring normal dna
