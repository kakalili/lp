modulating protein  protein interactions with small molecules the importance of binding hotspots
the modulation of protein  protein interactions ppis by small drug like molecules is a relatively new area of research and has opened up new opportunities in drug discovery however the progress made in this area is limited to a handful of known cases of small molecules that target specific diseases with the increasing availability of protein structure complexes it is highly important to devise strategies exploiting homologous structure space on a large scale for discovering putative ppis that could be attractive drug targets here we propose a scheme that allows performing large scale screening of all protein complexes and finding putative small molecule and or peptide binding sites overlapping with protein  protein binding sites so called  multibinding sites   we find more than   nonredundant proteins from  protein families with multibinding sites moreover we show that the multibinding sites are mostly observed in transient complexes largely overlap with the binding hotspots and are more evolutionarily conserved than other interface sites we investigate possible mechanisms of how small molecules may modulate protein  protein binding and discuss examples of new candidates for drug design
