crosstalk between hippo and tgf  subcellular localization of yap taz smad complexes
the hippo pathway plays a crucial role in growth control proliferation and tumor suppression activity of the signaling pathway is associated with cell density sensing and tissue organization furthermore the hippo pathway helps to coordinate cellular processes through crosstalk with growth factor mediated signaling pathways such as tgf  here we have examined the localization of interactions between proteins of the hippo pathway yap taz and tgf  smad   signaling pathway by using in situ proximity ligation assays we investigated the formation of protein complexes between yap taz and smad  and examined how these interactions were affected by tgf  stimulation and cell density in hacat keratinocytes and in smad deficient ht  colon cancer cells we demonstrate that tgf  induces formation of yap taz  smad  complexes in hacat cells under sparse cell conditions the complexes were detected to a higher degree and were predominantly located in the nucleus while under dense culture conditions the complexes were fewer and mainly located in the cytoplasm surprisingly we could not detect any yap taz  smad  complexes in ht  cells to examine if smad deficiency was responsible for the absence of interactions we treated hacat cells with sirna targeting smad  however we could still observe complex formation in the sirna treated cells suggesting that smad is not essential for the yap  smad  interaction in conclusion this study shows localized density dependent formation of yap taz  smad  complexes in hacat cells and provides evidence supporting a crosstalk between the hippo and the tgf  signaling pathways
