the    crystal structure and substrate specificity of the kdel tailed cysteine endopeptidase functioning in programmed cell death of ricinus communis endosperm
in the senescing endosperm of germinating castor bean ricinus communis a special organelle the ricinosome releases a papain type cysteine endopeptidase cysep during the final stages of cellular disintegration protein cleavage sites for the ricinus cysep were determined with fluorogenic peptides abz xaa arg   gln gln tyr no  asp  the highest kcat km values were obtained with neutral amino acid residues with large aliphatic and non polar leu val ile met or aromatic phe tyr trp side chains a second series abz leu xaa   gln pro tyr no  asp was evaluated based on these results the covalent binding inhibitor h d val leu lys chloromethylketone cmk was chosen as substrate analogue for replacement in the catalytic site unusually cysep cleaved  casein n and c terminal to the amino acid proline cysep was crystallized its structure was solved by molecular replacement at    resolution and refined to a r factor of    rfree     the polypeptide chain folds as in papain into two domains divided by the active site cleft an elongated surface depression harboring the active site the non primed specificity subsites of the proteinase are clearly defined by the h d val leu lys cmk inhibitor covalently bound to the active site the absence of the occluding loop which blocks the active site of exopeptidases at the c terminal side of the scissile bond identifies cysep as an endopeptidase the more open pocket of the ricinus cysep correlates with the extended variety of substrate amino acid residues accommodated by this enzyme including even proline at the p and p   positions this may allow the enzyme to attack a greater variety of proteins during programmed cell death
