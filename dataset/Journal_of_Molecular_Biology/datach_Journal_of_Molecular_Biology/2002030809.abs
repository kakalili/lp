preferential binding sites for interferon regulatory factors  and  involved in interferon a gene transcription edited by m yaniv
transcription of the murine interferon a  ifn a  gene is mediated by a virus responsive element vre a  located in the promoter proximal     to    region vre a contains four dna modules a to d which cooperate for maximal ifn a activation following virus infection the differential expression between the highly expressed ifn a and the weakly inducible ifn a  gene promoters is essentially due to point mutations within the c and d modules of the virus responsive element vre a  we now demonstrate that in murine l  and human   cells transcription factors irf  and irf  which are potent activators of virus induced type i ifn transcription differentially affect ifn a and ifn a  promoter activities using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and dnase i footprinting data our studies demonstrate that the ab modules correspond to a preferential site for irf  whereas the c module is preferentially recognized by irf  furthermore transfection of reporter constructs driven by four copies of different gaaann hexameric motifs found within vre a indicates that the nn residues of these hexameric sequences define the preferential binding sites for irf  or irf  together these experiments clarify the molecular basis for differential expression of ifn a genes following virus infection by delineating the sequence requirements for irf association with the virus responsive elements of the ifn a genes
