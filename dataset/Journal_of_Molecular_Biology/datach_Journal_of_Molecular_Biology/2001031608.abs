the ubx domain a widespread ubiquitin like module edited by p e wright
the ubx domain is an  amino acid residue module that is present typically at the carboxyl terminus of a variety of eukaryotic proteins in an effort to elucidate the function of ubx domains we solved the three dimensional structure of the ubx domain of human fas associated factor  faf  by nmr spectroscopy the structure has a  grasp fold characterised by a           secondary structure organisation the five  strands are arranged into a mixed sheet in the order    the longer first helix packs across the first three strands of the sheet and a second shorter   helix is located in an extended loop connecting strands  and  in the absence of significant sequence similarity the ubx domain can be superimposed with ubiquitin with an r m s d of     suggesting that the two structures share the same superfold and an evolutionary relationship however the absence of a carboxyl terminal extension containing a double glycine motif and of suitably positioned lysine side chains makes it highly unlikely that ubx domains are either conjugated to other proteins or part of mixed ubx ubiquitin chains database searches revealed that most ubx domain containing proteins belong to one of four evolutionarily conserved families represented by the human faf  p  y k and rep proteins a role of the ubx domain in ubiquitin related processes is suggested
