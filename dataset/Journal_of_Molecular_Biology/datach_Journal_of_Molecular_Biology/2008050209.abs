crystallographic studies on multiple conformational states of active site loops in pyrrolysyl trna synthetase
pyrrolysine a lysine derivative with a bulky pyrroline ring is the   nd  genetically encoded amino acid in the present study the carboxy terminal catalytic fragment of methanosarcina mazei pyrrolysyl trna synthetase pylrs was analyzed by x ray crystallography and site directed mutagenesis the catalytic fragment ligated trnapyl with pyrrolysine nearly as efficiently as the full length pylrs we determined the crystal structures of the pylrs catalytic fragment in the substrate free atp analogue amppnp bound and amppnp pyrrolysine bound forms and compared them with the previously reported pylrs structures the ordering loop and the motif  loop undergo conformational changes from the  open  states to the  closed  states upon amppnp binding on the other hand the     hairpin exhibits multiple conformational states the open intermediate   open   open and   closed   open  and closed states which are not induced upon substrate binding the pylrs structures with a docked trna suggest that the active site pocket can accommodate the cca terminus of trna when the motif  loop is in the closed state and the     hairpin is in the open or intermediate state the entrance of the active site pocket is nearly closed in the closed state of the     hairpin which may protect the pyrrolysyladenylate intermediate in the absence of trnapyl moreover a structure based mutational analysis revealed that hydrophobic residues in the amino acid binding tunnel are important for accommodating the pyrrolysine side chain and that asn  is essential for anchoring the side chain carbonyl and  amino groups of pyrrolysine in addition a docking model of pylrs with trna was constructed based on the aspartyl trna synthetase trna structure and was confirmed by a mutational analysis
