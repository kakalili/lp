electrostatic interactions in the denatured state and in the transition state for protein folding effects of denatured state interactions on the analysis of transition state structure
the development of electrostatic interactions during the folding of the n terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l  ntl  is investigated by ph dependent rate equilibrium free energy relationships we show that asp  among six acidic residues is involved in non native electrostatic interactions with k  in the transition state for folding as well as in the denatured state the perturbed native state pka of d  pka   appears to be maintained through non native interactions in both the transition state and the denatured state mutational effects on the stability of the transition state for protein un folding are often analyzed in respect to change in ground states thus the interpretation of transition state analysis critically depends on an understanding of mutational effects on both the native and denatured state increasing evidence for structurally biased denatured states under physiological conditions raises concerns about possible denatured state effects on folding studies we show that the structural interpretation of transition state analysis can be altered dramatically by denatured state effects
