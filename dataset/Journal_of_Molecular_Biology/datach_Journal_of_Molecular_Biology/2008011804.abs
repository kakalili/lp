novel inhibitor for prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase from porphyromonas gingivalis and details of substrate recognition mechanism
a new inhibitor h ala ile pyrrolidin  yl boronic acid was developed as an inhibitor against prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase with a ki value of    nm the structure of the prolyl tripeptidyl aminopeptidase complexed with the inhibitor enzyme  inhibitor complex was determined at     resolution the inhibitor was bound to the active site through a covalent bond between ser  and the boron atom of the inhibitor this structure should closely mimic the structure of the reaction intermediate between the enzyme and substrate we previously proposed that two glutamate residues glu  and glu   are involved in the recognition of substrates in order to clarify the function of these glutamate residues in substrate recognition three mutant enzymes e  a e  q and e  a were generated by site directed mutagenesis the e  a mutant was expressed as an inclusion body the e  q mutant was expressed in soluble form but no activity was detected here the structures of the e  a mutant and its complex with the inhibitor were determined the inhibitor was located at almost the same position as in the wild type enzyme  inhibitor complex the amino group of the inhibitor interacted with glu  and the main chain carbonyl group of gln   in addition a water molecule in the place of glu  of the wild type enzyme interacted with the amino group of the inhibitor this water molecule was located near the position of glu  in the wild type and formed a hydrogen bond with gln   the kcat km values of the e  a mutant toward the two substrates used were smaller than those of the wild type by two orders of magnitude the ki value of our inhibitor for the e  a mutant was     m which was   fold higher than that against the wild type enzyme consequently it was concluded that glu  and glu  are significant residues for the n terminal recognition of a substrate
