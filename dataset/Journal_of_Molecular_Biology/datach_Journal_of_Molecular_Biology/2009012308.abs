characterization of dna binding proteins using multiplexed competitor emsa
we describe a low cost high throughput technique to characterize nuclear protein dna binding interactions this technique known as multiplexed competitor electrophoretic mobility shift assay uses a series of multiplexed oligonucleotide dna consensus competitors in combination with a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay procedure to efficiently characterize dna binding proteins we show utility for the method to identify a previously unreported hepatocyte nuclear factor  site created in intron  of the lipoprotein lipase gene by a common single nucleotide polymorphism rs
