a mechanistic view of enzyme inhibition and peptide hydrolysis in the active site of the sars cov c like peptidase
the c like main peptidase clpro is a viral polyprotein processing enzyme essential for the viability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov  while it is generalized that clpro and the structurally related cpro viral peptidases cleave their substrates via a mechanism similar to that underlying the peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin like serine proteinases clsps  some of the hypothesized key intermediates have not been structurally characterized here we present three crystal structures of sars clpro in complex with each of two members of a new class of peptide based phthalhydrazide inhibitors both inhibitors form an unusual thiiranium ring with the nucleophilic sulfur atom of cys   trapping the enzyme s catalytic residues in configurations similar to the intermediate states proposed to exist during the hydrolysis of native substrates most significantly our crystallographic data are consistent with a scenario in which a water molecule possibly via indirect coordination from the carbonyl oxygen of thr  has initiated nucleophilic attack on the enzyme bound inhibitor our data suggest that this structure resembles that of the proposed tetrahedral intermediate during the deacylation step of normal peptidyl cleavage
