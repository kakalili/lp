functional domains of the hk  capsid maturation protease and the mechanisms of protein encapsidation
tailed double stranded dna bacteriophages and herpesviruses build capsids by co assembling a major capsid protein with an internal scaffolding protein that then exits from the assembled structure either intact or after digestion in situ by a protease in bacteriophage hk  the   residue n terminal delta domain of the major capsid protein is also removed by proteolysis after assembly and appears to perform the scaffolding function we describe the hk  protease that carries out these maturation cleavages insertion mutations at seven sites in the protease gene produced mutant proteins that assemble into proheads and those in the n terminal two thirds were enzymatically inactive plasmid expressed protease was rapidly cleaved in vivo but was stabilized by co expression with the delta domain purified protease was found to be active during the assembly of proheads in vitro heterologous fusions to the intact protease or to c terminal fragments targeted fusion proteins into proheads we confirm that the catalytic activity resides in the n terminal two thirds of the protease polypeptide and suggest that the c terminal one fifth of the protein contains a capsid targeting signal the implications of this arrangement are compared to capsid targeting systems in other phages herpesviruses and encapsulins
