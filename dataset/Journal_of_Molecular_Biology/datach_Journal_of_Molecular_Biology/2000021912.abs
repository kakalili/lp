resolution of tethered antiparallel and parallel holliday junctions by the flp site specific recombinase edited by m yaniv
members of the integrase family site specific recombinases also called the tyrosine family bring about recombination in two steps by exchanging pairs of single strands at a time the product of the first exchange reaction is a four way dna junction the holliday intermediate the conformational dynamics by which the recombination complex  isomerizes  from the holliday forming to the holliday resolving mode are not well understood experiments with the lambda int and escherichia coli xerc xerd systems imply that the strand configurations at the branch point of the protein free junction dictate the resolution mode in the protein bound junction we have examined the question of strand bias during resolution for the flp system by using a series of synthetic holliday junctions that are conformationally constrained by local sequences or by strand tethering we have not observed a strong resolution bias in favor of the strands designed to assume the  crossed  configuration within the unbound junction the resolution patterns with antiparallel junctions in a variety of substrate contexts reveal either parity in strand choice or only modest disparity on the other hand the highly biased resolutions observed in the case of tethered parallel junctions can be explained by the non equivalence in protein occupancy of the dna arms of these substrates and or inefficient conversion of cleavage events to recombinants at the tethered ends
