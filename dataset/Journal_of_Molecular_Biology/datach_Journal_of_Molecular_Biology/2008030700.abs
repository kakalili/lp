crystal structures of the streptomyces coelicolor tetr like protein actr alone and in complex with actinorhodin or the actinorhodin biosynthetic precursor s dnpa
actinorhodin an antibiotic produced by streptomyces coelicolor is exported from the cell by the acta efflux pump acta is divergently transcribed from actr which encodes a tetr like transcriptional repressor we showed previously that actr represses transcription by binding to an operator from the acta actr intergenic region importantly actinorhodin itself or various actinorhodin biosynthetic intermediates can cause actr to dissociate from its operator leading to derepression this suggests that actr may mediate timely self resistance to an endogenously produced antibiotic by responding to one of its biosynthetic precursors here we report the structural basis for this precursor mediated derepression with crystal structures of homodimeric actr by itself and in complex with either actinorhodin or the actinorhodin biosynthetic intermediate s dnpa  dihydro  hydroxy  methyl  oxo  h naphtho   c pyran  s acetic acid  the ligand binding tunnel in each actr monomer has a striking hydrophilic hydrophobic hydrophilic arrangement of surface residues that accommodate either one hexacyclic actinorhodin molecule or two back to back tricyclic s dnpa molecules moreover our work also reveals the strongest structural evidence to date that tetr mediated antibiotic resistance may have been acquired from an antibiotic producer organism
