the asymmetric trimeric architecture of  fe  s iscu implications for its scaffolding during iron  sulfur cluster biosynthesis
iscu is a key component of the isc machinery and is involved in the biogenesis of iron  sulfur fe  s proteins iscu serves as a scaffold for assembly of a nascent fe  s cluster prior to its delivery to an apo protein here we report the first crystal structure of iscu with a bound  fe  s cluster from the hyperthermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus determined at a resolution of     using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction of the cluster the holo iscu formed a novel asymmetric trimer that harbored only one  fe  s cluster one iron atom of the cluster was coordinated by the s  atom of cys  and the n  atom of his   and the other was coordinated by the s  atoms of cys  and cys  on the surface of just one of the protomers however the cluster was buried inside the trimer between the neighboring protomers the three protomers were conformationally distinct from one another and associated around a noncrystallographic pseudo  fold axis the three flexible loop regions carrying the ligand binding residues cys  cys  his  and cys   and the n terminal   helices were positioned at the interfaces and underwent substantial conformational rearrangement which stabilized the association of the asymmetric trimer this unique trimeric a aeolicus holo iscu architecture was clearly distinct from other known monomeric apo iscu sufu structures indicating that asymmetric trimer organization as well as its association dissociation would be involved in the scaffolding function of iscu
