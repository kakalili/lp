characterization of dnmt b thymine dna glycosylase interaction and stimulation of thymine glycosylase mediated repair by dna methyltransferase s and rna
methylation of cytosine residues in cpg dinucleotides plays an important role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure stability in higher eukaryotes dna methylation patterns are established and maintained at cpg dinucleotides by dna methyltransferases dnmt  dnmt a and dnmt b  in mammals and many other eukaryotes the cpg dinucleotide is underrepresented in the genome this loss is postulated to be the result of unrepaired deamination of cytosine and  methylcytosine to uracil and thymine respectively two thymine glycosylases are believed to reduce the impact of  methylcytosine deamination g t mismatch specific thymine dna glycosylase tdg and methyl cpg binding domain protein  can both excise uracil or thymine at u g and t g mismatches to initiate base excision repair here we report the characterization of interactions between dnmt b and both tdg and methyl cpg binding domain protein  our results demonstrate   that both tdg and dnmt b are colocalized to heterochromatin and   reduction of t g mismatch repair efficiency upon loss of dna methyltransferase expression as well as a requirement for an rna component for correct t g mismatch repair
