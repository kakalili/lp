three dimensional structures of idiotypically related fabs with intermediate and high affinity for fluorescein
multi disciplinary studies of fluorescein  protein conjugates have led to the generation of a family of antibodies with common idiotypes and affinities for fluorescein ranging over five orders of magnitude the high affinity    prototype traps the ligand in a highly complementary binding slot which is lined by multiple aromatic side chains an antibody    of intermediate affinity belongs to the same idiotypic family as    and shares substantial amino acid identities within the vl and vh domains to establish the structural basis for the affinity differences we solved the crystal structure of the   fab  fluorescein complex at a resolution of    similar to       binds fluorescein in a tight aromatic slot with its xanthenonyl ring system accommodated by end on insertion however the combined effects of the amino acid substitutions have resulted in reorganization of the binding site with the hcdr loops showing the greatest differences in conformations access to the binding site of   is substantially more open leaving the fluorescein s phenylcarboxylate moiety partially exposed to solvent in addition to the usage of a different d diversity mini gene encoding the hcdr loop the decrease in fluorescein affinity in the   antibody family appears to be correlated with the substitution of histidine    for arginine     in position  of the antibody light chains
