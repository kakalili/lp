one target  two different binding modes structural insights into gevokizumab and canakinumab interactions to interleukin
interleukin   il   is a key orchestrator in inflammatory and several immune responses il   exerts its effects through interleukin  receptor type i il ri and interleukin  receptor accessory protein il racp  which together form a heterotrimeric signaling competent complex canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific il   monoclonal antibodies canakinumab is known to neutralize il   by competing for binding to il r and therefore blocking signaling by the antigen antibody complex gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates il   bioactivity by reducing the affinity for its il ri il racp signaling complex how il   signaling is affected by both canakinumab and gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined we have analyzed the crystal structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment fab as well as of their binary complexes with il   furthermore we characterized the epitopes on il   employed by the antibodies by nmr epitope mapping studies the direct comparison of nmr and x ray data shows that the epitope defined by the crystal structure encompasses predominantly those residues whose nmr resonances are severely perturbed upon complex formation the antigen fab co structures confirm the previously identified key contact residues on il   and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of il   signaling a significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of il r and canakinumab on il   causes competitive inhibition of the association of il   and its receptor in contrast gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on il   and complex formation results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to il ri this suggests two different mechanisms of il   pathway attenuation
