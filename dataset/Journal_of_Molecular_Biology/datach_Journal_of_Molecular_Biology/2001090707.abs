solution structure and dynamics of yeast elongin c in complex with a von hippel lindau peptide edited by m f summers
elongin is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates the rate of elongation by suppressing transient pausing by rna polymerase ii at many sites along the dna it is heterotrimeric in mammals consisting of elongins a b and c subunits and bears overall similarity to a class of e ubiquitin ligases known as scf skp cdc  cullin f box complexes a subcomplex of elongins b and c is a target for negative regulation by the von hippel lindau vhl tumor suppressor protein elongin c from saccharomyces cerevisiae elc  exhibits high sequence similarity to mammalian elongin c using nmr spectroscopy we have determined the three dimensional structure of elc in complex with a human vhl peptide vhl       representing the major elc binding site the bound vhl peptide is entirely helical elc utilizes two c terminal helices and an intervening loop to form a binding groove that fits vhl       chemical shift perturbation and dynamics analyses reveal that a global conformational change accompanies elc vhl      complex formation moreover the disappearance of conformational exchange phenomena on the microsecond to millisecond time scale within elc upon vhl peptide binding suggests a role for slow internal motions in ligand recognition
