structural and thermodynamic signatures of dna recognition by mycobacterium tuberculosis dnaa
an essential protein dnaa binds to  bp dna sites within the origin of replication oric these binding events are prerequisite to forming an enigmatic nucleoprotein scaffold that initiates replication the number sequences positions and orientations of these short dna sites or dnaa boxes within the orics of different bacteria vary considerably to investigate features of dnaa boxes that are important for binding mycobacterium tuberculosis dnaa mtdnaa  we have determined the crystal structures of the dna binding domain dbd of mtdnaa bound to a cognate mtdnaa box at     resolution and to a consensus escherichia coli dnaa box at      these structures complemented by calorimetric equilibrium binding studies of mtdnaa dbd in a series of dnaa box variants reveal the main determinants of dna recognition and establish the t c t a g a tccaca sequence as a high affinity mtdnaa box bioinformatic and calorimetric analyses indicate that dnaa box sequences in mycobacterial orics generally differ from the optimal binding sequence this sequence variation occurs commonly at the first  bp making an in vivo mycobacterial dnaa box effectively a  mer and not a  mer we demonstrate that the decrease in the affinity of these mtdnaa box variants for mtdnaa dbd relative to that of the highest affinity box ttgtccaca is less than  fold the understanding of dnaa box recognition by mtdnaa and e coli dnaa enables one to map dnaa box sequences in the genomes of m tuberculosis and other eubacteria
