knockdown of human oxa l impairs the biogenesis of f fo atp synthase and nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase
the oxa protein is a founding member of the evolutionarily conserved oxa alb yidc protein family which is involved in the biogenesis of membrane proteins in mitochondria chloroplasts and bacteria the predicted human homologue oxa l was originally identified by partial functional complementation of the respiratory growth defect of the yeast oxa mutant here we demonstrate that both the endogenous human oxa l with an apparent molecular mass of   kda and the oxa l flag chimeric protein localize exclusively to mitochondria in hek  cells furthermore human oxa l was found to be an integral membrane protein and using two dimensional blue native denaturing page the majority of the protein was identified as part of a      kda complex the stable short hairpin sh rna mediated knockdown of oxa l in hek  cells resulted in markedly decreased steady state levels and atp hydrolytic activity of the f fo atp synthase and moderately reduced levels and activity of nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i  however no significant accumulation of corresponding sub complexes could be detected on blue native immunoblots intriguingly the achieved depletion of oxa l protein did not adversely affect the assembly or activity of cytochrome c oxidase or the cytochrome bc complex taken together our results indicate that human oxa l represents a mitochondrial integral membrane protein required for the correct biogenesis of f fo atp synthase and nadh ubiquinone oxidoreductase
