conformational preferences underlying reduced activity of a thermophilic ribonuclease h
the conformational basis for reduced activity of the thermophilic ribonuclease hi enzyme from thermus thermophilus compared to its mesophilic homolog from escherichia coli is elucidated using a combination of nmr spectroscopy and molecular dynamics md simulations explicit solvent all atom md simulations of the two wild type proteins and an e coli mutant in which a glycine residue is inserted after position  to mimic the t thermophilus protein reproduce the differences in conformational dynamics determined from  n spin relaxation nmr spectroscopy of three loop regions that surround the active site and contain functionally important residues the glycine rich region the handle region and the    e loop examination of the md trajectories indicates that the thermophilic protein samples conformations productive for substrate binding and activity less frequently than the mesophilic enzyme although these differences may manifest as either increased or decreased relative flexibility of the different regions additional md simulations indicate that mutations increasing activity of the t thermophilus enzyme at mesophilic temperatures do so by reconfiguring the local environments of the mutated sites to more closely resemble active conformations taken together the results show that both locally increased and decreased flexibility contribute to an overall reduction in activity of t thermophilus ribonuclease h compared to its mesophilic e coli homolog
