We have applied laser UV photo-footprinting to characterise kinetically complexes involving the activator protein FIS, RNA polymerase and the tyrT promoter of Escherichia coli. FIS photo-footprints strongly to three binding sites upstream of the core promoter. The polymerase photo-footprints in the near-consensus −35 hexamer on the non-template strand of DNA in a fashion similar to that of stable complexes involving the lacUV5 promoter. The kinetics of the interactions of polymerase alone with the tyrT promoter differ from those observed previously at the lacUV5 promoter. In the absence of FIS, we observe an upstream polymerase-induced signal at −122 within FIS site III that occurs subsequent to changes in the core promoter region and is strongly dependent on negative supercoiling. These observations support the proposal that the upstream region of the promoter is wrapped around the polymerase. We propose that the wrapped DNA allows the polymerase to overcome, at least in part, the barrier to DNA untwisting imparted by the G+C-rich discriminator. We further suggest that FIS plays a similar role and may facilitate polymerase escape.
