ubiquitin receptor proteins hhr a and hplic interact
ubiquitin receptor proteins play an important role in delivering ubiquitylated protein substrates to the proteasome for degradation hhr a and hplic are two such ubiquitin receptors that contain ubiquitin like ubl domains which interact with the proteasome and ubiquitin associated uba domains which interact with ubiquitin depending on their abundance ubl uba family members can either promote or inhibit the degradation of other proteins which suggests their participation in the delivery of substrates to the proteasome is highly regulated in previous work we determined ubl uba domain interactions to promote intramolecular interactions in hhr a that are abrogated with the addition of either ubiquitin or the proteasome component s a in yeast we determined the hhr a ortholog rad  to interact with another ubl uba family member ddi  and to bind a common tetraubiquitin chain here we use nmr spectroscopy to reveal that hhr a interacts with hplic via ubl uba domain interactions and to map their binding surfaces in addition we demonstrate that these two proteins associate in mammalian cells intriguingly inhibition of the proteasome mitigates hhr a hplic interaction
