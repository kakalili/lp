walker a motif acts to coordinate atp hydrolysis with motor output in viral dna packaging
during the assembly of many viruses a powerful atp driven motor translocates dna into a preformed procapsid a walker a  p loop  motif is proposed to coordinate atp binding and hydrolysis with dna translocation we use genetic biochemical and biophysical techniques to survey the roles of p loop residues in bacteriophage lambda motor function we identify  point mutations that reduce virus yield to below detectable levels in a highly sensitive genetic complementation assay and  that cause varying reductions in yield most changes in the predicted conserved residues k  r  g  and s  produce no detectable yield biochemical analyses show that r a and s a mutant proteins fold assemble and display genome maturation activity similar to wild type wt but exhibit little atpase or dna packaging activity kinetic dna cleavage and atpase measurements implicate r  in motor ring assembly on dna supporting recent structural models that locate the p loop at the interface between motor subunits single molecule measurements detect no translocation for k a and k r while g a and s a exhibit strong impairments consistent with their predicted roles in atp binding we identify eight residue changes spanning a  k  that yield impaired translocation phenotypes and show that walker a residues play important roles in determining motor velocity pausing and processivity the efficiency of initiation of packaging correlates strongly with motor velocity frequent pausing and slipping caused by changes a v and r k suggest that these residues are important for atp alignment and coupling of atp binding to dna gripping our findings support recent structural models implicating the p loop arginine in atp hydrolysis and mechanochemical coupling
