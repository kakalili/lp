interrelationship between hiv  fitness and mutation rate
differences in replication fidelity as well as mutator and antimutator strains suggest that virus mutation rates are heritable and prone to natural selection human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  has many distinct advantages for the study of mutation rate optimization given the wealth of structural and biochemical data on hiv  reverse transcriptase rt and mutants in this study we conducted parallel analyses of mutation rate and viral fitness in particular a panel of  rt mutants  most having drug resistance phenotypes  was analyzed for their effects on viral fidelity and fitness fidelity differences were measured using single cycle vector assays while fitness differences were identified using ex vivo head to head competition assays as anticipated virus mutants possessing either higher or lower fidelity had a corresponding loss in fitness while the virus panel was not chosen randomly it is interesting that it included more viruses possessing a mutator phenotype rather than viruses possessing an antimutator phenotype these observations provide the first description of an interrelationship between hiv  fitness and mutation rate and support the conclusion that mutator and antimutator phenotypes correlate with reduced viral fitness in addition the findings here help support a model in which fidelity comes at a cost of replication kinetics and may help explain why retroviruses like hiv  and rna viruses maintain replication fidelity near the extinction threshold
