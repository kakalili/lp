coupled unfolding and dimerization by the pah domain of the mammalian sin a corepressor
coregulator recruitment by sequence specific dna binding transcription factors constitutes an important step in many eukaryotic transcription regulatory pathways the sin corepressor is an evolutionarily conserved protein and a key component of a large histone deacetylase associated corepressor complex the sin corepressor contains four imperfect repeats of a domain called pah paired amphipathic helix that serve as docking sites for a variety of sequence specific dna binding factors and coregulators at least two closely related sin proteins designated sin a and sin b have been described in higher organisms and although functional differences between these paralogs are only beginning to be appreciated differences at the structural level are poorly understood here we analyze the conformational properties of the apo form of the mammalian sin a msin a pah domain at low micromolar concentrations the domain is predominantly monomeric and folded in a conformation similar to those found in complexes with the mad and hbp repressors unexpectedly at higher concentrations the domain dimerizes with concomitant population of a partially unfolded conformer these findings are in contrast to those reported for the msin b pah domain and may have implications for the manner in which these paralogous domains interact with their targets
