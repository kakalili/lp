differences in the electrostatic surfaces of the type iii secretion needle proteins prgi bsal and mxih
gram negative bacteria use a needle like protein assembly the type iii secretion apparatus to inject virulence factors into target cells to initiate human disease the needle is formed by the polymerization of    copies of a small acidic protein that is conserved among diverse pathogens we previously reported the structure of the bsal needle monomer from burkholderia pseudomallei by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and others have determined the crystal structure of the shigella flexneri mxih needle here we report the nmr structure of the prgi needle protein of salmonella typhimurium a human pathogen associated with food poisoning prgi bsal and mxih form similar two helix bundles however the electrostatic surfaces of prgi differ radically from those of bsal or mxih in bsal and mxih a large negative area is on a face formed by the helix      interface in prgi the major negatively charged surface is not on the  face  but instead is on the  side  of the two helix bundle and only residues from helix   contribute to this negative region despite being highly acidic proteins these molecules contain large basic regions suggesting that electrostatic contacts are important in needle assembly our results also suggest that needle packing interactions may be different among these bacteria and provide the structural basis for why prgi and mxih despite   sequence identity are not interchangeable in s typhimurium and s flexneri
