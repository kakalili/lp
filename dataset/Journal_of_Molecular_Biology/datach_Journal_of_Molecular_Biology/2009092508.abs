crystal structures of wzb of escherichia coli and cpsb of streptococcus pneumoniae representatives of two families of tyrosine phosphatases that regulate capsule assembly
many gram positive and gram negative bacteria utilize polysaccharide surface layers called capsules to evade the immune system consequently the synthesis and export of the capsule are a potential therapeutic target in escherichia coli k   the integral membrane tyrosine autokinase wzc and the cognate phosphatase wzb have been shown to be key for both synthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides in the gram positive bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae the cpscd complex is analogous to wzc and the phosphatase cpsb is the corresponding cognate phosphatase the phosphatases are known to dephosphorylate their corresponding autokinases yet despite their functional equivalence they share no sequence homology we present the structure of wzb in complex with phosphate and high resolution structures of apo cpsb and a phosphate complexed cpsb we show that both proteins are active toward wzc and thereby demonstrate that cpsb is not specific for cpscd cpsb is a novel enzyme and represents the first solved structure of a tyrosine phosphatase from a gram positive bacterium wzb and cpsb have completely different structures suggesting that they must operate by very different mechanisms although the mechanism of wzb can be inferred from previous studies cpsb appears to have a tyrosine phosphatase mechanism not observed before we propose a chemical mechanism for cpsb based on site directed mutagenesis and structural data
