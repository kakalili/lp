ribosome induces a closed to open conformational change in release factor
bacterial translation termination is triggered when a stop codon arrives at the ribosomal a site stop codons are recognized by class i release factors rf and rf in escherichia coli  which bind to the ribosome and catalyze the release of the newly synthesized protein crystal structures showed that rf and rf are in an open conformation when bound to the ribosome but are in a closed conformation when not bound to the ribosome it is not clear whether only the open form of rf and rf binds to the ribosome alternatively the closed form of rf and rf may bind to the ribosome and undergo a conformational change to the open state upon binding we used transition metal ion fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments to monitor precisely the conformation of rf in the absence and presence of the ribosome our results indicate that rf undergoes a large conformational change from a closed to an open form upon binding to the ribosome our results are consistent with the mechanism in which high termination fidelity is achieved by linking stop codon recognition by rf to the change in conformation from closed to open state
