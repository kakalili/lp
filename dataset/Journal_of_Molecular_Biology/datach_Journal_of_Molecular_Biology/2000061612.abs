the    crystal structure of bpi a study of how two dissimilar amino acid sequences can adopt the same fold edited by d rees
we have extended the resolution of the crystal structure of human bactericidal permeability increasing protein bpi to     bpi has two domains with the same fold but with little sequence similarity to understand the similarity in structure of the two domains we compare the corresponding residue positions in the two domains by the method of d d profiles a d d profile is a string formed by assigning each position in the d structure to one of  environment classes the environment classes are defined by the local secondary structure the area of the residue which is buried from solvent and the fraction of the area buried by polar atoms a structural alignment between the two bpi domains was used to compare the d d environments of structurally equivalent positions greater than   of the aligned positions have conserved d d environments but only   have conserved residue identities analysis of the d d environmentally conserved positions helps to identify pairs of residues likely to be important in conserving the fold regardless of the residue similarity we find examples of d d environmentally conserved positions with dissimilar residues which nevertheless play similar structural roles to generalize our findings we analyzed four other proteins with similar structures yet dissimilar sequences together these examples show that aligned pairs of dissimilar residues often share similar structural roles stabilizing dissimilar sequences in the same fold
