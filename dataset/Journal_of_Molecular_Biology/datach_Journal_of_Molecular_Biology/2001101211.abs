the crystal structure of bar headed goose hemoglobin in deoxy form the allosteric mechanism of a hemoglobin species with high oxygen affinity edited by a klug
the crystal structure of a high oxygen affinity species of hemoglobin bar headed goose hemoglobin in deoxy form has been determined to a resolution of     the r and rfree factor of the model are    and    respectively the structure reported here is a special deoxy state of hemoglobin and indicates the differences in allosteric mechanisms between the goose and human hemoglobins the quaternary structure of the goose deoxy hemoglobin shows obvious differences from that of human deoxy hemoglobin the rotation angle of one   dimer relative to its partner in a tetramer molecule from the goose oxy to deoxy hemoglobin is only    and the translation is only     which are much smaller than those in human hemoglobin in the    switch region of the goose deoxy hemoglobin the imidazole ring of his    does not span the side chain of thr    relative to the oxy hemoglobin as in human hemoglobin and the tertiary structure changes of heme pocket and fg corner are also smaller than that in human hemoglobin a unique mutation among avian and mammalian hbs of    from proline to alanine at the    interface in bar headed goose hemoglobin brings a gap between ala    and leu    the minimum distance between the two residues is     at the entrance to the central cavity around the molecular dyad some residues of two  chains form a positively charged groove where the inositol pentaphosphate binds to the hemoglobin the his    is at the inositol pentaphosphate binding site and the salt bridge between his    and asp   does not exist in the deoxy hemoglobin which brings the weak chloride independent bohr effect to bar headed goose hemoglobin
