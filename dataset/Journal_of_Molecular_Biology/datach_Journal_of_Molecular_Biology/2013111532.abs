the n terminal extension of ube e ubiquitin conjugating enzymes limits chain assembly
protein ubiquitylation depends upon the concerted action of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes e s and ubiquitin ligases e s  all e s have a conserved ubiquitin conjugating ubc domain but many have variable extensions n and c terminal to the ubc domain for many e s the function of the extension is not well understood here we show that the n terminal extension of the ube e proteins regulates formation of polyubiquitin chains by the processive ubc domain target proteins are therefore monoubiquitylated by full length ube e whereas the ubc domain alone polyubiquitylates proteins although the n terminal extension of ube e is largely disordered in solution these residues have a critical role in limiting chain building and when fused to the highly processive e  ube d  ubiquitylation is limited for some e s interaction of ubiquitin with the  backside  of the ubc domain promotes polyubiquitylation however interaction of ubiquitin with the backside of the ubc domain of ube e does not appear to be important for processivity this study underscores the importance of studying full length e proteins and not just the highly conserved core domain
