refined model of the  s conformation of smooth muscle myosin by cryo electron microscopy d image reconstruction
the actin activated atpase activity of smooth muscle myosin and heavy meromyosin smhmm is regulated by phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain rlc  complete regulation requires two intact myosin heads because single headed myosin subfragments are always active  d crystalline arrays of the  s form of intact myosin which has a dephosphorylated rlc were produced on a positively charged lipid monolayer and imaged in d at   nm resolution by cryo electron microscopy of frozen hydrated specimens an atomic model of smooth muscle myosin was constructed from the x ray structures of the smooth muscle myosin motor domain and essential light chain and a homology model of the rlc was produced based on the skeletal muscle s structure the initial model of the  s myosin based on the previous reconstruction of smhmm was subjected to real space refinement to obtain a quantitative fit to the density the smhmm was likewise refined and both refined models reveal the same asymmetric interaction between the upper  kda domain of the  blocked  head and parts of the catalytic converter domains and the essential light chain of the  free  head observed previously this observation suggests that this interaction is not simply due to crystallographic packing but is enforced by elements of the myosin heads the  s reconstruction shows additional  helical coiled coil not seen in the earlier smhmm reconstruction but the location of one segment of s is the same in both
