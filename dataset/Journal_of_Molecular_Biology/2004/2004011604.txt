Protein recognition is one of the most challenging and intriguing problems in structural biology. Despite all the available structural, sequence and biophysical information about protein–protein complexes, the physico-chemical patterns, if any, that make a protein surface likely to be involved in protein–protein interactions, remain elusive. Here, we apply protein docking simulations and analysis of the interaction energy landscapes to identify protein–protein interaction sites. The new protocol for global docking based on multi-start global energy optimization of an all-atom model of the ligand, with detailed receptor potentials and atomic solvation parameters optimized in a training set of 24 complexes, explores the conformational space around the whole receptor without restrictions. The ensembles of the rigid-body docking solutions generated by the simulations were subsequently used to project the docking energy landscapes onto the protein surfaces. We found that highly populated low-energy regions consistently corresponded to actual binding sites. The procedure was validated on a test set of 21 known protein–protein complexes not used in the training set. As much as 81% of the predicted high-propensity patch residues were located correctly in the native interfaces. This approach can guide the design of mutations on the surfaces of proteins, provide geometrical details of a possible interaction, and help to annotate protein surfaces in structural proteomics.
