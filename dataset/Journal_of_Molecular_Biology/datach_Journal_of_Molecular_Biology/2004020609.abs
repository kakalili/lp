binding of p  derived ligands to mdm induces a variety of long range conformational changes
we have used nmr to study the effects of peptide binding on the n terminal p  binding domain of human mdm  residues      there were changes in hsqc chemical shifts throughout the domain on binding four different p  derived peptide ligands that were significantly large to be indicative of global conformational changes large changes in chemical shift were observed in two main regions the peptide binding cleft that directly binds the p  ligands and the hinge regions connecting the  sheet and  helical structures that form the binding cleft these conformational changes reflect the adaptation of the cleft on binding peptide ligands that differ in length and amino acid composition different ligands may induce different conformational transitions in mdm that could be responsible for its function the dynamic nature of mdm might be important in the design of anti cancer drugs that are targeted to its p  binding site
