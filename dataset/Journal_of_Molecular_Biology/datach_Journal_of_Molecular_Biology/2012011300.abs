protein hot spots the islands of stability
understanding the structural basis of protein  protein interactions ppis may shed light on the organization and functioning of signal transduction and metabolic networks and may assist in structure based design of ligands drugs targeting protein  protein interfaces the residues at the bimolecular interface designated as the hot spots contribute most of the free binding energy of ppi to date there is no conclusive atomistic explanation for the unique functional properties of the hot spots we hypothesized that backbone compliance may play a role in protein  protein recognition and in the mechanism of binding of small molecule compounds to protein surfaces we used a steered molecular dynamics simulation to explore the compliance properties of the backbone of surface exposed residues in several model proteins interleukin  mouse double minute protein  and proliferating cell nuclear antigen we demonstrated that protein surfaces exhibit distinct patterns in which highly immobile residues form defined clusters   stability patches   alternating with areas of moderate to high mobility these  stability patches  tend to localize in functionally important regions involved in protein  protein recognition we propose a mechanism by which the distinct structural organization of the hot spots may contribute to their role in mediating ppi and facilitating binding of structurally diverse small molecule compounds to protein surfaces
