structure of bacteriocin as   from soluble state to membrane bound state
the bacteriocin as  is a membrane interacting peptide which displays a broad anti microbial spectrum against gram positive and gram negative bacteria the nmr structure of as  at ph  has been solved the analysis of this structure suggests that the mechanism of as  anti bacterial activity involves the accumulation of positively charged molecules at the membrane surface leading to a disruption of the membrane potential here we report the high resolution crystal structure of as  and sedimentation equilibrium experiments showing that this bacteriocin is able to adopt different oligomeric structures according to the physicochemical environment the analysis of these structures suggests a mechanism for molecular function of as  involving a transition from a water soluble form to a membrane bound state upon membrane binding
