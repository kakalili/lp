prokaryotic ubiquitin like protein pup is intrinsically disordered
the prokaryotic ubiquitin like protein pup targets substrates for degradation by the mycobacterium tuberculosis proteasome through its interaction with mpa an atpase that is thought to abut the  s catalytic subunit ubiquitin which is assembled into a polymer to similarly signal for proteasomal degradation in eukaryotes adopts a stable and compact structural fold that is adapted into other proteins for diverse biological functions we used nmr spectroscopy to demonstrate that unlike ubiquitin the  amino acid protein pup is intrinsically disordered with small helical propensity in the c terminal region we found that the pup mpa interaction involves an extensive contact surface that spans s   k  and that the binding is in the  slow exchange  regime on the nmr time scale thus demonstrating higher affinity than most ubiquitin ubiquitin receptor pairs interestingly during the titration experiment intermediate pup species were observable suggesting the formation of one or more transient state s upon binding moreover mpa selected one configuration for a region undergoing chemical exchange in the free protein these findings provide mechanistic insights into pup s functional role as a degradation signal
