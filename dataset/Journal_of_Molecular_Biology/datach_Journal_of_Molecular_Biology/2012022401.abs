metal binding dictates conformation and function of the amyloid precursor protein app e domain
the amyloid precursor protein app and its neurotoxic cleavage product a  are key players in the development of alzheimer s disease and appear essential for neuronal development and cell homeostasis in mammals proteolytic processing of app is influenced by metal ions protein ligands and its oligomerization state however the structural basis and functional mechanism of app regulation are hitherto largely unknown here we identified a metal dependent molecular switch located within the e domain of app containing four evolutionary highly conserved histidine residues three x ray structures of the metal bound molecule were solved at        resolution using protein crystallographic and biochemical methods we characterized this novel high affinity binding site within the e domain that binds competitively to copper and zinc at physiological concentrations metal specific coordination spheres induce large conformational changes and enforce distinct structural states most likely regulating the physiological function of app and its processing in alzheimer s disease
