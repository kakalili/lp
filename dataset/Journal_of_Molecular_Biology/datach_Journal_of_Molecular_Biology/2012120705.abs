analysis of structure  function relationships in the colibactin maturating enzyme clbp
pks genomic island of escherichia coli is involved in the synthesis of the non ribosomal peptide type genotoxin colibactin which has been suggesting as affecting the host immune response and having an impact on cancer development the pks encoded enzyme clbp is an atypical peptidase that contributes to the synthesis of colibactin in this work we identified key features of clbp bacterial fractionation and western blot analysis revealed the docking of clbp to the bacterial inner membrane via a c terminal domain harboring three predicted transmembrane helices whereas only one helix was necessary for the location in the inner membrane the complete sequence of the c terminal domain was necessary for clbp bioactivity in addition the n terminal sequence of clbp allowed the srp sec yidc and mreb dependent translocation of the enzymatic domain in the periplasmic compartment a feature also essential for clbp bioactivity finally the comparison of clbp structure with that of the paralogs fmta like and ampc revealed at an extremity of the catalytic groove a negative electrostatic potential surface characteristic of clbp site directed mutagenesis experiments identified in this zone two aspartic residues that were important for clbp bioactivity overall these results suggest a model for precolibactin activation by clbp and pave a way for the design of inhibitors targeting colibactin production
