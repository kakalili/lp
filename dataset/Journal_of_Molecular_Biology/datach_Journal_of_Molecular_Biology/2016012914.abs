c terminal threonine reduces a   amyloidogenicity compared with a
a   a product of the proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein app is related to a   by an additional thr residue at the c terminus a   is typically generated at low levels compared with the predominant a   and a   forms but it has been suggested that this longer peptide might have an impact on amyloid  aggregation and alzheimer s disease that is out of proportion to its brain content here we report that both a   and a   spontaneously aggregate into mature amyloid fibrils via sequential appearance of the same series of oligomeric and protofibrillar intermediates the earliest of which appears to lack  structure in spite of the additional  branched amino acid at the c terminus a   fibrils have fewer strong backbone h bonds than a   fibrils some of which are lost at the c terminus in contrast to previous reports we found that a   spontaneously aggregates more slowly than a   in addition a   fibrils are very inefficient at seeding a   amyloid formation even though a   fibrils efficiently seed amyloid formation by a   monomers finally mixtures of a   and a   aggregate more slowly than a   alone both in this a   a   co aggregation reaction and in cross seeding by a   fibrils the structure of the a   in the product fibrils is influenced by the presence of a   the results provide new details of amyloid structure and assembly pathways an example of structural plasticity in prion like replication and data showing that low levels of a   in the brain are unlikely to favorably impact the aggregation of a
