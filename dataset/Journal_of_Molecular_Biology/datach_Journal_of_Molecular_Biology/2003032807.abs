reversible amyloid formation by the p  tetramerization domain and a cancer associated mutant
the tetramerization domain for wild type p  p tet wt and a p  mutant r  h p tet r  h  associated with adrenocortical carcinoma acc in children can be converted from the soluble native state to amyloid like fibrils under certain conditions circular dichroism fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and staining with congo red and thioflavin t showed that p tet wt and p tet r  h adopt an alternative  sheet conformation p tet wt  and p tet r  h   respectively  characteristic of amyloid like fibrils when incubated at ph   and elevated temperatures electron micrographs showed that the alternative conformations for p tet wt p tet wt   and p tet r  h p tet r  h   were supramolecular structures best described as  molecular ribbons   ft ir analysis demonstrated that the mechanism of amyloid like fibril formation involved unfolding of the p tet wt  strands followed by unfolding of the  helices followed finally by formation of  strand containing structures that other methods showed were amyloid like ribbons the mutant p tet r  h had a significantly higher propensity to form amyloid like fibrils both p tet wt ph   and p tet r  h ph   and    when incubated at room temperature   c for one month were converted to molecular ribbons in addition p tet r  h and not p tet wt readily formed ribbons at ph   and   c over  hours interestingly unlike other amyloid forming proteins p tet wt  and p tet r  h  disassembled and refolded to the native tetramer conformation when the solution ph was raised from   to   although fibril formation at ph   was concentration and temperature dependent fibril disassembly at ph   was independent of both finally we propose that the significantly higher propensity of the mutant to form ribbons compared to the wild type may provide a possible mechanism for the observed nuclear accumulation of p  in acc cells and other cancerous cells
