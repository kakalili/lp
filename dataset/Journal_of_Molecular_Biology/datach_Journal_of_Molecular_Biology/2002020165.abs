bacteriophage p  portal vertex formation in vivo edited by m f moody
bacteriophage with double stranded linear dna genomes package dna into pre assembled icosahedral procapsids through a unique vertex the packaging vertex contains an oligomeric ring of a portal protein that serves as a recognition site for the packaging enzymes a conduit for dna translocation and the site of tail attachment previous studies have suggested that the portal protein of bacteriophage p  is not essential for shell assembly however when assembled in the absence of functional portal protein the assembled heads are not active in vitro packaging assays in terms of head assembly this raises an interesting question how are portal vertices defined during morphogenesis if their incorporation is not a requirement for head assembly to address this the p  portal gene was cloned into an inducible expression vector and transformed into the p  host salmonella typhimurium to allow control of the dosage of portal protein during infections using pulse chase radiolabeling it was determined that the portal protein is recruited into virion during head assembly surprisingly over expression of the portal protein during wild type p  infection caused a dramatic reduction in the yield of infectious virus the cause of this reduction was traced to two potentially related phenomena first excess portal protein caused aberrant head assembly resulting in the formation of t   procapsid like particles plps with twice the normal amount of portal protein second maturation of the plps was blocked during dna packaging resulting in the accumulation of empty plps within the host in addition to plps with normal morphology smaller heads apparently t   and aberrant spirals were also produced interestingly maturation of the small heads was relatively efficient resulting in the formation of small mature particles that were tailed and contained a head full of dna these data suggest that incorporation of portal vertices into heads occurs during growth of the coat lattice at decision points that dictate head assembly fidelity
