combinatorial design of an anticalin directed against the extra domain b for the specific targeting of oncofetal fibronectin
the oncofetal isoform of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin fn  which carries the extra domain b ed b and is exclusively expressed in neovasculature has gained interest for tumor diagnosis and therapy using engineered antibody fragments we have employed the human lipocalin  lcn  as a small and robust non immunoglobulin scaffold to select ed b specific anticalins from a new advanced random library using bacterial phage display and elisa screening against appropriately engineered fn fragments as a result we have isolated and biochemically characterized four different anticalins that all show low nanomolar affinities for ed b right in the range between the monomeric and dimeric forms of the single chain variable antibody fragment l  that has been widely applied in this area before all anticalins can be readily expressed in escherichia coli as soluble and strictly monomeric proteins and they show specific staining of ed b positive tumor cells in immunofluorescence microscopy while biacore affinity analyses indicate recognition of distinct ed b epitopes the crystal structure for one anticalin n a in complex with the fn b fragment was solved at    resolution and reveals binding to the gfcc  sheet and cc  loop on ed b this is the second example of a protein specific lcn based anticalin which illustrates the remarkable plasticity of the calyx like ligand pocket of lipocalins with their four structurally hypervariable loops supported by a highly conserved  barrel the ed b specific anticalins resulting from this study should provide useful reagents in research and biomedical drug development both for in vivo imaging and for directed cancer therapy
