decoding the molecular design principles underlying ca  binding to   crystallin motifs
numerous proteins belonging to the recently expanded   crystallin superfamily bind ca  at the double clamp n d n d x x s t s motif however there have been no attempts to understand the intricacies involving ca  binding such as the determinants of ca  binding affinity and their contributions to gain in stability this work is an in depth analysis of understanding the modes and determinants of ca  binding to   crystallin motifs we have performed extensive naturally occurring substitutions from related proteins on the   crystallin domains of flavollin a low affinity ca  binding protein and clostrillin a moderate affinity protein we monitored the consequences of these modifications on ca  binding by isothermal titration calorimetry thermal stability and conformational and crystal structure analyses we demonstrate that ca  binding to the two sites of a   domain is interdependent and that the presence of arg at the fifth position disables a site a change from thr to ser or vice versa influences ca  binding affinity highlighting the basis of diversity found in these domains a subtle change in the first site has a greater influence on ca  binding than a similar alteration in the second site thus the second site is more variable in nature replacing an acidic or hydrophobic residue in a binding site alters the ca  binding properties drastically while it appears from their binding site sequence that these domains have evolved randomly our examination illustrates the subtlety in the design of these modules decoding such design schemes would aid in our understanding of the functional themes underlying differential ca  binding and in predicting these in emerging sequence information
