evolved to be active sulfate ions define substrate recognition sites of ck  and emphasise its exceptional role within the cmgc family of eukaryotic protein kinases
ck  is the catalytic subunit of protein kinase ck and a member of the cmgc family of eukaryotic protein kinases like the cyclin dependent kinases the map kinases and glycogen synthase kinase  we present here a     resolution crystal structure of a fully active c terminal deletion mutant of human ck  liganded by two sulfate ions and we compare this structure systematically with representative structures of related cmgc kinases the two sulfate anions occupy binding pockets at the activation segment and provide the structural basis of the acidic consensus sequence s t d e x d e that governs substrate recognition by ck  the anion binding sites are conserved among those cmgc kinases in most cases they are neutralized by phosphorylation of a neighbouring threonine or tyrosine side chain which triggers conformational changes for regulatory purposes ck   however lacks both phosphorylation sites at the activation segment and structural plasticity here the anion binding sites are functionally changed from regulation to substrate recognition these findings underline the exceptional role of ck  as a constitutively active enzyme within a family of strictly controlled protein kinases
