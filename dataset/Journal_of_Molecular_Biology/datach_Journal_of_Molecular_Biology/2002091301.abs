a model binding site for testing scoring functions in molecular docking
prediction of interaction energies between ligands and their receptors remains a major challenge for structure based inhibitor discovery much effort has been devoted to developing scoring schemes that can successfully rank the affinities of a diverse set of possible ligands to a binding site for which the structure is known to test these scoring functions well characterized experimental systems can be very useful here mutation created binding sites in t lysozyme were used to investigate how the quality of atomic charges and solvation energies affects molecular docking atomic charges and solvation energies were calculated for     molecules in the available chemicals directory using a semi empirical quantum mechanical approach by the program amsol   http  t chem umn edu amsol the database was first screened against the apolar cavity site created by the mutation leu   ala l a  compared to the electronegativity based charges that are widely used the new charges and desolvation energies improved ranking of known apolar ligands and better distinguished them from more polar isosteres that are not observed to bind to investigate whether the new charges had predictive value the non polar residue met   which forms part of the binding site was changed to the polar residue glutamine the structure of the resulting leu   ala and met   gln double mutant of t lysozyme l a m  q was determined and the docking calculation was repeated for the new site seven representative polar molecules that preferentially docked to the polar versus the apolar binding site were tested experimentally all seven bind to the polar cavity l a m  q but do not detectably bind to the apolar cavity l a  five ligand bound structures of l a m  q were determined by x ray crystallography docking predictions corresponded to the crystallographic results to within    rmsd improved treatment of partial atomic charges and desolvation energies in database docking appears feasible and leads to better distinction of true ligands simple model binding sites such as l a and its more polar variants may find broad use in the development and testing of docking algorithms
