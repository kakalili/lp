structure of crme a virus encoded tumour necrosis factor receptor
vaccinia virus vacv  the smallpox vaccine encodes many proteins that subvert the host immune response one of these cytokine response modifier e crme  is secreted by infected cells and protects these cells from apoptotic challenge by tumour necrosis factor alpha tnf   we have expressed recombinant crme from vacv strain lister in escherichia coli shown that the purified protein is monomeric in solution and competent to bind tnf  and solved the structure to     resolution this is the first structure of a virus encoded tumour necrosis factor receptor tnfr  crme shares significant sequence similarity with mammalian type  tnf receptors tnfsfr b p  tnfr type   the structure confirms that crme adopts the canonical tnfr fold but only one of the two  ligand binding  loops of tnfrsf a is conserved in crme suggesting a mechanism for the higher affinity of poxvirus tnfrs for tnf  over lymphotoxin   the roles of dimerisation and pre  ligand assembly domains plads in poxvirus and mammalian tnfr activity are discussed
