error rate and specificity of human and murine dna polymerase   edited by m yaniv
we describe here the error specificity of mammalian dna polymerase   pol   an enzyme that performs translesion dna synthesis and may participate in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes both mouse and human pol  lack intrinsic proofreading exonuclease activity and both copy undamaged dna inaccurately analysis of more than   single base substitutions by human pol  indicates that error rates for all  mismatches are high and variable depending on the composition and symmetry of the mismatch and its location pol  also generates tandem base substitutions at an unprecedented rate and kinetic analysis indicates that it extends a tandem double mismatch about as efficiently as other replicative enzymes extend single base mismatches this ability to use an aberrant primer terminus and the high rate of single and double base substitutions support the idea that pol  may forego strict shape complementarity in order to facilitate highly efficient lesion bypass relaxed discrimination is further indicated by pol  infidelity for a wide variety of nucleotide deletion and addition errors the nature and location of these errors suggest that some may be initiated by strand slippage while others result from additional mechanisms
