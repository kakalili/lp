penicillin binding protein x of streptococcus pneumoniae three new mutational pathways for remodelling an essential enzyme into a resistance determinant
mutations in the transpeptidase domain of penicillin binding protein x pbp x of streptococcus pneumoniae that reduce the affinity to beta lactams are important determinants of resistance to these antibiotics we have now analyzed in vitro and in vivo properties of pbp x variants from cefotaxime resistant laboratory mutants and a clinical isolate the patterns of two to four resistance specific mutations present in each of the proteins all of which are placed between   and    around the active site fall into three categories according to their positions in the three dimensional structure the first pbp x group is characterized by mutations at the end of helix   and carries the well known t  a change and or one mutation on the surface of the penicillin binding domain in close contact with the c terminal domain all group i proteins display very low acylation efficiencies      m   s   for cefotaxime the second class represented by pbp x of the mutant c  shows acylation efficiencies below   m   s   for both cefotaxime and benzylpenicillin and contains the mutation l  f at a critical site close to the active serine pbp x of the clinical isolate   reveals a third mutational pathway where at least the two mutations q  e and s  l are important for resistance and acylation efficiency is reduced for both beta lactams to around    m   s   in each group at least one mutation is located in close vicinity to the active site and mediates a resistance phenotype in vivo alone whereas other mutations might exhibit secondary effects only in context with other alterations
