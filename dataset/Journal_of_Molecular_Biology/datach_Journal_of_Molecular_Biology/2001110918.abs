helical structure of phospholamban in membrane bilayers edited by g von heijne
the regulation of calcium levels across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involves the complex interplay of several membrane proteins phospholamban is a  residue integral membrane protein that is involved in reversibly inhibiting the ca  pump and regulating the flow of ca ions across the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane during muscle contraction and relaxation the structure of phospholamban is central to its regulatory role using homonuclear rotational resonance nmr methods we show that the internuclear distances between   c leu and   c ala  in the cytoplasmic region between   c pro  and   c ala  in the juxtamembrane region and between   c leu  and   c cys  in the transmembrane domain of phospholamban are consistent with  helical secondary structure additional heteronuclear rotational echo double resonance nmr measurements confirm that the secondary structure is helical in the region of pro  and that there are no large conformational changes upon phosphorylation these results support the model of the phospholamban pentamer as a bundle of five long  helices the long extended helices provide a mechanism by which the cytoplasmic region of phospholamban interacts with residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the ca  pump
