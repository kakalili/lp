substitution of glu  by glutamine revealed the function of the second water molecule as a proton donor in the binuclear metal enzyme creatininase
creatininase is a binuclear zinc enzyme and catalyzes the reversible conversion of creatinine to creatine it exhibits an open  closed conformational change upon substrate binding and the differences in the conformations of tyr   trp   and the loop region containing trp  were evident in the enzyme  creatine complex when compared to those in the ligand free enzyme we have determined the crystal structure of the enzyme complexed with a  methylguanidine all subunits in the complex existed as the closed form and the binding mode of creatinine was estimated site directed mutagenesis revealed that the hydrophobic residues that show conformational change upon substrate binding are important for the enzyme activity we propose a catalytic mechanism of creatininase in which two water molecules have significant roles the first molecule is a hydroxide ion wat  that is bound as a bridge between the two metal ions and attacks the carbonyl carbon of the substrate the second molecule is a water molecule wat  that is bound to the carboxyl group of glu  and functions as a proton donor in catalysis the activity of the e  q mutant was very low and it was only partially restored by the addition of zncl or mncl  in the e  q mutant kcat is drastically decreased indicating that glu  is important for catalysis x ray crystallographic study and the atomic absorption spectrometry analysis of the e  q mutant  substrate complex revealed that the drastic decrease of the activity of the e  q was caused by not only the loss of one zn ion at the metal site but also a critical function of glu   which most likely exists for a proton transfer step through wat
