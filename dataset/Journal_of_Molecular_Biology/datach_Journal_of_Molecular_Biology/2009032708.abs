the calcium dependent and calcium independent membrane binding of synaptotagmin  two modes of c b binding
the ca  independent membrane interactions of the soluble c domains from synaptotagmin  syt  were characterized using a combination of site directed spin labeling and vesicle sedimentation the second c domain of syt  c b binds to membranes containing phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylcholine in a ca  independent manner with a lipid partition coefficient of approximately      m   a soluble fragment containing the first and second c domains of syt  c a and c b has a similar affinity but c a alone has no detectable affinity to phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylserine bilayers in the absence of ca  although the ca  independent membrane affinity of c b is modest it indicates that this domain will never be free in solution within the cell site directed spin labeling was used to obtain bilayer depth restraints and a simulated annealing routine was used to generate a model for the membrane docking of c b in the absence of ca  in this model the polybasic strand of c b forms the membrane binding surface for the domain however this face of c b does not penetrate the bilayer but is localized within the aqueous double layer when c b is bound this double layer location indicates that c b interacts in a purely electrostatic manner with the bilayer interface in the presence of ca  the membrane affinity of c b is increased approximately  fold and the domain rotates so that the ca  binding loops of c b insert into the bilayer this ca  triggered conformational change may act as a switch to modulate the accessibility of the polybasic face of c b and control interactions of syt with other components of the fusion machinery
