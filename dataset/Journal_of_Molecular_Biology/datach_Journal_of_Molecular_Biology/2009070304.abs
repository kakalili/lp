structure of the rna polymerase core binding domain of   reveals a likely conformational fracture point
transcription initiation by bacterial   rna polymerase requires a conformational change of the holopolymerase  dna complex driven by an enhancer binding protein although structures of the core polymerase and the more common   factor have been determined little is known about the structure of the   variant we report here the structure of an aquifex aeolicus   domain residues      which binds core rna polymerase the structure is composed of two distinct subdomains held together by a small conserved hydrophobic interface that appears to act as a fracture point in the structure the n terminal four helical subdomain has a negative surface and conserved residues that likely contact the core polymerase while the c terminal three helical bundle has a strongly positive patch that could contact dna sequence conservation indicates that these structural features are conserved and are important for the role of   in the polymerase complex
