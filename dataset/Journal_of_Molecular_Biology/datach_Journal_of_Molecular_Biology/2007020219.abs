constitutive promoter occupancy by the mbf  activator and chromatin modification of the developmental regulated sea urchin  h a histone gene
the tandemly repeated sea urchin   histone genes are developmentally regulated these genes are transcribed up to the early blastula stage and permanently silenced as the embryos approach gastrulation as previously described expression of  the  h a gene depends on the binding of the mbf  activator to the   enhancer while down regulation relies on the functional interaction between the   sns  insulator and the ga repeats located upstream of the enhancer as persistent mbf  binding and enhancer activity are detected in gastrula embryos we have studied the molecular mechanisms that prevent the bound mbf  from trans activating the h a promoter at this stage of development here we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to demonstrate that mbf  occupies its site regardless of the transcriptional state of the h a gene in addition we have mapped two nucleosomes specifically positioned on the enhancer and promoter regions of the repressed h a gene interestingly insertion of a   bp oligonucleotide between the enhancer and the tata box led to up regulation of the h a gene at gastrula stage possibly by changing the position of the tata nucleosome finally we found association of histone de acetylase and de acetylation and methylation of k of histone h on the promoter and insulator of the repressed h a chromatin these data argue for a role of a defined positioned nucleosome in the promoter and histone tail post translational modifications in the   insulator and   regulatory regions in the repression of the  h a gene despite the presence of the mbf  activator bound to the enhancer
