identification of novel peptide substrates for protein farnesyltransferase reveals two substrate classes with distinct sequence selectivities
prenylation is a posttranslational modification essential for the proper localization and function of many proteins farnesylation the attachment of a  carbon farnesyl group near the c terminus of protein substrates is catalyzed by protein farnesyltransferase ftase  farnesylation has received significant interest as a target for pharmaceutical development and farnesyltransferase inhibitors are in clinical trials as cancer therapeutics however as the total complement of prenylated proteins is unknown the ftase substrates responsible for farnesyltransferase inhibitor efficacy are not yet understood identifying novel prenylated proteins within the human proteome constitutes an important step towards understanding prenylation dependent cellular processes based on sequence preferences for ftase derived from analysis of known farnesylated proteins we selected and screened a library of small peptides representing the c termini of   human proteins for activity with ftase we identified  novel ftase substrates that exhibit multiple turnover mto reactivity within this library our library also contained  peptides that can be farnesylated by ftase only under single turnover sto conditions based on these results a second library was designed that yielded an additional  novel mto ftase substrates and  sto substrates the two classes of substrates exhibit different specificity requirements efficient mto reactivity correlates with the presence of a nonpolar amino acid at the a position and a phe met or gln at the terminal x residue consistent with the proposed ca a x sequence model in contrast the sequences of the sto substrates vary significantly more at both the a and the x residues and are not well described by current farnesylation algorithms these results improve the definition of prenyltransferase substrate specificity test the efficacy of substrate algorithms and provide valuable information about therapeutic targets finally these data illuminate the potential for in vivo regulation of prenylation through modulation of sto versus mto peptide reactivity with ftase
