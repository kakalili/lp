single amino acid substitutions in conserved extracellular domains of e cadherin differ in their functional consequences edited by m yaniv
the calcium dependent homophilic cell adhesion molecule e cadherin typically connects epithelial cells the extracellular portion of the mature transmembrane protein consists of five homologous domains the four sequences linking these domains contain the structural amino acid motif dxxd that is thought to be involved in direct calcium binding in gastric cancer patients mutations affecting this motif between the second and third domain are frequently seen in order to determine the functional significance of similar sequence alterations with regard to their location we analyzed single amino acid substitutions changing the dxxd motif to dxxa in each linker region according to a mutation found in gastric cancer d  a  the cdna sequences coding for dqnd dvld and dvnd were changed d  a d  a d  a respectively and stably expressed in e cadherin negative mda mb  s mammary carcinoma cells we found that the d  a and d  a mutations result in abnormal protein localization changes in the actin cytoskeleton markedly reduced homophilic cell adhesion and altered cell morphology unexpectetly the tumor associated d  a mutation but not the d  a mutation induced increased cell motility the d  a mutation only had slight functional consequences whereas cells expressing the d  a mutant did not differ from cells expressing the wild type molecule although the putative calcium binding motif dxxd is located at repetitive positions in the extracellular portion of e cadherin our results indicate that it has different functions depending on the location remarkably tumor cells select for mutations in the most critical domains resulting both in loss of function decreased cell adhesion and in gain of function increased cell motility  since multiple dxxd motifs are typically seen in other cadherins our structure function study is relevant for this gene family in general
