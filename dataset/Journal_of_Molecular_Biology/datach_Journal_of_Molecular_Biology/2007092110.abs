molecular basis of tropomyosin binding to tropomodulin an actin capping protein
the tropomodulin tmod family of proteins that cap the pointed slow growing end of actin filaments require tropomyosin tm for optimal function earlier studies identified two regions in tmod that bind the n terminus of tm though the ability of different isoforms to bind the two sites is controversial we used model peptides to determine the affinity and define the specificity of the highly conserved n termini of three short non muscle tms       tm for the two tmod binding sites using circular dichroism spectroscopy native gel electrophoresis and chemical crosslinking all tm peptides have high affinity for the second tmod binding site within residues        tm    nm   tm   tm      nm  but differ gt   fold for the first site residues      tm   nm undetectable at    m   tm   tm  residue   r in   q in  and   and to a lesser extent residue  s in   t in  and   are primarily responsible for the differences the functional consequence of the sequence differences is reflected in more effective inhibition of actin filament elongation by full length  tms than  tm in the presence of tmod  the binding sites of the two tmod peptides on a model tm peptide differ as defined by comparing  n h hsqc spectra of a  n labeled model tm peptide in both the absence and presence of tmod peptide the nmr and cd studies show that there is an increase in  helix upon tmod  tm complex formation indicating that intrinsically disordered regions of the two proteins become ordered upon binding a model proposed for the binding of tmod to actin and tm at the pointed end of the filament shows how the tmod  tm accentuates the asymmetry of the pointed end and suggests how subtle differences among tm isoforms may modulate actin filament dynamics
