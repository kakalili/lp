kinetic folding and assembly mechanisms differ for two homologous heptamers
here we investigate the time resolved folding and assembly mechanism of the heptameric co chaperonin protein   cpn  in vitro the structure of cpn  is conserved throughout nature seven  barrel subunits are non covalently assembled through  strand pairings in an overall doughnut like shape kinetic folding assembly experiments of chemically denatured cpn  from homo sapiens hmcpn  and aquifex aeolicus aacpn  were monitored by far uv circular dichroism and fluorescence we find the processes to be complex involving several kinetic steps and to differ between the mesophilic and hyper thermophilic proteins the hmcpn  molecules partition into two parallel pathways one involving polypeptide folding before protein  protein assembly and another in which inter protein interactions take place prior to folding in contrast the aacpn  molecules follow a single sequential path that includes initial monomer misfolding relaxation to productive intermediates and subsequently final folding and heptamer assembly an a aeolicus variant lacking the unique c terminal extension of aacpn  displays the same kinetic mechanism as aacpn  signifying that the tail is not responsible for the rapid misfolding step this study demonstrates that molecular details can overrule similarity of native state topology in defining apparent protein biophysical properties
