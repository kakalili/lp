the human  lactalbumin molten globule comparison of structural preferences at ph  and ph
structural investigations of molten globules provide an important contribution towards understanding protein folding pathways a close similarity between equilibrium molten globule states and kinetic species observed during refolding has been reported for several proteins however the experimental conditions and in particular the ph under which the equilibrium and kinetic species are studied often differ significantly for human  lactalbumin   la  the equilibrium molten globule is most often studied at ph   the so called a state while kinetic refolding experiments are performed at neutral ph   la contains a large number of acidic amino acid residues that may influence the properties of the molten globule differently at low and neutral ph in this study we investigate the structural preferences of the  la molten globule at ph  at the level of individual residues using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and compare these data with previous results obtained at ph   we show that differences exist in the conformational ensemble that describes the  la molten globule at these two ph values the molten globule at ph  is generally less stable than that at the low ph a state most notable are differences in the stability of structure for the c helix and the calcium binding loop that precedes it and differences in the contribution of long range hydrophobic contacts between the n terminal and c terminal regions of the  domain to the stability of the molten globule our results are discussed in the context of previous studies of the  la molten globule and can be used to reconcile apparent discrepancies in published data relating to the c helix in the light of our results the low ph a state may not be the best model for the kinetic molten globule observed during refolding of  la the ph dependent effects reported here for  la may be of relevance in comparisons of equilibrium and kinetic molten globules of other proteins
