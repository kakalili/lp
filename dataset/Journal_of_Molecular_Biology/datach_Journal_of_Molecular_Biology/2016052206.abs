the functional role of el  and eb  intersubunit bridge in the eukaryotic ribosome
during translation the two eukaryotic ribosomal subunits remain associated through  intersubunit bridges five of which are eukaryote specific these are mainly localized to the peripheral regions and are believed to stabilize the structure of the ribosome the functional importance of these bridges remains largely unknown here the essentiality of the eukaryote specific bridge eb  has been investigated the main component of this bridge is ribosomal protein el  that is composed of an n terminal globular domain a middle region and a long c terminal  helix the analysis of deletion mutants demonstrated that the globular domain and middle region of el  are essential for cell viability most likely functioning in ribosome assembly the eb  bridge formed by contacts between the c terminal  helix of el  and  s rrna in concert with additional stabilizing interactions involving either es or us  is dispensable for viability nevertheless el  mutants impaired in eb  bridge formation displayed slow growth phenotypes altered sensitivity resistance to translational inhibitors and enhanced hyperosmotic stress tolerance biochemical analyses determined that the eb  bridge contributes to the stability of ribosome subunit interactions in vitro  s subunits containing el  variants defective in eb  bridge formation failed to form  s ribosomes regardless of mg  concentration the reassociation of  s and mutant  s subunits was markedly improved in the presence of deacetylated trna emphasizing the importance of trnas during the subunit association we propose that the eb  bridge plays an important role in subunit joining and in optimizing ribosome functionality
