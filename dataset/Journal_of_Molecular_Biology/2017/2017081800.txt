Sixty years ago, the first protein structure of myoglobin was determined by John Kendrew and his colleagues; hemoglobin followed shortly thereafter. For quite some time, it seemed that only X-ray crystallography would be capable of determining the structure of proteins to high resolution. In recent years, cryo-electron microscopy has emerged as a viable alternative and indeed in many cases the preferred approach. It is capable of studying proteins that span a size range from several megadaltons to proteins as small as myoglobin and hemoglobin.
