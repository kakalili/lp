water dynamics in the large cavity of three lipid binding proteins monitored by  o magnetic relaxation dispersion
intracellular lipid binding proteins contain a large binding cavity filled with water molecules the role played by these water molecules in ligand binding is not well understood but their energetic and dynamic properties must be important for protein function here we use the magnetic relaxation dispersion mrd of the water  o resonance to investigate the water molecules in the binding cavity of three different lipid binding proteins heart fatty acid binding protein h fabp  ileal lipid binding protein i lbp and intestinal fatty acid binding protein i fabp  whereas about half of the crystallographically visible water molecules appear to be expelled by the ligand we find that ligand binding actually increases the number of water molecules within the cavity at   k the water molecules in the cavity exchange positions on a time scale of about ns and exchange with external water on longer time scales       s  exchange of water molecules among hydration sites within the cavity should be strongly coupled to ligand motion whereas a recent md simulation indicates that the structure of the cavity water resembles a bulk water droplet the present mrd results show that its dynamics is more than two orders of magnitude slower than in the bulk these findings may have significant implications for the strength specificity and kinetics of lipid binding
