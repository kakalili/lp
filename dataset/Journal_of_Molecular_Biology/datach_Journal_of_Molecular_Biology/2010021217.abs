organization structure and assembly of  carboxysomes determined by electron cryotomography of intact cells
carboxysomes are polyhedral inclusion bodies that play a key role in autotrophic metabolism in many bacteria using electron cryotomography we examined carboxysomes in their native states within intact cells of three chemolithoautotrophic bacteria we found that carboxysomes generally cluster into distinct groups within the cytoplasm often in the immediate vicinity of polyphosphate granules and a regular lattice of density frequently connects granules to nearby carboxysomes small granular bodies were also seen within carboxysomes these observations suggest a functional relationship between carboxysomes and polyphosphate granules carboxysomes exhibited greater size shape and compositional variability in cells than in purified preparations finally we observed carboxysomes in various stages of assembly as well as filamentous structures that we attribute to misassembled shell protein surprisingly no more than one partial carboxysome was ever observed per cell based on these observations we propose a model for carboxysome assembly in which the shell and the internal rubisco ribulose   bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase lattice form simultaneously likely guided by specific interactions between shell proteins and rubiscos
