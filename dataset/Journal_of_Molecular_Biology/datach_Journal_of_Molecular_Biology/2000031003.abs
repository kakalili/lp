crystal structure of the dna polymerase processivity factor of t bacteriophage edited by i a wilson
the protein encoded by gene  of t bacteriophage gene  protein or gp   is responsible for tethering the catalytic subunit of t dna polymerase to dna during high speed replication also referred to as a sliding dna clamp gp  is similar in its function to the processivity factors of bacterial and eukaryotic dna polymerases the  clamp and pcna respectively crystallographic analysis has shown that the  clamp and pcna form highly symmetrical ring shaped structures through which duplex dna can be threaded gp  shares no sequence similarity with  clamp or pcna and sequence comparisons have not been able to establish whether it adopts a similar structure we have determined the crystal structure of gp  from t bacteriophage at    resolution using multiple isomorphous replacement the protein forms a trimeric ring shaped assembly with overall dimensions that are similar to those of the bacterial and eukaryotic processivity factors each monomer of gp  contains two domains that are very similar in chain fold to those of  clamp and pcna despite an overall negative charge the inner surface of the ring is in a region of positive electrostatic potential consistent with a mechanism in which dna is threaded through the ring
