structural studies of fatty acyl acyl carrier protein thioesters reveal a hydrophobic binding cavity that can expand to fit longer substrates
a knowledge of the structures of acyl chain loaded species of the acyl carrier protein acp as used in fatty acid biosynthesis and a range of other metabolic events is essential for a full understanding of the molecular recognition at the heart of these processes to date the only crystal structure of an acylated species of acp is that of a butyryl derivative of escherichia coli acp we have now determined the structures of a family of acylated e coli acps of varying acyl chain length the acyl moiety is attached via a thioester bond to a phosphopantetheine linker that is in turn bound to a serine residue in acp the growing acyl chain can be accommodated within a central cavity in the acp for transport during the elongation stages of lipid synthesis through changes in the conformation of a four  helix bundle the results not only clarify the means by which a substrate of varying size and complexity is transported in the cell but also suggest a mechanism by which interacting enzymes can recognize the loaded acp through recognition of surface features including the conformation of the phosphopantetheine linker
