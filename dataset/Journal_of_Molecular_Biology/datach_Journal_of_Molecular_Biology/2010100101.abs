the role of l stalk  trna interaction in the ribosome elongation cycle
the ribosomal l stalk is a mobile structure implicated in directing trna movement during translocation through the ribosome this article investigates three aspects of l stalk  trna interaction first by combining data from cryo electron microscopy x ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations through the molecular dynamics flexible fitting method we obtained atomic models of different trnas occupying the hybrid p e state interacting with the l stalk these models confirm the assignment of fluorescence resonance energy transfer states from previous single molecule investigations of l stalk dynamics second the models reconcile how initiator trnafmet interacts less strongly with the l stalk compared to elongator trnaphe as seen in previous single molecule experiments third results from a simulation of the entire ribosome in which the l stalk is moved from a half closed conformation to its open conformation are found to support the hypothesis that l stalk opening is involved in trna release from the ribosome
