in vitro dynamic visualization analysis of fluorescently labeled minor capsid protein ix and core protein v by simultaneous detection
oncolytic adenoviruses represent a promising therapeutic medicine for human cancer therapy but successful translation into human clinical trials requires careful evaluation of their viral characteristics while the function of adenovirus proteins has been analyzed in detail the dynamics of adenovirus infection remain largely unknown due to technological constraints that prevent adequate tracking of adenovirus particles after infection fluorescence labeling of adenoviral particles is one new strategy designed to directly analyze the dynamic processes of viral infection in virus  host cell interactions we hypothesized that the double labeling of an adenovirus with fluorescent proteins would allow us to properly analyze intracellular viruses and the fate of viral proteins in a live analysis of an adenovirus as compared to single labeling thus we generated a fluorescently labeled adenovirus with both a red fluorescent minor capsid protein ix pix  pix monomeric red fluorescent protein  mrfp  and a green fluorescent minor core protein v pv  pv enhanced green fluorescent protein egfp  resulting in ad ix mrfp e v egfp the fluorescent signals for pix mrfp and pv egfp were detected within   min in living cells however a growth curve analysis of ad ix mrfp e v egfp showed an approximately   fold reduced production of the viral progeny at   h postinfection as compared to adenovirus type  interestingly pix mrfp and pv egfp were initially localized in the cytoplasm and nucleolus respectively at   h postinfection these proteins were observed in the nucleus during the late stage of infection and relocalization of the proteins was observed in an adenoviral replication dependent manner these results indicate that simultaneous detection of adenoviruses using dual fluorescent proteins is suitable for real time analysis including identification of infected cells and monitoring of viral spread which will be required for a complete evaluation of oncolytic adenoviruses
