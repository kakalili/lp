diverse role of three tyrosines in binding of the rna   cap to the human nuclear cap binding complex
the heterodimeric nuclear cap binding complex cbc specifically recognizes the monomethylguanosine   cap structure of the eukaryotic rna polymerase ii transcripts such as mrna and u snrna the binding is essential for nuclear maturation of mrna for nuclear export of u snrna in metazoans and for nonsense mediated decay of mrna and the pioneer round of translation we analysed the recognition of the cap by native human cbc and mutants in which each tyrosine that stacks with the  methylguanosine moiety was replaced by phenylalanine or alanine and both tyrosines were replaced by phenylalanines the equilibrium association constants kas for two selected cap analogues p  methylguanosine   p guanosine   triphosphate and  methylguanosine triphosphate were determined by two independent methods fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance we could distinguish two tyrosines y  and y  in stabilization of the cap inside the cbc binding pocket in particular lack of y  in cbc leads to a greater affinity of the mono than the dinucleotide cap analogue in contrast to the wild type protein a crucial role of cation   stacking in the mechanism of the specific cap recognition by cbc was postulated from the comparison of the experimentally derived gibbs free binding energy  g  with the stacking energy  e of the  methylguanosine y binary and ternary complexes calculated by the m ller  plesset second order perturbation method the resulting kinetic model of the association between the capped rna and cbc based on the experimental data and quantum calculations is discussed with respect to the  cbc to eukaryotic initiation factor e handoff  of mrna
