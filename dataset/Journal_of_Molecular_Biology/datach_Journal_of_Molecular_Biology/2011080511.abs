crystallographic snapshots of the complete catalytic cycle of the unregulated aspartate transcarbamoylase from bacillus subtilis
here we report high resolution x ray structures of bacillus subtilis aspartate transcarbamoylase atcase  an enzyme that catalyzes one of the first reactions in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis structures of the enzyme have been determined in the absence of ligands in the presence of the substrate carbamoyl phosphate and in the presence of the bisubstrate transition state analog n phosphonacetyl l aspartate combining the structural data with in silico docking and electrostatic calculations we have been able to visualize each step in the catalytic cycle of atcase from the ordered binding of the substrates to the formation and decomposition of the tetrahedral intermediate to the ordered release of the products from the active site analysis of the conformational changes associated with these steps provides a rationale for the lack of cooperativity in trimeric atcases that do not possess regulatory subunits
