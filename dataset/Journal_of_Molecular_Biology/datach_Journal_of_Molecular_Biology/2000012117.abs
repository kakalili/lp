localization of the  subunit in the escherichia coli f f atpsynthase by immuno electron microscopy the  subunit binds on top of the f  edited by w baumeister
the binding site of the  subunit in the f f atpsynthase from escherichia coli has been determined by electron microscopy of negatively stained antibody decorated enzyme molecules the images show that the antibody is bound at the very top of the f domain indicating that at least part of  is bound in the dimple formed by the n termini of the  and  subunits the data may explain why there is only one binding site for  on the f despite there being three identical   pairs the finding also implies that the b subunits of the f have to extend all the way from the membrane surface to the very top of the f domain to make contact with the  subunit
