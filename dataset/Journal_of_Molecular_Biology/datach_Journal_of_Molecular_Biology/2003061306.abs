a structural and functional role for  mer repeats in  synuclein and other exchangeable lipid binding proteins
we have used nmr spectroscopy and limited proteolysis to characterize the structural properties of the parkinson s disease related protein  synuclein in lipid and detergent micelle environments we show that the lipid or micelle surface bound portion of the molecule adopts a continuously helical structure with a single break modeling  s as an ideal  helix reveals a hydrophobic surface that winds around the helix axis in a right handed fashion this feature is typical of  mer repeat containing sequences that adopt right handed coiled coil conformations in order to bind a flat or convex lipid surface however an unbroken helical  s structure would need to adopt an unusual slightly unwound     helix conformation three complete turns per  residues  the break we observe in the  s helix may allow the protein to avoid this unusual conformation by adopting two shorter stretches of typical  helical structure however a quantitative analysis suggests the possibility that the    conformation may in fact exist in lipid bound  s we discuss how structural features of helical  mer repeats could play a role in the reversible lipid binding function of  synuclein and generalize this argument to include the  mer repeat containing apolipoproteins which also require the ability to release readily from lipid surfaces a search of protein sequence databases confirms that synuclein like  mer repeats are present in other proteins that bind lipids reversibly and predicts such a role for a number of hypothetical proteins of unknown function
