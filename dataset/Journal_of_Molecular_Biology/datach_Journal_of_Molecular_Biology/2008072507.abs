transfer of flexibility between ankyrin repeats in i b  upon formation of the nf  b complex
the mechanism of inhibition of the transcriptional activator nuclear factor  b nf  b by the inhibitor i b  is central to the understanding of the control of transcriptional activity via this widely employed pathway previous studies suggested that i b  a modular protein with an nf  b binding domain consisting of six ankyrin repeat domains anks  shows differential flexibility with ank    apparently more rigid in solution in the absence of nf  b than ank  and  here we report nmr studies that confirm the enhanced flexibility of ank  and  in free i b  upon binding of nf  b ank  and  become well structured and rigid but somewhat surprisingly other domains of the i b  which were relatively rigid in the free protein become significantly more flexible due to the high molecular masses of the component proteins and the complexes we employ a hierarchical experimental plan to maximize the available information on local flexibility in the ankyrin repeat domains backbone resonances of the   residue i b  protein were assigned firstly in a smaller construct consisting of ankyrin repeats    these assignments could be readily transferred to the spectra of the construct containing six repeats both free and complexed with various combinations of the nf  b p  and p  domains transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy type nmr experiments on differentially labeled proteins enabled information on backbone structure and dynamics to be obtained even in complexes with molecular masses approaching   kda changes in the flexibility and stability of the various ankyrin repeat domains of i b  complex formation take a variety of forms depending on the position of the domain in the complex providing a variety of examples of the structural and functional utility of intrinsically unstructured or partly folded protein domains
