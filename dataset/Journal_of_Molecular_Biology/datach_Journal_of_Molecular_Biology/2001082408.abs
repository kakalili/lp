nucleotide sequence of coliphage hk  and the evolution of lambdoid phages edited by m gottesman
hk  is a temperate lambdoid bacteriophage that adsorbs to the o antigen of its host escherichia coli h the genome of a temperature sensitive clear plaque mutant consists of    nucleotides in which we recognize  open reading frames orfs  eighteen of these lie in a region of the genome that we call the virion structure domain the other  orfs lie in what we call the metabolic domain virions of hk  resemble those of phage p  the virion structural orfs encode three kinds of putative proteins relative to the virion proteins of p    those that are nearly about    identical   those that are weakly about    identical and   those composed of nearly and weakly identical segments we hypothesize that these composite proteins form bridges between the virion proteins of the other two kinds three of the putative virion proteins that are only weakly identical to p  proteins are    and   identical to proteins encoded by the phage apse  whose virions also resemble those of p  because the hosts of apse  and hk  have been separated from each other by an estimated   my we propose using the amino acid differences that have accumulated in these proteins to estimate a biological clock for temperate lambdoid phages the putative transcriptional regulatory gene circuitry of hk  seems to resemble that of phage lambda integration on the other hand resembles that of satellite phage p in that the attp sequence lies between the leftward promoter and int rather than downstream of int comparing the metabolic domains of several lambdoid phage genomes reveals seven short conserved sequences roughly defining boundaries of functional modules we propose that these boundary sequences are foci of genetic recombination that serve to assort the modules and make the metabolic domain highly mosaic genetically
