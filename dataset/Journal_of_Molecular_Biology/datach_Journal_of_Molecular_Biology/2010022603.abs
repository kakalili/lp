the ring domain of traf plays an essential role in the inhibition of tnf  induced cell death but not in the activation of nf  b
tumor necrosis factor tnf receptor associated factor  traf  and receptor interacting protein  rip  play critical roles in activating c jun n terminal kinase jnk and inhibitor of  b kinase ikk  as well as in inhibiting apoptosis induced by tnf  the traf ring domain mediated polyubiquitination of rip is believed to be essential for tnf  induced ikk activation and the ring domain deleted traf  traf  r has been widely used as a dominant negative in transient overexpression systems to block tnf  induced jnk and ikk activation here we report that stable expression of traf  r at a physiological level in traf and traf double knockout traf  dko cells almost completely restores normal tnf  induced ikk activation but not rip polyubiquitination in addition stable expression of traf  r in traf  dko cells efficiently inhibited the tnf  induced later phase of prolonged jnk activation yet failed to inhibit tnf  induced cell death although the basal and inducible expression of anti apoptotic proteins in traf  r expressing traf  dko cells was normal the cells remained sensitive to tnf  induced cell death because anti apoptotic proteins were not recruited to the tnfr complex efficiently moreover stable expression of traf  r in traf  dko cells failed to suppress constitutive p  processing in these cells these data suggest that i the traf ring domain plays a critical role in inhibiting cell death induced by tnf  and is essential for suppressing the noncanonical nuclear factor  b pathway in unstimulated cells  ii rip polyubiquitination is not essential for tnf  induced ikk activation and iii prolonged jnk activation has no obligate role in tnf  induced cell death
