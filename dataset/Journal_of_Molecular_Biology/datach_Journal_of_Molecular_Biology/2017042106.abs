enhancing the catalytic deamination activity of apobec c is insufficient to inhibit vif deficient hiv
the retroviral restriction factors of the apobec  a  cytidine deaminase family catalyze the deamination of cytidines in single stranded viral dna apobec c a c is a strong antiviral factor against viral infectivity factor vif deficient simian immunodeficiency virus  vif which is however a weak inhibitor against human immunodeficiency virus hiv  for reasons unknown the precise link between the antiretroviral effect of a c and its catalytic activity is incompletely understood here we show that the s p mutation in human a c a c s p boosted hypermutation in the viral genomes of simian immunodeficiency virus  vif and murine leukemia virus but not in human immunodeficiency virus hiv  vif the enhanced antiviral activity of a c s p correlated with enhanced in vitro cytidine deamination furthermore the s p mutation did not change the substrate specificity of a c ribonucleoprotein complex formation self association zinc coordination or viral incorporation features we propose that local structural changes induced by the serine to proline substitution are responsible for the gain of catalytic activity of a c s p our results are a first step toward an understanding of a c s dna binding capacity deamination dependent editing and antiviral functions at the molecular level we conclude that the enhanced enzymatic activity of a c is insufficient to restrict hiv  indicating an unknown escape mechanism of hiv
