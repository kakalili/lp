rapid self assembly of  synuclein observed by in situ atomic force microscopy
self assembly of  synuclein resulting in protein aggregates of diverse morphology has been implicated in the pathogenesis of parkinson s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known as synucleinopathies apart from its biomedical relevance this aggregation process is representative of the interconversion of an unfolded protein into nanostructures with typical amyloid features we have used in situ tapping mode atomic force microscopy to continuously monitor the self assembly of wild type  synuclein its disease related mutants a p and a t and the c terminally truncated variant  synuclein      different aggregation modes were observed depending on experimental conditions i e ph protein concentration polyamine concentration temperature and the supporting substrate at ph   in the absence of the biogenic polyamines spermidine or spermine elongated sheets      nm in height and presumably representing individual  sheet structures were formed on mica substrates within a few minutes their orientation was directed by the crystalline substructure of the substrate in contrast sheet formation was not observed with hydrophobic highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrates suggesting that negatively charged surfaces promote  synuclein self assembly in the presence of spermidine or spermine      nm high spheroidal structures were preferentially formed sharing characteristics with similar structures previously reported for several amyloidogenic proteins and linked to neurotoxicity   synuclein spheroid formation depended critically on polyamine binding to the c terminus revealing a promoting effect of the c terminus on  synuclein assembly in the bound state in rare cases fibril growth from spheroids or preformed aggregates was observed at ph   fibrils were formed initially and incorporated into amorphous aggregates in the course of the aggregation process providing evidence for the potential of amyloid fibril surfaces to act as nucleation sites in amorphous aggregation this study provides a direct insight into different modes of  synuclein self assembly and identifies key factors modulating the aggregation process
