two stage folding of hp  from ab initio simulations
accurate ab initio simulation of protein folding is a critical step toward elucidation of protein folding mechanisms here we demonstrate highly accurate folding of the  residue villin headpiece subdomain hp  by all atom molecular dynamics simulations using amber ff  and the generalized born solvation model in a set of    s long simulations the protein folded to the native state in multiple trajectories with the lowest c  rmsd being     for residues     excluding residues  and   the native state had the highest population among all sampled conformations and the center of most populated cluster had a c  rmsd of      folding of this protein can be described as a two stage process that followed a well defined pathway in the first stage formation of helices ii and iii as a folding intermediate constituted the rate limiting step and was initiated at a folding nucleus around residues phe  and pro  the folding intermediate further acted as a template that facilitated the folding and docking of helix i in the second stage detailed descriptions of the folding kinetics and the roles of key residues are presented
