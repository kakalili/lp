structure and binding mechanism of vascular endothelial cadherin a divergent classical cadherin
vascular endothelial cadherin ve cadherin  a divergent member of the type ii classical cadherin family of cell adhesion proteins mediates homophilic adhesion in the vascular endothelium previous investigations with a bacterially produced protein suggested that ve cadherin forms cell surface trimers that bind between apposed cells to form hexamers here we report studies of mammalian produced ve cadherin ectodomains suggesting that like other classical cadherins ve cadherin forms adhesive trans dimers between monomers located on opposing cell surfaces trimerization of the bacterially produced protein appears to be an artifact that arises from a lack of glycosylation we also present the    resolution crystal structure of the ve cadherin ec   adhesive region which reveals homodimerization via the strand swap mechanism common to classical cadherins in common with type ii cadherins strand swap binding involves two tryptophan anchor residues but the adhesive interface resembles type i cadherins in that ve cadherin does not form a large nonswapped hydrophobic surface thus ve cadherin is an outlier among classical cadherins with characteristics of both type i and type ii subfamilies
