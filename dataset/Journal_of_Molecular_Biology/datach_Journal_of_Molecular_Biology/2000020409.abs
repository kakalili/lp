the transition state in the folding unfolding reaction of four species of three disulfide variant of hen lysozyme the role of each disulfide bridge edited by c r matthews
the effects of lacking a specific disulfide bridge on the transition state in folding were examined in order to explore the folding unfolding mechanism of lysozyme four species of three disulfide variant of hen lysozyme  ss lysozyme were prepared by replacing two cys residues with ala or ser c s c  a c a c  a c a c a and c a c a the recombinant hen lysozyme was studied as the standard reference containing four authentic disulfide bridges and the extra n terminal met the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra n terminal folding rates were measured by monitoring the change in fluorescence intensity associated with tri n acetyl d glucosamine binding to the active site of refolded lysozyme it was confirmed that the folding rate of the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra n terminal was the same as that of wild type lysozyme and that the folding rate was little affected by the presence of tri n acetyl d glucosamine trinag  the folding rate of c a c a was found to be the fastest and almost the same as that of the recombinant hen lysozyme containing the extra n terminal and that of c a c  a the second and that of c s c  a the third the folding rate of c a c a was particularly slow on the other hand the unfolding rates which were measured in the presence of trinag showed the dependence on the concentration of trinag the intrinsic unfolding rate in the absence of trinag was determined by extrapolation also in the unfolding rate c a c a was markedly slower than the others it was found from the analysis of binding constants of trinag to c a c a during the unfolding process that the active site of c a c a partly unfolds already prior to the unfolding transition on the basis of these kinetic data we suggest that c a c a folding transition can occur with leaving the loop region around ss  c  c  flexible while cross linking by ss  c  c  is important for the promotion of folding because it is an indispensable constraint on the way towards the folding transition state
