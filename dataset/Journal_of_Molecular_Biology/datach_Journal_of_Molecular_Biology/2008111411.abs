sulphate removal induces a major conformational change in leishmania mexicana pyruvate kinase in the crystalline state
we report x ray structures of pyruvate kinase from leishmania mexicana lmpyk that are trapped in different conformations these together with the previously reported structure of lmpyk in its inactive t state conformation allow comparisons of three different conformers of the same species of pyruvate kinase pyk  four new site point mutants showing the effects of side chain alteration at subunit interfaces are also enzymatically characterised the lmpyk tetramer crystals grown with ammonium sulphate as precipitant adopt an active like conformation with sulphate ions at the active and effector sites the sulphates occupy positions similar to those of the phosphates of ligands bound to active r state and constitutively active nonallosteric pyks from several species and provide insight into the structural roles of the phosphates of the substrates and effectors crystal soaking in sulphate free buffers was found to induce major conformational changes in the tetramer in particular the unwinding of the a    helix and the inward hinge movement of the b domain are coupled with a significant widening     of the tetramer caused by lateral movement of the c domains the two new lmpyk structures and the activity studies of site point mutations described in this article are consistent with a developing picture of allosteric activity in which localised changes in protein flexibility govern the distribution of conformer families adopted by the tetramer in its active and inactive states
