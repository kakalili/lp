size independent and noncooperative recognition of dsrna by the rice stripe virus rna silencing suppressor ns
plant and animal viruses employ diverse suppressor proteins to thwart the host antiviral reaction of rna silencing many suppressors bind dsrna with different size specificity here we examine the dsrna recognition mechanism of the rice stripe virus ns suppressor using quantitative biochemical approaches as well as mutagenesis and suppression activity analyses in plants we show that dimeric ns is a size independent rather than small interfering rna specific dsrna binding protein that recognizes a minimum of  bp and can bind to long dsrna with two or more copies global analysis using a combinatorial approach reveals that ns dimer has an occluded site size of    bp on dsrna an intrinsic binding constant of     m   and virtually no binding cooperativity this lack of cooperativity suggests that ns is not geared to target long dsrna the larger site size of ns  compared with its interacting size indicates that the ns structure has a border region that has no direct contact with dsrna but occludes a   bp region from binding we also develop a method to correct the border effect of ligand by extending the lattice length in addition we find that ns recognizes the helical structure and   hydroxyl group of dsrna with moderate specificity analysis of dsrna binding mutants suggests that silencing of the suppression activity of ns is mechanistically related to its dsrna binding ability
