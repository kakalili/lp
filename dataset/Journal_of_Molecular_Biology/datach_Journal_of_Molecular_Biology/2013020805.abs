identification of functionally conserved regions in the structure of the chaperone cenh h complex
in eukaryotes a variant of conventional histone h termed cenh epigenetically marks the centromere the conserved cenh chaperone specifically recognizes cenh and is required for cenh deposition at the centromere recently the structures of the chaperone cenh h complexes have been determined for homo sapiens hs and the budding yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae sc and kluyveromyces lactis kl  surprisingly the three structures are very different leading to different proposed structural bases for chaperone function the question of which structural region of cenh provides the specificity determinant for the chaperone recognition is not fully answered here we investigated these issues using solution nmr and site directed mutagenesis we discovered that in contrast to previous findings the structures of the kl and sc chaperone cenh h complexes are actually very similar this new finding reveals that both budding yeast and human chaperones use a similar structural region to block dna from binding to the histones our mutational analyses further indicate that the n terminal region of the cenh   helix is sufficient for specific recognition by the chaperone for both budding yeast and human thus our studies have identified conserved structural bases of how the chaperones recognize cenh and perform the chaperone function
