proteasome inhibition induces nuclear translocation of the dioxin receptor through an sp and protein kinase c dependent pathway
the dioxin receptor ahr  in addition to its role in xenobiotic induced carcinogenesis appears to participate in cell proliferation differentiation and organ homeostasis understanding potential mechanisms of activation of this receptor in the absence of exogenous ligands is therefore important to study its contribution to endogenous cellular functions using mouse embryo primary fibroblasts we have previously shown that proteasome inhibition increased ahr transcriptional activity in the absence of xenobiotics we suggested that proteasome inhibition dependent ahr activation could involve an increase in the expression of the partner protein dioxin receptor nuclear translocator arnt  since arnt over expression induced nuclear translocation of the ahr and arnt deficient cells were unable to translocate this receptor to the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition we have analyzed the effect of proteasome inhibition on the expression of regulatory proteins controlling arnt levels treatment with the proteasome inhibitor mg  increased endogenous sp phosphorylation and its dna binding activity to the arnt promoter sp phosphorylation and binding to the arnt promoter arnt over expression and ahr nuclear translocation were inhibited by gf   x a protein kinase c specific inhibitor in addition mg  stimulated protein kinase c activity in mef cells with a pattern similar to that observed for arnt expression these data suggest that cellular control of protein kinase c activity through sp and arnt could regulate ahr transcriptional activity in the absence of xenobiotics
