smn gemin and gemin associate with  actin mrna in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells in vitro
childhood spinal muscular atrophy is caused by a reduced expression of the survival motor neuron smn protein smn has been implicated in the axonal transport of  actin mrna in both primary and transformed neuronal cell lines and loss of this function could account at least in part for spinal muscular atrophy onset and pathological specificity here we have utilised a targeted screen to identify mrna associated with smn gemin and gemin in the cytoplasm of a human neuroblastoma cell line shsy y importantly we have provided the first direct evidence that  actin mrna is present in smn cytoplasmic complexes in shsy y cells
