ligand induced structural changes to maltodextrin binding protein as studied by solution nmr spectroscopy edited by p e wright
solution nmr studies on the physiologically relevant ligand free and maltotriose bound states of maltodextrin binding protein mbp are presented together with existing data on mbp in complex with  cyclodextrin non physiological inactive ligand  these new results provide valuable information on changes in local structure dynamics and global fold that occur upon ligand binding to this two domain protein by measuring a large number of different one bond residual dipolar couplings the domain conformations critical for biological function were investigated for all three states of mbp structural models of the solution conformation of mbp in a number of different forms were generated from the experimental dipolar coupling data and x ray crystal structures using a quasi rigid body domain orientation algorithm implemented in the structure calculation program cns excellent agreement between relative domain orientations in ligand free and maltotriose bound solution conformations and the corresponding crystal structures is observed these results are in contrast to those obtained for the mbp  cyclodextrin complex where the solution state is found to be     more closed than the crystalline state the present study highlights the utility of residual dipolar couplings for orienting protein domains or macromolecules with respect to each other
