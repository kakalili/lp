crystal structure of a t cell receptor v   av s  domain new canonical forms for the first and second complementarity determining regions edited by i a wilson
we describe the x ray crystallographic structure of a murine t cell receptor tcr v  domain   v      av s aj  to     resolution the v    domain is derived from a tcr that recognizes a type ii collagen peptide associated with the murine major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii molecule i aq v    packs as a v  v  homodimer with a highly symmetric monomer monomer interface the first and second complementarity determining regions cdr and cdr  of this v  are shorter than the cdrs corresponding to the majority of other v  gene families and three dimensional structures of cdrs of these lengths have not been described previously the cdr and cdr therefore represent new canonical forms that could serve as templates for av  family members cdr of the v    domain is highly flexible and this is consistent with plasticity of this region of the tcr the fourth hypervariable loop hv   of av  and av  family members is one residue longer than that of other hv  regions and shows a high degree of flexibility the increase in length results in a distinct disposition of the conserved residue lys  which has been shown in other studies to play a role in antigen recognition the x ray structure of v    extends the database of canonical forms for cdr and cdr  and has implications for antigen recognition by tcrs that contain related v  domains
