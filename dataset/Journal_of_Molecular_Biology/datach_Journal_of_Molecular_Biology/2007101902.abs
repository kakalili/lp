substrate induced conformational changes and dynamics of udp n acetylgalactosamine polypeptide n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase
o glycan biosynthesis is initiated by the transfer of n acetylgalactosamine galnac from a nucleotide sugar donor udp galnac to ser thr residues of an acceptor substrate the detailed transfer mechanism catalyzed by the udp galnac polypeptide n acetyl  galactosaminyltransferases ppgalnacts  remains unclear despite structural information available for several isoforms in complex with substrates at various stages along the catalytic pathway we used all atom molecular dynamics simulations with explicit solvent and counterions to study the conformational dynamics of ppgalnact  in several enzymatic states along the catalytic pathway ppgalnact  is simulated both in the presence and in the absence of substrates and reaction products to examine the role of conformational changes in ligand binding in multiple  ns long simulations of more than   ns total run time we studied systems ranging from    to    atoms our simulations accurately identified dynamically active regions of the protein as previously revealed by the x ray structures and permitted a detailed atomistic description of the conformational changes of loops near the active site and the characterization of the ensemble of structures adopted by the transferase complex on the transition pathway between the ligand bound and ligand free states in particular the conformational transition of a functional loop adjacent to the active site from closed active to open inactive is correlated with the rotameric state of the conserved residue w   analysis of water dynamics in the active site revealed that internal water molecules have an important role in enhancing the enzyme flexibility we also found evidence that charged side chains in the active site rearrange during site opening to facilitate ligand binding our results are consistent with the single displacement transfer mechanism previously proposed for ppgalnacts based on x ray structures and mutagenesis data and provide new evidence for possible functional roles of certain amino acids conserved across several isoforms
