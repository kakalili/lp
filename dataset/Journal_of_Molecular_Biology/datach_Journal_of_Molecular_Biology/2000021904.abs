crystal structures of an n terminal fragment from moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase complexed with nucleic acid functional implications for template primer binding to the fingers domain edited by d c rees
reverse transcriptase rt serves as the replicative polymerase for retroviruses by using rna and dna directed dna polymerase activities coupled with a ribonuclease h activity to synthesize a double stranded dna copy of the single stranded rna genome in an effort to obtain detailed structural information about nucleic acid interactions with reverse transcriptase we have determined crystal structures at    resolution of an n terminal fragment from moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase complexed to blunt ended dna in three distinct lattices this fragment includes the fingers and palm domains from moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase we have also determined the crystal structure at    resolution of the fragment complexed to dna with a single stranded template overhang resembling a template primer substrate protein dna interactions which are nearly identical in each of the three lattices involve four conserved residues in the fingers domain asp   arg   asn  and gly   dna atoms involved in the interactions include the   oh group from the primer strand and minor groove base atoms and sugar atoms from the n   and n   positions of the template strand where n is the template base that would pair with an incoming nucleotide the single stranded template overhang adopts two different conformations in the asymmetric unit interacting with residues in the     loop     in hiv  rt  our fragment dna complexes are distinct from previously reported complexes of dna bound to hiv  rt but related in the types of interactions formed between protein and dna in addition the dna in all of these complexes is bound in the same cleft of the enzyme through site directed mutagenesis we have substituted residues that are involved in binding dna in our crystal structures and have characterized the resulting enzymes we now propose that nucleic acid binding to the fingers domain may play a role in translocation of nucleic acid during processive dna synthesis and suggest that our complex may represent an intermediate in this process
