two levels of cooperativeness in the binding of todt to the tod operon promoter
the tods todt two component system controls the expression of tod genes for toluene degradation in pseudomonas putida todt binds to two pseudopalindromes at     box  and    box   as well as to a half palindrome box   with respect to the main transcription initiation site in the ptodx promoter todt recognizes each half palindrome in boxes  and   but affinities for these sequences are lower than those for the pseudopalindromes pointing towards positive cooperativeness in intrabox recognition todt s affinity for dna fragments containing two vicinal boxes either boxes  and  or boxes  and   is higher than its affinity for individual boxes suggesting interbox cooperativeness similar patterns of cooperativeness were observed for the recombinant todt dna binding domain c terminal todt fragment aa       c todt  suggesting important cooperativeness determinants in this domain occupation of ptodx by todt is initiated at box  and optimization of its palindromic order increases affinity in vitro however this does not result in enhanced in vivo gene expression mutations at either half of the box  palindrome have no significant effects on transcriptional activity whereas mutations in the entire box  cause a  fold reduction using atomic force microscopy we show that todt induces a dna hairpin bend at ptodx between boxes  and   as supported by footprint studies showing a hyperreactive nucleotide at g    the n terminal part of todt seems to play a central role in hairpin formation since c todt neither induces a bend nor causes g    hyperreactivity in footprints this hairpin seems important for transcriptional activation since c todt binding to ptodx does not stimulate transcription
