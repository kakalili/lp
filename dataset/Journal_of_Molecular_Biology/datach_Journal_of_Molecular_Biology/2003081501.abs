crystal structure of alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase and the relationship between genotype and enzymatic phenotype in primary hyperoxaluria type
a deficiency of the liver specific enzyme alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase agt is responsible for the potentially lethal hereditary kidney stone disease primary hyperoxaluria type  ph  many of the mutations in the gene encoding agt are associated with specific enzymatic phenotypes such as accelerated proteolysis ser  pro  intra peroxisomal aggregation gly arg  inhibition of pyridoxal phosphate binding and loss of catalytic activity gly glu  and peroxisome to mitochondrion mistargeting gly  arg  several mutations including that responsible for agt mistargeting co segregate and interact synergistically with a pro leu polymorphism found at high frequency in the normal population in order to gain further insights into the mechanistic link between genotype and enzymatic phenotype in ph  we have determined the crystal structure of normal human agt complexed to the competitive inhibitor amino oxyacetic acid to    analysis of this structure allows the effects of these mutations and polymorphism to be rationalised in terms of agt tertiary and quaternary conformation and in particular it provides a possible explanation for the pro leu  gly  arg synergism that leads to agt mistargeting
