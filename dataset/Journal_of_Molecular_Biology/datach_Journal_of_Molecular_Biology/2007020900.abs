the structure of the minimal relaxase domain of moba at     resolution
the plasmid r   encodes proteins that enable its conjugative mobilization between bacterial cells it can transfer between many different species and is one of the most promiscuous of the mobilizable plasmids the plasmid encoded protein moba which has both nicking and priming activities on single stranded dna is essential for mobilization the nicking or relaxase activity has been localized to the   residue n terminal domain called minmoba we present here the     x ray structure of minmoba the fold is similar to that seen for two other relaxases trai and trwc the similarity in fold and action suggests these enzymes are evolutionary homologs despite the lack of any significant amino acid similarity minmoba has a well defined target dna called orit the active site metal is observed near tyr  which is known to form a phosphotyrosine adduct with the substrate a model of the orit substrate complexed with minmoba has been made based on observed substrate binding to trwc and trai the model is consistent with observations of substrate base specificity and provides a rationalization for elements of the likely enzyme mechanism
