mechanism of action of abc importers conservation divergence and physiological adaptations
the past decade has seen a remarkable surge in structural characterization of atp binding cassette abc transporters which have spurred a more focused functional analysis of these elaborate molecular machines as a result it has become increasingly apparent that there is a substantial degree of mechanistic variation between abc transporters that function as importers which correlates with their physiological roles here we summarize recent advances in abc importers structure  function studies and provide an explanation as to the origin of the different mechanisms of action
