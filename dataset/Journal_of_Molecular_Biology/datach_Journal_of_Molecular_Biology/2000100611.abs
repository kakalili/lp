structural analysis of the transcriptional activation region on fis crystal structures of six fis mutants with different activation properties edited by r huber
the fis protein regulates gene expression in escherichia coli by activating or repressing transcription of a variety of genes fis can activate transcription when bound to dna upstream of the rna polymerase binding site such as in the rrnb p promoter or when bound to a site overlapping the    rna polymerase binding site such as in the prop p promoter it has been suggested that transcriptional activation in both promoters results from interactions between specific amino acids within a turn connecting the b and c helices the bc turn in fis and the c terminal domain of the  subunit of rna polymerase  ctd of rnap  here crystal structures of six fis bc turn mutants with different transcriptional activation properties q a r y r l g a g d and q a were determined at   to    resolution two of these mutants r y and r l crystallized in unit cells which are different from that of wild type fis and the structure of r l offers the most complete fis model to date in that the extended structure of the n terminal region is revealed the bc turn in all of these mutant structures remains in a nearly identical     turn conformation as present in wild type fis analyses of the molecular surfaces of the transactivation region of the mutants suggest that several residues in or near the bc turn including gln  arg  gly  and gln  form a ridge that could contact the  ctd of rnap on one side the structures and biochemical properties of the mutants suggest that arg  is the most critical residue for contacting rnap within this ridge and that the glycine at position  helps to stabilize the structure
