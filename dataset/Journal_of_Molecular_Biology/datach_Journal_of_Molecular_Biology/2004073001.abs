a new definition for the consensus sequence of the peroxisome targeting signal type
all organisms except the nematode caenorhabditis elegans have been shown to possess an import system for peroxisomal proteins containing a peroxisome targeting signal type  pts  the currently accepted consensus sequence for this amino terminal nonapeptide is  r k l v i x h q l a  some c elegans proteins contain putative pts motifs including the ortholog cemek of human mevalonate kinase an enzyme known to be targeted by pts to mammalian peroxisomes we cloned the gene for cemek open reading frame y g a  and examined the subcellular localization of cemek and of two other proteins with putative pts s at their amino termini encoded by the open reading frames d    and w g    all three proteins localized to the cytosol confirming and extending the finding that c elegans lacks pts dependent peroxisomal protein import the putative pts s of the proteins encoded by d    and w g   did not function in targeting to peroxisomes in yeast or mammalian cells suggesting that the current pts consensus sequence is too broad analysis of available experimental data on both functional and nonfunctional pts s led to two re evaluated pts consensus sequences  r l v i q xx l v i h l s g a x h q l a  describes the most common variants of pts  while  r k l v i q xx l v i h q l s g a k x h q l a f  describes essentially all variants of pts  these redefined pts consensus sequences will facilitate the identification of proteins of unknown cellular localization as possible peroxisomal proteins
