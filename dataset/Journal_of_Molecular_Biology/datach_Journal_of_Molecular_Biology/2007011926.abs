role of a single amino acid in the evolution of glycans of invertebrates and vertebrates
structures of glycoconjugate n glycans and glycolipids of invertebrates show significant differences from those of vertebrates these differences are due largely to the vertebrate    galactosyltransferase    gal t  which is found as a    n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase   galnac t  in invertebrates mutation of tyr  to ile or leu in human  gal t converts the enzyme into an equally efficient  galnac t  a comparison of all the human  gal t ortholog enzymes shows that this tyr  residue in human  gal t is conserved either as tyr or phe in all vertebrate enzymes while in all invertebrate enzymes it is conserved as an ile or leu we find that mutation of the corresponding ile residue to tyr in drosophila  galnac t converts the enzyme to a  gal t by reducing its n acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity by nearly   fold while enhancing its galactosyltransferase activity by  fold furthermore we find that similar to the vertebrate mammalian  gal t enzymes the wild type drosophila  galnac t enzyme binds to a mammary gland specific protein   lactalbumin   la  thus it would seem that during the evolution of vertebrates from invertebrates over   million years ago   gal t appeared as a result of the single amino acid substitution of tyr or phe for leu or ile in the invertebrate  galnac t  subsequently the pre existing  la binding site was utilized during mammalian evolution to synthesize lactose in the mammary gland during lactation
