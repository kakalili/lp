crystal structures of escherichia coli uridine phosphorylase in two native and three complexed forms reveal basis of substrate specificity induced conformational changes and influence of potassium
uridine phosphorylase up is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine salvage pathway that catalyses the reversible phosphorolysis of uridine to uracil and ribose  phosphate inhibiting liver up in humans raises blood uridine levels and produces a protective effect   uridine rescue   against the toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent  fluorouracil without reducing its antitumour activity we have investigated up  substrate interactions by determining the crystal structures of native escherichia coli up two forms  and complexes with  fluorouracil ribose  phosphate  deoxyuridine phosphate and thymidine phosphate these hexameric structures confirm the overall structural similarity of up to e coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase pnp whereby in the presence of substrate each displays a closed conformation resulting from a concerted movement that closes the active site cleft however in contrast to pnp where helix segmentation is the major conformational change between the open and closed forms in up more extensive changes are observed in particular a swinging movement of a flap region consisting of residues      seals the active site this overall change in conformation results in compression of the active site cleft gln  and arg   part of an inserted segment not seen in pnp are key residues in the uracil binding pocket and together with a tightly bound water molecule are seen to be involved in the substrate specificity of up enzyme activity shows a twofold dependence on potassium ion concentration the presence of a potassium ion at the monomer monomer interface induces some local rearrangement which results in dimer stabilisation the conservation of key residues and interactions with substrate in the phosphate and ribose binding pockets suggest that ribooxocarbenium ion formation during catalysis of up may be similar to that proposed for e coli pnp
