predicting allosteric communication in myosin via a pathway of conserved residues
we present a computational method that predicts a pathway of residues that mediate protein allosteric communication the pathway is predicted using only a combination of distance constraints between contiguous residues and evolutionary data we applied this analysis to find pathways of conserved residues connecting the myosin atp binding site to the lever arm these pathway residues may mediate the allosteric communication that couples atp hydrolysis to the lever arm recovery stroke having examined pre stroke conformations of dictyostelium scallop and chicken myosin ii as well as dictyostelium myosin i we observed a conserved pathway traversing switch ii and the relay helix which is consistent with the understood need for allosteric communication in this conformation we also examined post rigor and rigor conformations across several myosin species although initial residues of these paths are more heterogeneous all but one of these paths traverse a consistent set of relay helix residues to reach the beginning of the lever arm we discuss our results in the context of structural elements and reported mutational experiments which substantiate the significance of the pre stroke pathways our method provides a simple computationally efficient means of predicting a set of residues that mediate allosteric communication we provide a refined downloadable application and source code on https  simtk org to share this tool with the wider community https  simtk org home allopathfinder
