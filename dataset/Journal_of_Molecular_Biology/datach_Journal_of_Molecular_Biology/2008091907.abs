topology conservation and loop flexibility in quadruplex  drug recognition crystal structures of inter and intramolecular telomeric dna quadruplex  drug complexes
knowledge of the biologically relevant topology is critical for the design of drugs targeting quadruplex nucleic acids we report here crystal structures of a g quadruplex selective ligand complexed with two human telomeric dna quadruplexes the intramolecular quadruplex sequence d taggg ttaggg  and the bimolecular quadruplex sequence d tagggttagggt were co crystallized with a tetra substituted naphthalene diimide quadruplex binding ligand the structures were solved and refined to    and     resolution respectively revealing that the quadruplex topology in both structures is unchanged by the addition of the ligands retaining a parallel stranded arrangement with external double chain reversal propeller loops the parallel topology results in accessible external   and   planar g tetrad surfaces for ligand stacking this also enables significant ligand induced conformational changes in several tta propeller loops to take place such that the loops themselves are able to accommodate bound drug molecules without affecting the parallel quadruplex topology by stacking on the external tta connecting loop nucleotides ligands are bound into the external tta loop nucleotides and stack onto g tetrad surfaces these crystal structures provide a framework for further ligand development of the naphthalene diimide series to enhance selectivity and affinity
