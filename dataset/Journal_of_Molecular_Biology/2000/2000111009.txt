The self-assembly of apoferritin molecules into crystals is a suitable model for protein crystallization and aggregation; these processes underlie several biological and biomedical phenomena, as well as for protein and virus self-assembly. We use the atomic force microscope in situ, during the crystallization of apoferritin to visualize and quantify at the molecular level the processes responsible for crystal growth. To evaluate the governing thermodynamic parameters, we image the configuration of the incorporation sites, “kinks”, on the surface of a growing crystal. We show that the kinks are due to thermal fluctuations of the molecules at the crystal-solution interface. This allows evaluation of the free energy of the intermolecular bond φ=3.0 kBT=7.3 kJ/mol. The crystallization free energy, extracted from the protein solubility, is −42 kJ/mol. Published determinations of the second virial coefficient and the protein solubility between 0 and 40°C revealed that the enthalpy of crystallization is close to zero. Analyses based on these three values suggest that the main component in the crystallization driving force is the entropy gain of the water molecules bound to the protein molecules in solution and released upon crystallization. Furthermore, monitoring the incorporation of individual molecules in to the kinks, we determine the characteristic frequency of attachment of individual molecules at one set of conditions. This allows a correlation between the mesoscopic kinetic coefficient for growth and the molecular-level thermodynamic and kinetic parameters determined here. We found that step growth velocity, scaled by the molecular size, equals the product of the kink density and attachment frequency, i.e. the latter pair are the molecular-level parameters for self-assembly of the molecules into crystals.
