transient structure formation in unfolded acyl coenzyme a binding protein observed by site directed spin labelling
paramagnetic relaxation has been used to monitor the formation of structure in the folding peptide chain of guanidinium chloride denatured acyl coenzyme a binding protein the spin label  oxyl     tetramethyl  pyrroline  methyl methanesulfonate mtsl was covalently bound to a single cysteine residue introduced into five different positions in the amino acid sequence it was shown that the formation of structure in the folding peptide chain at conditions where   of the sample is unfolded brings the relaxation probe close to a wide range of residues in the peptide chain which are not affected in the native folded structure it is suggested that the experiment is recording the formation of many discrete and transient structures in the polypeptide chain in the preface of protein folding analysis of secondary chemical shifts shows a high propensity for  helix formation in the c terminal part of the polypeptide chain which forms an  helix in the native structure and a high propensity for turn formation in two regions of the polypeptide that form turns in the native structure the results contribute to the idea that native like structural elements form transiently in the unfolded state and that these may be of importance to the initiation of protein folding
