structural basis of aquaporin inhibition by mercury
the aquaporin family of channels was defined based on the inhibition of water transport by mercurial compounds despite the important role of mercurials little is known about the structural changes involved upon mercury binding leading to channel inhibition to elucidate the mechanism we designed a mutant t  c of aquaporin z aqpz patterned after the known mercury sensitive site of aquaporin  aqp  and determined the x ray crystal structures of the unbound and mercury blocked states superposition of the two structures shows no conformational rearrangement upon mercury binding in the blocked structure there are two mercury sites one bound to cys  and occluding the pore and a second also bound to the same cysteine but found buried in an interstitial cavity to test the mechanism of blockade we designed a different mutant l  c to produce a more effective mercury block at the pore site in a dose response inhibition study this mutant was  times more sensitive to mercury than wild type aqpz and four times more sensitive than t  c the x ray structure of l  c shows four mercury atoms at or near the pore site defined in the t  c structure and no structural change upon mercury binding thus we elucidate a steric inhibition mechanism for this important class of channels by mercury
