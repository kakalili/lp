structural changes common to catalysis in the tpx peroxiredoxin subfamily
thiol peroxidases tpxs are dimeric  cys peroxiredoxins from bacteria that preferentially reduce alkyl hydroperoxides catalysis requires two conserved residues the peroxidatic cysteine and the resolving cysteine which are located in helix   and helix   respectively the partial unraveling of helices   and   during catalysis allows for the formation of an intramolecular disulfide between these two residues here we present three structures of escherichia coli tpx representing the fully folded peroxide binding site intact  locally unfolded disulfide bond  and partially locally unfolded transitional state conformations we also compare known tpx crystal structures and analyze the sequence conservation patterns among nearly   tpx sequences twelve fully conserved tpx specific residues cluster at the active site and dimer interface and an additional  highly conserved residues are mostly located in a cradle providing the environment for helix   using the structures determined here as representative fully folded transitional and locally unfolded tpx conformations we describe in detail the structural changes associated with catalysis in the tpx subfamily key insights include the description of a conserved hydrophobic collar around the active site a set of conserved packing interactions between helices   and   that allow the local unfolding of   to trigger the partial unfolding of   a conserved dimer interface that anchors the ends of helices   and   to stabilize the active site during structural transitions and a conserved set of residues constituting a cradle that stabilizes the two discrete conformations of helix   involved in catalysis the involvement of the dimer interface in stabilizing active site folding and in forming the hydrophobic collar implies that tpx is an obligate homodimer and explains the high conservation of interface residues
