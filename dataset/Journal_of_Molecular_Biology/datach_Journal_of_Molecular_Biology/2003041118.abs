crystal structure of human  hexosaminidase b understanding the molecular basis of sandhoff and tay  sachs disease
in humans two major  hexosaminidase isoenzymes exist hex a and hex b hex a is a heterodimer of subunits  and     identity  whereas hex b is a homodimer of  subunits interest in human  hexosaminidase stems from its association with tay  sachs and sandhoff disease these are prototypical lysosomal storage disorders resulting from the abnormal accumulation of gm ganglioside gm  hex a degrades gm by removing a terminal n acetyl d galactosamine   galnac residue and this activity requires the gm  activator a protein which solubilizes the ganglioside for presentation to hex a we present here the crystal structure of human hex b alone     and in complex with the mechanistic inhibitors galnac isofagomine     or nag thiazoline     from these and the known x ray structure of the gm  activator we have modeled hex a in complex with the activator and ganglioside together our crystallographic and modeling data demonstrate how  and  subunits dimerize to form either hex a or hex b how these isoenzymes hydrolyze diverse substrates and how many documented point mutations cause sandhoff disease   subunit mutations and tay  sachs disease   subunit mutations
