multi resolution contour based fitting of macromolecular structures edited by w baumeister
a novel contour based matching criterion is presented for the quantitative docking of high resolution structures of components into low resolution maps of macromolecular complexes the proposed laplacian filter is combined with a six dimensional search using fast fourier transforms to rapidly scan the rigid body degrees of freedom of a probe molecule relative to a fixed target density map a comparison of the docking performance with the standard cross correlation criterion demonstrates that contour matching with the laplacian filter significantly extends the viable resolution range of correlation based fitting to resolutions as low as    the gain in docking precision at medium to low resolution      is critical for image reconstructions from electron microscopy em  the new algorithm enables for the first time the reliable docking of smaller molecular components into em densities of large biomolecular assemblies at such low resolutions as an example of the practical effectiveness of contour based fitting a new pseudo atomic model of a microtubule was constructed from a    resolution em map and from atomic structures of  and  tubulin subunits
