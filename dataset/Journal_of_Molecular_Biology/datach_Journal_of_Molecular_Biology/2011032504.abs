characterization of a family of ranbp type zinc fingers that can recognize single stranded rna
the recognition of single stranded rna ssrna is an important aspect of gene regulation and a number of different classes of protein domains that recognize ssrna in a sequence specific manner have been identified recently we demonstrated that the ranbp type zinc finger znf domains from the human splicing factor znf ran binding domain containing protein  zranb  can bind to a sequence containing the consensus agguaa six other human proteins namely ewing s sarcoma ews  translocated in liposarcoma tls fus rna binding protein   rbp   rna binding motif  rbm  rna binding motif   rbm  and testis expressed sequence  a tex a  each contains a single znf with homology to the zranb znfs and several of these proteins have been implicated in the regulation of mrna processing here we show that all of these znfs are able to bind with micromolar affinities to ssrna containing a ggu motif nmr titration data reveal that binding is mediated by the corresponding surfaces on each znf and we also show that sequence selectivity is largely limited to the ggu core motif and that substitution of the three flanking adenines that were selected in our original selection experiment has a minimal effect on binding affinity these data establish a subset of ranbp type znfs as a new family of ssrna binding motifs
