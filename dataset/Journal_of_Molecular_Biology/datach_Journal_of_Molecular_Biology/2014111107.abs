the carboxy terminal domain of ros is essential for  methylcytosine dna glycosylase activity
arabidopsis thaliana repressor of silencing  ros  is a multi domain bifunctional dna glycosylase lyase which excises  methylcytosine  mc and  hydroxymethylcytosine  hmc as well as thymine and  hydroxymethyluracil i e  the deamination products of mc and hmc when paired with a guanine leaving an apyrimidinic ap site that is subsequently incised by the lyase activity ros is slow in base excision and fast in ap lyase activity indicating that the recognition of pyrimidine modifications might be a rate limiting step in the c terminal half the enzyme harbors a helix  hairpin  helix dna glycosylase domain followed by a unique c terminal domain we show that the isolated glycosylase domain is inactive for base excision but retains partial ap lyase activity addition of the c terminal domain restores the base excision activity and increases the ap lyase activity as well furthermore the two domains remain tightly associated and can be co purified by chromatography we suggest that the c terminal domain of ros is indispensable for the mc dna glycosylase activity of ros
