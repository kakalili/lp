monitoring the transition from the t to the r state in e coli aspartate transcarbamoylase by x ray crystallography crystal structures of the e a mutant enzyme in four distinct allosteric states
a detailed description of the transition that allosteric enzymes undergo constitutes a major challenge in structural biology we have succeeded in trapping four distinct allosteric states of a mutant enzyme of escherichia coli aspartate transcarbomylase and determining their structures by x ray crystallography the mutant version of aspartate transcarbamoylase in which glu  in the catalytic chains was replaced by ala destabilizes the native r state and shifts the equilibrium towards the t state this behavior allowed the use of substrate analogs such as phosphonoacetamide and malonate to trap the enzyme in t like and r like structures that are distinct from the t state structure of the wild type enzyme as represented by the structure of the enzyme with ctp bound and the r state structure as represented by the structure with n phosphonacetyl l aspartate bound  these structures shed light on the nature and the order of internal structural rearrangements during the transition from the t to the r state they also suggest an explanation for diminished activity of the e a enzyme and for the change in reaction mechanism from ordered to random for this mutant enzyme
