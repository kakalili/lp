the multiple facets of prc alterations in cancers
genome sequencing of large cohorts of tumors has revealed that mutations in genes encoding chromatin regulators are frequent in cancer however the precise contribution of these mutations to tumor development often remains elusive here we review the current knowledge concerning the alterations of the polycomb machinery in cancer with a particular focus on the polycomb repressive complex  prc  a key chromatin modifier involved in the maintenance of transcriptional silencing a broad variety of alterations can impair prc activity yet overall only one type of alteration is found in a given class of tumor we discuss the potential impact of the various types of prc alterations on gene expression we propose that the distinct set of genes regulated by prc  depending on tumor etiology constrain the type of alteration of prc that can fuel tumor development beyond this specificity we propose that prc and more generally chromatin regulators act as gatekeepers of transcriptional integrity a role that often confers a tumor suppressive function
