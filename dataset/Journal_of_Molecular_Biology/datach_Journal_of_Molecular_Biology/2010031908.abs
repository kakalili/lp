multiple nucleotide preferences determine cleavage site recognition by the hiv  and m mulv rnases h
the rnase h activity of reverse transcriptase is required during retroviral replication and represents a potential target in antiviral drug therapies sequence features flanking a cleavage site influence the three types of retroviral rnase h activity internal dna   end directed and rna   end directed using the reverse transcriptases of hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  and moloney murine leukemia virus m mulv  we evaluated how individual base preferences at a cleavage site direct retroviral rnase h specificity strong test cleavage sites designated as between nucleotide positions   and   for the hiv  and m mulv enzymes were introduced into model hybrid substrates designed to assay internal or dna   end directed cleavage and base substitutions were tested at specific nucleotide positions for internal cleavage positions               and    for hiv  and positions         and   for m mulv significantly affected rnase h cleavage efficiency while positions   and    for hiv  and positions       and    for m mulv had more modest effects dna   end directed cleavage was influenced substantially by positions         and   for hiv  and positions         and   for m mulv cleavage site distance from the recessed end did not affect sequence preferences for m mulv reverse transcriptase based on the identified sequence preferences a cleavage site recognized by both hiv  and m mulv enzymes was introduced into a sequence that was otherwise resistant to rnase h the isolated rnase h domain of m mulv reverse transcriptase retained sequence preferences at positions  and   despite prolific cleavage in the absence of the polymerase domain the sequence preferences of retroviral rnase h likely reflect structural features in the substrate that favor cleavage and represent a novel specificity determinant to consider in drug design
