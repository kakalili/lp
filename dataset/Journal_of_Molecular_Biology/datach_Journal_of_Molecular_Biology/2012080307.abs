autoinhibition of etv  tel dna binding appended helices sterically block the ets domain
etv  or tel  a transcriptional repressor belonging to the ets family is frequently involved in chromosomal translocations linked with human cancers it displays a dna binding mode distinct from other ets proteins due to the presence of a self associating pnt domain in this study we used nmr spectroscopy to dissect the structural and dynamic bases for the autoinhibition of etv dna binding by sequences c terminal to its ets domain the c terminal inhibitory domain cid contains two helices h and h  which sterically block the dna binding interface of the ets domain importantly these appended helices are only marginally stable as revealed by amide hydrogen exchange and  n relaxation measurements the cid is thus poised to undergo a facile conformational change as required for dna binding the cid also dampens millisecond timescale motions of the ets domain hypothesized to be critical for the recognition of specific ets target sequences this work illustrates the use of appended sequences on conserved structural domains to generate biological diversity and complements previous studies of the allosteric mechanism of ets autoinhibition to reveal both common and divergent features underlying the regulation of dna binding by ets transcription factors
