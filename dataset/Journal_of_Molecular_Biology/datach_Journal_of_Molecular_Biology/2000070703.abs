short tpa rich segments of the    region induce dna methylation in neurospora crassa edited by k yamamoto
the mechanisms that establish dna methylation in eukaryotes are poorly understood in principle methylation in a particular chromosomal region may reflect the presence of a  signal  that recruits methylation the absence of a signal that prevents methylation or both experiments were carried out to address these possibilities for the   kb zeta eta     region a relict of repeat induced point mutation rip in the fungus neurospora crassa the    region directs its own de novo methylation at a variety of chromosomal locations we tested the methylation potential of a nested set of fragments with deletions from one end of the    region various internal fragments of this region chimeras of  and the homologous unmutated allele theta    and various synthetic variants integrated precisely in single copy at the am locus on linkage group lg vr or the his  locus on lg ir we found that   the    region contains at least two non overlapping methylation signals   different fragments of the region can induce different levels of methylation   methylation induced by    sequences can spread far into flanking sequences   fragments as small as   bp can trigger methylation   methylation signals behave similarly but not identically at different chromosomal sites   mutation density per se does not determine whether sequences become methylated and   neither a t richness nor high densities of tpa dinucleotides typical attributes of methylated sequences in neurospora are essential features of methylation signals but both promote de novo methylation we conclude that de novo methylation of    sequences does not simply reflect the absence of signals that prevent methylation rather the region contains multiple positive signals that trigger methylation these findings conflict with earlier models for the control of dna methylation including the simplest version of the collapsed chromatin model
