crystal structure of an rluf  rna complex a base pair rearrangement is the key to selectivity of rluf for u   of the ribosome
escherichia coli pseudouridine synthase rluf is dedicated to modifying u   in a stem  loop of  s rna while a homologue rlub modifies the adjacent base u   both uridines are in the same rna stem separated by      the     x ray crystal structure of rluf bound to the isolated stem  loop in which u   is substituted by  fluorouridine to prevent catalytic turnover shows rluf distinguishes closely spaced bases in similar environments by a selectivity mechanism based on a frameshift in base pairing the rna stem  loop is bound to a conserved binding groove in the catalytic domain a base from a bulge in the stem a   has folded into the stem forcing one strand of the rna stem to translate by one position and thus positioning u   to flip into the active site rluf does not modify u   in mutant stem  loops that lack the a   bulge and shows dramatically higher activity for a stem  loop with a mutation designed to facilitate a   refolding into the stem with concomitant rna strand translation residues whose side chains contact rearranged bases in the bound stem  loop while conserved among rlufs are not conserved between rlufs and rlubs suggesting that rlub does not bind to the rearranged stem loop
