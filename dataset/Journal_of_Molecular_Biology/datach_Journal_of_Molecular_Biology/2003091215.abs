afm study of potato virus x disassembly induced by movement protein
recently we have reported that a selective binding of potato virus x pvx coded movement protein termed tgbp mp to one end of a polar coat protein cp helix converted viral rna into a translatable form and induced a linear destabilization of the whole helical particle here the native pvx virions rnase treated pvxrna deg helical particles lacking intact rna and their complexes with tgbp  tgbp  pvx and tgbp  pvxrna deg  were examined by atomic force microscopy afm  when complexes of the tgbp mp with pvx were examined by means of afm in liquid no structural reorganization of pvx particles was observed by contrast the products of tgbp dependent pvx degradation termed  beads on string  were formed under conditions of afm in air the afm images of pvxrna deg were indistinguishable from images of native pvx particles however the tgbp dependent disassembly of the cp helix was triggered when the tgbp  pvxrna deg complexes were examined by afm regardless of the conditions used in air or in liquid  our data supported the idea that binding of tgbp to one end of the pvx cp helix induced linear destabilization of the whole helical particle which may lead to its disassembly under conditions of afm
