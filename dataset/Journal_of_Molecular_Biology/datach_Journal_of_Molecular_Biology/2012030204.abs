complex spatial organization and flagellin composition of flagellar propeller from marine magnetotactic ovoid strain mo
marine magnetotactic ovoid bacterium mo  is capable of swimming along the geomagnetic field lines by means of its two sheathed flagellar bundles at a speed up to    m s in this study by using electron microscopy we showed that in each bundle six individual flagella were organized in hexagon with a seventh in the middle we identified  flagellin paralogs and  putative flagellins in the genome of mo  among them   were tandemly located on an     kb segment while the  th was on a separated locus using reverse transcription pcr and quantitative pcr we found that all the  flagellin or putative flagellin genes were transcribed and that  of them were more abundantly expressed than others a nlc nanoliquid chromatography  esi electrospray ionization  ms ms mass spectrometry mass spectrometry mass spectrometry analysis identified all the  flagellin proteins in three glycosylated polypeptide bands resolved by one dimensional denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and  of them in  spots obtained by means of two dimensional electrophoresis of flagellar extracts most spots contained more than one flagellin and eight of the ten identified flagellins existed in multiple isoforms taken together these results show unprecedented complexity in the spatial organization and flagellin composition of the flagellar propeller such architecture is observed only for ovoid  coccoid bilophotrichously flagellated magnetotactic bacteria living in marine sediments suggesting a species and environmental specificity
