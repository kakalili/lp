Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a family of calcium release channels found on intracellular calcium-handing organelles. Molecular cloning studies have identified three different RyR isoforms, which are 66–70% identical in amino acid sequence. In mammals, the three isoforms are encoded by three separate genes located on different chromosomes. The major variations among the isoforms occur in three regions, known as divergent regions 1, 2, and 3 (DR1, DR2, and DR3). In the present study, a modified RyR2 (cardiac isoform) cDNA was constructed, into which was inserted a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding cDNA within DR2, specifically after amino acid residue Thr1366 (RyR2T1366-GFP). HEK293 cells expressing RyR2T1366-GFP cDNAs showed caffeine-sensitive and ryanodine-sensitive calcium release, demonstrating that RyR2T1366-GFP forms functional calcium release channels. Cells expressing RyR2T1366-GFP were identified readily by the characteristic fluorescence of GFP, indicating that the overall structure of the inserted GFP was retained. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of purified RyR2T1366-GFP showed structurally intact receptors, and a three-dimensional reconstruction was obtained by single-particle image processing. The location of the inserted GFP was obtained by comparing this three-dimensional reconstruction to one obtained for wild-type RyR2. The inserted GFP and, consequently Thr1366 within DR2, was mapped on the three-dimensional structure of RyR2 to domain 6, one of the characteristic cytoplasmic domains that form part of the multi-domain “clamp” regions of RyR2. The three-dimensional location of DR2 suggests that it plays roles in the RyR conformational changes that occur during channel gating, and possibly in RyR's interaction with the dihydropyridine receptor in excitation–contraction coupling. This study further demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of the GFP insertion/cryo-EM approach for correlating RyR's amino acid sequence with its three-dimensional structure, thereby enhancing our understanding of the structural basis of RyR function.
