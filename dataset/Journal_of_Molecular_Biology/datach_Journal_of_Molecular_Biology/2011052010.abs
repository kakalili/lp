crystal structures and enzymatic properties of a triamine agmatine aminopropyltransferase from thermus thermophilus
to maintain functional conformations of dna and rna in high temperature environments an extremely thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus employs a unique polyamine biosynthetic pathway and produces more than  types of polyamines in the thermophile genome only one spermidine synthase homolog spee was found and it was shown to be a key enzyme in the pathway the catalytic assay of the purified enzyme revealed that it utilizes triamines norspermidine and spermidine and agmatine as acceptors in its aminopropyl transfer reaction therefore the enzyme was denoted as a triamine agmatine aminopropyltransferase taapt  we determined the crystal structures of the enzyme complexed with and without the aminopropyl group donor s adenosylmethionine despite sequence and structural similarity with spermidine synthases from other organisms a novel c terminal  sheet and differences in the catalytic site were observed the c terminal module interacts with the gatekeeping loop and fixes the open conformation of the loop to recognize larger polyamine substrates such as agmatine and spermidine additional computational docking studies suggest that the structural differences of the catalytic site also contribute to recognition of the aminopropyl aminobutyl or guanidium moiety of the substrates of taapt these results explain in part the extraordinarily diverse polyamine spectrum found in t thermophilus
