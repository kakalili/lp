elevated copper remodels hepatic rna processing machinery in the mouse model of wilson s disease
copper is essential to mammalian physiology and its homeostasis is tightly regulated in humans genetic defects in copper excretion result in copper overload and wilson s disease wd  previous studies on the mouse model for wd atp b     revealed copper accumulation in hepatic nuclei and specific changes in mrna profile prior to the onset of pathology to find a molecular link between nuclear copper elevation and changes in hepatic transcriptome we utilized quantitative ionomic and proteomic approaches x ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry analysis indicate that copper in the atp b    nucleus while highly elevated does not markedly alter nuclear ion content widespread protein oxidation is also not observed although the glutathione reductase selh is upregulated likely to maintain redox balance we further demonstrate that accumulating copper affects the abundance and or modification of a distinct subset of nuclear proteins these proteins populate pathways that are most significantly associated with rna processing an alteration in splicing pattern was observed for hnrnp a b  itself the rna shuttling factor and spliceosome component analysis of hnrnp a b mrna and protein revealed an increased retention of exon  and a selective  fold upregulation of a corresponding protein splice variant mass spectrometry measurements suggest that the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of rna binding proteins including hnrnp a b  is altered in the atp b    liver we conclude that remodeling of the rna processing machinery is an important component of cell response to elevated copper that may guide pathology development in the early stages of wd
