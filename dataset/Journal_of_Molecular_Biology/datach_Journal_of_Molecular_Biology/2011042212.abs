energetics of seca dimerization
transport of many proteins to extracytoplasmic locations occurs via the general secretion sec pathway in escherichia coli this pathway is composed of the secyeg protein conducting channel and the seca atpase seca plays a central role in binding the signal peptide region of preproteins directing preproteins to membrane bound secyeg and promoting translocation coupled with atp hydrolysis although it is well established that seca is crucial for preprotein transport and thus cell viability its oligomeric state during different stages of transport remains ill defined we have characterized the energetics of seca dimerization as a function of salt concentration and temperature and defined the linkage of seca dimerization and signal peptide binding using analytical ultracentrifugation the use of a new fluorescence detector permitted an analysis of seca dimerization down to concentrations as low as   nm the dimer dissociation constants are strongly dependent on salt linkage analysis indicates that seca dimerization is coupled to the release of about five ions demonstrating that electrostatic interactions play an important role in stabilizing the seca dimer interface binding of signal peptide reduces seca dimerization affinity such that kd increases about  fold from     m in the absence of peptide to     m in the presence of peptide the weakening of the seca dimer that accompanies signal peptide binding may poise the seca dimer to dissociate upon binding to secyeg
