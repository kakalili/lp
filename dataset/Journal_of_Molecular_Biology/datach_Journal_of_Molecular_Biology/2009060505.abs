topology is the principal determinant in the folding of a complex all alpha greek key death domain from human fadd
in order to elucidate the relative importance of secondary structure and topology in determining folding mechanism we have carried out a phi value analysis of the death domain dd from human fadd fadd dd is a   amino acid domain consisting of six anti parallel alpha helices arranged in a greek key structure we asked how does the folding of this domain compare with that of a other all alpha helical proteins and b other greek key proteins is the folding pathway determined mainly by secondary structure or is topology the principal determinant our  value analysis reveals a striking resemblance to the all beta greek key immunoglobulin like domains both fold via diffuse transition states and importantly long range interactions between the four central elements of secondary structure are established in the transition state the elements of secondary structure that are less tightly associated with the central core are less well packed in both cases topology appears to be the dominant factor in determining the pathway of folding in all greek key domains
