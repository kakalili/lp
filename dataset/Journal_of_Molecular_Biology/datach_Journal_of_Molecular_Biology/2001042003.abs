positively charged residues at the n terminal arm of the homeodomain are required for efficient dna binding by homeodomain leucine zipper proteins edited by m yaniv
plant homeodomain leucine zipper proteins unlike most animal homeodomains bind dna efficiently only as dimers in the present work we report that the deletion of the homeodomain n terminal arm first nine residues of the homeodomain leucine zipper protein hahb  dramatically affects its dna binding affinity causing a  fold increase in dissociation constant the addition of the n terminal arm of drosophila antennapedia to the truncated form restores the dna binding affinity of dimers to values similar to those of the native form however the antennapedia n terminal arm is not able to confer increased binding affinity to monomers of hahb  lacking the leucine zipper motif indicating that the inefficient binding of monomers must be due to structural differences in other parts of the molecule the construction of proteins with modifications at residues  to  of the homeodomain suggests strongly that positively charged amino acids at these positions play essential roles in determining the dna binding affinity however the effect of mutations at positions  and  can be counteracted by introducing a stretch of positively charged residues at positions  to  of the homeodomain sequence comparisons indicate that all homeodomain leucine zipper proteins might use contacts of the n terminal arm with dna for efficient binding the occurrence of a homeodomain with a dna interacting n terminal arm must then be an ancient acquisition in evolution earlier than the separation of lines leading to metazoa fungi and plants
