regulation of prion protein expression by noncoding regions of the prnp gene
expression of the cellular prion protein is necessary for the transmission and propagation of prion diseases increasing the level of prion protein expression decreases the incubation period for these diseases therefore understanding the regulation of prion protein expression could be critical for treating or preventing these diseases we investigated the regulation of prion protein expression by the promoter and noncoding regions of the bovine and murine prnp genes we determined that expression is modulated by intron  and exon  in the absence of intron  exon  inhibited activity of the promoter however intron  demonstrated promoter like activity and possessed a tata box in addition we identified an alternative transcript present in the brains of cattle and mice that lacks exon  taken together these results show that intron  and exon  play a critical role in the regulation of prion protein expression because switching off prion protein expression has been shown to arrest prion disease these regions present novel targets for intervention in the disease process
