evolvability of yeast protein  protein interaction interfaces
the functional importance of protein  protein interactions indicates that there should be strong evolutionary constraint on their interaction interfaces however binding interfaces are frequently affected by amino acid replacements change due to coevolution within interfaces can contribute to variability but is not ubiquitous an alternative explanation for the ability of surfaces to accept replacements may be that many residues can be changed without affecting the interaction candidates for these types of residues are those that make interchain interaction only through the protein main chain   carbon or associated hydrogen atoms since almost all residues have these atoms we hypothesize that this subset of interface residues may be more easily substituted than those that make interactions through other atoms we term such interactions  residue type independent   investigating this hypothesis we find that nearly a quarter of residues in protein interaction interfaces make exclusively interchain residue type independent contacts these residues are less structurally constrained and less conserved than residues making residue type specific interactions we propose that residue type independent interactions allow substitutions in binding interfaces while the specificity of binding is maintained
