mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes are destabilized in barth syndrome patients
mutations in the human taz gene are associated with barth syndrome an often fatal x linked disorder that presents with cardiomyopathy and neutropenia the taz gene encodes tafazzin a putative phospholipid acyltranferase that is involved in the remodeling of cardiolipin a phospholipid unique to the inner mitochondrial membrane it has been shown that the disruption of the tafazzin gene in yeast taz  affects the assembly and stability of respiratory chain complex iv and its supercomplex forms however the implications of these results for barth syndrome are restricted due to the additional presence of complex i in humans that forms a supercomplex with complexes iii and iv here we investigated the effects of tafazzin and hence cardiolipin deficiency in lymphoblasts from patients with barth syndrome using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis digitonin extraction revealed a more labile complex i iii iv supercomplex in mitochondria from barth syndrome cells with complex iv dissociating more readily from the supercomplex the interaction between complexes i and iii was also less stable with decreased levels of the complex i iii supercomplex reduction of complex i holoenzyme levels was observed also in the barth syndrome patients with a corresponding decrease in steady state subunit levels we propose that the loss of mature cardiolipin species in barth syndrome results in unstable respiratory chain supercomplexes thereby affecting complex i biogenesis respiratory activities and subsequent pathology
