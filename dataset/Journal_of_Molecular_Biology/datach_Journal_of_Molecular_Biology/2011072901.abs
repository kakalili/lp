t cell receptor signaling enhances transcriptional elongation from latent hiv proviruses by activating p tefb through an erk dependent pathway
latent human immunodeficiency virus hiv proviruses are thought to be primarily reactivated in vivo through stimulation of the t cell receptor tcr  activation of the tcr induces multiple signal transduction pathways leading to the ordered nuclear migration of the hiv transcription initiation factors nf  b nuclear factor  b and nfat nuclear factor of activated t cells  as well as potential effects on hiv transcriptional elongation we have monitored the kinetics of proviral reactivation using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to measure changes in the distribution of rna polymerase ii in the hiv provirus surprisingly in contrast to tnf   tumor necrosis factor   activation where early transcription elongation is highly restricted due to rate limiting concentrations of tat efficient and sustained hiv elongation and positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb recruitment are detected immediately after the activation of latent proviruses through the tcr inhibition of nfat activation by cyclosporine had no effect on either hiv transcription initiation or elongation however examination of p tefb complexes by gel filtration chromatography showed that tcr signaling led to the rapid dissociation of the large inactive p tefb sk rnp small nuclear rna sk ribonucleoprotein complex and the release of active low molecular weight p tefb complexes both p tefb recruitment to the hiv long terminal repeat and enhanced hiv processivity were blocked by the erk extracellular signal regulated kinase inhibitor u   but not by akt serine threonine protein kinase akt and pi k phosphatidylinositol  kinase inhibitors in contrast to treatment with hmba hexamethylene bisacetamide and drb   dichlorobenzimidazole   ribofuranoside  which disrupt the large sk rnp complex but do not stimulate early hiv elongation tcr signaling provides the first example of a physiological pathway that can shift the balance between the inactive p tefb pool and the active p tefb pool and thereby stimulate proviral reactivation
