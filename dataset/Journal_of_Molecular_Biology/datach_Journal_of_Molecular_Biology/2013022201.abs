intrinsic translocation barrier as an initial step in pausing by rna polymerase ii
pausing of rna polymerase ii rnap ii by backtracking on dna is a major regulatory mechanism in control of eukaryotic transcription backtracking occurs by extrusion of the   end of the rna from the active center after bond formation and before translocation of rnap ii on dna in several documented cases backtracking requires a special signal such as a t rich sequences forming an unstable rna  dna hybrid in the elongation complex however other sequence dependent backtracking signals and conformations of rnap ii leading to backtracking remain unknown here we demonstrate with s cerevisiae rnap ii that a cleavage deficient elongation factor tfiis tfiisaa enhances backtracked pauses during regular transcription this is due to increased efficiency of formation of an intermediate that leads to backtracking this intermediate may involve misalignment at the   end of the nascent rna in the active center of the yeast rnap ii and tfiisaa promotes formation of this intermediate at the dna sequences presenting a high energy barrier to translocation we proposed a three step mechanism for rnap ii pausing in which a prolonged dwell time in the pre translocated state increases the likelihood of the   rna end misalignment facilitating a backtrack pausing these results demonstrate an important role of the intrinsic blocks to forward translocation in pausing by rnap ii
