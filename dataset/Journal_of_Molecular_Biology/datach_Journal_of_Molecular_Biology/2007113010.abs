differential ubiquitination of smad mediated by chip implications in the regulation of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway
smad  a downstream regulator of the bone morphogenetic protein bmp receptors is tightly regulated by the ubiquitin proteasomal degradation system to dissect the mechanisms that underlie the regulation of smad  it is important to investigate the specific ubiquitination site s in smad  here we report that the  nh group of the n terminus and the  nh groups of internal lysine residues     and   k   k  and k   of smad are ubiquitin acceptor sites mediated by the carboxyl terminus of hsc  interacting protein chip  the in vitro degradation assay indicates that ubiquitination at the n terminus partially contributes to the degradation of smad  furthermore we demonstrate that the ubiquitination level of pseudo phosphorylated smad by chip is stronger than that of wild type smad and can be strongly inhibited by a phosphorylated tail of smad  pis ps v ps  third our results indicate that hsp  facilitates chip mediated poly ubiquitination of smad whereas it attenuates chip meditated mono ubiquitination of smad  finally consistent with the in vitro observation we show that chip preferentially mediates the degradation of phospho smad  in vivo taken together these results provide us a hint that chip might preferentially regulate phosphorylated smad and thus the bmp signaling
