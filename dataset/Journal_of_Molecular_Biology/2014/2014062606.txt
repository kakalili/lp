Annexin A2 (AnxA2) interacts with numerous ligands, including calcium, lipids, mRNAs and intracellular and extracellular proteins. Different post-translational modifications participate in the discrimination of the functions of AnxA2 by modulating its ligand interactions. Here, phospho-mimicking mutants (AnxA2-S25E and AnxA2-S25D) were employed to investigate the effects of Ser25 phosphorylation on the structure and function of AnxA2 by using AnxA2-S25A as a control. The overall α-helical structure of AnxA2 is not affected by the mutations, since the thermal stabilities and aggregation tendencies of the mutants differ only slightly from the wild-type (wt) protein. Unlike wt AnxA2, all mutants bind the anxA2 3′ untranslated region and β-γ-G-actin with high affinity in a Ca2+-independent manner. AnxA2-S25E is not targeted to the nucleus in transfected PC12 cells. In vitro phosphorylation of AnxA2 by protein kinase C increases its affinity to mRNA and inhibits its nuclear localisation, in accordance with the data obtained with the phospho-mimicking mutants. Ca2+-dependent binding of wt AnxA2 to phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate, as well as weaker but still Ca2+-dependent binding to phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate, was demonstrated by a protein–lipid overlay assay, whereas binding of AnxA2 to these lipids, as well as its binding to liposomes, is inhibited by the Ser25 mutations. Thus, introduction of a modification (mutation or phosphorylation) at Ser25 appears to induce a conformational change leading to increased accessibility of the mRNA- and G-actin-binding sites in domain IV independent of Ca2+ levels, while the Ca2+-dependent binding of AnxA2 to phospholipids is attenuated.
