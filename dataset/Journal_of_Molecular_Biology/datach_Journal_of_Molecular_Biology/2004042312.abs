high pressure promotes circularly shaped insulin amyloid
amyloids initially associated with certain degenerative diseases and recently with the prions and prion based inheritance in yeasts are linearly ordered  sheet rich protein aggregates presently thought to represent a rather common generic trait of proteins as polymers regardless of genetic origins and properties of precursor protein molecules amyloids share many physicochemical properties including the linear fibrillar morphology here we show that under high hydrostatic pressure insulin forms amyloids of a unique circular morphology despite a degree of size distribution the smallest forms of the approximate radius of      nm are most abundant among the ring shaped structures the circular amyloid is accompanied by bent     nm long fibrils the pressure enhancement of a ring like supramolecular fold suggests an anisotropic distribution of void volumes in regular amyloid fibres while the ability of high pressure to evoke such drastic perturbations on an amyloidogenic pathway may help tune conformation of amyloid templates e g inducing the prpsc type infectivity in amyloids grown in vitro from recombinant prp  the very finding raises new questions concerning possible consequences for high pressure food processing
