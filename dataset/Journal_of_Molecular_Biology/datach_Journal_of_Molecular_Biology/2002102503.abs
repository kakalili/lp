molecular mechanism of the interaction between mdm and p
we have investigated the kinetic and thermodynamic basis of the p   mdm interaction using a set of peptides based on residues     of p  wild type p  peptide bound mdm with a dissociation constant of  nm phosphorylation of s  and s  did not affect binding but t  phosphorylation weakened binding tenfold indicating that phosphorylation of only t  is responsible for abrogating p   mdm binding truncation to residues     increased affinity  fold but further truncation to     abolished binding nmr studies of the binding of the p  derived peptides revealed global conformational changes of the overall structure of mdm  stretching far beyond the binding cleft indicating significant changes in the domain dynamics of mdm upon ligand binding
