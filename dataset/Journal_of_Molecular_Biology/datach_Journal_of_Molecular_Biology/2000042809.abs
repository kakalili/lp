the pressure temperature free energy landscape of staphylococcal nuclease monitored by h nmr edited by p e wright
the thermodynamic stability of staphylococcal nuclease was studied against the variation of both temperature and pressure by utilizing h nmr spectroscopy at   mhz in  mm mes buffer containing     h o ph   equilibrium fractions of folded and unfolded protein species were evaluated with the proton signals of two histidine residues as monitor in the pressure range of     bar and in the temperature range of    c   c from the multi parameter fit of the experimental data to the gibbs energy equation expressed as a simultaneous function of pressure and temperature we determined the compressibility change     the volume change at  bar  v  and the expansivity change    upon unfolding among other thermodynamic parameters           ml mol   bar            ml mol   k    v         ml mol   at   c   g       kj mol   at   c   cp      kj mol   k    s        kj mol   k   at   c  the result yields a three dimensional free energy surface i e the free energy landscape of staphylococcal nuclease on the p t plane the significantly positive   and   values suggest that in the pressure denatured state staphylococcal nuclease forms a loosely packed and fluctuating structure the slight but statistically significant difference between the unfolding transitions of the his and his  environments is considered to reflect local fluctuations in the native state leading to pre melting of the his  environment prior to the cooperative unfolding of the major part of the protein
