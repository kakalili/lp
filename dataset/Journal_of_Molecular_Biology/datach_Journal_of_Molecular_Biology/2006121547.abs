signaling through toll like receptor   induces the differentiation of human bone marrow cd  progenitor cells along the myeloid lineage
toll like receptors tlrs play a key role in pathogen recognition and regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses although tlr expression and signaling have been investigated in blood cells it is currently unknown whether their bone marrow ancestors express tlrs and respond to their ligands here we found that tlrs e g tlr  tlr and tlr  were expressed by freshly isolated human bone marrow bm hematopoietic cd  progenitor cells incubation of these primitive cells with tlr ligands such as immunostimulatory small interfering rnas and r   a specific ligand for tlr   induced cytokine production e g il   il  il  tnf   gm csf  moreover tlr  signaling induced the differentiation of bm cd  progenitors into cells with the morphology of macrophages and monocytic dendritic precursors characterized by the expression of cd  cd  and or cd c markers by contrast r  ligand did not induce the expression of glycophorin a an early marker for erythropoiesis collectively the data indicate for the first time that human bm cd  progenitor cells constitutively express functional tlr tlr  whose ligation can induce leukopoiesis without the addition of any exogenous cytokines thus tlr signaling may regulate bm cell development in humans
