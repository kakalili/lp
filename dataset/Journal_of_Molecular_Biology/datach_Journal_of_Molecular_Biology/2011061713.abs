regioselective control of  d glucose oxidation by pyranose  oxidase is intimately coupled to conformational degeneracy
trametes multicolor pyranose  oxidase p o is a flavoprotein oxidase that oxidizes d glucose at c to  keto d glucose by a highly regioselective mechanism in this work fluorinated sugar substrates were used as mechanistic probes to investigate the basis of regioselectivity in p o although frequently used to study the mechanisms of glycoside hydrolases our work provides the first example of applying these probes to sugar oxidoreductases our previous structure of the p o mutant h  a in complex with the slow substrate  deoxy  fluoro d glucose showed a substrate binding mode compatible with oxidation at c  to accommodate the sugar a gating segment   fsy   in the substrate recognition loop partly unfolded to create a spacious and more polar active site that is distinct from the closed state of p o the crystal structure presented here shows that the preferred c oxidation where an ordered complex of p o h  a with  deoxy  fluoro d glucose at     resolution was successfully trapped in this semi open c oxidation complex the substrate recognition loop tightens to form an optimized substrate complex stabilized by interactions between asp  and glucose o  as well as tyr  and the glucose o group interactions that are not possible when glucose is positioned for oxidation at c  the different conformations of the  fsy  gating segment in the semi open and closed states induce backbone and side chain movements of thr  and asp  that add further differential stabilization to the individual states we expect the semi open state c oxidation state and closed state to be good approximations of the active site structure during the reductive half reaction sugar oxidation and oxidative half reaction o reduction
