de novo proteins with life sustaining functions are structurally dynamic
designing and producing novel proteins that fold into stable structures and provide essential biological functions are key goals in synthetic biology in initial steps toward achieving these goals we constructed a combinatorial library of de novo proteins designed to fold into  helix bundles as described previously screening this library for sequences that function in vivo to rescue conditionally lethal mutants of escherichia coli auxotrophs yielded several de novo sequences termed synrescue proteins which rescued four different e coli auxotrophs in an effort to understand the structural requirements necessary for auxotroph rescue we investigated the biophysical properties of the synrescue proteins using both computational and experimental approaches results from circular dichroism size exclusion chromatography and nmr demonstrate that the synrescue proteins are  helical and relatively stable surprisingly however they do not form well ordered structures instead they form dynamic structures that fluctuate between monomeric and dimeric states these findings show that a well ordered structure is not a prerequisite for life sustaining functions and suggests that dynamic structures may have been important in the early evolution of protein function
