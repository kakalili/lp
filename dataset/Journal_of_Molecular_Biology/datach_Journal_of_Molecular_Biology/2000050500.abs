mapping the protein dna interface and the metal binding site of the major human apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease edited by j m miller
apurinic apyrimidinic ap endonuclease ape is a key enzyme in the mammalian base excision repair pathway that corrects ap sites in the genome ape cleaves the phosphodiester bond immediately   to ap sites through a hydrolytic reaction involving a divalent metal co factor here site directed mutagenesis chemical footprinting techniques and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to gain insights into how ape interacts with its metal cation and ap dna it was found that ape binds predominantly to the minor groove of ap dna and that residues r  and y  contribute to protein dna complex stability furthermore the ape ap dna footprint does not change along its reaction pathway upon active site coordination of mg  or in the presence of dna polymerase beta pol   an interactive protein partner in ap site repair the dna region immediately   to the abasic residue was determined to be in close proximity to the ape metal binding site experimental evidence is provided that amino acid residues e  d  and d  of ape are involved in metal coordination molecular dynamics simulations starting from the active site of the ape crystal structure suggest that d  and e  bind directly to the metal while d  coordinates the cation through the first hydration shell these studies define the ape ap dna interface determine the effect of pol  on the ape dna interaction and reveal new insights into the ape active site and overall protein dynamics
