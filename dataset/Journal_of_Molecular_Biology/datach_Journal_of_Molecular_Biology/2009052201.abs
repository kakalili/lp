insights into the enzymatic mechanism of  phosphogluconolactonase from trypanosoma brucei using structural data and molecular dynamics simulation
trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of african sleeping sickness current work for the development of new drugs against this pathology includes evaluation of enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway ppp  which first requires a clear understanding of their function and mechanism of action in this context we focused on t brucei  phosphogluconolactonase tb pgl  which converts   phosphogluconolactone into  phosphogluconic acid in the second step of the ppp we have determined the crystal structure of tb pgl in complex with two ligands  phosphogluconic acid and citrate at     and     resolution respectively we have performed molecular dynamics md simulations on tb pgl in its empty form and in complex with   phosphogluconolactone its natural ligand analysis of the structural data and md simulations allowed us to propose a detailed enzymatic mechanism for pgl enzymes
