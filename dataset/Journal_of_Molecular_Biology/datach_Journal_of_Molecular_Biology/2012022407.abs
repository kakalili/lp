temporal regulation of gene expression of the escherichia coli bacteriophage phieco
escherichia coli phage phieco  encodes two proteins that bind to host rna polymerase rnap  gp  a novel protein and gp  a distant homolog of   family proteins here we investigated the temporal pattern of phieco  and host gene expression during infection host transcription shutoff and three distinct bacteriophage temporal gene classes early middle and late were revealed a combination of bioinformatic and biochemical approaches allowed identification of phage promoters recognized by a host rnap holoenzyme containing the   factor these promoters are located upstream of early phage genes a combination of macroarray data primer extension and in vitro transcription analyses allowed identification of six promoters recognized by an rnap holoenzyme containing gp  these promoters are characterized by a single consensus element taatgtata and are located upstream of the middle and late phage genes curiously gp  an inhibitor of host and early phage transcription by   holoenzyme activated transcription by the gp  holoenzyme in vitro
