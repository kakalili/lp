a humanized aldolase antibody for selective chemotherapy and adaptor immunotherapy
mouse monoclonal antibody  c is the prototype of a new class of catalytic antibodies that were generated by reactive immunization through a reactive lysine  c catalyzes aldol and retro aldol reactions using the enamine mechanism of natural aldolases in addition to its remarkable versatility and efficacy in synthetic organic chemistry  c has been used for the selective activation of prodrugs in vitro and in vivo and thereby emerged as a promising tool for selective chemotherapy adding another application with relevance for cancer therapy designated adaptor immunotherapy we have recently shown that  c can be chemically programmed to target tumors by formation of a covalent bond of defined stoichiometry with a  diketone derivative of an integrin  v  targeting rgd peptidomimetic however a major limitation for the transition from preclinical to clinical evaluation is the human anti mouse antibody immune response that mouse  c is likely to elicit in a majority of patients after single administration here we report the humanization of mouse  c based on rational design guided by molecular modeling in essence the catalytic center of mouse  c  which encompasses a deep hydrophobic pocket with a reactive lysine residue at the bottom was grafted into a human antibody framework humanized  c igg was found to bind to  diketone haptens with conserved affinities and revealed strong catalytic activity with identical kcat and slightly higher km values compared to the parental mouse antibody furthermore humanized  c igg revealed efficiency in prodrug activation and chemical programming comparable to the parental mouse antibody
