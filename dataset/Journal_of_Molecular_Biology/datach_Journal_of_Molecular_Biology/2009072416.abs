novel tag and exchange rmce strategies generate master cell clones with predictable and stable transgene expression properties
site specific recombinases have revolutionized the systematic generation of transgenic cell lines and embryonic stem cells animals and will ultimately also reveal their potential in the genetic modification of induced pluripotent stem cells introduced in    our flp recombinase mediated cassette exchange strategy permits the exchange of a target cassette for a cassette with the gene of interest introduced as a part of an exchange vector the process is  clean  in the sense that it does not co introduce prokaryotic vector parts neither does it leave behind a selection marker stringent selection principles provide master cell lines permitting subsequent recombinase mediated cassette exchange cycles in the absence of a drug selection and with a considerable efficiency      exemplified by chinese hamster ovary cells the strategy proves to be successful even for cell lines with an unstable genotype
