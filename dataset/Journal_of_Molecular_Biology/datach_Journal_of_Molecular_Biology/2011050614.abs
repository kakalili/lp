biochemical and structural characterization of lysophosphatidic acid binding by a humanized monoclonal antibody
lysophosphatidic acid lpa is a common product of glycerophospholipid metabolism and an important mediator of signal transduction aberrantly high lpa concentrations accompany multiple disease states one potential approach for treatment of these diseases therefore is the therapeutic application of antibodies that recognize and bind lpa as their antigen we have determined the x ray crystal structure of an anti lpa antibody lt   fab fragment in its antigen free form to     resolution and in complex with two lpa isotypes    and    to resolutions of   and      respectively the variable cdr complementarity determining region loops at the antigen binding site adopt nearly identical conformations in the free and antigen bound crystal structures the crystallographic models reveal that the lt   antibody employs both heavy and light chain cdr loops to create a network of eight hydrogen bonds with the glycerophosphate head group of its lpa antigen the head group is almost completely excluded from contact with solvent while the hydrocarbon tail is partially solvent exposed in general mutation of amino acid residues at the antigen binding site disrupts lpa binding however the introduction of particular mutations chosen strategically on the basis of the structures can positively influence lpa binding affinity finally these structures elucidate the exquisite specificity demonstrated by an anti lipid antibody for binding a structurally simple and seemingly unconstrained target molecule
