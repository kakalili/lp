crystal structure of the translocation atpase seca from thermus thermophilus reveals a parallel head to head dimer
the mechanism of pre protein export through the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane in which the seca atpase plays a crucial role as an  energy supplier   is poorly understood in particular biochemical and structural studies provide contradictory data as to the oligomeric state of seca when it is integrated into the active trans membrane translocase here we report the     resolution crystal structure of the thermus thermophilus seca protein ttseca  whereas the structure of the ttseca monomer closely resembles that from other bacteria the oligomeric state of ttseca is strikingly distinct in contrast to the antiparallel head to tail dimerization reported previously for the other bacterial systems ttseca forms parallel head to head dimers that are reminiscent of open scissors the dimer interface is abundant in bulky arg and lys side chains from both subunits which stack on one another to form an unusual  basic zipper  that is highly conserved as revealed by homology modeling and sequence analysis the basic zipper is sealed on both ends by two pairs of the salt bridges formed between the basic side chains from the zipper and two invariant acidic residues the organization of the dimers in which the two pre protein binding domains are located proximal to each other at the tip of the  scissors   might allow a concerted mode of substrate recognition while the opening closing of the scissors might facilitate translocation
