acceptor  donor  acceptor  motifs recognize the watson  crick hoogsteen and sugar  donor  acceptor  donor  edges of adenine and adenosine containing ligands
nucleotides are among the most extensively exploited chemical moieties in nature and as a part of a handful of different protein ligands nucleotides play key roles in energy transduction enzymatic catalysis and regulation of protein function we have previously reported that in many proteins with different folds and functions a distinctive adenine binding motif is involved in the recognition of the watson  crick edge of adenine here we show that many proteins do have clear structural motifs that recognize adenosine and some other nucleotides and nucleotide analogs not only through the watson  crick edge but also through the sugar and hoogsteen edges each of the three edges of adenosine has a donor  acceptor  donor dad pattern that is often recognized by proteins via a complementary acceptor  donor  acceptor ada motif whereby three distinct hydrogen bonds are formed two conventional n  h  o and n  h  n hydrogen bonds and one weak c  h  o hydrogen bond the local conformation of the adenine binding loop is    or    and reflects the mode of nucleotide binding additionally we report  proteins from five different folds that simultaneously recognize both the sugar edge and the watson  crick edge of adenine in these proteins a unique  loop  supersecondary structure grasps an adenine containing ligand between two identical adenine binding motifs as part of the    loop  fold
