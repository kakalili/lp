use of analogues of methionine and methionyl adenylate to sample conformational changes during catalysis in escherichia coli methionyl trna synthetase
binding of methionine to methionyl trna synthetase metrs is known to promote conformational changes within the active site however the contribution of these rearrangements to enzyme catalysis is not fully understood in this study several methionine and methionyl adenylate analogues were diffused into crystals of the monomeric form of escherichia coli methionyl trna synthetase the structures of the corresponding complexes were solved at resolutions below    and compared to those of the enzyme free or complexed with methionine residues y  and w  play key roles in the strength of the binding of the amino acid and of its analogues indeed full motions of these residues are required to recover the maximum in free energy of binding residue y  also controls the size of the hydrophobic pocket where the amino acid side chain interacts h  appears to participate to the specific recognition of the sulphur atom of methionine complexes with methionyl adenylate analogues illustrate the shielding by metrs of the region joining the methionine and adenosine moieties finally the structure of metrs complexed to a methionine analogue mimicking the tetrahedral carbon of the transition state in the aminoacylation reaction was solved on the basis of this model we propose that in response to the binding of the   end of trna y  moves again in order to deshield the anhydride bond in the natural adenylate
