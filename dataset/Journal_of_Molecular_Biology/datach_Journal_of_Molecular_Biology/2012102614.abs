crystal structure of cucumisin a subtilisin like endoprotease from cucumis melo l
cucumisin is a plant serine protease isolated as an extracellular glycoprotein from the melon fruit cucumis melo l var prince cucumisin is composed of multiple domain modules including catalytic protease associated and fibronectin  iii like domains the crystal structure of cucumisin was determined by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion method and refined at    resolution a structural homology search indicated that the catalytic domain of cucumisin shares structural similarity with subtilisin and subtilisin like fold enzymes according to the z score the highest structural similarity is with tomato subtilase  sbt  with an rmsd of    for the entire region the dimer formation mediated by the protease associated domain in sbt is a distinctive structural characteristic of cucumisin on the other hand analytical ultracentrifugation indicated that cucumisin is mainly monomeric in solution although the locations of the amino acid residues composing the catalytic triad are well conserved between cucumisin and sbt  a disulfide bond is uniquely located near the active site of cucumisin the steric circumstances of the active site with this disulfide bond are distinct from those of sbt  and it contributes to the substrate preference of cucumisin especially at the p position among the plant serine proteases the thermostability of cucumisin is higher than that of its structural homologue sbt  as determined by their melting points a structural comparison between cucumisin and sbt revealed that cucumisin possesses less surface area and shortened loop regions consequently the higher thermostability of cucumisin is achieved by its more compact structure
