domain iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae  s ribosomal rna its role in binding of ribosomal protein l  and  s subunit formation edited by d e draper
domain iii of saccharomyces cerevisiae  s rrna contains the recognition site for the primary rrna binding ribosomal protein l  which belongs to the functionally conserved el  l  family of ribosomal proteins the el  l  binding region is very complex consisting of several irregular helices held together by long distance secondary and tertiary interactions moreover it contains the eukaryote specific v  d a expansion segment functional characterisation of the structural elements of this site by a detailed in vitro and in vivo mutational analysis indicates the presence of two separate regions that are directly involved in l  binding in particular mutation of either of two conserved nucleotides in the loop of helix  significantly reduces in vitro l  binding thus strongly supporting their role as attachment sites for the r protein two other helices appear to be primarily required for the correct folding of the binding site mutations that abolish in vitro binding of l  block accumulation of  s rrna in vivo because they stall pre rrna processing at the level of its immediate precursor the  sb pre rrna surprisingly several mutations that do not significantly affect l  binding in vitro cause the same lethal defect in  sb pre rrna processing deletion of the v expansion segment also leads to under accumulation of mature  s rrna and a twofold reduction in growth rate we conclude that an intact domain iii including the v expansion segment is essential for normal processing and assembly of  s rrna
