positive and negative selection of mutant forms of prokaryotic cyanobacterial ribulose   bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase
a system for biological selection of randomly mutagenized ribulose   bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco genes from the cyanobacterium synechococcus pcc   was designed in which a rubisco deletion mutant of the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus served as a host trans complementation with the synechococcus pcc   rbcls genes enabled anaerobic photoautotrophic growth of the r capsulatus deletion strain with  co  but not with   co in the atmosphere and this strain could not grow under aerobic chemoautotrophic conditions phenotypic differences between the r capsulatus host strain complemented with the wild type rbcls genes and transconjugates carrying mutated genes were used to identify mutants that were able to complement to photoautotrophic growth with   co  these  positive  mutant proteins were unaffected for any measured kinetic properties with a single exception a mutant with a valine substitution at phenylalanine   had an increased affinity for ribulose   bisphosphate mutants with changes in the affinity for co were isolated through negative selection in which mutants incapable of complementing r capsulatus to photoautotrophic growth with  co were identified mutations at aspartate   resulted in enzymes that were greatly affected for different kinetic parameters including an increased km for co  this study demonstrated that random mutagenesis and bioselection procedures could be used to identify mutations that influence important properties of bacterial rubisco these residues would not have been identified by other methods
