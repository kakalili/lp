mining the structural genomics pipeline identification of protein properties that affect high throughput experimental analysis
structural genomics projects represent major undertakings that will change our understanding of proteins they generate unique datasets that for the first time present a standardized view of proteins in terms of their physical and chemical properties by analyzing these datasets here we are able to discover correlations between a protein s characteristics and its progress through each stage of the structural genomics pipeline from cloning expression purification and ultimately to structural determination first we use tree based analyses decision trees and random forest algorithms to discover the most significant protein features that influence a protein s amenability to high throughput experimentation based on this we identify potential bottlenecks in various stages of the structural genomics process through specialized  pipeline schematics   we find that the properties of a protein that are most significant are  i whether it is conserved across many organisms  ii the percentage composition of charged residues  iii the occurrence of hydrophobic patches  iv the number of binding partners it has and v its length conversely a number of other properties that might have been thought to be important such as nuclear localization signals are not significant thus using our tree based analyses we are able to identify combinations of features that best differentiate the small group of proteins for which a structure has been determined from all the currently selected targets this information may prove useful in optimizing high throughput experimentation further information is available from http  mining nesg org
