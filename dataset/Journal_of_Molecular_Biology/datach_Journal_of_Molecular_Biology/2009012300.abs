structure of the type iii secretion recognition protein yscu from yersinia enterocolitica
the inner membrane protein yscu has an important role during the assembly of the yersinia enterocolitica type iii secretion injectisome its cytoplasmic domain yscuc recognizes translocators as individual substrates in the export hierarchy activation of yscu entails autocleavage at a conserved npth motif modification of this motif markedly changes the properties of yscu including translocator export cessation and production of longer injectisome needles we determined the crystal structures of the uncleaved variants n  a and n  d of yscuc at     and     resolution respectively the globular domain is found to consist of a central mixed  sheet surrounded by  helices the npth motif forms a type ii  turn connecting two  strands nmr analysis of cleaved and uncleaved yscuc indicates that the global structure of the protein is retained in cleaved yscuc the structure of yscuc variant n  d reveals that wild type yscuc is poised for cleavage due to an optimal reaction geometry for nucleophilic attack of the scissile bond by the side chain of asn   in vivo analysis of n  q and h  a r  a yscu variants showed a phenotype that combines the absence of translocator secretion with normal needle length control comparing the structure of yscu to those of related proteins reveals that the linker domain between the n terminal transmembrane domain and the autocleavage domain can switch from an extended to a largely  helical conformation allowing for optimal positioning of the autocleavage domain during injectisome assembly
