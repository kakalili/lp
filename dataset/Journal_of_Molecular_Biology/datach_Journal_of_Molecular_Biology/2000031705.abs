gene sequence and crystal structure of the aldehyde oxidoreductase from desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc    edited by d c rees
the aldehyde oxidoreductase mod isolated from the sulfate reducer desulfovibrio desulfuricans atcc    is a member of the xanthine oxidase family of molybdenum containing enzymes it has substrate specificity similar to that of the homologous enzyme from desulfovibrio gigas mop and the primary sequences from both enzymes show   identity the enzyme was crystallized in space group p   with unit cell dimensions of a b     and c      and diffraction data were obtained to beyond     the crystal structure was solved by patterson search techniques using the coordinates of the d gigas enzyme the overall fold of the d desulfuricans enzyme is very similar to mop and the few differences are mapped to exposed regions of the molecule this is reflected in the electrostatic potential surfaces of both homologous enzymes one exception being the surface potential in a region identifiable as the putative docking site of the physiological electron acceptor other essential features of the mop structure such as residues of the active site cavity are basically conserved in mod two mutations are located in the pocket bearing a chain of catalytically relevant water molecules as deduced from this work both these enzymes are very closely related in terms of their sequences as well as d structures the comparison allowed confirmation and establishment of features that are essential for their function namely conserved residues in the active site catalytically relevant water molecules and recognition of the physiological electron acceptor docking site
