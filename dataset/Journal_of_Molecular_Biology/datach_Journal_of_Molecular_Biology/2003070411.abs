general method for sequence independent site directed chimeragenesis
we have developed a simple and general method that allows for the facile recombination of distantly related or unrelated proteins at multiple discrete sites to evaluate the sequence independent site directed chimeragenesis sisdc method we have recombined  lactamases tem  and pse  at seven sites examined the quality of the chimeric genes created and screened the library of     chimeras for functional enzymes probe hybridization and sequencing analyses revealed that sisdc generated a random library with little sequence bias and in which all targeted fragments were recombined in the desired order sequencing the genes from clones having functional lactamases identified  unique chimeras these chimeras are characterized by a lower level of disruption as calculated by the schema algorithm than the library as a whole these results illustrate the use of sisdc in creating designed chimeric protein libraries and further illustrate the ability of schema to identify chimeras whose folded structures are likely not to be disrupted by recombination
