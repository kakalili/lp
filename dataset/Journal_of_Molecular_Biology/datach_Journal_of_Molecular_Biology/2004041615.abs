leaving group activation by aromatic stacking an alternative to general acid catalysis
general acid catalysis is a powerful and widely used strategy in enzymatic nucleophilic displacement reactions for example hydrolysis phosphorolysis of the n glycosidic bond in nucleosides and nucleotides commonly involves the protonation of the leaving nucleobase concomitant with nucleophilic attack however in the nucleoside hydrolase of the parasite trypanosoma vivax crystallographic and mutagenesis studies failed to identify a general acid this enzyme binds the purine base of the substrate between the aromatic side chains of trp  and trp   here we show via quantum chemical calculations that face to face stacking can raise the pka of a heterocyclic aromatic compound by several units site directed mutagenesis combined with substrate engineering demonstrates that trp  catalyzes the cleavage of the glycosidic bond by promoting the protonation of the purine base at n  hence functioning as an alternative to general acid catalysis
