Many proteins display complex folding kinetics, which represent multiple parallel folding pathways emanating from multiple unfolded forms and converging to the unique native form. The small protein thioredoxin from Escherichia coli is one such protein. The effect of the chaperonin GroEL on modulating the complex energy landscape that separates the unfolded ensemble from the native state of thioredoxin has been studied. It is shown that while the fluorescence change accompanying folding occurs in five kinetic phases in the absence of GroEL, only the two slowest kinetic phases are discernible in the presence of saturating concentrations of GroEL. This result is shown to be consistent with only one out of several available folding routes being operational in the presence of GroEL. It is shown that native protein, which forms via fast as well as slow routes in the absence of GroEL, forms only via a slow route in its presence. The effect of GroEL on the folding of thioredoxin is shown to be the consequence of it binding differentially to the many folding-competent forms. While some of these forms can continue folding when bound to GroEL, others cannot. All molecules are then drawn into the operational folding route by the law of mass action. This observation indicates a new role for GroEL, which is to bias the energy landscape of a folding polypeptide towards fewer available pathways. It is suggested that such channeling might be a mechanism to avoid possible aggregation-prone routes available to a refolding polypeptide in vivo.
