alternative splicing of an amino terminal pevk like region generates multiple isoforms of drosophila projectin edited by m f moody
drosophila projectin is an extremely large protein found within the muscle sarcomeric unit parallel with the actin and myosin filaments projectin has been suggested as the elastic component of c filaments in insect indirect flight muscles which is consistent with its localization from the z band to the tip of the a band in these muscles here we describe the completion of the projectin sequence analysis which defines projectin as a  mda protein composed of  immunoglobulin and  fibronectin iii domains this analysis led also to the identification of a domain rich in the amino acids p e v and k within the nh terminus of projectin the length of the projectin pevk like region varies from   to   amino acid residues following a complex pattern of alternative splicing events pevk domains were first identified in vertebrate titin and they have been associated with the elasticity of the protein the pevk like domain of the projectin isoforms in indirect flight muscles may contribute to the elastic function of the c filaments the synchronous projectin isoforms contain a pevk like region and the possible non elastic function s of this domain in synchronous muscles are discussed
