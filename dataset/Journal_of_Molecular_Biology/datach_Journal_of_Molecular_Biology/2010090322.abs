the structure of the fniii tandem a  a  points to a periodically conserved architecture in the myosin binding region of titin
titin is a large intrasarcomeric protein that among its many roles in muscle is thought to modulate the in vivo assembly of the myosin motor filament this is achieved through the molecular template properties of its a band region which is composed of fibronectin type iii fniii and immunoglobulin ig domains organized into characteristic  domain d zone and  domain c zone superrepeats currently there is little knowledge on the structural details of this region of titin here we report the conformational characterization of three fniii tandems a  a  a  a  and a  a  which are components of the representative fourth c zone superrepeat the structure of a  a  has been elucidated by x ray crystallography to     resolution while low resolution models of a  a  and a  a  have been calculated using small angle x ray scattering a  a  adopts an extended  up  down  domain arrangement where domains are connected by a hydrophilic three residue linker sequence the linker is embedded in a rich network of polar contacts at the domain interface that results in a stiff molecular conformation the models of a  a  and a  a  which contain hydrophobic six residue long interdomain linkers equally showed elongated molecular shapes but with slightly coiled or zigzagged conformations small angle x ray scattering data further suggested that the long linkers do not result in a noticeable increase in molecular flexibility but lead to semibent domain arrangements our findings indicate that the structural characteristics of fniii tandems from a band titin contrast markedly with those of poly ig tandems from the elastic i band which exhibit domain interfaces depleted of interactions and compliant conformations furthermore the analysis of sequence conservation in fniii domains from a band titin points to the existence of conformationally defined interfaces at specific superrepeat positions possibly leading to a periodic and locally ordered architecture supporting the molecular scaffold properties of this region of titin
