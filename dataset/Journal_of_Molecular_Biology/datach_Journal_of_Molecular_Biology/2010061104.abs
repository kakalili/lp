distant neighbor base sequence context effects in human nucleotide excision repair of a benzo a pyrene derived dna lesion
the effects of non nearest base sequences beyond the nucleotides flanking a dna lesion on either side on nucleotide excision repair ner in extracts from human cells were investigated we constructed two duplexes containing the same minor groove aligned  s   trans anti b a p n dg g   dna adduct derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo a pyrene b a p    c c a t c g  c t a c c    cg  c i  and   c a c a c g  c a c a c    cg  c ii  we used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to compare the extent of dna bending and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the structural characteristics of these two dna duplexes the ner efficiencies are      fold greater in the case of the cg  c ii than the cg  c i sequence context in   mer duplexes gel electrophoresis and self ligation circularization experiments revealed that the cg  c ii duplex is more bent than the cg  c i duplex while molecular dynamics simulations showed that the unique c a c  segment in the cg  c ii duplex plays a key role the presence of a minor groove positioned guanine amino group the watson  crick partner to c  acts as a wedge facilitated by a highly deformable local c a  base step this amino group allows the b a p ring system to produce a more enlarged minor groove in cg  c ii than in cg  c i as well as a local untwisting and enlarged and flexible roll only in the cg  c ii sequence these structural properties fit well with our earlier findings that in the case of the family of minor groove  s   trans anti b a p n dg lesions flexible bends and enlarged minor groove widths constitute ner recognition signals and extend our understanding of sequence context effects on ner to the neighbors that are distant to the lesion
