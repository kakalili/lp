structural clusters of evolutionary trace residues are statistically significant and common in proteins edited by f e cohen
given the massive increase in the number of new sequences and structures a critical problem is how to integrate these raw data into meaningful biological information one approach the evolutionary trace or et uses phylogenetic information to rank the residues in a protein sequence by evolutionary importance and then maps those ranked at the top onto a representative structure if these residues form structural clusters they can identify functional surfaces such as those involved in molecular recognition now that a number of examples have shown that et can identify binding sites and focus mutational studies on their relevant functional determinants we ask whether the method can be improved so as to be applicable on a large scale to address this question we introduce a new treatment of gaps resulting from insertions and deletions which streamlines the selection of sequences used as input we also introduce objective statistics to assess the significance of the total number of clusters and of the size of the largest one as a result of the novel treatment of gaps et performance improves measurably we find evolutionarily privileged clusters that are significant at the   level in  out of      proteins drawn from a variety of structural classes and biological functions in  of the  proteins for which a protein ligand complex is available the dominant cluster contacts the ligand we conclude that spatial clustering of evolutionarily important residues is a general phenomenon consistent with the cooperative nature of residues that determine structure and function in practice these results suggest that et can be applied on a large scale to identify functional sites in a significant fraction of the structures in the protein databank pdb  this approach to combining raw sequences and structure to obtain detailed insights into the molecular basis of function should prove valuable in the context of the structural genomics initiative
