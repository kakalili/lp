a view of dynamics changes in the molten globule native folding step by quasielastic neutron scattering edited by p e wright
in order to understand the changes in protein dynamics that occur in the final stages of protein folding we have used neutron scattering to probe the differences between a protein in its folded state and the molten globule states the internal dynamics of bovine  lactalbumin bla and its molten globules mbla have been examined using incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering iqns  the iqns results show length scale dependent pico second dynamics changes on length scales from   to    studied on shorter length scales the non exchangeable protons undergo jump motions over potential barriers as those involved in side chain rotamer changes the mean potential barrier to local jump motions is higher in bla than in mbla as might be expected on longer length scales the protons undergo spatially restricted diffusive motions with the diffusive motions being more restricted in bla than in mbla both bla and mbla have similar mean square amplitudes of high frequency motions comparable to the chemical bond vibrational motions bond vibrational motions thus do not change significantly upon folding interestingly the quasielastic scattering intensities show pronounced maxima for both bla and mbla suggesting that  clusters  of atoms are moving collectively within the proteins on picosecond time scales the correlation length or  the cluster size   of such atom clusters moving collectively is dramatically reduced in the molten globules with the correlation length being    in mbla shorter than that of    in bla such collective motions may be important for the stability of the folded state and may influence the protein folding pathways from the molten globules
