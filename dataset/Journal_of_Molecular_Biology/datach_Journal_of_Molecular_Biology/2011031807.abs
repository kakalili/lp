structure basis of bigelovin as a selective rxr agonist with a distinct binding mode
the nuclear receptor retinoid x receptor rxr functions potently in the regulation of homeostasis and cell development while rexinoids as rxr agonists have proved their therapeutic potential in the treatment of metabolic diseases and cancer here the natural product bigelovin was identified as a selective rxr  agonist interestingly this compound could not transactivate rxr  rxr  homodimer but could enhance the transactivation of rxr  peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  heterodimer and repress that of rxr  liver x receptor lxr   heterodimer while it had no effects on rxr  farnesoid x receptor heterodimer considering that the effective role of lxr response element involved transactivation of sterol regulatory element binding protein c mediated by rxr  lxr  in triglyceride elevation such lxr response element repressing by bigelovin has obviously addressed its potency for further research moreover our determined crystal structure of the bigelovin activated rxr  ligand binding domain with the coactivator human steroid receptor coactivator  peptide revealed that bigelovin adopted a distinct binding mode compared with the known rxr ligands bigelovin lacks the acidic moiety in structure which indicated that the acidic moiety rendered little effects on rxr activation our results have thereby provided new insights into the structure based selective rexinoids design with bigelovin as a potential lead compound
