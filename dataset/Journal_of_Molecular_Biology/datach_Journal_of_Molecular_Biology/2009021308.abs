structure  function relationships in fungal large subunit catalases
neurospora crassa has two large subunit catalases cat  and cat  cat  is associated with non growing cells and accumulates particularly in asexual spores cat  is associated with growing cells and is induced under different stress conditions it is our interest to elucidate the structure  function relationships in large subunit catalases here we have determined the cat  crystal structure and compared it with the previously determined cat  structure similar to cat  cat  hydrogen peroxide h o  saturation kinetics exhibited two components consistent with the existence of two active sites one saturated in the millimolar range and the other in the molar range in the cat  structure we found three interesting features related to its unusual kinetics  a a constriction in the channel that conveys h o to the active site  b a covalent bond between the tyrosine which forms the fifth coordination bound to the iron of the heme and a vicinal cysteine  c oxidation of the pyrrole ring iii to form a cis hydroxyl group in c and a cis  spirolactone in c  the site of heme oxidation marks the starts of the central channel that communicates to the central cavity and the shortest way products can exit the active site cat  has a similar constriction in its major channel which could function as a gating system regulated by the h o concentration before the gate cat  functional tyrosine is not covalently bonded but has instead the electron relay mechanism described for the human catalase to divert electrons from it pyrrole ring iii in cat  is not oxidized as it is in other large subunit catalases whose structure has been determined different in cat  from these enzymes is an occupied central cavity results presented here indicate that cat  and cat  enzymes represent a functional group of catalases with distinctive structural characteristics that determine similar kinetics
