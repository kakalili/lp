probing   ssdna loop formation in e coli recbcd recbc  dna complexes using non natural dna a model for  chi  recognition complexes
the equilibrium binding of escherichia coli recbc and recbcd helicases to duplex dna ends containing varying lengths of polyethylene glycol peg spacers within pre formed   single stranded ss dna  dt n tails was studied these studies were designed to test a previous proposal that the    dt n tail can be looped out upon binding recbc and recbcd for   ssdna tails with n   nucleotides equilibrium binding of protein to unlabeled dna substrates with ends containing peg substituted   ssdna tails was examined by competition with a cy labeled reference dna which undergoes a cy fluorescence enhancement upon protein binding we find that the binding affinities of both recbc and recbcd for a dna end are unaffected upon substituting peg for the ssdna between the sixth and the final two nucleotides of the    dt n tail however placing peg at the end of the    dt n tail increases the binding affinities to their maximum values i e the same as binding constants for recbc or recbcd to a dna end with only a    dt  tail  equilibrium binding studies of a recbc mutant containing a nuclease domain deletion recb nucc suggest that looping of the   tail when n   nucleotides occurs even in the absence of the recb nuclease domain although the nuclease domain stabilizes such loop formation computer modeling of the recbcd  dna complexes suggests that the loop in the   ssdna tail may form at the recb recc interface based on these results we suggest a model for how a loop in the   ssdna tail might form upon encounter of a  chi  recognition sequence during unwinding of dna by the recbcd helicase
