structural analysis of a multifunctional tandemly repeated inositol polyphosphatase
mitsuokella multacida expresses a unique inositol polyphosphatase phyamm that is composed of tandem repeats trs  each repeat possesses a protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp active site signature sequence and fold using a combination of structural mutational and kinetic studies we show that the n terminal d  and c terminal d  active sites of the tr have diverged and possess significantly different specificities for inositol polyphosphate structural analysis and molecular docking calculations identify steric and electrostatic differences within the substrate binding pocket of each tr that may be involved in the altered substrate specificity the implications of our results for the biological function of related ptp like phytases are discussed finally the structures and activities of phyamm and tandemly repeated receptor ptps are compared and discussed to our knowledge this is the first example of an inositol phosphatase with tandem ptp domains possessing substrate specificity for different inositol phosphates
