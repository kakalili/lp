the contribution of a covalently bound cofactor to the folding and thermodynamic stability of an integral membrane protein
the factors controlling the stability folding and dynamics of integral membrane proteins are not fully understood the high stability of the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin br  an archetypal member of the rhodopsin photoreceptor family has been ascribed to its covalently bound retinal cofactor we investigate here the role of this cofactor in the thermodynamic stability and folding kinetics of br multiple spectroscopic probes were used to determine the kinetics and energetics of protein folding in mixed lipid detergent micelles in the presence and absence of retinal the presence of retinal increases extrapolated values for the overall unfolding free energy from      kcal mol   to      kcal mol   at zero denaturant suggesting that the cofactor contributes    kcal mol   towards the overall stability of br in addition the cooperativity of equilibrium unfolding curves is markedly reduced in the absence of retinal with overall m values decreasing from      kcal mol   to      kcal mol   indicating that the folded state of the apoprotein is less compact than the equivalent for the holoprotein this change in the denaturant response means that the difference in the unfolding free energy at a denaturant concentration midway between the two unfolding curves is only ca    kcal mol   kinetic data show that the decrease in stability upon removal of retinal is associated with an increase in the apparent intrinsic rate constant of unfolding kuh o from       s   to       s   at    c this correlates with a decrease in the unfolding activation energy by    kcal mol   in the apoprotein extrapolated to zero sds these results suggest that changes in br stability induced by retinal binding are mediated solely by changes in the activation barrier for unfolding the results are consistent with a model in which br is kinetically stabilized via a very slow rate of unfolding arising from protein  retinal interactions that increase the rigidity and compactness of the polypeptide chain
