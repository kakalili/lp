novel isoform specific interfaces revealed by pka rii  holoenzyme structures
the camp dependent protein kinase catalytic c subunit is inhibited by two classes of functionally nonredundant regulatory r subunits ri and rii unlike ri subunits rii subunits are both substrates and inhibitors because rii  knockout mice have important disease phenotypes the rii  holoenzyme is a target for developing isoform specific agonists and or antagonists we also know little about the linker region that connects the inhibitor site to the n terminal dimerization domain although this linker determines the unique globular architecture of the rii  holoenzyme to understand how rii  functions as both an inhibitor and a substrate and to elucidate the structural role of the linker we engineered different rii  constructs in the absence of nucleotide rii        which contains a single cyclic nucleotide binding domain bound c subunit poorly whereas with amp pnp a non hydrolyzable atp analog the affinity was   nm the rii       holoenzyme structure      with amp pnp mn  showed that we trapped the rii  subunit in an enzyme substrate complex with the c subunit in a closed conformation the enhanced affinity afforded by amp pnp mn  may be a useful strategy for increasing affinity and trapping other protein substrates with their cognate protein kinase because mutagenesis predicted that the region n terminal to the inhibitor site might dock differently to ri and rii we also engineered rii        which contained six additional linker residues the additional linker residues in rii       increased the affinity to   nm suggesting that docking to this surface may also enhance catalytic efficiency in the corresponding holoenzyme structure this linker docks as an extended strand onto the surface of the large lobe this hydrophobic pocket formed by the  f   g loop and conserved in many protein kinases also provides a docking site for the amphipathic helix of pki this novel orientation of the linker peptide provides the first clues as to how this region contributes to the unique organization of the rii  holoenzyme
