in vitro cleavage of eif gi but not eif gii by hiv  protease and its effects on translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system
in eukaryotic cells protein synthesis is regulated by a set of initiation factors eif that are required for recruiting the  s ribosomal subunit onto the mrna molecule among these proteins eif gi which is targeted by picornaviral proteases makes a bridge between the mrna cap structure via eif e and the  s ribosome via eif  recently internal ribosome entry segment ires elements have been characterized in the genomic rna of both simian immunodeficiency virus siv and human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   suggesting that viral expression of these two viruses can be regulated at the translational level thus by analogy with members of the picornavirus family we have investigated the action of the hiv  protease on initiation factors eif gi and eif gii using cell extracts and the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system our results show that eif gi but not eif gii is substrate for hiv  protease and this effect can be prevented by a hiv  protease inhibitor palinavir however in contrast to picornaviral proteases the cleavage of eif gi by hiv  protease occurs at multiple sites and impairs translation of both cap dependent and ires containing rnas except for the hcv ires which does not require eif gi or eif gii for activity
