fast subdomain folding prior to the global refolding transition of e coli adenylate kinase a double kinetics study
the rate of folding of globular proteins depends on specific local and nonlocal intramolecular interactions what is the relative role of these two types of interaction at the initiation of refolding we address this question by application of a  double kinetics  method based on fast initiation of refolding of site specifically labeled protein samples and detection of the transient distributions of selected intramolecular distances by means of fast measurements of time  resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer we determined the distribution of the distance between the ends of a   chain segment that includes the ampbind domain by labeling residues  and   in escherichia coli adenylate kinase ak and the distribution of the distance between residues  and   which depends on the overall order of the molecule that distribution shows two state transition to the native intramolecular distance at the same rate as that of the cooperative refolding transition of the ak molecule in sharp contrast the distance distribution between residues  and  is already native like at the end of the dead time of the mixing device this fast formation of native short distance between two widely separated chain sections can be either dependent on fast folding of the ampbind domain or a result of a very effective nonlocal interaction between specific short clusters of hydrophobic residues further experiments on studying the kinetics of folding of selected structural elements in the protein will help determination of the driving force of this early folding event
