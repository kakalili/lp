affilin  novel binding molecules based on human  b crystallin an all  sheet protein
the concept of novel binding proteins as an alternative to antibodies has undergone rapid development and is now ready for practical use in a wide range of applications alternative binding proteins based on suitable scaffolds with desirable properties are selected from combinatorial libraries in vitro here we describe an approach using a  sheet of human  b crystallin to generate a universal binding site through randomization of eight solvent exposed amino acid residues selected according to structural and sequence analyses specific variants so called affilin have been isolated from a phage display library against a variety of targets that differ considerably in size and structure the isolated affilin variants can be produced in escherichia coli as soluble proteins and have a high level of thermodynamic stability the crystal structures of the human wild type  b crystallin and a selected affilin variant have been determined to     and     resolution respectively comparison of the two molecules indicates that the human  b crystallin tolerates amino acid exchanges with no major structural change we conclude that the intrinsically stable and easily expressed  b crystallin provides a suitable framework for the generation of novel binding molecules
