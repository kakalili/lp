protein synthesis factors rf  rf  rf  rrf and tmrna and peptidyl trna hydrolase rescue stalled ribosomes at sense codons
during translation ribosomes stall on mrna when the aminoacyl trna to be read is not readily available the stalled ribosomes are deleterious to the cell and should be rescued to maintain its viability to investigate the contribution of some of the cellular translation factors on ribosome rescuing we provoked stalling at aga codons in mutants that affected the factors and then analyzed the accumulation of oligopeptidyl peptides of up to  amino acid residues oligopep  trna or polypeptidyl peptides of more than   amino acids in length polypep  trna associated with ribosomes stalling was achieved by starvation for aminoacyl trnaarg upon induced expression of engineered lacz   galactosidase reporter gene harboring contiguous aga codons close to the initiation codon or at internal codon positions together with minigene atgagataa accompanied by reduced peptidyl trna hydrolase pth  our results showed accumulations of peptidyl trna associated with ribosomes in mutants for release factors rf  rf  and rf  ribosome recycling factor rrf  pth and transfer messenger rna tmrna  implying that each of these factors cooperate in rescuing stalled ribosomes the role of these factors in ribosome releasing from the stalled complex may vary depending on the length of the peptide in the peptidyl trna rf and rrf rescue stalled ribosomes by  drop off  of peptidyl trna while rf  rf  in the absence of termination codon  or pth may rescue by hydrolyzing the associated peptidyl trna this is followed by the disassembly of the ribosomal complex of trna and mrna by rrf and elongation factor g
