structure of hepatitis b surface antigen from subviral tubes determined by electron cryomicroscopy
hepatitis b virus consists of an icosahedral core containing the double stranded dna genome enveloped by a membrane with embedded surface proteins the crystal structure of the core protein has been solved but little information about the structure of the surface proteins has so far been available there are three sizes of surface protein small s  medium m and large l  which form disulfide bonded homo and heterodimers the three proteins expressed from different start sites in the coding sequence share the common c terminal s region the m protein contains an additional pres sequence n terminal to s and the l protein a further pres sequence n terminal to m in infected individuals the surface proteins are produced in huge excess over the amount needed for viral envelopment and are secreted as a heterogeneous mixture of isometric and tubular subviral particles we have used electron cryomicroscopy to study tubular particles extracted from human serum helical fourier  bessel analysis was used to calculate a low resolution map although it showed that the tubes were quite disordered from the symmetry derived from this analysis we used single particle methods to improve the resolution we found that the tubes had a diameter of approximately     with spike like features projecting from the membrane in the plane of the membrane the proteins appear to be close packed we propose a model for the packing arrangement of surface protein dimers in the tubes
