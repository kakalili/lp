achieving specific rna cleavage activity by an inactive splicing endonuclease subunit through engineered oligomerization
protein  protein interaction is a common strategy exploited by enzymes to control substrate specificity and catalytic activities rna endonucleases which are involved in many rna processing and regulation processes are prime examples of this how the activities of rna endonucleases are tightly controlled such that they act on specific rna is of general interest we demonstrate here that an inactive rna splicing endonuclease subunit can be switched  on  solely by oligomerization furthermore we show that the mode of assembly correlates with different rna specificities the recently identified splicing endonuclease homolog from sulfolobus solfataricus despite possessing all of the putatively catalytic residues has no detectable rna cleavage activity on its own but is active upon mixing with its structural subunit guided by the previously determined three dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit we altered its sequence such that it could potentially self assemble thereby enabling its catalytic activity we present the evidence for the specific rna cleavage activity of the engineered catalytic subunit and for its formation of a functional tetramer we also identify a higher order oligomer species that possesses distinct rna cleavage specificity from that of previously characterized rna splicing endonucleases
