oleic acid induces mir  processing through remodeling of pri mir  protein complex
micrornas mirs play a vital role in governing cell function with their levels tightly controlled at transcriptional and post transcriptional levels different sets of rna binding proteins interact with primary mirs pri mirs and precursor mir transcripts pre mirs  controlling their biogenesis post transcriptionally the hu antigen r hur mediated binding of musashi homolog  msi  to the conserved terminal loop of pri mir  regulates the levels of brain enriched mir  formation in a tissue specific manner here we show that oleic acid oa inhibits the binding of proteins containing rna recognition motifs rrm to the conserved terminal loop of pri mir  using electrophoretic mobility shift assays in hela cell extracts we show that oa treatment disrupts pre mir protein complexes furthermore oa rescues in vitro processing of pri mir  which is otherwise blocked by hur and msi proteins on the contrary pri mir  shows reduced processing in the presence of oa this indicates that oa may inhibit the binding of other rrm containing protein s necessary for mir  processing finally we demonstrate that oa induces mature mir  production in hela cells together our results demonstrate that oa can regulate the processing of pri mirs by remodeling their protein complexes this provides a new tool to study rna processing and a potential lead for small molecules that target the mir  biogenesis pathway
