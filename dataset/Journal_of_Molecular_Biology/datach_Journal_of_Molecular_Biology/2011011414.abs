structural origins of high apparent dielectric constants experienced by ionizable groups in the hydrophobic core of a protein
the side chains of lys  asp  and glu  in staphylococcal nuclease are fully buried and surrounded mainly by hydrophobic matter except for internal water molecules associated with carboxylic oxygen atoms these ionizable side chains titrate with pka values of      and   respectively to reproduce these pka values with continuum electrostatics calculations we treated the protein with high dielectric constants we have examined the structural origins of these high apparent dielectric constants by using nmr spectroscopy to characterize the structural response to the ionization of these internal side chains substitution of val  with lys  and asp  led to increased conformational fluctuations of the microenvironments surrounding these groups even under ph conditions where lys  and asp  are neutral when lys  asp  and glu  are charged the proteins remain almost fully folded but resonances for a few backbone amides adjacent to the internal ionizable residues are broadened this suggests that the ionization of the internal groups promotes a local increase in dynamics on the intermediate timescale consistent with either partial unfolding or increased backbone fluctuations of helix  near residue   or less likely with increased fluctuations of the charged side chains at position   these experiments confirm that the high apparent dielectric constants reported by internal lys  asp  and glu  reflect localized changes in conformational fluctuations without incurring detectable global structural reorganization to improve structure based pka calculations in proteins we will need to learn how to treat this coupling between ionization of internal groups and local changes in conformational fluctuations explicitly
