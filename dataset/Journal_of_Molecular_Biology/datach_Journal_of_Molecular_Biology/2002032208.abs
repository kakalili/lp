protein kinase substrate recognition studied using the recombinant catalytic domain of amp activated protein kinase and a model substrate edited by j karn
we have expressed a truncated form of the   kinase domain of amp activated protein kinase ampk in escherichia coli as a glutathione s transferase fusion gst kd  a t  d mutant version did not require prior phosphorylation and was utilized for most subsequent studies we have also created a recombinant substrate gst acc by expressing  residues around the major phosphorylation site ser  on rat acetyl coa carboxylase    acc  as a gst fusion this was an excellent substrate that was phosphorylated with similar kinetic parameters to acc by both native ampk and the bacterially expressed kinase domain we also constructed a structural model for the binding of the acc sequence to the kinase domain based on crystal structures for related protein kinases the model was tested by making a total of  mutants of gst acc and seven mutants of gst kd and measuring kinetic parameters with different combinations the results reveal that ampk and acc interact over a much wider region than previously realized  gt  residues  the features of the interaction can be summarised as follows  i an amphipathic helix from p    to p    on the substrate binds in a hydrophobic groove on the large lobe of the kinase  ii basic residues at p    and p    bind to two acidic patches d  d  d  and e  d  e   respectively  on the large lobe  iii a histidine at p   interacts with d  on the small lobe  iv the side chain of p   leucine could not be precisely positioned but a new finding was that asparagine or glutamine could replace a hydrophobic residue at this position these interactions position the serine residue to be phosphorylated in close proximity to the  phosphate group of atp although based on modelling rather than a determined structure this represents one of the most detailed studies of the interaction between a kinase and its substrate achieved to date
