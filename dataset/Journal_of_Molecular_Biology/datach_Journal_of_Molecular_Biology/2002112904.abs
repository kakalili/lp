the ctra response regulator essential for caulobacter crescentus cell cycle progression requires a bipartite degradation signal for temporally controlled proteolysis
the two component signaling protein ctra activates or represses the expression of one quarter of the cell cycle regulated genes in caulobacter crescentus integrating dna replication morphogenesis and cell division the activity of this essential protein is controlled by a positive transcriptional feedback loop cell cycle regulated phosphorylation and rapid proteolysis as cells enter s phase at the swarmer to stalked cell transition and in the stalked portion of the asymmetric predivisional cell ctra activity must be removed from cells at the onset of dna replication because phosphorylated ctra binds to and silences the origin of replication the clpxp protease is required for ctra proteolysis but is present throughout the cell cycle so the mechanism for activating and deactivating ctra proteolysis is unknown here we identify a bipartite proteolytic signal in the ctra response regulator consisting of two determinants that are each necessary but not sufficient for regulated degradation one determinant is present in the last  amino acid residues of ctra particularly the terminal ala ala residues and another is located within the first  residues of the ctra receiver domain a fusion of the receiver domain and last  residues of ctra to yfp is properly degraded in living cells although the n terminal  residues contain the conserved asp  phosphorylation site mutant analyses show that cell cycle controlled ctra proteolysis is insensitive to the ctra phosphorylation state the n terminal proteolytic determinant is predicted to reside on the surface of the receiver domain in  sheet  and  helix
