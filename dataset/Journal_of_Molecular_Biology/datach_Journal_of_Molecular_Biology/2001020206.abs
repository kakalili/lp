the folding nucleus of a fibronectin type iii domain is composed of core residues of the immunoglobulin like fold edited by a r fersht
to identify the contacts that stabilise the rate limiting transition state for folding of fnfn  the tenth fniii domain of human fibronectin   mutants have been analysed at  positions across this domain an anomalous response to mutation means that structure formation in the a b and g strands cannot be evaluated by this method in all the residues analysed phi values are fractional and no completely structured region is observed the analysis reveals that hydrophobic residues from the central strands of the beta sandwich form a large core of interactions in the transition state br nsted analysis shows that the stabilisation energy from the amino acid side chains in the transition state is    of that in the native state the protein folds by a nucleation condensation mechanism and tertiary interactions within the core make up the folding nucleus local interactions in turns and loops are apparently much less significant comparison with an homologous domain from human tenascin tnfn  shows that fnfn  has a more extended structured transition state spanning three different  layers  of the beta sandwich the results support the hypothesis that interactions in the common structural core guide the folding of these domains
