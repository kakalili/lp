osteogenesis imperfecta murine interaction between type i collagen homotrimers
types i ii and iii collagens are believed to have evolved from the same homotrimer ancestor and they have substantial sequence homology but type i molecules are   i   i heterotrimers unlike homotrimeric types ii and iii it is believed that the   i chain first appeared in lower vertebrates and that it plays a particularly important role in bone formation for instance spontaneous mutations resulting in non functional   chains and formation of type i homotrimers cause severe bone pathology osteogenesis imperfecta in humans and in animals however the exact role of the   chain is not known here we report measurements of intermolecular forces between collagen helices in native and reconstituted fibers composed of type i homotrimers heterotrimers and their mix for comparison we report forces between type ii homotrimers in reconstituted fibers in agreement with previous studies we find that the absence of the   chain reduces temperature favored attraction between collagen helices either because of the difference in amino acid sequence of the   and   chains or because of more extensive post translational modification of homotrimers we find that forces between helices in fibers from type i as well as type ii homotrimers are not sensitive to ph between ph  and   in contrast to type i heterotrimers apparently the effect of ph is related to extra histidine residues present on   chains but not on   chains finally our measurements indicate that the   chain is responsible for binding some soluble compound s  possibly glycosaminoglycans whose displacement results e g  in the loss of tendon crystallinity the ability of the   chain to bind non collagen matrix components may be particularly important for bone matrix formation and mineralization
