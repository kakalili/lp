stereospecific interactions of proline residues in protein structures and complexes
the constrained backbone torsion angle of a proline pro residue has usually been invoked to explain its three dimensional context in proteins here we show that specific interactions involving the pyrrolidine ring atoms also contribute to its location in a given secondary structure and its binding to another molecule it is adept at participating in two rather non conventional interactions c  h   and c  h  o the geometry of interaction between the pyrrolidine and aromatic rings vis  vis the occurrence of the c  h   interactions has been elucidated some of the secondary structural elements stabilized by pro  aromatic interactions are  turns where a pro can interact with an adjacent aromatic residue and in antiparallel  sheet where a pro in an edge strand can interact with an aromatic residue in the adjacent strand at a non hydrogen bonded site the c  h groups at the c  and c  positions can form strong c  h  o interactions as seen from the clustering of points and such interactions involving a pro residue at c  position relative to an  helix can cap the hydrogen bond forming potentials of the free carbonyl groups at the helix c terminus functionally important pro residues occurring at the binding site of a protein almost invariably engage aromatic residues with one of them being held by c  h   interaction from the partner molecule in the complex and such aromatic residues are highly conserved during evolution
