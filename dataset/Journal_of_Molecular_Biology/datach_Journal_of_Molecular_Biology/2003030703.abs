distinctive solution conformation of phosphatase inhibitor cpi  substituted with aspartate at the phosphorylation site threonine residue
we present solution nmr structures for wild type and mutated forms of cpi   a phosphoinhibitor for protein phosphatase  phosphorylation of thr  of cpi  produces a gt   fold increase in inhibitory potency for myosin phosphatase we compared the h   n heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy hsqc chemical shifts of wild type cpi   partially phosphorylated cpi  and cpi  with thr  replaced with asp to introduce a negative charge there was a switch in the protein conformation due to either asp substitution or phosphorylation so we determined the solution nmr structure of the cpi  t d mutant as a model for the active phospho  conformation the structures reveal a molecular switch in conformation that involves the rotation of two of the four helices in the four helix bundle despite this conformational switch there was little increase in the inhibitory potency with t d we propose that for this inhibitor a negative charge at residue  is sufficient to trigger an active conformation but a phosphoryl group is required for full inhibitory potency against protein phosphatase
