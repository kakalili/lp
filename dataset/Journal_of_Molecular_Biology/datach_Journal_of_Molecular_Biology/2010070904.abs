mechanochemistry of a viral dna packaging motor
the pentameric atpase motor gp  packages double stranded dna into the bacteriophage   virus capsid on the basis of the results of single molecule experimental studies we propose a push and roll mechanism to explain how the packaging motor translocates the dna in bursts of four   bp power strokes while rotating the dna in this mechanism each power stroke accompanies pi release after atp hydrolysis since the high resolution structure of the gp  motor is not available we borrowed characterized features from the p rna packaging motor in bacteriophage    for each power stroke a lumenal lever from a single subunit is electrostatically steered to the dna backbone the lever then pushes sterically orthogonal to the backbone axis such that the right handed dna helix is translocated and rotated in a left handed direction the electrostatic association allows tight coupling between the lever and the dna and prevents dna from slipping back the lever affinity for dna decreases towards the end of the power stroke and the dna rolls to the lever on the next subunit each power stroke facilitates atp hydrolysis in the next catalytic site by inserting an arg finger into the site as captured in   p  at the end of every four power strokes adp release happens slowly so the cycle pauses constituting a dwell phase during which four atps are loaded into the catalytic sites the next burst phase of four power strokes starts once spontaneous atp hydrolysis takes place in the fifth site without insertion of an arg finger the push and roll model provides a new perspective on how a multimeric atpase transports dna and it might apply to other ring motors as well
