the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the inhibitor receptor expressed on myeloid cells irem
the immune receptors expressed on myeloid cells irem are type i transmembrane proteins encoded on human chromosome    q    whose function is believed to be important in controlling inflammation to date three irem receptors have been identified irem  functions as an inhibitory receptor whereas irem  and irem  serve an activating function here we report the crystal structure of irem  extracellular domain at     resolution the overall fold of irem  resembles that of a v type immunoglobulin domain and reveals overall close homology with immunoglobulin domains from other immunoreceptors such as clm  trem  tlt  and nkp  comparing the surface electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity of irem  with its murine homologous clm  we observed unique structural properties for the complementary determining region of irem  which suggests that they may be involved in recognition of the irem  ligand particularly interesting is the structural conformation and physical properties of the antibody s equivalent cdr loop which we show to be a structurally variable region of the molecule and therefore could be the main structural determinant for ligand discrimination and binding in addition the analysis of the irem  structure revealed the presence of four structurally different cavities three of these cavities form a continuous hydrophobic groove on the irem  surface which point to a region of the molecule capable of accommodating potential ligands
