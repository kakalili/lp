folding of a lysm domain entropy enthalpy compensation in the transition state of an ideal two state folder
protein engineering methods   values were used to investigate the folding transition state of a lysin motif lysm domain from escherichia coli membrane bound lytic murein transglycosylase d this domain consists of just  structured residues in a symmetrical     arrangement and is the smallest   protein yet investigated using these methods an extensive mutational analysis revealed a highly robust folding pathway with no detectable transition state plasticity indicating that lysm is an example of an ideal two state folder the pattern of  values denotes a highly polarised transition state with significant formation of the helices but no structure within the  sheet remarkably this transition state remains polarised after circularisation of the domain and exhibits an identical  value pattern however the interactions within the transition state are uniformly weaker in the circular variant this observation is supported by results from an eyring analysis of the folding rates of the two proteins we propose that the folding pathway of lysm is dominated by enthalpic rather than entropic considerations and suggest that the lower entropy cost of formation of the circular transition state is balanced to some extent by the lower enthalpy of contacts within this structure
