promiscuous stimulation of parf protein polymerization by heterogeneous centromere binding factors
the segrosome is the nucleoprotein complex that mediates accurate segregation of bacterial plasmids the segrosome of plasmid tp  comprises parf and parg proteins that assemble on the parh centromere parf which exemplifies one clade of the ubiquitous para superfamily of segregation proteins polymerizes extensively in response to atp binding polymerization is modulated by the parg centromere binding factor cbf  the segrosomes of plasmids ptar pvt  and pb  include para homologues of the parf subgroup as well as diverse homodimeric cbfs with no primary sequence similarity to parg or each other centromere binding by these analogues is largely specific here we establish that the parf homologues of ptar and pb  filament modestly with atp and that nucleotide hydrolysis is not required for this polymerization which is more prodigious when the cognate cbf is also present by contrast the parf homologue of plasmid pvt  did not respond appreciably to atp alone but polymerized extensively in the presence of both its cognate cbf and atp the co factors also stimulated nucleotide independent polymerization of cognate parf proteins moreover apart from the cbf of ptar the disparate parg analogues promoted polymerization of non cognate parf proteins suggesting that filamentation of the parf proteins is enhanced by a common mechanism like parg the co factors may be modular possessing a centromere specific interaction domain linked to a flexible region containing determinants that promiscuously stimulate parf polymerization the cbfs appear to function as bacterial analogues of formins microtubule associated proteins or related ancillary factors that regulate eucaryotic cytoskeletal dynamics
