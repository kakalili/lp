ph dependent interactions and the stability and folding kinetics of the n terminal domain of l  electrostatic interactions are only weakly formed in the transition state for folding edited by c r matthews
the role of electrostatic interactions in the stability and the folding of the n terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l  ntl  was investigated by determining the effects of varying the ph conditions urea denaturations and thermal unfolding experiments were used to measure the free energy of folding  g  at  different ph values ranging from ph   to ph    folding rates were measured at  ph values between ph   and ph   and unfolding rates were determined at  ph values in this range using stopped flow fluorescence experiments the protein is maximally stable between ph   and   with a value of  g    kcal mol   the folding rate reaches a maximum at ph   however the change in folding rates with ph is relatively modest over the ph range of   to   there is a small increase in folding rates ln kf changes from   to   however the change in stability is more dramatic with a difference of   kcal mol   between ph   and ph   the change in stability is largely due to the smaller barrier for unfolding at low ph values the natural log of the unfolding rates varies by approximately four units between ph   and ph   the stability of the protein decreases above ph   and again the change is largely due to changes in the unfolding rate ln kf varies by less than one unit between ph   and ph   while  g  decreases by   kcal mol   over the range of ph   to ph    which corresponds to a change in ln keq of   these studies show that ph dependent interactions contribute significantly to the overall stability of the protein but have only a small effect upon the folding kinetics indicating that electrostatic interactions are weakly formed in the transition state for folding
