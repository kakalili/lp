role of the  clamp in the protein translocation mechanism of anthrax toxin
membrane embedded molecular machines are utilized to move water soluble proteins across these barriers anthrax toxin forms one such machine through the self assembly of its three component proteins  protective antigen pa  lethal factor and edema factor upon endocytosis into host cells acidification of the endosome induces pa to form a membrane inserted channel which unfolds lethal factor and edema factor and translocates them into the host cytosol translocation is driven by the proton motive force composed of the chemical potential the proton gradient  ph  and the membrane potential     a crystal structure of the lethal toxin core complex revealed an    clamp  structure that binds to substrate helices nonspecifically here we test the hypothesis that through the recognition of unfolding helical structure the  clamp can accelerate the rate of translocation we produced a synthetic pa mutant in which an  helix was crosslinked into the  clamp to block its function this synthetic construct impairs translocation by raising a yet uncharacterized translocation barrier shown to be much less force dependent than the known unfolding barrier we also report that the  clamp more stably binds substrates that can form helices than those such as polyproline that cannot hence the  clamp recognizes substrates by a general shape complementarity mechanism substrates that are incapable of forming compact secondary structure due to the introduction of a polyproline track are severely deficient for translocation therefore the  clamp and its recognition of helical structure in the translocating substrate play key roles in the molecular mechanism of protein translocation
