native like tertiary structure formation in the  domain of a hen lysozyme two disulfide variant edited by c r matthews
structure formation in two species of the two disulfide variant of hen lysozyme was investigated by means of cd spectroscopy disulfide exchange measurement and h nmr spectroscopy one species  ss           which contained the two disulfide bonds found in the  domain of authentic lysozyme had amounts of secondary and tertiary structures and bacteriolytic activity comparable to those of authentic lysozyme and showed a cooperative thermal unfolding by contrast the other species  ss           which contained the  domain disulfide bond as well as the inter domain one had a limited amount of secondary structure and little tertiary structure disulfide exchange did not occur for ss           whereas it occurred for ss           indicating that the protein main chain fold coupled with the formation of two disulfide bonds is relatively stable for the former variant while unstable for the latter  h nmr spectra of ss           showed that native like local environment is present within the region that corresponds to the  domain while it is absent within the region that corresponds to the  or inter domain these results indicate that the  domain of hen lysozyme can be an independent folding domain at equilibrium although the bipartite nature in the structure formation of hen lysozyme is similar to that reported for  lactalbumin differences exist between the disulfide intermediates of the two proteins in terms of the structural domain that accomplishes tertiary structure
