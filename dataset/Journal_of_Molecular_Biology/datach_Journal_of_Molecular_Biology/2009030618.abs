the oligomeric assembly of the novel haem degrading protein hbps is essential for interaction with its cognate two component sensor kinase
hbps a novel protein of previously unknown function from streptomyces reticuli is up regulated in response to haemin and peroxide based oxidative stress and interacts with the sens senr two component signal transduction system in this study we report the high resolution crystal structures   and     of octomeric hbps crystallized in the presence and in the absence of haem and demonstrate that iron binds to surface exposed lysine residues of an octomeric assembly based on an analysis of the crystal structures we propose that the iron atom originates from the haem group and report subsequent biochemical experiments that demonstrate that hbps possesses haem degrading activity in vitro further examination of the crystal structures has identified amino acids that are essential for assembly of the octomer the role of these residues is confirmed by biophysical experiments additionally we show that while the octomeric assembly state of hbps is not essential for haem degrading activity the assembly of hbps is required for its interaction with the cognate sensor kinase sens homologs of hbps and sens senr have been identified in a number of medically and ecologically relevant bacterial species including vibrio cholerae klebsiella pneumoniae corynebacterium diphtheriae arthrobacter aurescens and pseudomonas putida  suggesting the existence of a previously undescribed bacterial oxidative stress response pathway common to gram negative and gram positive bacteria thus the data presented provide the first insight into the function of a novel protein family and an example of an iron mediated interaction between an accessory protein and its cognate two component sensor kinase
