crystal structure of aspergillus niger isopullulanase a member of glycoside hydrolase family
an isopullulanase ipu from aspergillus niger atcc   hydrolyzes    glucosidic linkages of pullulan to produce isopanose although ipu does not hydrolyze dextran it is classified into glycoside hydrolase family   gh   major members of which are dextran hydrolyzing enzymes ipu is highly glycosylated making it difficult to obtain its crystal we used endoglycosidase hf to cleave the n linked oligosaccharides of ipu and we here determined the unliganded and isopanose complexed forms of ipu both solved at    resolution ipu is composed of domains n and c joined by a short linker with electron density maps for  or  n acetylglucosamine residues per molecule domain n consists of    strands and forms a  sandwich domain c where the active site is located forms a right handed  helix and the lengths of the pitches of each coil of the  helix are similar to those of gh  dextranase and gh  polygalacturonase the entire structure of ipu resembles that of a gh  enzyme penicillium minioluteum dextranase dex a  despite a difference in substrate specificity compared with the active sites of ipu and dex a the amino acid residues participating in subsites  and  are not conserved and the glucose residues of isopanose bound to ipu completely differ in orientation from the corresponding glucose residues of isomaltose bound to dex a the shape of the catalytic cleft characterized by the seventh coil of the  helix and a loop from domain n appears to be critical in determining the specificity of ipu for pullulan
