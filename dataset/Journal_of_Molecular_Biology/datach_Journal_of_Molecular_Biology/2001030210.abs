how methionyl trna synthetase creates its amino acid recognition pocket upon l methionine binding edited by a r fersht
amino acid selection by aminoacyl trna synthetases requires efficient mechanisms to avoid incorrect charging of the cognate trnas a proofreading mechanism prevents escherichia coli methionyl trna synthetase ecmet rs from activating in vivo l homocysteine a natural competitor of l methionine recognised by the enzyme the crystal structure of the complex between ecmet rs and l methionine solved at    resolution exhibits some conspicuous differences with the recently published free enzyme structure thus the methionine  sulphur atom replaces a water molecule h bonded to leu n and tyr  o  in the free enzyme rearrangements of aromatic residues enable the protein to form a hydrophobic pocket around the ligand side chain the subsequent formation of an extended water molecule network contributes to relative displacements up to    of several domains of the protein the structure of this complex supports a plausible mechanism for the selection of l methionine versus l homocysteine and suggests the possibility of information transfer between the different functional domains of the enzyme
