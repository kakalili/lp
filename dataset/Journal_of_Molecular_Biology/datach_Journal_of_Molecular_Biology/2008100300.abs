specific heteromeric association of four transmembrane peptides derived from platelet glycoprotein ib  ix complex
as the receptor on the platelet surface for von willebrand factor glycoprotein gp ib  ix complex is critically involved in hemostasis and thrombosis how the complex is assembled from gp ib  gp ib  and gp ix subunits all of which are type i transmembrane proteins is not entirely clear genetic and mutational analyses have identified the transmembrane tm domains of these subunits as active participants in assembly of the complex in this study peptides containing the transmembrane domain of each subunit have been produced and their interaction with one another characterized only the ib  tm sequence but not the ib  and ix counterparts can form homo oligomers in sds page and toxcat assays following up on our earlier observation that a ib   ib   ib  peptide complex     linked through native juxtamembrane disulfide bonds could be produced from isolated ib  and ib  tm peptides in detergent micelles we show here that addition of the ix tm peptide facilitates formation of the native    complex reproducing the same effect by the ix subunit in cells expressing the gp ib  ix complex specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer was observed between donor labeled    peptide complex and acceptor conjugated ix tm peptide in micelles finally the mutation d  k in the ix tm peptide could hamper both the formation of the    complex and the energy transfer consistent with its reported effect in the full length complex overall our results have demonstrated directly the native like heteromeric interaction among the isolated ib  ib  and ix tm peptides which provides support for the four helix bundle model of the tm domains in the gp ib  ix complex and paves the way for further structural analysis the methods developed in this study may be applicable to other studies of heteromeric interaction among multiple tm helices
