structural basis of interaction between urokinase type plasminogen activator and its receptor
recent studies indicate that binding of the urokinase type plasminogen activator upa to its high affinity receptor upar orchestrates upar interactions with other cellular components that play a pivotal role in diverse patho physiological processes including wound healing angiogenesis inflammation and cancer metastasis however notwithstanding the wealth of biochemical data available describing the activities of upar little is known about the exact mode of upar upa interactions or the presumed conformational changes that accompany upa upar engagement here we report the crystal structure of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor supar  which contains the three domains of the wild type receptor but lacks the cell surface anchoring sequence in complex with the amino terminal fragment of urokinase type plasminogen activator atf  at the resolution of     we report the     crystal structure of free atf our results provide a structural basis represented by conformational changes induced in upar for several published biochemical observations describing the nature of upar upa interactions and provide insight into mechanisms that may be responsible for the cellular responses induced by upa binding
