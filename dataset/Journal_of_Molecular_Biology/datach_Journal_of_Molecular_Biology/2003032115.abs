engineering of restriction endonucleases using methylation activity of the bifunctional endonuclease eco i to select the mutant with a novel sequence specificity
type ii restriction endonucleases res are widely used tools in molecular biology biotechnology and diagnostics efforts to generate new specificities by structure guided design and random mutagenesis have been unsuccessful so far we have developed a new procedure called the methylation activity based selection mabs for generating res with a new specificity mabs uses a unique property of bifunctional type ii res to methylate dna targets they recognize the procedure includes three steps   conversion of a bifunctional re into a monofunctional dna modifying enzyme by cleavage center disruption   mutagenesis and selection of mutants with altered dna modification specificity based on their ability to protect predetermined dna targets   reconstitution of the cleavage center s wild type structure the efficiency of the mabs technique was demonstrated by altering the sequence specificity of the bifunctional re eco i from   ctgaag to   ctgrag and thus generating the mutant restriction endonuclease and dna methyltransferase of a specificity not known before this study provides evidence that mabs is a promising technique for generation of res with new specificities
