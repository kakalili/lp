genome of xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage xp  an odd t odd phage
xp  is a lytic bacteriophage of the phytopathogenic bacterium xanthomonas oryzae though morphologically xp  belongs to the syphoviridae family it encodes its own single subunit rna polymerase characteristic of t like phages of the podoviridae family here we report the determination and analysis of the    bp sequence of the xp  genome the genome is a linear double stranded dna molecule with   cohesive overhangs and no terminal repeats or redundancies half of the xp  genome contains genes coding for structural proteins and host lysis functions in an arrangement typical for temperate dairy phages that are related to the escherichia coli  phage the other half of the xp  genome contains genes coding for factors of host gene expression shut off enzymes of viral genome replication and expression the two groups of genes are transcribed divergently and separated by a regulatory region which contains divergent promoters recognized by the host rna polymerase xp  has apparently arisen through a recombination between genomes of widely different phages further evidence of extensive gene flux in the evolution of xp  includes a high fraction    of genes derived from an hnh family endonuclease and a dna dependent dna polymerase that is closer to a homolog from leishmania than to dna polymerases from other phages or bacteria
