cytochrome c   a small heme protein that lacks misligation in its unfolded state folds with rapid two state kinetics edited by c r matthews
cytochrome c   cyt c   from desulfovibrio vulgaris is a small helical heme protein that displays apparent two state equilibrium unfolding behavior the covalently attached heme is low spin ligated by met and his residues in the native state but becomes high spin upon unfolding at ph  here we show that in contrast to other c type heme proteins where misligations in the unfolded states are prominent cyt c  refolding kinetics at ph  proceeds rapidly without detectable intermediates the extrapolated folding rate constant in water for oxidized cyt c  matches exactly that predicted from the cyt c  native state topology    s   experimental versus   s   predicted  we therefore conclude that the presence of the oxidized cofactor does not affect the intrinsic formation speed of the cyt c  structural motif
