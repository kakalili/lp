assembly of the central domain of the  s ribosomal subunit roles for the primary binding ribosomal proteins s  and s
assembly of the  s ribosomal subunit occurs in a highly ordered and sequential manner the ordered addition of ribosomal proteins to the growing ribonucleoprotein particle is initiated by the association of primary binding proteins these proteins bind specifically and independently to  s ribosomal rna rrna  two primary binding proteins s and s  interact exclusively with the central domain of  s rrna binding of s  to the central domain results in a conformational change in the rna and is followed by the ordered assembly of the s s  dimer s  and finally s  to form the platform of the  s subunit in contrast s is not part of this major platform assembly branch of the remaining central domain binding proteins only s  association is slightly dependent on s  thus although s is a primary binding protein that extensively contacts the central domain its role in assembly of this domain remains unclear here we used directed hydroxyl radical probing from four unique positions on s  to assess organization of the central domain of  s rrna as a consequence of s association hydroxyl radical probing of fe ii  s   s rrna and fe ii  s  s  s rrna ribonucleoprotein particles reveal changes in the  s rrna environment of s  upon addition of s  these changes occur predominantly in helices  and  near previously identified s binding sites these s dependent conformational changes are consistent with  s rrna folding in complete  s subunits thus while s binding is not absolutely required for assembly of the platform it appears to affect significantly the  s rrna environment of s  by influencing central domain organization
