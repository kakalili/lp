protein  dna interactions that govern aaa activator dependent bacterial transcription initiation
transcriptional control at the promoter melting step is not yet well understood in this study a site directed photo cross linking method was used to systematically analyse component protein  dna interactions that govern promoter melting by the enhancer dependent escherichia coli rna polymerase rnap containing the   promoter specificity factor e   at a single base pair resolution in three functional states the   factor imposes tight control upon the rnap by creating a regulatory switch where promoter melting nucleates     bp upstream of the transcription start site promoter melting by e   is only triggered upon remodelling of this regulatory switch by a specialised activator protein in an atp hydrolysing reaction we demonstrate that prior to dna melting only the   factor directly interacts with the promoter in the regulatory switch within the initial closed e    promoter complex and one intermediate e    promoter complex we establish that activator induced conformational rearrangements in the regulatory switch are a prerequisite to allow the promoter to enter the catalytic cleft of the rnap and hence establish the transcriptionally competent open complex where full promoter melting occurs these results significantly advance our current understanding of the structural transitions occurring at bacterial promoters where regulation occurs at the dna melting step
