crystal structure of a complex between human spliceosomal cyclophilin h and a u u snrnp  k peptide
the spliceosomal cyclophilin h is a specific component of the human u u small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle interacting with homologous sequences in the proteins u u  k and hprp  during pre mrna splicing we determined the crystal structure of the complex comprising cyclophilin h and the cognate domain of u u  k the  amino acid fragment of u u  k is bound to a region remote from the cyclophilin active site residues ile   phe  of u u  k expand the central  sheet of cyclophilin h and the side chain of phe  inserts into a hydrophobic cavity concomitantly in the crystal the cyclophilin h active site is occupied by the n terminus of a neighboring cyclophilin h molecule in a substrate like manner indicating the capacity of joint binding to a substrate and to u u  k free and complexed cyclophilin h have virtually identical conformations suggesting that the u u  k binding site is pre shaped and the peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase activity is unaffected by complex formation the complex defines a novel protein  protein interaction mode for a cyclophilin allowing cyclophilin h to mediate interactions between different proteins inside the spliceosome or to initiate from its binding platforms isomerization or chaperoning activities
