structure and allostery of the chaperonin groel
chaperonins are intricate allosteric machines formed of two back to back stacked rings of subunits presenting end cavities lined with hydrophobic binding sites for nonnative polypeptides once bound substrates are subjected to forceful concerted movements that result in their ejection from the binding surface and simultaneous encapsulation inside a hydrophilic chamber that favors their folding here we review the allosteric machine movements that are choreographed by atp binding which triggers concerted tilting and twisting of subunit domains these movements distort the ring of hydrophobic binding sites and split it apart potentially unfolding the multiply bound substrate then groes binding is accompanied by a    twist of the binding domains that removes the hydrophobic sites from the cavity lining and forms the folding chamber atp hydrolysis is not needed for a single round of binding and encapsulation but is necessary to allow the next round of atp binding in the opposite ring it is this remote atp binding that triggers dismantling of the folding chamber and release of the encapsulated substrate whether folded or not the basis for these ordered actions is an elegant system of nested cooperativity of the atpase machinery atp binds to a ring with positive cooperativity and movements of the interlinked subunit domains are concerted in contrast there is negative cooperativity between the rings so that they act in alternation it is remarkable that a process as specific as protein folding can be guided by the chaperonin machine in a way largely independent of substrate protein structure or sequence
