reconstitution of the strand invasion step of double strand break repair using human rad  rad  and rpa proteins edited by j karn
the human rad  recombinase is essential for the repair of double strand breaks in dna that occur in somatic cells after exposure to ionising irradiation or in germ line cells undergoing meiotic recombination the initiation of double strand break repair is thought to involve resection of the double strand break to produce   ended single stranded ss tails that invade homologous duplex dna here we have used purified proteins to set up a defined in vitro system for the initial strand invasion step of double strand break repair we show that i hrad  binds to the ssdna of tailed duplex dna molecules and ii hrad  catalyses the invasion of tailed duplex dna into homologous covalently closed dna invasion is stimulated by the single strand dna binding protein rpa and by the hrad  protein strikingly hrad  forms terminal nucleoprotein filaments on either   or   ssdna tails and promotes strand invasion without regard for the polarity of the tail taken together these results show that hrad  is recruited to regions of ssdna occurring at resected double strand breaks and that hrad  shows no intrinsic polarity preference at the strand invasion step that initiates double strand break repair
