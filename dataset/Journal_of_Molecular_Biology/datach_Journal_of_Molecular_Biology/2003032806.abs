subunit assembly for dna cleavage by restriction endonuclease sgrai
the sgrai endonuclease usually cleaves dna with two recognition sites more rapidly than dna with one site often converting the former directly to the products cut at both sites in this respect sgrai acts like the tetrameric restriction enzymes that bind two copies of their target sites before cleaving both sites concertedly however by analytical ultracentrifugation sgrai is a dimer in solution though it aggregates to high molecular mass species when bound to its specific dna sequence its reaction kinetics indicate that it uses different mechanisms to cleave dna with one and with two sgrai sites it cleaves the one site dna in the style of a dimeric restriction enzyme acting at an individual site mediating neither interactions in trans as seen with the tetrameric enzymes nor subunit associations as seen with the monomeric enzymes in contrast its optimal reaction on dna with two sites involves an association of protein subunits two dimers bound to sites in cis may associate to form a tetramer that has enhanced activity which then cleaves both sites concurrently the mode of action of sgrai differs from all restriction enzymes characterised previously so this study extends the range of mechanisms known for restriction endonucleases
