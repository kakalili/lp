structural insights into substrate specificity in variants of n acetylneuraminic acid lyase produced by directed evolution
the substrate specificity of escherichia coli n acetylneuraminic acid lyase was previously switched from the natural condensation of pyruvate with n acetylmannosamine yielding n acetylneuraminic acid to the aldol condensation generating n alkylcarboxamide analogues of n acetylneuraminic acid this was achieved by a single mutation of glu  to asn in order to analyze the structural changes involved and to more fully understand the basis of this switch in specificity we have isolated all  variants of the enzyme at position   and determined the activities with a range of substrates we have also determined five high resolution crystal structures the structures of wild type e coli n acetylneuraminic acid lyase in the presence and in the absence of pyruvate the structures of the e  n variant in the presence and in the absence of pyruvate and the structure of the e  n variant in the presence of pyruvate and a competitive inhibitor  r r    trihydroxy n n dipropylbutanamide all structures were solved in space group p  at resolutions ranging from     to     a comparison of these structures in combination with the specificity profiles of the variants reveals subtle differences that explain the details of the specificity changes this work demonstrates the subtleties of enzyme  substrate interactions and the importance of determining the structures of enzymes produced by directed evolution where the specificity determinants may change from one substrate to another
