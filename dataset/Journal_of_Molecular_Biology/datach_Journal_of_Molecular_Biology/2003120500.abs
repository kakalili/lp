stabilization of a tetrameric malate dehydrogenase by introduction of a disulfide bridge at the dimer  dimer interface
malate dehydrogenase mdh from the moderately thermophilic bacterium chloroflexus aurantiacus camdh is a tetrameric enzyme while mdhs from mesophilic organisms usually are dimers to investigate the potential contribution of the extra dimer  dimer interface in camdh with respect to thermal stability we have engineered an intersubunit disulfide bridge designed to strengthen dimer  dimer interactions the resulting mutant t  c containing two      disulfide bridges in the tetramer showed a   fold increase in half life at   c and an increase of  deg c in apparent melting temperature compared to the wild type the crystal structure of the mutant solved at    resolution was essentially identical with that of the wild type with the exception of the added inter dimer disulfide bridge and the loss of an aromatic intra dimer contact remarkably the mutant and the wild type had similar temperature optima and activities at their temperature optima thus providing a clear case of uncoupling of thermal stability and thermoactivity the results show that tetramerization may contribute to mdh stability to an extent that depends strongly on the number of stabilizing interactions in the dimer  dimer interface
