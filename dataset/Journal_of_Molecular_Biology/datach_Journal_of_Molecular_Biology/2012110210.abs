are parm filaments polar or bipolar
a recent perspective erickson h     bacterial actin homolog parm arguments for an apolar antiparallel double helix j mol biol          by harold erickson has suggested that published reconstructions of bacterial parm filaments from three different laboratories may have artifactually imposed polarity upon a filament that is really bipolar with the two strands running in opposite directions we show that erickson s model of a bipolar filament can be easily distinguished from a polar filament by helical diffraction since the asymmetric unit in a bipolar filament would be twice the size as that in a polar filament existing data from both electron cryo microscopy and x ray diffraction exclude a bipolar model we adopt the suggestion put forward by erickson to process filaments assuming that they are bipolar and show that the resulting filaments are polar
