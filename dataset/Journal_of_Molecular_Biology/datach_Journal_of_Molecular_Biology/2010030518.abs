sequence recognition of dna by protein induced conformational transitions
the binding of proteins to specific sequences of dna is an important feature of virtually all dna transactions proteins recognize specific dna sequences using both direct readout sensing types and positions of dna functional groups and indirect readout sensing dna conformation and deformability  previously we showed that the p  c repressor n terminal domain p r ntd forces the central non contacted  atat  sequence of the dna operator into the b  state a state known to affect dna hydration rigidity and bending usually the b  state with a narrow minor groove and a spine of hydration is reserved for a tract dna tpa steps disrupt a tracts  here we have co crystallized p r ntd with an operator containing a central   acgt   sequence in the non contacted region c g base pairs have not previously been observed in the b  state and are thought to prevent it however p r ntd induces a narrow minor groove and a spine of hydration to  acgt   we observe that c g base pairs have distinctive destabilizing and disordering effects on the spine of hydration it appears that the reduced stability of the spine results in a higher energy cost for the b to b  transition the differential effect of dna sequence on the barrier to this transition allows the protein to sense the non contacted dna sequence
