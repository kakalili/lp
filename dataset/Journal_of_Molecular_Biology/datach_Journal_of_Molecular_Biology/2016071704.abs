archaeoglobus fulgidus dna polymerase d a zinc binding protein inhibited by hypoxanthine and uracil
archaeal family d dna polymerases pol d comprise a small dp  proofreading subunit and a large dp  polymerase subunit pol d is one of the least studied polymerase families and this publication investigates the enzyme from archaeoglobus fulgidus afu pol d  the c terminal region of dp contains two conserved cysteine clusters and their roles are investigated using site directed mutagenesis the cluster nearest the c terminus is essential for polymerase activity and the cysteines are shown to serve as ligands for a single critical zn  ion the cysteines farthest from the c terminal were not required for activity and a role for these amino acids has yet to be defined additionally it is shown that afu pol d activity is slowed by the template strand hypoxanthine extending previous results that demonstrated inhibition by uracil hypoxanthine was a weaker inhibitor than uracil investigations with isolated dp  which has a measurable polymerase activity localised the deaminated base binding site to this subunit uracil and hypoxanthine slowed afu pol d  in trans   that is a copied dna strand could be inhibited by a deaminated base in the alternate strand of a replication fork the error rate of afu pol d measured in vitro was        typical for a polymerase that has been proposed to carry out genome replication in the archaea deleting the       proofreading exonuclease activity reduced fidelity twofold the results presented in this publication considerably increase our knowledge of pol d
