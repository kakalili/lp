plant based heterologous expression of mal d  a thaumatin like protein and allergen of apple malus domestica  and its characterization as an antifungal protein
mal d  is a thaumatin like protein and important allergen of apple fruits that is associated with ige mediated symptoms in apple allergic individuals we obtained a full length cdna clone of mal d  from rna isolated from ripe apple malus domestica cv golden delicious  the cdna s open reading frame encodes a protein of   amino acid residues including a signal peptide of  residues and two putative glycosylation sites the deduced amino acid sequence of the mature mal d  protein results in a predicted molecular mass of     da and a calculated pi of    sequence comparisons and molecular modeling place mal d  among those pathogenesis related thaumatin like proteins that contain a conserved acidic cleft in order to ensure the correct formation of the protein s eight conserved disulfide bridges we expressed mal d  in nicotiana benthamiana plants by the use of a tobacco mosaic viral vector transfected n benthamiana plants accumulated mal d  to levels of at least  of total soluble protein maldi tof mass spectrometric analyses of the recombinant mal d  and its proteolytic fragments showed that the apple specific leader peptide was correctly cleaved off by the host plant and that the mature recombinant protein was intact and not glycosylated purified recombinant mal d  displayed the ability to bind ige from apple allergic individuals equivalent to natural mal d  in addition the recombinant thaumatin like mal d  exhibited antifungal activity against fusarium oxysporum and penicillium expansum implying a function in plant defense against fungal pathogens
