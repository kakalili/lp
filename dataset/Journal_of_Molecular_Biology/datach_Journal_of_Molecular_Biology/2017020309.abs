abysis integrated antibody sequence and structure  management analysis and prediction
abysis is a web based antibody research system that includes an integrated database of antibody sequence and structure data the system can be interrogated in numerous ways  from simple text and sequence searches to sophisticated queries that apply d structural constraints the publicly available version includes pre analyzed sequence data from the european molecular biology laboratory european nucleotide archive embl ena and kabat as well as structure data from the protein data bank a researcher s own sequences can also be analyzed through the web interface a defining characteristic of abysis is that the sequences are automatically numbered with a series of popular schemes such as kabat and chothia and then annotated with key information such as complementarity determining regions and potential post translational modifications a unique aspect of abysis is a set of residue frequency tables for each position in an antibody allowing  unusual residues   those rarely seen at a particular position to be highlighted and decisions to be made on which mutations may be acceptable this is especially useful when comparing antibodies from different species abysis is useful for any researcher specializing in antibody engineering especially those developing antibodies as drugs abysis is available at www abysis org
