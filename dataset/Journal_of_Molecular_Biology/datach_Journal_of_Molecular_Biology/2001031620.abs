crystal structure of alginate lyase a iii complexed with trisaccharide product at    resolution edited by r huber
the structure of a iii from a sphingomonas species a complexed with a trisaccharide product  deoxy l erythro hex  enepyranosyluronate mannuronate mannuronic acid was determined by x ray crystallography at    with an r factor of    the final model of the complex form comprising   amino acid residues   water molecules one sulfate ion and one trisaccharide product exhibited a c  r m s d value of     with the reported apo form of the enzyme the trisaccharide was bound in the active cleft at subsites        from the non reducing end by forming several hydrogen bonds and van der waals interactions with protein atoms the catalytic residue was estimated to be tyr   which existed between subsites   and  based on a mannuronic acid model oriented at subsite
