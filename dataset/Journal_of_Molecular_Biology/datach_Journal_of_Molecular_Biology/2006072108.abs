crystal structure of the monomeric porin ompg
the outer membrane om of gram negative bacteria contains a large number of channel proteins that mediate the uptake of ions and nutrients necessary for growth and functioning of the cell an important group of om channel proteins are the porins which mediate the non specific diffusion based passage of small  lt   da polar molecules all porins of gram negative bacteria that have been crystallized to date form stable trimers with each monomer composed of a  stranded  barrel with a relatively narrow central pore in contrast the ompg porin is unique as it appears to function as a monomer we have determined the x ray crystal structure of ompg from escherichia coli to a resolution of     the structure shows a  stranded  barrel with a relatively simple architecture due to the absence of loops that fold back into the channel ompg has a large       central pore that is considerably wider than those of other e coli porins and very similar in size to that of the toxin  hemolysin the architecture of the channel together with previous biochemical and other data suggests that ompg may form a non specific channel for the transport of larger oligosaccharides the structure of ompg provides the starting point for engineering studies aiming to generate selective channels and for the development of biosensors
