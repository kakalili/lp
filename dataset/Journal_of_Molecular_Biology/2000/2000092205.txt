Interleukin-2 tyrosine kinase (Itk), is a T-cell specific tyrosine kinase of the Tec family. We have examined a novel intermolecular interaction between the SH3 and SH2 domains of Itk. In addition to the interaction between the isolated domains, we have found that the dual SH3/SH2 domain-containing fragment of Itk self-associates in a specific manner in solution. Tec family members contain the SH3, SH2 and catalytic domains common to many kinase families but are distinguished by a unique amino-terminal sequence, which contains a proline-rich stretch. Previous work has identified an intramolecular regulatory association between the proline-rich region and the adjacent SH3 domain of Itk. The intermolecular interaction between the SH3 and SH2 domains of Itk that we describe provides a possible mechanism for displacement of this intramolecular regulatory sequence, a step that may be required for full Tec kinase activation. Additionally, localization of the interacting surfaces on both the SH3 and SH2 domains by chemical shift mapping has provided information about the molecular details of this recognition event. The interaction involves the conserved aromatic binding pocket of the SH3 domain and a newly defined binding surface on the SH2 domain. The interacting residues on the SH2 domain do not conform to the consensus motif for an SH3 proline-rich ligand. Interestingly, we note a striking correlation between the SH2 residues that mediate this interaction and those residues that, when mutated in the Tec family member Btk, cause the hereditary immune disorder, X-linked agamaglobulinemia.
