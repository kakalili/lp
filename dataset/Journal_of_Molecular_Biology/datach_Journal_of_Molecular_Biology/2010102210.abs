the metalloregulatory zinc site in streptococcus pneumoniae adcr a zinc activated marr family repressor
streptococcus pneumoniae d  adcr adhesin competence repressor is the first metal sensing member of the marr multiple antibiotic resistance repressor family to be characterized expression profiling with a  adcr strain grown in liquid culture brain  heart infusion under microaerobic conditions revealed upregulation of  genes including adcr and adccba encoding a high affinity abc uptake system for zinc and genes encoding cell surface zinc binding pneumococcal histidine triad pht proteins and adcaii lmb laminin binding  the  adcr h  q and h  q adcr mutant allelic strains grown in   mm zn ii exhibit a slow growth phenotype and an approximately twofold increase in cell associated zn ii  apo and zn ii bound adcr are homodimers in solution and binding to a  mer dna containing an adc operator is strongly stimulated by zn ii with kdna zn      m  ph      m nacl    c  adcr binds two zn ii per dimer with stepwise zn ii affinities kzn and kzn of     m  at ph   and     m  at ph   and one to three lower affinity zn ii depending on the ph x ray absorption spectroscopy of the high affinity site reveals a pentacoordinate n o complex and no cysteine coordination the latter finding corroborated by wild type like functional properties of c a adcr alanine substitution of conserved residues his  in the dna binding domain and his  and his  in the c terminal regulatory domain abolish high affinity zn ii binding and greatly reduce zn ii activated binding to dna nmr studies reveal that these mutants adopt the same folded conformation as dimeric wild type apo adcr but fail to conformationally switch upon zn ii binding these studies implicate his  his  and h  as metalloregulatory zinc ligands in s pneumoniae adcr
