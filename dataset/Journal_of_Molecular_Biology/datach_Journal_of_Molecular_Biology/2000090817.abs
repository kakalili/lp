chimeras of the flp and cre recombinases tests of the mode of cleavage by flp and cre edited by m gottesman
the flp and cre recombinases are members of the integrase family of tyrosine recombinases each protein consists of a  kda nh terminal domain and a larger cooh terminal domain that contains the active site of the enzyme the cooh terminal domain also contains the major determinants for the binding specificity of the recombinase to its cognate dna binding site all family members cleave the dna by the attachment of a conserved nucleophilic tyrosine residue to the   phosphate group at the sites of cleavage in order to gain further insights into the determinants of the binding specificity and modes of cleavage of flp and cre we have made chimeric proteins in which we have fused the nh terminal domain of flp to the cooh terminal domain of cre   fre   and the nh terminal domain of cre to the cooh terminal domain of flp   clp   these chimeras have novel binding specificities in that they bind strongly to hybrid sites containing elements from both the flp and cre dna targets but poorly to the native target sites in this study we have taken advantage of the unique binding specificities of fre and clp to examine the mode of cleavage by cre flp fre and clp we find that the cooh terminal domain of the recombinases determines their mode of cleavage thus flp and clp cleave in trans whereas cre and fre cleave in cis these results agree with the studies of flp and with the cocrystal structure of cre bound to its dna target site they disagree with our previous findings that cre could carry out trans cleavage we discuss the variations in the experimental approaches in order to reconcile the different results
