structure of a thioredoxin like  fe s ferredoxin from aquifex aeolicus edited by i a wilson
the    resolution crystal structure of a  fe s cluster containing ferredoxin from aquifex aeolicusreveals a thioredoxin like fold that is novel among iron sulfur proteins the  fe s cluster is located near the surface of the protein at a site corresponding to that of the active site disulfide bridge in thioredoxin the four cysteine ligands are located near the ends of two surface loops two of these ligands can be substituted by non native cysteine residues introduced throughout a stretch of the polypeptide chain that forms a protruding loop extending away from the cluster the presence of homologs of this ferredoxin as components of more complex anaerobic and aerobic electron transfer systems indicates that this is a versatile fold for biological redox processes
