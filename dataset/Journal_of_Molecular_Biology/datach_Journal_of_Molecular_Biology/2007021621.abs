the x ray crystal structures of two constitutively active mutants of the escherichia coli phob receiver domain give insights into activation
the phor phob two component system is a key regulatory protein network enabling escherichia coli to respond to inorganic phosphate pi starvation conditions by turning on pho regulon genes for more efficient pi uptake and use of alternative phosphorus sources under environmental pi depletion the response regulator rr component phob is phosphorylated at the receiver domain rd  a process that requires mg  bound at the active site phosphorylation of the rd relieves the inhibition of the phob effector domain ed  a dna binding region that binds to pho regulon promoters to activate transcription the molecular details of the activation are proposed to involve dimerization of the rd and a conformational change in the rd detected by the ed the structure of the phob rd shows a symmetrical interaction involving   loop    and n terminus of   elements also seen in the complex of phob rd with mg  in which helix   highly increases its flexibility phob rd in complex with mg  and bef   an emulator of the phosphate moiety undergoes a dramatic conformational change on helix   and shows another interaction involving     and   segments we have selected a series of constitutively active phob mutants phobca that are able to turn on the pho regulon promoters in the absence phosphorylation and as they cannot be inactivated should therefore mimic the active rd state of phob and its functional oligomerisation we have analysed the phobca rd crystal structures of two such mutants asp ala tyr  cys and asp ala asp glu interestingly both mutants reproduce the homodimeric arrangement through the symmetric interface encountered in the unbound and magnesium bound wild type phob rd structures besides the mutant rd structures show a modified active site organization as well as changes at helix   that correlate with repositioning of surrounding residues like the active site events indicator trp  putatively redifining the interaction with the ed in the full length protein
