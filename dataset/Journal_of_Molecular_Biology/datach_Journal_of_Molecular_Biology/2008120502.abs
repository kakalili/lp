bag m is a component of the invivo dna  glucocorticoid receptor complex at hormone regulated promoter
molecular chaperones and cochaperones are known to participate in nuclear receptor mediated gene expression in addition to providing the appropriate conformation for hormone binding it has been reported that bag m bcl  associated athanogene m downregulates the transactivation function of the glucocorticoid receptor gr  here we demonstrate that bag m downregulates the glucocorticoid function via binding to distinct amino acid sequences in the hinge region of the gr in cells expressing the human metallothionein iia gene overexpression of bag m resulted in an in vivo dissociation of the dna  receptor complex and a decrease in glucocorticoid mediated transcription indicating that this cochaperone acts as a negative regulator of gr action in bag m expressing cells this cochaperone is recruited with the gr to genomic hormone response element following glucocorticoid treatment in line with this small interfering rna knockdown of the cellular level of bag m enhanced dna binding by the gr resulting in a robust increase in transcriptional activity these findings identify a regulatory mechanism downstream of hormone binding used by bag m for attenuating gr action in response to its changing cellular levels
