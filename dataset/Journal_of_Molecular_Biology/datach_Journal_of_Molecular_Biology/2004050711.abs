a peroxiredoxin specifically expressed in two types of pharyngeal neurons is required for normal growth and egg production in caenorhabditis elegans
a family of antioxidant proteins the peroxiredoxins serve two purposes detoxification of reactive oxygen species and cellular signaling among the three peroxiredoxins of caenorhabditis elegans ceprx    ceprx was found to have a very unusual expression pattern restricted to only two types of pharyngeal neurons namely the single pharyngeal interneuron i and the sensory interneuron i  ceprx and ceprx depleted worms showed no obvious phenotypic alterations whereas worms devoid of ceprx were retarded developmentally and had a significantly reduced brood size other features such as lifespan pharyngeal activity or defecation rates were indistinguishable from those of wild type worms recombinant ceprx revealed antioxidant activity as it was able to detoxify hydrogen peroxide and butylhydroperoxide t booh  and to protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation by thiol dependent metal catalyzed oxidation in addition the molecule was able to act as a terminal peroxidase in the thioredoxin system expression of ceprx in c elegans was induced after short term exposure of worms to t booh but survival of ceprx knockout mutants in the presence of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species was not impaired thus ceprx may protect specifically the two types of neurons from oxidative damage or more likely plays a critical role in peroxide signaling in this nematode
