structural insights into baf  and baf  complex formation
mammalian baf complexes are a subfamily of swi snf atp dependent chromatin remodelers that dynamically modulate chromatin structure to regulate fundamental cellular processes including gene transcription cell cycle control and dna damage response so far many distinct baf complexes have been identified with polymorphic assemblies of up to  subunits from  genes the evolutionarily conserved brg brm baf  and baf  baf  form a stable complex that carries out essential chromatin remodeling activity and therefore have been regarded as the core components of baf complex here we first confirmed that swirm domain of baf  is responsible for its interaction with baf  and then narrowed down the swirm binding region in baf  to the repeat  rpt  domain we further presented the high resolution crystal structure of swirm rpt complex extensive mutagenesis experiments together with isothermal titration calorimetry and nmr titrations were performed to corroborate the interactions observed in crystal structure overall we demonstrated that baf  swirm is a modular domain involved in baf  interaction which is functionally distinct from other characterized swirm domains that possess dna binding activity
