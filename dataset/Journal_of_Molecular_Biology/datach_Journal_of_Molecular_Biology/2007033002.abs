crystal structure of co sensing transcription activator cooa bound to exogenous ligand imidazole
cooa is a co dependent transcriptional activator and transmits a co sensing signal to a dna promoter that controls the expression of the genes responsible for co metabolism cooa contains a b type heme as the active site for sensing co co binding to the heme induces a conformational change that switches cooa from an inactive to an active dna binding form here we report the crystal structure of an imidazole bound form of cooa from carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans ch cooa  in the resting form ch cooa has a six coordinate ferrous heme with two endogenous axial ligands the  amino group of the n terminal amino acid and a histidine residue the n terminal amino group of cooa that is coordinated to the heme iron is replaced by co this substitution presumably triggers a structural change leading to the active form the crystal structure of ch cooa reveals that imidazole binds to the heme which replaces the n terminus as does co the dissociated n terminus is positioned approximately    from the heme iron in the imidazole bound form in addition the heme plane is rotated by   about the normal of the porphyrin ring compared to that found in the inactive form of rhodospirillum rubrum cooa even though the ligand exchange imidazole bound ch cooa remains in the inactive form for dna binding these results indicate that the release of the n terminus resulting from imidazole binding is not sufficient to activate cooa the structure provides new insights into the structural changes required to achieve activation
