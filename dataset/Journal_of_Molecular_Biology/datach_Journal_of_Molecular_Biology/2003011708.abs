crystal structure and site directed mutagenesis of enzymatic components from clostridium perfringens iota toxin
iota toxin from clostridium perfringens type e is an adp ribosylating toxin adprt that adp ribosylates actin which is lethal and dermonecrotic in mammals it is a binary toxin composed of an enzymatic component ia and a binding component ib  ia adp ribosylates g actin at arginine   resulting in the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton here we report on studies of the structure function relationship by the crystal structures of ia complexed with nadh and nadph at    and    resolution respectively and mutagenesis that map the active residues the catalytic c domain structure was similar to that of bacillus cereus vegetative insecticidal protein vip  which is an insect targeted toxin except for the exe loop region however a significant structural difference could be seen in the n domain which interacts with ib suggesting an evolutionary difference between mammalian targeted and insect targeted adprt the high resolution structure analysis revealed specific nad conformation a ring like conformation of nicotinamide mononucleotide nmn  supported by arg   arg   asn   arg  and glu   additionally the mutagenesis study showed that the residues tyr   arg   glu   ser   phe   arg  and glu   including a newly identified one are essential for nad glycohydrolase nadase activity at least one residue glu   is an essential residue for adp ribosyltransferase artase  but not for nadase consequently the structural feature and these mutagenesis findings suggest that the catalytic mechanism of ia proceeds via an sn type reaction
