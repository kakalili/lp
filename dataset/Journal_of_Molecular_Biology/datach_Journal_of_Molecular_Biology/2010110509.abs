actin filament bundling and different nucleating effects of mouse diaphanous related formin fh domains on actin adf and actin cofilin complexes
mouse diaphanous related formins mdias are members of the formin protein family that nucleate actin polymerization and subsequently promote filamentous actin f actin elongation by monomer addition to fast growing barbed ends it has been suggested that mdias preferentially recruit actin complexed to profilin due to their proline rich fh domains during filament elongation dimeric mdias remain attached to the barbed ends by their fh domains which form an anti parallel ring like structure enclosing the filament barbed ends dimer formation of mdia fh domains is dependent on their n terminal lasso and linker subdomains connector  here we investigated the effect of isolated fh domains on actin polymerization using mdia fh domain plus connector as well as core mdia  mdia  and mdia missing the connector by cosedimentation and electron microscopy after negative staining analytical ultracentrifugation showed that core fh domains of mdia and mdia exhibited a low degree of dimer formation whereas mdia fh minus connector and mdia fh plus connector readily dimerized only core mdia fh was able to nucleate actin polymerization however all tested core fh domains decorated and bundled f actin as demonstrated by electron microscopy after negative staining bundling activity was highest for mdia fh  decreased for mdia fh  and further decreased for mdia fh  the mdia fh domain plus connector induced actin polymerization also in the absence of profilin but failed to induce f actin deformation and bundling we also tested whether mdia fh was able to repolymerize actin in complex with different proteins that stabilize globular actin the data obtained demonstrated that mdia fh induced actin repolymerization only from the actin cofilin  complex but not when complexed to actin depolymerizing factor gelsolin segment  vitamin d binding protein or deoxyribonuclease i
