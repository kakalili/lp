Recruitment of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex to the promoter of the Ifng gene has been studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in activated functionally different CD4+ T helper (Th) cell subsets. In parallel, analysis of association of the nuclear scaffold/matrix with the Ifng gene promoter has been carried out. The RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) interacted with the Ifng gene promoter in analyzed activated neutral Th cells, IFN-γ producing Th1 cells and IFN-γ silent Th2 cells. However, the interaction of the Ifng gene promoter with the nuclear matrix occurred differentially in a lineage-specific manner. The pattern of the nuclear matrix interaction correlated directly with the gene expression. Strong association of the promoter with the nuclear matrix was observed only in the Th1 cell subset where the Ifng gene was actively transcribed. We propose that it is the interaction of the Ifng gene promoter with the nuclear matrix that may set off transcription in activated Th cells by promoter-associated RNA pol II.
