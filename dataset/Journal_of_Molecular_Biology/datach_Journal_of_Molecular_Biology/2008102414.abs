computational redesign of the shv   lactamase  lactamase inhibitor protein interface
lactamases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of  lactam antibiotics   lactamase  lactamase inhibitor protein blip complexes are emerging as a well characterized experimental model system for studying protein  protein interactions blip is a   amino acid protein that inhibits several class a  lactamases with a wide range of affinities picomolar affinity for k  nanomolar affinity for tem  sme  and blai but only micromolar affinity for shv   lactamase the large differences in affinity coupled with the availability of extensive mutagenesis data and high resolution crystal structures for the tem  blip and shv  blip complexes make them attractive systems for the further development of computational design methodology we used egad a physics based computational design program to redesign blip in an attempt to increase affinity for shv  characterization of several of designs and point mutants revealed that in all cases the mutations stabilize the interface by   to   fold relative to wild type blip the calculated changes in binding affinity for the mutants were within a mean absolute error of   kcal mol from the experimental values and comparison of the calculated and experimental values for a set of  shv  blip complexes yielded a correlation coefficient of    structures of the two complexes with the highest affinity shv  blip e m and shv  blip e m s  k s  m  are presented at    resolution while the predicted structures have much in common with the experimentally determined structures they do not coincide perfectly in particular a salt bridge between shv  d  and blip k  is observed in the experimental structures but not in the predicted design conformations this discrepancy highlights the difficulty of modeling salt bridge interactions with a protein design algorithm that approximates side chains as discrete rotamers nevertheless while local structural features of the interface were sometimes miscalculated egad is globally successful in designing complexes with increased affinity
