selective binding of meiosis specific yeast hop protein to the holliday junctions distorts the dna structure and its implications for junction migration and resolution
saccharomyces cerevisiae hop  which encodes a component of synaptonemal complex sc  plays an important role in both gene conversion and crossing over between homologs as well as enforces meiotic recombination checkpoint control over the progression of recombination intermediates in hop  mutants meiosis specific double strand breaks dsbs are reduced to  of the wild type level and at aberrantly late times these dsbs are processed into inter sister recombination intermediates however the underlying mechanism by which hop protein regulates these nuclear events remains obscure here we show that hop protein interacts selectively with the holliday junction changes its global conformation and blocks the dissolution of the junction by a recq helicase the holliday junction  hop protein complexes are significantly more stable at higher ionic strengths and molar excess of unlabeled competitor dna than complexes containing other recombination intermediates structural analysis of the holliday junction using  aminopurine fluorescence emission dnase i footprinting and kmno probing provide compelling evidence that hop protein binding induces significant distortion at the center of the holliday junction we propose that hop protein might coordinate the physical monitoring of meiotic recombination intermediates with the process of branch migration of holliday junction
