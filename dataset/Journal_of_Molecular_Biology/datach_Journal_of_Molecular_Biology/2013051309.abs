cooperativity of allosteric receptors
cooperativity of ligand binding to allosteric receptors can be quantified using the hill coefficient nh to measure the sigmoidal character of the binding curve however for measurements of the transition between conformational states nh values can be misleading due to ambiguity of the reference state for cooperative ligand binding the reference state is a hyperbolic curve for a monomer with a single binding site characterized by nh  therefore binding curves with nh gt  provide a direct measure of cooperativity for the dependence of the conformational state on ligand concentration curves with nh gt  are observed but in virtually all cases the equivalent allosteric monomer has a value of nh lt  the ratio of the two nh values defines the effective cooperativity and always corresponds to nh n the number of protomers in the oligomer for concerted transitions as specified by the monod  wyman  changeux model dose  response curves for homopentameric   nicotinic receptors illustrate this relationship for both wild type and mutant forms for functional allosteric monomers such as g protein coupled receptors normalization stretches the dose  response curve along the y axis thereby masking the  allosteric range  and increasing the apparent cooperativity to a limit for monomers of nh   the concepts of equivalent monomer and allosteric range were originally proposed in   by crick and wyman in a manuscript circulated among the proponents of allostery but only now published for the first time in this special issue
