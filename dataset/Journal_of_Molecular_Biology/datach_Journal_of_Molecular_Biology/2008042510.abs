interaction of alzheimer  s a  peptide with an engineered binding protein  thermodynamics and kinetics of coupled folding  binding
the oligomerization and aggregation of the amyloid   a  peptide a cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein predominantly  or  amino acids in length has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease the identification of a  binding agents e g  antibodies or peptides constitutes a promising therapeutic approach however the amount of structural and biophysical data on the underlying a  interactions is currently very limited we have earlier determined the structure of a      in complex with the affibody protein za   a selected binding protein based on a three helix bundle scaffold z domain  za  is a dimer of affibody subunits linked via a disulfide bridge involving a selected cysteine mutation at position   za  binds to the central and c terminal part of a  residues      which adopts a  hairpin conformation in the complex here we present a detailed biophysical analysis of the za  a      interaction employing nmr circular dichroism spectroscopy  anilino  naphthalenesulfonic acid and tyrosine fluorescence size exclusion chromatography thermal denaturation profiles and isothermal titration calorimetry we conclude that i free za  is characterized by conformational exchange and the loss of helix  of the three helix bundle scaffold  ii a high energy barrier is associated with the conversion of an initial za  a      recognition complex into the native complex structure entailing slow binding kinetics  iii both a  and za  fold upon binding which e g  becomes manifest in the binding thermodynamics that feature a large negative change in heat capacity  iv the c  disulfide does not merely afford dimerization but its impact on the binding interfaces of the affibody subunits and a  is a prerequisite for tight binding the extensive folding coupled to binding observed here likely constitutes an obligate feature of biomolecular interactions involving the central and c terminal part of a  options for improvement of za  binding proteins are discussed
