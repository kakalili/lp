distinct origins of trna m g  methyltransferase
the enzyme trna m g  methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from s adenosyl l methionine adomet to the n position of g  in the anticodon loop of a subset of trna the modified guanosine is   to the anticodon and is important for maintenance of reading frame during decoding of genetic information while the methyltransferase is well conserved in bacteria and is easily identified encoded by the trmd gene  the identity of the enzyme in eukarya and archaea is less clear here we report that the enzyme encoded by mj   of methanocaldococcus jannaschii is the archaeal counterpart of the bacterial trmd however despite catalyzing the same reaction and displaying similar enzymatic properties mj   and bacterial trmd are completely unrelated in sequence the catalytic domain of mj   when aligned with the five known structural folds i  v that have been described to bind adomet is of the class i fold similar to the ancient rossmann fold that binds nucleotides in contrast the catalytic domain of the bacterial trmd has the unusual class iv fold of a trefoil knot structure thus both the sequence and structural arrangements of trna m g  methyltransferase have distinct evolutionary origins among primary kingdoms revealing an unexpected but remarkable non orthologous gene displacement to achieve an important trna modification
