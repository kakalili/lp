histone hyperacetylation in the coding region of chromatin undergoing transcription in sv  minichromosomes is a dynamic process regulated directly by the presence of rna polymerase ii
sv  chromosomes undergoing transcription operationally defined by the presence of rna polymerase ii rnapii were immune selected with antibody to rnapii and subjected to secondary chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies to hyperacetylated or unacetylated h or h  immune selection fragmentation and immunoprecipitation was used to determine the hyperacetylation status of histones independent of the location of the rnapii and re chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to determine their hyperacetylation status when associated with rnapii while hyperacetylated h and h were found in the coding regions regardless of the location of rnapii unacetylated h and h were found only at sites lacking rnapii the absence of unacetylated h and h at sites containing rnapii was correlated with the specific association of the histone acetyl transferase p  with the rnapii in contrast the presence of unacetylated h and h at sites lacking rnapii was shown to result from the action of a histone deacetylase based upon the effects of the inhibitor sodium butyrate these results suggest that the extent of hyperacetylation of h and h during transcription alternates between hyperacetylation directed by an rnapii associated histone acetyl transferase and deacetylation directed by a histone deacetylase at other sites
