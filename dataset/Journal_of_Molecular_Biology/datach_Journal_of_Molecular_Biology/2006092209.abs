structural and functional analysis of saccharomyces cerevisiae mob
the mob proteins function as activator subunits for the dbf dbf  family of protein kinases human and xenopus mob protein structures corresponding to the most conserved c terminal core but lacking the variable n terminal region have been reported and provide a framework for understanding the mechanism of dbf dbf  regulation here we report the     x ray crystal structure of saccharomyces cerevisiae mob containing both the conserved c terminal core and the variable n terminal region within the n terminal region three novel structural elements are observed namely an  helix denoted h  a strand like element denoted s and a short  strand denoted s  helix h associates in an intermolecular manner with a second mob molecule to form a mob homodimer strand s binds to the core domain in an intramolecular manner across a putative dbf binding site mapped by mob temperature sensitive alleles and nmr binding experiments in vivo functional analysis demonstrates that mob mutants that target helix h or its reciprocal binding site are biologically compromised the n terminal region of mob thus contains structural elements that are functionally important
