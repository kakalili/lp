a structural rearrangement of the na k atpase traps ouabain within the external ion permeation pathway
with the use of the energy of atp hydrolysis the na k atpase is able to transport across the cell membrane na and k against their electrochemical gradients the enzyme is strongly inhibited by ouabain and its derivatives some that are therapeutically used for patients with heart failure cardiotonic steroids  using lanthanide resonance energy transfer we trace here the conformational changes occurring on the external side of functional na k atpases induced by the binding of ouabain changes in donor acceptor pair distances are mainly observed within the  subunit of the enzyme to derive a structural model matching the experimental lanthanide resonance energy transfer distances measured with bound ouabain we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with energy restraints applied simultaneously using a novel methodology with multiple non interacting fragments the restrained simulation initiated from the x ray structure of the e  k  state became strikingly similar to the x ray structure of the sodium bound state the final model shows that ouabain is trapped within the external ion permeation pathway of the pump
