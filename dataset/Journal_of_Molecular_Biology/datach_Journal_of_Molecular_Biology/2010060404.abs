structure of a two domain n terminal fragment of ribosomal protein l  from methanococcus jannaschii reveals a specific piece of the archaeal ribosomal stalk
ribosomal stalk is involved in the formation of the so called  gtpase associated site  and plays a key role in the interaction of ribosome with translation factors and in the control of translation accuracy the stalk is formed by two or three copies of the l l  dimer bound to the c terminal tail of protein l  the n terminal domain of l  binds to a segment of domain ii of  s rrna near the binding site for ribosomal protein l  the structure of bacterial l  in complex with three l l  n terminal dimers has been determined in the isolated state and the structure of the first third of archaeal l  bound to domain ii of  s rrna has been solved within the haloarcula marismortui  s ribosomal subunit a close structural similarity between the rna binding domain of archaeal l  and the rna binding domain of bacterial l  has been demonstrated in this work a long rna binding n terminal fragment of l  from methanococcus jannaschii has been isolated and crystallized the crystal structure of this fragment which encompasses two thirds of the protein has been solved at     resolution the model presented shows the structure of the rna binding domain and the structure of the adjacent domain that exist in archaeal l  and eukaryotic p proteins only furthermore our model incorporated into the structure of the h marismortui  s ribosomal subunit allows clarification of the structure of the archaeal ribosomal stalk base
