target binding to s  b reduces dynamic properties and increases ca  binding affinity for wild type and ef hand mutant proteins
mutations in the second ef hand d n d n d n and e a of s  b were used to study its ca  binding and dynamic properties in the absence and presence of a bound target trtk   with d ns  b as an exception d nkd    m  ca  binding to ef hand mutants were reduced by more than  fold in the absence of trtk   d nkd     m d nkd      m and e akd      m  when compared to wild type protein wtkd    m  for the trtk  complexes the ca  binding affinity to wild type wt trtkkd     m and the ef mutants was increased by  to  fold versus in the absence of target d n trtkkd     m d n trtkkd     m d n trtkkd     m and e a trtkkd     m  in addition rex as measured using relaxation dispersion for side  chain  n resonances of asn  d ns  b  was reduced upon trtk  binding when measured by nmr likewise backbone motions on multiple timescales picoseconds to milliseconds throughout wild type d ns  b d ns  b and d ns  b were lowered upon binding trtk   however the x ray structures of ca  bound     and trtk bound     d ns  b showed no change in ca  coordination thus these and analogous structural data for the wild type protein could not be used to explain how target binding increased ca  binding affinity in solution therefore a model for how s  b  trtk   complex formation increases ca  binding is discussed which considers changes in protein dynamics upon binding the target trtk
