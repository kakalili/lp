binding of retinol induces changes in rat cellular retinol binding protein ii conformation and backbone dynamics edited by p e wright
the structure and backbone dynamics of rat holo cellular retinol binding protein ii holo crbp ii in solution has been determined by multidimensional nmr the final structure ensemble was based on   distance and  dihedral angle restraints and was calculated using metric matrix distance geometry with pairwise gaussian metrization followed by simulated annealing the average rms deviation of the backbone atoms for the final  structures relative to their mean coordinates is         comparison of the solution structure of holo crbp ii with apo crbp ii indicates that the protein undergoes conformational changes not previously observed in crystalline crbp ii affecting residues    of the helix turn helix residues    of the subsequent linker as well as the  hairpin c d e f and g h loops the bound retinol is completely buried inside the binding cavity and oriented as in the crystal structure the order parameters derived from the  n t  t and steady state noe parameters show that the backbone dynamics of holo crbp ii is restricted throughout the polypeptide the t derived apparent backbone exchange rate and amide h exchange rate both indicate that the microsecond to second timescale conformational exchange occurring in the portal region of the apo form has been suppressed in the holo form
