proteomic analysis of ribosomes translational control of mrna populations by glycogen synthase gys
ribosomes exist as a heterogenous pool of macromolecular complexes composed of ribosomal rna molecules ribosomal proteins and numerous associated  nonribosomal  proteins to identify nonribosomal proteins that may modulate ribosome activity we examined the composition of translationally active and inactive ribosomes using a proteomic multidimensional protein identification technology notably the phosphorylated isoform of glycogen synthase glycogen synthase  gys  was preferentially associated with elongating ribosomes depletion of gys affected the translation of a subset of cellular mrnas some of which encode proteins that modulate protein biosynthesis these findings argue that gys abundance by virtue of its ribosomal association provides a feedback loop between the energy state of the cells and the translation machinery
