genetic incorporation of a photo crosslinkable amino acid reveals novel protein complexes with grb in mammalian cells
cell signaling pathways are essentially organized through the distribution of various types of binding domains in signaling proteins with each domain binding to specific target molecules although identification of these targets is crucial for mapping the pathways affinity based or copurification methods are insufficient to distinguish between direct and indirect interactions in a cellular context in the present study we developed another approach involving the genetic encoding of a photo crosslinkable amino acid p trifluoromethyl diazirinyl l phenylalanine was thus incorporated at a defined site in the src homology  sh  domain of the adaptor protein grb in human embryonic kidney cells these cells were exposed to   nm light after an epidermal growth factor stimulus and the crosslinkable grb sh domain exclusively formed covalent bonds with directly interacting proteins proteomic mass spectrometry analysis identified these direct binders of grb sh separately from the proteins noncovalently bound to the src homology  domains of grb  in addition to two signaling associated proteins git and af  the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins f h  and h were thus identified as novel direct binders the results revealed a connection between the cell signaling protein and the nuclear machinery involved in mrna processing and demonstrated the usefulness of genetically encoded photo crosslinkers for mapping protein  protein interactions in cells
