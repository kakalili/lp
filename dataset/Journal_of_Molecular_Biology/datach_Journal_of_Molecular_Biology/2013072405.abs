single molecule fret reveals the native state dynamics of the i b  ankyrin repeat domain
previous single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret studies in which the second and sixth ankyrin repeats ars of i b  were labeled with fret pairs showed slow fluctuations as if the i b  ar domain was unfolding in its native state to systematically probe where these slow dynamic fluctuations occur we now present data from smfret studies wherein fret labels were placed at ars  and  mutant named ar     at ars  and  ar     and at ars  and  ar     the results presented here reveal that ar  most readily detaches unfolds from the ar domain undergoing substantial fluctuations at room temperature ar  has fewer stabilizing consensus residues than the other i b  ars probably contributing to the ease with which ar   loses grip   ar  shows almost no fluctuations at room temperature but a significant fraction of molecules shows fluctuations at   c introduction of stabilizing mutations that are known to fold ar  dampen the fluctuations of ar  indicating that the ar  fluctuations are likely due to weakened inter repeat stabilization from ar  ar  also fluctuates somewhat at room temperature suggesting that fluctuations are a general behavior of ars at ends of ar domains remarkably ar  still fluctuates in the bound state but mainly between   and   fret efficiency whereas in the free i b  the fluctuations extend to lt   fret efficiency overall our results provide a more complete picture of the energy landscape of the native state dynamics of an ar domain
