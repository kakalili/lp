compensatory evolution reveals functional interactions between ribosomal proteins s  l  and l
certain mutations in s  a ribosomal protein involved in translation elongation rate and translation accuracy confer resistance to the aminoglycoside streptomycin previously we showed in salmonella typhimurium that the fitness cost i e reduced growth rate due to the amino acid substitution k n in s  could be compensated by at least  different mutations located in the ribosomal proteins s  s and l  here we have characterized in vivo the fitness translation speed and translation accuracy of four different l  mutants when separated from the resistance mutation located in s  the three different compensatory amino acid substitutions in l  at position   q h q l and q r caused a decrease in fitness while the g  a change had no effect on bacterial growth the rate of protein synthesis was unaffected or increased by the mutations at position  and the level of read through of a uga nonsense codon was increased in vivo indicating a loss of translational accuracy the mutations in l  increased sensitivity to aminoglycosides active at the a site further indicating a perturbation of the decoding step these phenotypes are similar to those of the classical s and s ram ribosomal ambiguity mutants by evolving low fitness l  mutants by serial passage we showed that the fitness cost conferred by the l  mutations could be compensated by additional mutations in the ribosomal protein l  itself in s  and in l  a protein located close to l  our results reveal a novel functional role for the  s ribosomal protein l  during protein synthesis supporting published structural data suggesting that the interaction of l  and l  with  s rrna could influence function of the  s subunit moreover our study demonstrates how compensatory fitness evolution can be used to discover new molecular functions of ribosomal proteins
