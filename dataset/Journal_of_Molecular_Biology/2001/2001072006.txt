We have measured the dependencies of both the dissociation rate of specifically bound EcoRI endonuclease and the ratio of non-specific and specific association constants on water activity, salt concentration, and pH in order to distinguish the contributions of these solution components to specific and non-specific binding. For proteins such as EcoRI that locate their specific recognition site efficiently by diffusing along non-specific DNA, the specific site dissociation rate can be separated into two steps: an equilibrium between non-specific and specific binding of the enzyme to DNA, and the dissociation of non-specifically bound protein. We demonstrated previously that the osmotic dependence of the dissociation rate is dominated by the equilibrium between specific and non-specific binding that is independent of the osmolyte nature. The remaining osmotic sensitivity linked to the dissociation of non-specifically bound protein depends significantly on the particular osmolyte used, indicating a change in solute-accessible surface area. In contrast, the dissociation of non-specifically bound enzyme accounts for almost all the pH and salt-dependencies. We observed virtually no pH-dependence of the equilibrium between specific and non-specific binding measured by the competition assay. The observed weak salt-sensitivity of the ratio of specific and non-specific association constants is consistent with an osmotic, rather than electrostatic, action. The seeming lack of a dependence on viscosity suggests the rate-limiting step in dissociation of non-specifically bound protein is a discrete conformational change rather than a general diffusion of the protein away from the DNA.
