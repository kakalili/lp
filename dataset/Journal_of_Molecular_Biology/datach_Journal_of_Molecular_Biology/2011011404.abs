structural characterization of hbxip the protein that interacts with the anti apoptotic protein survivin and the oncogenic viral protein hbx
hepatitis b x interacting protein hbxip is a ubiquitous protein that was originally identified as a binding partner of the hepatitis b viral protein hbx hbxip is also thought to serve as an anti apoptotic cofactor of survivin promoting the suppression of pro caspase  activation here we report the crystal structure of the shortest isoform of hbxip   aa long     kda at     resolution hbxip crystal shows a monomer per asymmetric unit with a profilin like fold which is common to a superfamily of proteins the roadblock lc domain family involved in protein  protein interactions based on this fold we propose that hbxip can form a dimer that can indeed be found in the crystal when symmetric molecules are generated around the asymmetric unit this dimer shows an extended  sheet area formed by  anti parallel  strands from both subunits another interesting aspect of the proposed hbxip dimer interface is the presence of a small leucine zipper between the two   helices of each monomer in solution the scattering curve obtained by small angle x ray scattering for the sample used for crystallization indicates that the protein is predominantly in dimeric form in solution the fit between the experimental small angle x ray scattering curve and the backcalculated curves for two potential crystal dimers shows a significant preference for the roadblock lc fold dimer model moreover the hbxip crystal structure represents a step towards understanding the cellular role of hbxip
