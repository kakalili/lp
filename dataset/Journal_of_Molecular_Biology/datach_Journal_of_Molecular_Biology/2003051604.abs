systematic variation of amino acid substitutions for stringent assessment of pairwise covariation
during protein evolution amino acids change due to a combination of functional constraints and genetic drift proteins frequently contain pairs of amino acids that appear to change together covariation  analysis of covariation from naturally occurring sets of orthologs cannot distinguish between residue pairs retained by functional requirements of the protein and those pairs existing due to changes along a common evolutionary path here we have separated the two types of covariation by independently recombining every naturally occurring amino acid variant within a set of  subtilisin orthologs our analysis shows that in this family of subtilisin orthologs almost all possible pairwise combinations of amino acids can coexist this suggests that amino acid covariation found in the subtilisin orthologs is almost entirely due to common ancestral origin of the changes rather than functional constraints we conclude that naturally occurring sequence diversity can be used to identify positions that can vary independently without destroying protein function
