topological information embodied in local juxtaposition geometry provides a statistical mechanical basis for unknotting by type  dna topoisomerases
topoisomerases may unknot by recognizing specific dna juxtapositions the physical basis of this hypothesis is investigated by considering single loop conformations in a coarse grained polymer model we determine the statistical relationship between the local geometry of a juxtaposition of two chain segments and whether the loop is knotted globally and ascertain how the knot unknot topology is altered by a topoisomerase like segment passage at the juxtaposition segment passages at a  free  juxtaposition tend to increase knot probability in contrast segment passages at a  hooked  juxtaposition cause more transitions from knot to unknot than vice versa resulting in a steady state knot probability far lower than that at topological equilibrium the reduction in knot population by passing chain segments through a hooked juxtaposition is more prominent for loops of smaller sizes n but remains significant even for larger loops steady state knot probability is only    and    of equilibrium respectively for n   and   in the model an exhaustive analysis of     different juxtaposition geometries indicates that the ability of a segment passage to unknot correlates strongly with the juxtaposition s  hookedness   remarkably and consistent with experiments on type  topoisomerases from different organisms the unknotting potential of a juxtaposition geometry in our polymer model correlates almost perfectly with its corresponding decatenation potential these quantitative findings suggest that it is possible for topoisomerases to disentangle by acting selectively on juxtapositions with  hooked  geometries
