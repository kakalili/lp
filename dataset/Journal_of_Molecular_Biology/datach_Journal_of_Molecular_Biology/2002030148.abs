the hidden thermodynamics of a zinc finger
the zn finger provides a model for studies of protein structure and stability its core contains a conserved phenylalanine residue adjoining three architectural elements a  hairpin an  helix and a tetrahedral zn  binding site here we demonstrate that the consensus phe is not required for high affinity zn  binding but contributes to the specification of a precise dna binding surface substitution of phe by leucine in a zfy peptide permits zn  dependent folding although a native like structure is retained structural fluctuations lead to attenuation of selected nuclear overhauser enhancements and accelerated amide proton exchange surprisingly wild type zn affinity is maintained by entropy enthalpy compensation eec  a hidden entropy penalty t  s  kcal mol is balanced by enhanced enthalpy of association   h   kcal mol at   c because the variant is less well ordered than the phe anchored domain the net change in entropy is opposite to the apparent change in configurational entropy by analogy to the thermodynamics of organometallic complexation we propose that eec arises from differences in solvent reorganization exclusion of leu among biological sequences suggests an evolutionary constraint on the dynamics of a zn finger
