l iduronidase premature stop codons and potential read through in mucopolysaccharidosis type i patients
l iduronidase is a glycosyl hydrolase involved in the sequential degradation of the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulphate and dermatan sulphate a deficiency in  l iduronidase results in the lysosomal accumulation and urinary secretion of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans and is the cause of the lysosomal storage disorder mucopolysaccharidosis type i mps i hurler and scheie syndromes mckusick     the premature stop codons q x and w  x are two of the most common  l iduronidase gene idua mutations accounting for up to   of mps i disease alleles in some populations here we have reported a new mutation making a total of  different mutations that can cause premature idua stop codons and have investigated the biochemistry of these mutations natural stop codon read through was dependent on the fidelity of the codon when evaluated at q x and w  x in cho k cells but the three possible stop codons taa tag and tga had different effects on mrna stability and this effect was context dependent in cho k cells expressing the q x and w  x mutations the level of gentamicin enhanced stop codon read through was slightly less than the increment in activity caused by a lower fidelity stop codon in this system gentamicin had more effect on read through for the taa and tga stop codons when compared to the tag stop codon in an mps i patient study premature tga stop codons were associated with a slightly attenuated clinical phenotype when compared to classical hurler syndrome e g w  x w  x and q x q x genotypes with tag stop codons  natural read through of premature stop codons is a potential explanation for variable clinical phenotype in mps i patients enhanced stop codon read through is a potential treatment strategy for a large sub group of mps i patients
