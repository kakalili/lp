functional reconstitution of purified human hv h channels
voltage dependent h  hv channels mediate proton conduction into and out of cells under the control of membrane voltage hv channels are unusual compared to voltage dependent k  na  and ca  channels in that hv channel genes encode a voltage sensor domain vsd without a pore domain the h currents observed when hv channels are expressed heterologously suggest that the vsd itself provides the pathway for proton conduction in order to exclude the possibility that the hv channel vsd assembles with an as yet unknown protein in the cell membrane as a requirement for h conduction we have purified hv channels to homogeneity and reconstituted them into synthetic lipid liposomes the hv channel vsd by itself supports h flux
