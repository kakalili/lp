molecular basis of the tfs ira interaction a combined protein engineering and molecular modelling study
tfs p and ylr  cp are yeast proteins belonging to the pebp family tfs p but not ylr  cp has been shown to interact with and inhibit ira p a gtpase activating protein of ras tfs p has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of the cpy protease and the d structure of the complex has been resolved to shed light on the molecular determinants of tfs p involved in the tfs ira interaction the d structure of ylr  cp has been modelled and compared to that of tfs p tfs p point mutants and tfs hybrid proteins combining regions of tfs p and ylr  cp were also designed and their function was tested results interpreted from a structural point of view show that the accessibility of the surface pocket of tfs p its n terminal region and the specific electrostatic properties of a large surface region containing these two elements play a crucial role in this interaction
