crystal structures of a rab protein in its inactive and active conformations
we have determined crystal structures of sec  a member of the rab family in the g protein superfamily in two states bound to gdp and to a non hydrolyzable gtp analog guanosine       imidotriphosphate gppnhp  this represents the first structure of a rab protein bound to gdp sec in both states grossly resembles other g proteins bound to gdp and gppnhp in sec gppnhp structural features common to active rab proteins are observed in sec gdp the switch i region is highly disordered and displaced relative to the switch i region of ras gdp in two of the four molecules of sec gdp in the asymmetric unit of the sec gdp crystals the switch ii region adopts a conformation similar to that seen in the structure of the small g protein ran bound to gdp this allows residues threonine   glutamate   and arginine  of sec to make contacts with other conserved residues and water molecules important for nucleotide binding in the other two molecules in the asymmetric unit these interactions do not take place this structural variability in both the switch i and switch ii regions of gdp bound sec provides a possible explanation for the high off rate of gdp bound to sec  and suggests a mechanism for regulation of the gtpase cycle of rab proteins by gdi proteins
