structural and thermodynamic insights into the recognition of native proteins by anti peptide antibodies
the mechanism by which antibodies elicited against protein derived peptides achieve cross reactivity with their cognate proteins remains unknown to address this question we have carried out the complete thermodynamic characterization of the association of a monoclonal antibody       raised against a peptide snpep derived from staphylococcal nuclease snase with both eliciting peptide and cognate protein although both ligands bind with similar affinity kd    m and    m for protein and peptide respectively  protein and peptide binding have highly different thermodynamic signatures peptide binding is characterized by a large enthalpic contribution  h    kcal mol whereas protein binding is dominated by a large entropic contribution   t s    kcal mol  the structure of the snpep fab complex determined by x ray diffraction reveals that the bound conformation of the peptide differs from the conformation of the corresponding loop region in crystal structures of free snase the energy difference estimated by molecular dynamics simulations between native snase and a model in which the  loop is built in the conformation of the fab bound peptide shows that the energetic cost of adopting this conformation is compatible with the enthalpic cost of binding the protein vis  vis the peptide these results are compatible with a mechanism by which the anti peptide antibody recognizes the cognate protein high affinity is maintained upon binding a non native conformation by offsetting enthalpic penalties with reduced entropic losses these findings provide potentially useful guidelines for the identification of linear epitopes within protein sequences that are well suited for the development of synthetic peptide vaccines
