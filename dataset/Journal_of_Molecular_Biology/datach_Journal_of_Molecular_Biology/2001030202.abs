crystal structure of gere the ultimate transcriptional regulator of spore formation in bacillus subtilis edited by t richmond
the small dna binding protein gere regulates gene transcription in the terminally differentiated mother cell compartment during late stages of sporulation in bacillus subtilis this versatile transcription factor shares sequence homology with the luxr fixj uhpa family of activators and modulates the expression of a number of genes in particular those encoding the components of the coat that surrounds the mature spore gere orchestrates the final stages of coat deposition and maturation that lead to a spore with remarkable resistance properties but that must be responsive to low levels of germination signals as this germination process is largely passive and can occur in the absence of de novo protein synthesis the correct assembly of germination machinery including germinant receptors and energy storage compounds is crucial to the survival of the cell the crystal structure of gere has been solved at     resolution using multi wavelength anomalous dispersion techniques and reveals the nature of the gere dimer each monomer comprises four  helices of which the central pair forms a helix turn helix dna binding motif implications for dna binding and the structural organisation of the luxr fixj uhpa family of transcription activator domains are discussed
