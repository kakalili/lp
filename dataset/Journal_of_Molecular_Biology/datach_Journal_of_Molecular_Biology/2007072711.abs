elastic behavior of reca dna helical filaments
escherichia coli reca protein forms a right handed helical filament with dna molecules and has an atp dependent activity that exchanges homologous strands between single stranded dna ssdna and duplex dna we show that the reca  ssdna filamentous complex is an elastic helical molecule whose length is controlled by the binding and release of nucleotide cofactors reca  ssdna filaments were fluorescently labelled and attached to a glass surface inside a flow chamber when the chamber solution was replaced by a buffer solution without nucleotide cofactors the reca  ssdna filament rapidly contracted approximately   fold with partial filament dissociation the contracted filament elongated up to   fold when a buffer solution containing atp s was injected and elongated up to   fold when a buffer solution containing atp or datp was injected this contraction  elongation behavior was able to be repeated by the successive injection of datp and non nucleotide buffers we propose that this elastic motion couples to the elastic motion and or the twisting rotation of dna strands within the filament by adjusting their helical phases
