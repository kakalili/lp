an antibody against the c terminal domain of pcsk lowers ldl cholesterol levels in vivo
proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type  pcsk  is associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia a state of elevated levels of ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia can result in severe implications such as stroke and coronary heart disease the inhibition of pcsk function by therapeutic antibodies that block interaction of pcsk with the epidermal growth factor like repeat a domain of ldl receptor ldlr was shown to successfully lower ldl cholesterol levels in clinical studies here we present data on the identification structural and biophysical characterization and in vitro and in vivo pharmacology of a pcsk antibody mab  the x ray structure shows that mab binds the module  of the c terminal domain ctd of pcsk  it blocks access to an area bearing several naturally occurring gain of function and loss of function mutations although the antibody does not inhibit binding of pcsk to epidermal growth factor like repeat a it partially reverses pcsk induced reduction of the ldlr and ldl cholesterol uptake in a cellular assay mab is also effective in lowering serum levels of ldl cholesterol in cynomolgus monkeys in vivo complete loss of pcsk is associated with insufficient liver regeneration and increased risk of hepatitis c infections blocking of the ctd is sufficient to partially inhibit pcsk function antibodies binding the ctd of pcsk may thus be advantageous in patients that do not tolerate complete inhibition of pcsk
