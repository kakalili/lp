the allosteric activator mg atp modifies the quaternary structure of the r state of escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase without altering the t  r equilibrium
the allosteric enzyme aspartate transcarbamylase from escherichia coli atcase displays regulatory properties that involve various conformational changes including a large quaternary structure rearrangement this entails a major change in its solution x ray scattering curve upon binding substrate analogues we show here that in the presence of the nucleotide effector atp known to stimulate the enzyme activity the scattering profiles show a marked dependence on the metal bound to atp whereas atp has no major effect on the scattering pattern of atcase a saturating concentration of mg atp notably modifies the scattering profile of the enzyme either in the absence or in the presence of the bisubstrate analogue n phosphonacetyl l aspartate pala  the transition with pala in the presence of this metal nucleotide complex remains concerted furthermore mg atp as already observed with atp has no detectable direct effect on the t to r transition the experimental scattering curves in the presence of mg atp were fitted by a modeling approach using rigid body movements of the regulatory subunits and the catalytic trimers in the crystal structures while the differences observed in the t state in the presence of mg atp are essentially attributed to the binding per se of the nucleotide the solution structure of the r state complexed to mg atp is even more extended along the  fold axis than the previously described r solution structure which is already more stretched out along the same axis than the crystal r structure based on the crystal structure of the enzyme in the r state complexed with free atp a proposal is made to account for the effect of magnesium
