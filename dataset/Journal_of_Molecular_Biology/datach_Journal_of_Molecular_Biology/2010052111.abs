computational and experimental evidence for the evolution of a     barrel protein from an ancestral quarter barrel stabilised by disulfide bonds
the evolution of the prototypical     barrel protein imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase hisf was studied by complementary computational and experimental approaches the  fold symmetry of hisf suggested that its constituting     quarter barrels have a common evolutionary origin this conclusion was supported by the computational reconstruction of the hisf sequence of the last common ancestor which showed that its quarter barrels were more similar to each other than are those of extant hisf proteins a comprehensive sequence analysis identified hisf n  corresponding to       as the slowest evolving quarter barrel this finding indicated that it is the closest relative of the common     predecessor which must have been a stable and presumably tetrameric protein in accordance with this prediction a recombinantly produced hisf n protein was properly folded and formed a tetramer being stabilised by disulfide bonds the introduction of a disulfide bond in hisf c  corresponding to       also resulted in the formation of a stable tetramer the fusion of two identical hisf n quarter barrels yielded the stable dimeric half barrel hisf n n  our findings suggest a two step evolutionary pathway in which a hisf n like predecessor was duplicated and fused twice to yield hisf most likely the     quarter barrel and     half barrel intermediates on this pathway were stabilised by disulfide bonds that became dispensable upon consolidation of the     barrel
