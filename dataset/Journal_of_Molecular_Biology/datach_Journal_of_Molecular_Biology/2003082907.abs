the structure of the n terminal domain of riboflavin synthase in complex with riboflavin at    resolution
riboflavin synthase of escherichia coli is a homotrimer with a molecular mass of  kda the enzyme catalyzes the dismutation of   dimethyl     d ribityl lumazine affording riboflavin and  amino  ribitylamino   h h pyrimidinedione the n terminal segment residues     and the c terminal segment residues      form beta barrels with similar fold and a high degree of sequence similarity a recombinant peptide comprising amino acid residues    forms a dimer which binds riboflavin with high affinity here we report the structure of this construct in complex with riboflavin at    resolution it is demonstrated that the complex can serve as a model for ligand binding in the native enzyme the structure and riboflavin binding mode is in excellent agreement with structural information obtained from the native enzyme from escherichia coli and riboflavin synthase from schizosaccharomyces pombe the implications for the binding specificity and the regiospecificity of the catalyzed reaction are discussed
