initiation factor  induced structural changes in the  s ribosomal subunit and in complexes containing trnafmet and mrna edited by d e diaper
initiation factor  if  acts to switch the decoding preference of the small ribosomal subunit from elongator to initiator trna the effects of if on the  s ribosomal subunit and on the  s mrna trnafmet complex were determined by uv induced rna crosslinking three intramolecular crosslinks in the  s rrna of the  that were monitored by gel electrophoresis are affected by if  these are the crosslinks between c   and c   within the decoding region between c   c   joining the end loop of a helix of  s rrna domain iii and the decoding region and between u  and g   joining the   end loop of  s rrna domain ii and the end loop of the terminal helix these changes occur even in the  s if complex indicating they are not mediated through trnafmet or mrna uv induced crosslinks occur between  s rrna position c   and trnafmet position u  in trnafmet the nucleotide adjacent to the   anticodon nucleotide and between  s rrna position c   and the mrna at positions  and   where a of the initiator aug codon is   the presence of if reduces both of these crosslinks by twofold and fourfold respectively the binding site for if involves the   region some other parts of the  s rrna domain ii and the terminal stem loop region these are located in the front bottom part of the platform structure in the  s subunit a short distance from the decoding region the changes that occur in the decoding region even in the absence of mrna and trna may be induced by if from a short distance or could be caused by the second if structural domain
