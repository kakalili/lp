function of his  in aquifex aeolicus  deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase
aquifex aeolicus  deoxy d manno octulosonate  phosphate synthase kdo ps catalyzes the condensation of arabinose  phosphate a p and phosphoenolpyruvate pep by favoring the activation of a water molecule coordinated to the active site metal ion cys  his   glu  and asp  are the other metal ligands wild type kdo ps is purified with zn  or fe  in the active site but maximal activity in vitro is achieved when the endogenous metal is replaced with cd  the h  g enzyme retains  of the wild type activity icp mass spectrometry analysis indicates that loss of his  decreases the enzyme affinity for fe  but not for zn  however maximal activity is again achieved by substitution of the endogenous metal with cd  we have determined the x ray structures of the cd  h  g enzyme in its substrate free form and in complex with pep and pep plus a p these structures show a normal amount of cd  bound suggesting that coordination by his  is not essential to retain cd  in the active site nonetheless there are significant changes in the coordination sphere of cd  with respect to the wild type enzyme as the carboxylate moiety of pep binds directly to the metal ion and replaces water and his  as ligands these observations indicate that the primary function of his  in a aeolicus kdo ps is to orient pep in the active site of the enzyme in such a way that a water molecule on the sinister si side of pep can be activated by direct coordination to the metal ion
