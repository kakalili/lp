a monomer of pif unwinds double stranded dna and it is regulated by the nature of the non translocating strand at the   end
using a dna polymerase coupled assay and fret f rster resonance energy transfer based helicase assays in this work we show that a monomer of saccharomyces cerevisiae pif can unwind dsdna double stranded dna  the helicase activity of a pif monomer is modulated by the nature of the   ssdna single stranded dna tail of the substrate and its effect on a pif dependent re winding activity that is coupled to the opening of dsdna we propose that in addition to the ssdna site on the protein that interacts with the translocating strand pif has a second site that binds the   ssdna of the substrate interaction of dna with this site modulates the degree to which re winding counteracts unwinding depending on the nature of the   tail and the length of the duplex dna to be unwound this activity is sufficiently strong to mask the helicase activity of a monomer in excess pif over the dna the pif dependent re winding of the opened dna strongly limits unwinding independent of the   tail we propose that in this case binding of dna to the second site is precluded and modulation of the pif dependent re winding activity is largely lost
