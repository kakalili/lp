functional hydration and conformational gating of proton uptake in cytochrome c oxidase
cytochrome c oxidase couples the reduction of dioxygen to proton pumping against an electrochemical gradient the d channel a    long cavity provides the principal pathway for the uptake of chemical and pumped protons a water chain is thought to mediate the relay of protons via a grotthuss mechanism through the d channel but it is interrupted at n  in all available crystallographic structures we use free energy simulations to examine the proton uptake pathway in the wild type and in single point mutants n  v and n  a in which redox and pumping activities are compromised we present a general approach for the calculation of water occupancy in protein cavities and demonstrate that combining efficient sampling algorithms with long simulation times hundreds of nanoseconds is required to achieve statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in the protein interior the relative population of different conformational and hydration states of the d channel is characterized results shed light on the role of n  in the mechanism of proton uptake and clarify the physical basis for inactive phenotypes the conformational isomerization of the n  side chain is shown to act as a gate controlling the formation of a functional water chain or  proton wire   in the closed state of n   the spatial distribution of water in the d channel is consistent with available crystallographic models however a metastable state of n  opens up a narrow bottleneck in which   occupancy by a water molecule establishes a proton pathway throughout the d channel results for n  v suggest that blockage of proton uptake resulting from persistent interruption of the water pathway is the cause of this mutant s marginal oxidase activity in contrast results for n  a indicate that the d channel is a continuously hydrated cavity implying that the decoupling of oxidase activity from proton pumping measured in this mutant is not due to interruption of the proton relay chain
