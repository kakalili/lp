s  a competes with the taz domain of p  for binding to p  and attenuates p  acetylation
s  a is a calcium binding protein that like some other members of the s  protein family is able to bind p  this interaction may be physiologically relevant considering the numerous connotations of s  proteins and of s  a  in particular with cancer and metastasis in this work we show that the interaction with s  a is limited to unmodified or phosphorylated p  and is inhibited by p  acetylation using in vitro acetylation assay we show that the presence of s  a attenuates p  acetylation by p   furthermore using elisa we show that s  a and the taz domain of p  bind p  with similar affinities and that s  a effectively competes with taz for binding to p  our results add another element to the complicated scheme of p  activation
