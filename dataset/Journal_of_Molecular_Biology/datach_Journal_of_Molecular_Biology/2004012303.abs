structure of the integrin    binding collagen peptide
we have determined the    crystal structure of a triple helical integrin binding collagen peptide ibp with sequence gly pro hyp  gly phe hyp gly glu arg gly pro hyp  the central gfoger hexapeptide is recognised specifically by the integrins             and     these integrin collagen interactions are implicated in a number of key physiological processes including cell adhesion cell growth and differentiation and pathological states such as thrombosis and tumour metastasis comparison of the ibp structure with the previously determined structure of an identical collagen peptide in complex with the integrin   i domain ibpc allows the first detailed examination of collagen in a bound and an unbound state the ibp structure shows a direct and a water mediated electrostatic interaction between glu and arg side chains from adjacent strands but no intra strand interactions the interactions between ibp glu and arg side chains are disrupted upon integrin binding a comparison of ibp and ibpc main chain conformation reveals the flexible nature of the triple helix backbone in the imino poor gfoger region this flexibility could be important to the integrin  collagen interaction and provides a possible explanation for the unique orientation of the three gfoger strands observed in the integrin ibpc complex crystal structure
