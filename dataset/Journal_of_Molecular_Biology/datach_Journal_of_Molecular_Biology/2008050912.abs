tet repressor induction by tetracycline a molecular dynamics continuum electrostatics and crystallographic study
the tet repressor tetr mediates the most important mechanism of bacterial resistance against tetracycline tc antibiotics in the absence of tc tetr is tightly bound to its operator dna upon binding of tc with an associated mg  ion it dissociates from the dna allowing expression of the repressed genes its tight control by tc makes tetr broadly useful in genetic engineering the tc binding site is over    from the dna so the binding signal must propagate a long distance we use molecular dynamics simulations and continuum electrostatic calculations to test two models of the allosteric mechanism we simulate the tetr dna complex the tc bound   induced  tetr and the transition pathway between them the simulations support the model inferred previously from the crystal structures and reveal new details when tc mg  binds the mg  ion makes direct and water mediated interactions with helix  of one tetr monomer and helix  of the other monomer and helix  is pulled in towards the central core of the structure hydrophobic interactions with helix  then pull helix  in a pendulum motion with a maximal displacement at its n terminus the dna interface the crystal structure of an additional tetr reported here corroborates this motion the n terminal residue of helix  lys  is highly conserved in dna binding regulatory proteins of the tetr class and makes the largest contribution of any amino acid to the tetr dna binding free energy thus the conformational changes lead to a drastic reduction in the tetr dna binding affinity allowing tetr to detach itself from the dna tc plays the role of a specific mg  carrier whereas the mg  ion itself makes key interactions that trigger the allosteric transition in the tetr tc complex
