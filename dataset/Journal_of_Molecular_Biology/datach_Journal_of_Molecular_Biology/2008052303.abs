structural basis for chitotetraose coordination by cgl  a novel galectin related protein from coprinopsis cinerea
recent advances in genome sequencing efforts have revealed an abundance of novel putative lectins among these many galectin related proteins characterized by many conserved residues but intriguingly lacking critical amino acids have been found in all corners of the eukaryotic superkingdom here we present a structural and biochemical analysis of one representative the galectin related lectin cgl found in the inky cap mushroom coprinopsis cinerea this protein contains all but one conserved residues known to be involved in  galactoside binding in galectins a trp residue strictly conserved among galectins is changed to an arg in cgl  r   accordingly the galectin related protein is not able to bind lactose screening of a glycan array revealed that cgl displays preference for oligomers of     linked n acetyl glucosamines chitooligosaccharides and galnac    glcnac lacdinac  carbohydrate binding affinity of this novel lectin was quantified using isothermal titration calorimetry and its mode of chitooligosaccharide coordination not involving any aromatic amino acid residues was studied by x ray crystallography structural information was used to alter the carbohydrate binding specificity and substrate affinity of cgl  the importance of residue r  in determining the carbohydrate binding specificity was demonstrated by replacing this arg with a trp residue r w  this single amino acid change led to a lectin that failed to bind chitooligosaccharides but gained lactose binding our results demonstrate that similar to the legume lectin fold the galectin fold represents a conserved structural framework upon which dramatically altered specificities can be grafted by few alterations in the binding site and that in consequence many metazoan galectin related proteins may represent lectins with novel carbohydrate binding specificities
