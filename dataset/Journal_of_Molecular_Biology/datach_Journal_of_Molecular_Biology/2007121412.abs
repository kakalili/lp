opsin stability and folding modulation by phospholipid bicelles
integral membrane proteins do not fare well when extracted from biological membranes and are unstable or lose activity in detergents commonly used for structure and function investigations we show that phospholipid bicelles provide a valuable means of preserving alpha helical membrane proteins in vitro by supplying a soluble lipid bilayer fragment both   dimyristoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dmpc   cholamidopropyl dimethyl ammonio  propane sulfonate chaps and dmpc l    dihexanoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine dhpc bicelles dramatically increase the stability of the mammalian vision receptor rhodopsin as well as its apoprotein opsin opsin is particularly unstable in detergent solution but can be directly purified into dmpc chaps we show that opsin can also be directly purified in dmpc dhpc bicelles to give correctly folded functional opsin as shown by the ability to regenerate rhodopsin to    yield these well characterised dmpc dhpc bicelles enable us to probe the influence of bicelle properties on opsin stability these bicelles are thought to provide dmpc bilayer fragments with most dhpc capping the bilayer edge giving a soluble bilayer disc opsin stability is shown to be modulated by the q value the ratio of dmpc to dhpc which reflects changes in the bicelle size and thus proportion of dmpc bilayer present the observed changes in stability also correlate with loss of opsin secondary structure as determined by synchrotron far uv circular dichroism spectroscopy the most stable bicelle results in the least helix loss the inclusion of chaps rather than dhpc in the dmpc chaps bicelles however imparts the greatest stability this suggests that it is not just the dmpc bilayer fragment in the bicelles that stabilises the protein but that chaps provides additional stability either through direct interaction with the protein or by altering the dmpc chaps bilayer properties within the bicelle the significant stability enhancements and preservation of secondary structure reported here in bicelles are pertinent to other membrane proteins notably g protein coupled receptors which are unstable in detergent solution
