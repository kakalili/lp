positive correlation between dna polymerase  primase pausing and mutagenesis within polypyrimidine polypurine microsatellite sequences
microsatellite dna sequences are ubiquitous in the human genome and mutation rates of these repetitive sequences vary with respect to dna sequence as well as length we have analyzed polymerase dna interactions as a function of microsatellite sequence using polypyrimidine polypurine di and tetranucleotide alleles representative of those found in the human genome using an in vitro primer extension assay and the mammalian dna polymerase  primase complex we have observed a polymerase termination profile for each microsatellite that is unique to that allele interestingly a periodic termination profile with an interval size     nucleotides unrelated to microsatellite unit length was observed for the tc  and ttcc  templates in contrast a unit punctuated polymerase termination profile was found for the longer polypurine templates we detected strong polymerase pauses within the tc  allele at low reaction ph which were eliminated by the addition of deaza dgtp consistent with these specific pauses being a consequence of triplex dna formation during dna synthesis quantitatively a strand bias was observed in the primer extension assay in that polymerase synthesis termination is more intense when the polypurine sequence serves as the template relative to its complementary polypyrimidine sequence the hsv tk forward mutation assay was utilized to determine the corresponding polymerase  primase error frequencies and specificities at the microsatellite alleles a higher microsatellite polymerase error frequency       to       was measured when polypurine sequences serve as templates for dna synthesis relative to the polypyrimidine template        thus a positive correlation exists between polymerase  primase pausing and mutagenesis within microsatellite dna alleles
