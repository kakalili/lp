plasmodium falciparum ssb tetramer binds single stranded dna only in a fully wrapped mode
the tetrameric escherichia coli single stranded dna ssdna binding protein ec ssb functions in dna metabolism by binding to ssdna and interacting directly with numerous dna repair and replication proteins ec ssb tetramers can bind ssdna in multiple dna binding modes that differ in the extent of ssdna wrapping here we show that the structurally similar ssb protein from the malarial parasite plasmodium falciparum pf ssb also binds tightly to ssdna but does not display the same number of ssdna binding modes as ec ssb binding ssdna exclusively in fully wrapped complexes with site sizes of     nt tetramer pf ssb does not transition to the more cooperative ssb  dna binding mode observed for ec ssb consistent with this pf ssb tetramers also do not display the dramatic intra tetramer negative cooperativity for binding of a second dt  molecule that is evident in ec ssb these findings highlight variations in the dna binding properties of these two highly conserved homotetrameric ssb proteins and these differences might be tailored to suit their specific functions in the cell
