specific and non specific interactions of integration host factor with dna thermodynamic evidence for disruption of multiple ihf surface salt bridges coupled to dna binding edited by d draper
site specific dna binding of architectural protein integration host factor ihf is involved in formation of functional multiprotein dna assemblies in escherichia coli while non specific binding of ihf and other histone like proteins serves to structure the nucleoid here we report an isothermal titration calorimetry study of the thermodynamics of binding ihf to a  bp fragment composed entirely of the specific h  site from  phage dna at low to moderate k       mm  strong competition is observed between specific and non specific binding as a result of a low specificity ratio     and a very small non specific site size in this k  range both specific and non specific binding are enthalpy driven with large negative enthalpy entropy and heat capacity changes and binding constants that are insensitive to k  above   mm k  only specific binding is observed and both the binding constant and the magnitudes of enthalpy entropy and heat capacity changes all decrease strongly with increasing k  when interpreted in the context of the structure of the specific complex the thermodynamics provide compelling evidence for a previously unrecognized design principle by which proteins that form extensive binding interfaces with nucleic acids control binding constants binding site sizes and effects of temperature and ion concentrations on stability and specificity we propose that up to  of the  ihf cationic side chains that are located within   of dna phosphate oxygen atoms in the complex are masked in the absence of dna by pairing with anionic carboxylate groups in intramolecular salt bridges dehydrated ion pairs  these salt bridges increase in stability with increasing temperature and decreasing k  to explain the unusual thermodynamics of ihf dna interactions we propose that both specific and non specific binding at low k  require disruption of salt bridges as many as  for specific binding whereupon many of the unmasked charged groups hydrate and the cationic groups interact with dna from structural or thermodynamic parallels with ihf we propose that large scale coupling of disruption of protein salt bridges to dna binding is significant for other large interface dna wrapping proteins including the nucleosome lac repressor core tetramer rna polymerase core protein hu and ssb
