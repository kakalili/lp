the pex pex complex is a heterohexameric aaa motor with alternating and highly coordinated subunits
pex and pex are type  aaa atpases required for the de novo biogenesis of peroxisomes mutations in pex and pex account for the majority of the most severe forms of peroxisome biogenesis disorders in humans here we show that the atp dependent complex of pex and pex from saccharomyces cerevisiae is a heterohexamer with alternating subunits within the pex pex complex only the d atpase ring hydrolyzes atp while nucleotide binding in the d ring promotes complex assembly atp hydrolysis by pex is highly coordinated with that of pex  furthermore pex  the membrane anchor required for pex pex recruitment to peroxisomes inhibits the atp hydrolysis activity of pex pex
