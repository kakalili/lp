the crystal structure of e coli rrna pseudouridine synthase rlue
pseudouridine synthase rlue modifies u   in a stem of  s rna in escherichia coli this modification is located in the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome we determined the crystal structures of the c terminal catalytic domain of e coli rlue at     resolution and of full length rlue at     resolution the crystals of the full length enzyme contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit and in both molecules the n terminal domain is disordered the protein has an active site cleft conserved in all other pseudouridine synthases that contains invariant asp and tyr residues implicated in catalysis an electropositive surface patch that covers the active site cleft is just wide enough to accommodate an rna stem the rna substrate stem can be docked to this surface such that the catalytic asp is adjacent to the target base and a conserved arg is positioned to help flip the target base out of the stem into the enzyme active site a flexible rlue specific loop lies close to the conserved region of the stem in the model and may contribute to substrate specificity the stem alone is not a good rlue substrate suggesting rlue makes additional interactions with other regions in the ribosome
