site specific structural variations accompanying tubular assembly of the hiv  capsid protein
the   residue capsid ca protein of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  spontaneously self assembles into tubes with a hexagonal lattice that is believed to mimic the surface lattice of conical capsid cores within intact virions we report the results of solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr measurements on hiv  ca tubes that provide new information regarding changes in molecular structure that accompany ca self assembly local dynamics within ca tubes and possible mechanisms for the generation of lattice curvature this information is contained in site specific assignments of signals in two and three dimensional solid state nmr spectra conformation dependent  n and  c nmr chemical shifts detection of highly dynamic residues under solution nmr conditions measurements of local variations in transverse spin relaxation rates of amide h nuclei and quantitative measurements of site specific  n   n dipole  dipole couplings our data show that most of the ca sequence is conformationally ordered and relatively rigid in tubular assemblies and that structures of the n terminal domain ntd and the c terminal domain ctd observed in solution are largely retained however specific segments including the n terminal  hairpin the cyclophilin a binding loop the inter domain linker segments involved in intermolecular ntd  ctd interactions and the c terminal tail have substantial static or dynamical disorder in tubular assemblies other segments including the   helical segment in ctd undergo clear conformational changes structural variations associated with curvature of the ca lattice appear to be localized in the inter domain linker and intermolecular ntd  ctd interface while structural variations within ntd hexamers around local  fold symmetry axes and in ctd  ctd dimerization interfaces are less significant
