GrpE is the nucleotide exchange factor for the Escherichia coli molecular chaperone DnaK, the prokaryotic homologue of Hsp70. Thermodynamic properties of GrpE structural domains were characterized by examining a number of structural and point mutants using circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and analytical ultracentrifugation. These structural domains are the long paired N-terminal helices, the central four-helix bundle, and the C-terminal compact beta-domains. We show that the central four-helix bundle (tm∼75°C) provides a stable platform for the association of the long paired N-terminal helices (tm∼50°C), which can then function as a temperature sensor. The stability of the N-terminal helices is linked to the presence of the C-terminal compact beta-domains of GrpE, providing a potential mechanism for coupling of DnaK-binding activity of GrpE with temperature. On the basis of our thermodynamic analysis of E.coli GrpE, we present a structure-based model for the melting properties of the nucleotide exchange factor, wherein the long paired helices function as a molecular thermocouple.
