crystal structure of plasmodium falciparum spermidine synthase in complex with the substrate decarboxylated s adenosylmethionine and the potent inhibitors mcha and adodato
plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe type of malaria a life threatening disease affecting the lives of over three billion people factors like widespread resistance against available drugs and absence of an effective vaccine are seriously compounding control of the malaria parasite thus there is an urgent need for the identification and validation of new drug targets the enzymes of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway have been suggested as possible targets for the treatment of malaria one of these enzymes is spermidine synthase spds putrescine aminopropyltransferase  which catalyzes the transfer of an aminopropyl moiety from decarboxylated s adenosylmethionine dcadomet to putrescine leading to the formation of spermidine and   methylthioadenosine here we present the three dimensional structure of p falciparum spermidine synthase pfspds in apo form in complex with dcadomet and two inhibitors s adenosyl   diamino  thio octane adodato and trans  methylcyclohexylamine  mcha  the results show that binding of dcadomet to pfspds stabilizes the conformation of the flexible gatekeeper loop of the enzyme and affects the conformation of the active site amino acid residues preparing the protein for binding of the second substrate the complexes of adodato and mcha with pfspds reveal the mode of interactions of these compounds with the enzyme while adodato essentially fills the entire active site pocket  mcha only occupies part of it which suggests that simple modifications of this compound may yield more potent inhibitors of pfspds
