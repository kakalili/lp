structural insights into yeast dna polymerase  by small angle x ray scattering
dna polymerase   pol  is a multisubunit polymerase that plays an indispensable role in replication from yeast to humans pol  from saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of three subunits pol  pol  and pol  despite the elucidation of the structures and models of the individual subunits or portions thereof  the nature of their assembly remains unclear we present here a small angle x ray scattering analysis of a yeast pol  complex pol t composed of pol  pol  and pol n amino acids     of pol   from the small angle x ray scattering global parameters and reconstructed envelopes we show that pol t adopts an elongated conformation with a radius of gyration rg of      and a maximal dimension of       we also propose an orientation for the accessory pol   pol n subunits relative to the pol catalytic core that best agrees with the experimental scattering profile the analysis also points to significant conformational variability that may allow pol  to better coordinate its action with other proteins at the replication fork
