scanning force microscopy of the complexes of p  core domain with supercoiled dna edited by m yaniv
we used scanning force microscopy to analyse the interaction of the core domain of the tumor suppressor protein p  p cd amino acid residues  to    with supercoiled dna scdna molecules the complexes were attached to a mica substrate by the divalent cation spreading technique p cd bound to supercoiled plasmid ppgm bearing the consensus sequence   agacatgcctagacatgcct    p con was imaged as a globular complex only one such complex was observed with each scdna molecule in contrast binding to supercoiled pbluescript ii sk  dna lacking the consensus sequence resulted in the appearance of multiple variable size complexes of various sizes on single dna molecules addition of p cd to scdna containing a cruciform forming at  insert resulted in the binding of the protein exclusively at the cruciform the data presented here suggest that p cd can form stable specific and non specific complexes with supercoiled dna molecules albeit of variable multimeric organization
