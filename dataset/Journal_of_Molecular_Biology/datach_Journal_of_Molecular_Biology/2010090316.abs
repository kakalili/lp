allosteric remodelling of the histone h binding pocket in the pygo phd finger triggered by its binding to the b l bcl co factor
the zn coordinated phd fingers of pygopus pygo proteins are critical for  catenin dependent transcriptional switches in normal and malignant tissues they bind to methylated histone h tails assisted by their bcl co factors whose homology domain  hd  binds to the rear phd surface although histone binding residues are identical between the two human pygo paralogs we show here that pygo complexes exhibit slightly higher binding affinities for methylated histone h tail peptides than pygo complexes we solved the crystal structure of the pygo phd  bcl  hd complex which revealed paralog specific interactions in its phd  hd interface that could contribute indirectly to its elevated affinity for the methylated histone h tail interestingly using nmr spectroscopy we discovered that hd binding to phd triggers an allosteric communication with a conserved isoleucine residue that lines the binding channel for histone h threonine  t  the link between the two adjacent binding pockets accommodating histone h alanine  and methylated lysine  respectively this modulates the surface of the t channel providing a plausible explanation as to how bcl co factors binding to pygo phd fingers impact indirectly on their histone binding affinity intriguingly this allosteric modulation of the t channel is propagated through the phd structural core by a highly conserved tryptophan the signature residue defining the phd subclass of zn fingers which suggests that other phd proteins may also be assisted by co factors in their decoding of modified histone h tails
