convergence of experimental computational and evolutionary approaches predicts the presence of a tetrameric form for cd   edited by w baumeister
experimental results using multiple site specific infrared dichroism have shown that when reconstituted into lipid bilayers the orientation of the transmembrane domain of cd   is not compatible with a dimeric right handed model reported previously this model obtained using a computational approach that uses evolutionary data is in agreement with mutagenesis data and homology modelling this suggested that in our experimental conditions the oligomeric state of cd   may not be dimeric we have explored this possibility by performing global searching molecular dynamics simulations assuming different homo oligomeric sizes from  to   in these simulations the helix tilt was restrained to the average helix tilt obtained experimentally     only a left handed tetrameric model was compatible with the experimentally observed tilt and rotational orientation of the helix and was also the lowest energy model amongst the candidate structures obtained furthermore simulations performed using close homologues demonstrate that this model is compatible with evolutionary conservation data finally the pattern of residue conservation in the  family of proteins strongly argues in favour of the presence of a left handed hetero oligomer with an orientation compatible with the tetramer we present these results show that both the known dimeric and the so far undetected tetrameric form may be of functional importance in the cell
