dynamic phenylalanine clamp interactions define single channel polypeptide translocation through the anthrax toxin protective antigen channel
anthrax toxin is an intracellularly acting toxin where sufficient detail is known about the structure of its channel allowing for molecular investigations of translocation the toxin is composed of three proteins protective antigen pa  lethal factor lf  and edema factor ef  the toxin s translocon pa translocates the large enzymes lf and ef across the endosomal membrane into the host cell s cytosol polypeptide clamps located throughout the pa channel catalyze the translocation of lf and ef here we show that the central peptide clamp the  clamp is a dynamic site that governs the overall peptide translocation pathway single channel translocations of a  residue guest  host peptide revealed that there were four states when peptide interacted with the channel two of the states had intermediate conductances of   and   of full conductance with aromatic guest  host peptides the   conducting intermediate oscillated with the fully blocked state a trp guest  host peptide was studied by manipulating its stereochemistry and prenucleating helix formation with a covalent linkage in the place of a hydrogen bond or hydrogen bond surrogate hbs  the trp peptide synthesized with  amino acids translocated more efficiently than peptides synthesized with d or alternating d  amino acids hbs stapled trp peptide exhibited signs of steric hindrance and difficulty translocating however when mutant  clamp f  a channels were tested the hbs peptide translocated normally overall peptide translocation is defined by dynamic interactions between the peptide and  clamp these dynamics require conformational flexibility such that the peptide productively forms both extended chain and helical states during translocation
