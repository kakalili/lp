structure based annotation of a novel sugar isomerase from the pathogenic e coli o  h
prokaryotes can use a variety of sugars as carbon sources in order to provide a selective survival advantage the gene z   found in the pathogenic escherichia coli o  h encodes a  hypothetical  protein of unknown function sequence analysis identified the gene product as a putative member of the cupin superfamily of proteins but no other functional information was known we have determined the crystal structure of the z   protein at     resolution and identified the protein as a novel e coli sugar isomerase ecsi through overall fold analysis and secondary structure matching extensive substrate screening revealed that ecsi is capable of acting on d lyxose and d mannose the complex structure of ecsi with fructose allowed the identification of key active site residues and mutagenesis confirmed their importance the structure of ecsi also suggested a novel mechanism for substrate binding and product release in a cupin sugar isomerase supplementation of a nonpathogenic e coli strain with ecsi enabled cell growth on the rare pentose d lyxose
