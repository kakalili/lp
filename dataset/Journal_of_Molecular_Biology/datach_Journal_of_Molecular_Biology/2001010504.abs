localization of the protein l in the  s subunit and the  s e coli ribosome edited by d e draper
the protein l is found in all ribosomes and is one of the best conserved proteins of this mega dalton complex the protein was localized within both the isolated  s subunit and the  s ribosome of the escherichia coli bacteria with the neutron scattering technique of spin contrast variation l is elongated exposing one end of the protein to the surface of the intersubunit interface of the  s subunit the protein changes its conformation slightly when the  s subunit reassociates with the  s subunit to form a  s ribosome becoming more elongated and moving approximately    into the  s matrix the results support a recent observation that l is essential for the association of the ribosomal subunits and might participate in the binding and translocation of the trnas
