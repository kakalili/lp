structures of chitobiase mutants complexed with the substrate di n acetyl d glucosamine the catalytic role of the conserved acidic pair aspartate   and glutamate   edited by r huber
the catalytic domain of chitobiase   n   acetylhexosaminidase from serratia marcescens is an    tim barrel this enzyme belongs to family  of glycosyl hydrolases in which a conserved amino acid pair aspartate glutamate is present asp  glu   it was proposed that catalysis by this enzyme family is carried out by glutamate   acting as a proton donor and by the acetamido group of the substrate as a nucleophile we investigated the role of asp  and glu  by site directed mutagenesis biochemical characterization and by structural analyses of chitobiase substrate co crystals we found that both residues are essential for chitobiase activity the mutations however led to subtle changes in the catalytic site our results support the model that glu  acts as the proton donor and that asp  acts in several different ways asp  restrains the acetamido group of the substrate in a specific orientation by forming a hydrogen bond with n of the non reduced    sugar in addition this residue participates in substrate binding it is also required for the correct positioning of glu  and may provide additional negative charge at the active site thus these biochemical and structural studies provide a molecular explanation for the functional importance and conservation of these residues
