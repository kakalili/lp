the    resolution crystal structure of the carbamate kinase like carbamoyl phosphate synthetase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus bound to adp confirms that this thermostable enzyme is a carbamate kinase and provides insight into substrate binding and stability in carbamate kinases edited by r huber
carbamoyl phosphate cp  an essential precursor of arginine and the pyrimidine bases is synthesized by cp synthetase cps in three steps the last step the phosphorylation of carbamate is also catalyzed by carbamate kinase ck  an enzyme used by microorganisms to produce atp from adp and cp although the recently determined structures of cps and ck show no obvious mutual similarities a ck like cps reported in hyperthermophilic archaea was postulated to be a missing link in the evolution of cp biosynthesis the    resolution structure of this enzyme from pyrococcus furiosus shows both a subunit topology and a homodimeric molecular organization with a  stranded open  sheet core surrounded by  helices similar to those in ck however the pyrococcal enzyme exhibits many solvent accessible ion pairs an extensive strongly hydrophobic intersubunit surface and presents a bound adp molecule which does not dissociate at   c from the enzyme the adp nucleotide is sequestered in a ridge formed over the c edge of the core sheet at the bottom of a large cavity with the purine ring enclosed in a pocket specific for adenine overall the enzyme structure is ill suited for catalyzing the characteristic three step reaction of cps and supports the view that the ck like cps is in fact a highly thermostable and very slow at   c ck that in the extreme environment of p furiosus may have the new function of making rather than using cp the thermostability of the enzyme may result from the extension of the hydrophobic intersubunit contacts and from the large number of exposed ion pairs some of which form ion pair networks across several secondary structure elements in each enzyme subunit the structure provides the first information on substrate binding and catalysis in cks and suggests that the slow rate at   c is possibly a consequence of slow product dissociation
