de novo synthesis and assembly of rrna into ribosomal subunits during cold acclimation in escherichia coli
during the cold adaptation that follows a cold stress bacterial cells undergo many physiological changes and extensive reprogramming of their gene expression pattern bulk gene expression is drastically reduced while a set of cold shock genes is selectively and transiently expressed the initial stage of cold acclimation is characterized by the establishment of a stoichiometric imbalance of the translation initiation factors ifs ribosomes ratio that contributes to the preferential translation of cold shock transcripts whereas de novo synthesis of the ifs following cold stress has been documented nothing was known concerning the activity of the rrn operons during the cold acclimation period in this work we focus on the expression of the rrn operons and the fate of rrna after temperature downshift we demonstrate that in escherichia coli rrna synthesis does not stop during the cold acclimation phase but continues with greater contribution of the p compared to the p promoter and all seven rrn operons are active although their expression levels change with respect to pre stress conditions eight hours after the      c temperature downshift the newly transcribed rrna represents up to   of total rrna and is preferentially found in the polysomes however with respect to the de novo synthesis of the ifs both rrna transcription and maturation are slowed down drastically by cold stress thereby accounting in part for the stoichiometric imbalance of the ifs ribosomes overall our data indicate that new ribosomes which are possibly suitable to function at low temperature are slowly assembled during cold acclimation
