prolonged ca  and force transients in myosin rlc transgenic mouse fibers expressing malignant and benign fhc mutations
clinical studies have revealed that mutations in the ventricular myosin regulatory light chain rlc lead to the development of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy fhc  an autosomal dominant disease characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy myofibrillar disarray and sudden cardiac death while mutations in other contractile proteins have been studied widely by others there is no report elucidating the mechanism s associated with fhc linked rlc mutations in this study we have assessed the functional consequences of two rlc mutations r q and n k in transgenic mice clinical phenotypes associated with these mutations included inter ventricular hypertrophy abnormal ecg findings and the r q mutation caused multiple cases of premature sudden cardiac death simultaneous measurements of the atpase and force in transgenic skinned papillary muscle fibers from mutated versus control mice showed an increase in the ca  sensitivity of atpase and steady state force only in r q fibers the calculated energy cost or rate of dissociation of force generating myosin cross bridges atpase force ratio plotted as a function of activation state was the same in all groups of fibers both mutations caused prolonged ca  transients in electrically stimulated intact papillary muscles however the r q mutation also resulted in a significantly prolonged force transient our results suggest that the phenotypes of fhc observed in patients harboring these rlc mutations correlate with the extent of physiological changes monitored in transgenic fibers cardiac hypertrophy observed in patients is most likely caused by the activation of compensatory mechanisms ensuing from higher workloads due to incomplete relaxation as evidenced by prolonged ca  transients for both n k and r q fibers furthermore the poor prognosis of the r q patients may be associated with more severe diastolic dysfunction due to the slower off rate of ca  from troponin c leading to longer force and ca  transients and increased ca  sensitivity of atpase and force
