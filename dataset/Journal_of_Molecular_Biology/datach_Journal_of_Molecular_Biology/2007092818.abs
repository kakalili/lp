four new crystal structures of tk subtilisin in unautoprocessed autoprocessed and mature forms insight into structural changes during maturation
subtilisin from the hyperthermophilic archaeon thermococcus kodakaraensis tk subtilisin is matured from pro tk subtilisin upon autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide the crystal structures of the autoprocessed and mature forms of tk subtilisin were determined at     and     resolution respectively comparison of these structures with that of unautoprocessed pro tk subtilisin indicates that the structure of tk subtilisin is not seriously changed during maturation however one unique ca  binding site ca  is identified in these structures in addition the n terminal region of the mature domain gly   pro   which binds tightly to the main body in the unautoprocessed form is disordered and mostly truncated in the autoprocessed and mature forms respectively interestingly this site is formed also in the unautoprocessed form when its crystals are soaked with   mm cacl  as revealed by the     structure along with the formation of this site the n terminal region leu   thr  is disordered with the scissile peptide bond contacting with the active site these results indicate that the calcium ion binds weakly to the ca  site in the unautoprocessed form but is trapped upon autoprocessing we propose that the ca  site is required to promote the autoprocessing reaction by stabilizing the autoprocessed form in which the new n terminus of the mature domain is structurally disordered furthermore the crystal structure of the tk propeptide s  a subtilisin complex which was formed by the addition of separately expressed proteins was determined at     resolution this structure is virtually identical with that of the autoprocessed form indicating that the interaction between the two domains is highly intensive and specific
