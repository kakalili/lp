The blood coagulation protein factor XI (FXI) consists of a pair of disulfide-linked chains each containing four apple domains and a catalytic domain. The apple 4 domain (A4; F272–E362) mediates non-covalent homodimer formation even when the cysteine involved in an intersubunit disulfide is mutated to serine (C321S). To understand the role of non-covalent interactions stabilizing the FXI dimer, equilibrium unfolding of wild-type A4 and its C321S variant was monitored by circular dichroism, intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence and dynamic light scattering measurements as a function of guanidine hydrochloride concentration. Global analysis of the unimolecular unfolding transition of wild-type A4 revealed a partially unfolded equilibrium intermediate at low to moderate denaturant concentrations. The optically detected equilibrium of C321S A4 also fits best to a three-state model in which the native dimer unfolds via a monomeric intermediate state. Dimer dissociation is characterized by a dissociation constant, Kd, of ∼90 nM (in terms of monomer), which is in agreement with the dissociation constant measured independently using fluorescence anisotropy. The results imply that FXI folding occurs via a monomeric equilibrium intermediate. This observation sheds light on the effect of certain naturally occurring mutations, such as F283L, which lead to intracellular accumulation of non-native forms of FXI. To investigate the structural and energetic consequences of the F283L mutation, which perturbs a cluster of aromatic side-chains within the core of the A4 monomer, it was introduced into the dissociable dimer, C321S A4. NMR chemical shift analysis confirmed that the mutant can assume a native-like dimeric structure. However, equilibrium unfolding measurements show that the mutation causes a fourfold increase in the Kd value for dissociation of the native dimer and a 1 kcal/mol stabilization of the monomer, resulting in a highly populated intermediate. Since the F283 side-chain does not directly participate in the dimer interface, we propose that the F283L mutation leads to increased dimer dissociation by stabilizing a monomeric state with altered side-chain packing that is unfavorable for homodimer formation.
