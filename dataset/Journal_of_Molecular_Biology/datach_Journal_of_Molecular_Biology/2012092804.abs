structure of the sensor domain of mycobacterium tuberculosis pknh receptor kinase reveals a conserved binding cleft
since their discovery over  years ago eukaryotic like transmembrane receptor ser thr protein kinases stpks have been shown to play critical roles in the virulence growth persistence and reactivation of many bacteria information regarding the signals transmitted by these proteins however remains scarce to enhance understanding of the basis for stpk receptor signaling we determined the    resolution crystal structure of the extracellular sensor domain of the mycobacterium tuberculosis receptor stpk pknh rv  c  the pknh sensor domain adopts an unanticipated fold containing two intramolecular disulfide bonds and a large hydrophobic and polar cleft the residues lining the cleft and those surrounding the disulfide bonds are conserved these results suggest that pknh binds a small molecule ligand that signals by changing the location or quaternary structure of the kinase domain
