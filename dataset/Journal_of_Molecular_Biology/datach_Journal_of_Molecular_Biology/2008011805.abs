modulation of cardiac troponin c function by the cardiac specific n terminus of troponin i influence of pka phosphorylation and involvement in cardiomyopathies
the cardiac specific n terminus of cardiac troponin i ctni is known to modulate the activity of troponin upon phosphorylation with protein kinase a pka by decreasing its ca  affinity and increasing the relaxation rate of the thin filament the molecular details of this modulation have not been elaborated to date we have established that the n terminus and the switch region of ctni bind to cntnc the n domain of cardiac troponin c ctnc  simultaneously and that the pka signal is transferred via the ctni n terminus modulating the cntnc affinity toward ctni     but not toward ca  the kd of cntnc for ctni     was found to be    m in the presence of ctni    and    m in the presence of ctn    pp which can explain the difference in muscle relaxation rates upon the phosphorylation with pka in experiments with cardiac fibers in the light of newly found mutations in cntnc that are associated with cardiomyopathies the important role played by the ctni n terminus in the development of heart disorders emerges the mutants studied l q the n domain of ctnc containing mutation l q and e d d y the n domain of ctnc containing mutation e d d y  demonstrated unchanged ca  affinity per se and in complex with the ctni n terminus ctni    and ctni   pp  the affinity of l q and e d d y toward ctni     was significantly perturbed both alone and in complex with ctni    and ctni   pp which is likely to be responsible for the development of malfunctions
