spontaneous subunit exchange and biochemical evidence for trans autophosphorylation in a dimer of escherichia coli histidine kinase envz
the envz ompr histidyl aspartyl phosphorelay hap system in escherichia coli regulates the expression of ompf and ompc the major outer membrane porin genes in response to environmental osmolarity changes here we report that dimers of envzc the cytoplasmic domain of envz undergo spontaneous subunit exchange in solution by introducing a cysteine substitution s  c in the dimerization domain of envzc we were able to crosslink the two subunits in a dimer and trap the heterodimer formed between two different mutant envzc by using a complementing system with two autophosphorylation defective envzc mutants one containing the h  v mutation at the autophosphorylation site and the other containing the g  a mutation in the atp binding domain we demonstrated that an envzc g  a subunit can be phosphorylated by an envzc h  v subunit only when a heterodimer is formed the rate of subunit exchange is concentration dependent with higher rates at higher concentrations of protein the disulfide crosslinked envzc g  a homodimer could not be phosphorylated by envzc h  v  since the heterodimer formation between the two mutant proteins was blocked indicating that autophosphorylation cannot occur by dimer  dimer interaction by using mbp  l envzc s  c fusion protein  l the linker region spanning residues      was deleted  it was found that in the disulfide crosslinked mbp  l envzc s  c  l envzc s  c g  a heterodimer only the  l envzc s  c g  a subunit was phosphorylated but not the mbp  l envzc s  c subunit together the present results provide biochemical evidence that envz autophosphorylation occurs in trans and only within an envz dimer
