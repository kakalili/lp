new insights into the autoinhibition mechanism of glycogen synthase kinase
it has been suggested that phosphorylation at serine  near the n terminus of glycogen synthase kinase   gsk   mimics the prephosphorylation of its substrate and therefore the n terminus functions as a pseudosubstrate the molecular basis for the pseudosubstrate s binding to the catalytic core and autoinhibition has not been fully defined here we combined biochemical and computational analyses to identify the potential residues within the n terminus and the catalytic core engaged in autoinhibition of gsk   bioinformatic analysis found arg  arg  and ser in the pseudosubstrate sequence to be extremely conserved through evolution mutations at arg and arg to alanine enhanced gsk   kinase activity and impaired its ability to autophosphorylate at ser  in addition and unlike wild type gsk   these mutants were unable to undergo autoinhibition by phosphorylated ser  we further show that gln  and asn  located within the catalytic core interact with the pseudosubstrate mutation at these sites prevented inhibition by phosphorylated ser  furthermore the respective mutants were not inhibited by a phosphorylated pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor finally computational docking of the pseudosubstrate into the catalytic active site of the kinase suggested specific interactions between arg and asn  and of arg to asp   apart from the interaction of phosphorylated serine  with the  phosphate binding pocket   altogether our study supports a model of gsk   pseudosubstrate autoregulation that involves phosphorylated ser  arg  and arg within the n terminus and identified the specific contact sites within the catalytic core
