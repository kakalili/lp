The viral envelope glycoprotein gp41 mediates membrane fusion in HIV/SIV infection. gp41 ectodomain (e-gp41, residues 27-149), which was shown to interact with phospholipid membranes, exists in an equilibrium between the monomeric and trimeric states. Here, we analyzed, by intrinsic Trp fluorescence and resonance energy transfer, whether SIV e-gp41-membrane interaction depends on the gp41 oligomeric state. We found that both gp41 monomers and trimers bind membranes, with the monomersâ€™ full binding being reached at substantially lower lipid to protein ratios. Furthermore, the different characteristics of the Trp fluorescence of monomers and trimers enabled us to detect binding of each form at concentrations at which both species were present. CD spectroscopy revealed that the secondary structure of gp41 monomers does not change upon membrane binding, suggesting that membrane-bound monomeric-gp41 is a possible target for DP-178, a potent peptide inhibitor of HIV infection. The consequences of the interaction between monomeric and trimeric gp41 with membranes in HIV/SIV infection, its inhibition, and its associated neuropathologies are discussed.
