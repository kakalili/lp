crystal structure of aclacinomycin  hydroxylase a s adenosyl l methionine dependent methyltransferase homolog involved in anthracycline biosynthesis in streptomyces purpurascens
anthracyclines are aromatic polyketide antibiotics and several of these compounds are widely used as anti tumor drugs in chemotherapy aclacinomycin  hydroxylase rdmb is one of the tailoring enzymes that modify the polyketide backbone in the biosynthesis of these metabolites rdmb a s adenosyl l methionine dependent methyltransferase homolog catalyses the hydroxylation of  demethoxy  rhodomycin to  rhodomycin one step in rhodomycin biosynthesis in streptomyces purpurascens the crystal structure of rdmb determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction to    resolution reveals that the enzyme subunit has a fold similar to methyltransferases and binds s adenosyl l methionine the n terminal domain which consists almost exclusively of  helices is involved in dimerization the c terminal domain contains a typical    nucleotide binding fold which binds s adenosyl l methionine and several of the residues interacting with the cofactor are conserved in o methyltransferases adjacent to the s adenosyl l methionine molecule there is a large cleft extending to the enzyme surface of sufficient size to bind the substrate analysis of the putative substrate binding pocket suggests that there is no enzymatic group in proximity of the substrate  demethoxy  rhodomycin which could assist in proton abstraction and thus facilitate methyl transfer the lack of a suitably positioned catalytic base might thus be one of the features responsible for the inability of the enzyme to act as a methyltransferase
