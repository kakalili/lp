cholesterol promotes the interaction of alzheimer  amyloid monomer with lipid bilayer
cholesterol in the plasma membrane plays an important role in the pathogenesis of alzheimer s disease but the exact function of cholesterol in the regulation of amyloid   a  generation aggregation and toxicity remains elusive to gain insight into the bioactivity of cholesterol we investigate the effect of cholesterol levels on the interaction of a     monomer with the zwitterionic  palmitoyl  oleoylphosphatidylcholine popc bilayer containing different mole fractions of cholesterol from      to   using all atom molecular dynamics simulations simulation results show that an increased cholesterol level alters the structure dynamics and surface chemistry of the lipid bilayer leading to increased bilayer thickness hydrophobic chain order surface hydrophobicity and decreased lipid mobility all these effects significantly promote the binding of a  to the lipid bilayer mechanistically the adsorption of a  on the bilayer is a cooperative process first charged residues act as anchors to establish the initial binding of a  to phosphate headgroups of the bilayer driven by electrostatic interactions which further facilitates hydrophobic residues to reside on the bilayer once hydrophobic residues especially from c terminus are locked on the bilayer the interactions among charged residues lipid bilayer and calcium ions are optimized to provide additional attractive forces to stabilize a  adsorbed on or inserted into the lipid bilayer inclusion of cholesterol makes this binding process more energetically favorable upon adsorption on the bilayer a  appears to preferentially adopt  helical or unstructured conformation this work supports that cholesterol acts as a promoter for a    membrane interactions which would facilitate a  aggregation and membrane insertion
