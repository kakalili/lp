interactions of translation factor ef g with the bacterial ribosome before and after mrna translocation
a conserved translation factor known as ef g in bacteria promotes the translocation of trna and mrna in the ribosome during protein synthesis here ef g ribosome complexes in two intermediate states before and after mrna translocation have been probed with hydroxyl radicals generated from free fe ii edta before mrna translocation and gtp hydrolysis ef g protected a limited set of nucleotides in both subunits of the ribosome from cleavage by hydroxyl radicals in this state an extensive set of nucleotides in the platform and head domains of the  s subunit and in the l l  stalk region of the  s subunit became more exposed to hydroxyl radical attack suggestive of conformational changes in these domains following mrna translocation ef g protected a larger set of nucleotides  s rrna helices h  h  h  and h   s rrna helices h and h   no nucleotide with enhanced reactivity to hydroxyl radicals was detected in this latter state both before and after mrna translocation ef g protected identical nucleotides in h and h  of the  s subunit these results suggest that h and h  may remain associated with ef g during the dynamic course of the translocation mechanism nucleotides in h  and h  of the  s subunit were protected only after translocation and gtp hydrolysis suggesting that these helices interact dynamically with ef g the effects in h  suggest that ef g interacts weakly with h  before mrna translocation and strongly and more extensively with this helix following mrna translocation
