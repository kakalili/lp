apo and calcium bound crystal structures of alpha  giardin an unusual annexin from giardia lamblia
alpha  giardin is a member of the multi gene alpha giardin family in the intestinal protozoan giardia lamblia this gene family shares an ancestry with the annexin super family whose common characteristic is calcium dependent binding to membranes that contain acidic phospholipids several alpha giardins are highly expressed during parasite induced diarrhea in humans despite being a member of a large family of proteins little is known about the function and cellular localization of alpha  giardin although giardins are often associated with the cytoskeleton it has been shown that giardia exhibits high levels of alpha  giardin mrna transcript throughout its life cycle however constitutive over expression of this protein is lethal to the parasite determining the three dimensional structure of an alpha giardin is essential to identifying functional domains shared in the alpha giardin family here we report the crystal structures of the apo and ca  bound forms of alpha  giardin the first alpha giardin to be characterized structurally crystals of apo and ca  bound alpha  giardin diffracted to     and      respectively the crystal structure of selenium substituted apo alpha  giardin reveals a planar array of four tandem repeats of predominantly  helical domains reminiscent of previously determined annexin structures making this the highest resolution structure of an annexin to date the apo alpha  giardin structure also reveals a hydrophobic core formed between repeats i iv and ii iii a region typically hydrophilic in other annexins surprisingly the ca  bound structure contains only a single calcium ion located in the de loop of repeat i and coordinated differently from the two types of calcium sites observed in previous annexin structures the apo and ca  bound alpha  giardin structures assume overall similar conformations however ca  bound alpha  giardin crystallized in a lower symmetry space group with four molecules in the asymmetric unit vesicle binding studies suggest that alpha  giardin unlike most other annexins does not bind to vesicles composed of acidic phospholipids in a calcium dependent manner
