crystal structure of human cyclin k a positive regulator of cyclin dependent kinase
cyclin k and the closely related cyclins t  t a and t b interact with cyclin dependent kinase  cdk  forming multiple nuclear complexes referred to collectively as positive transcription elongation factor b p tefb  through phosphorylation of the c terminal domain of the rna polymerase ii largest subunit distinct p tefb species regulate the transcriptional elongation of specific genes that play central roles in human physiology and disease development including cardiac hypertrophy and human immunodeficiency virus  pathogenesis we have determined the crystal structure of human cyclin k residues      at     resolution which represents the first atomic structure of a p tefb subunit the cyclin k fold comprises two typical cyclin boxes with two short helices preceding the n terminal box a prominent feature of cyclin k is an additional helix h a in the first cyclin box that obstructs the binding pocket for the cell cycle inhibitor p kip  modeling of cdk bound to cyclin k provides insights into the structural determinants underlying the formation and regulation of this complex a homology model of human cyclin t generated using the cyclin k structure as a template reveals that the two proteins have similar structures as expected from their high level of sequence identity nevertheless their cdk interacting surfaces display significant structural differences which could potentially be exploited for the design of cyclin targeted inhibitors of the cdk  cyclin k and cdk  cyclin t complexes
