high resolution structure of ybff from escherichia coli k  a unique substrate binding crevice generated by domain arrangement
esterases are one of the most common enzymes and are involved in diverse cellular functions ybff protein from escherichia coli ec ybff belongs to the esterase family for the large substrates palmitoyl coenzyme a and malonyl coenzyme a which are important cellular intermediates for energy conversion and biomolecular synthesis to obtain molecular information on ybff esterase which is found in a wide range of microorganisms we elucidated the crystal structures of ec ybff in complexes with small molecules at resolutions of   and      respectively the structure of ec ybff is composed of a globular    hydrolase domain with a three helical bundle cap which is linked by a kinked helix to the    hydrolase domain it contains a catalytic tetrad of ser his asp ser with the first ser acting as a nucleophile the unique spatial arrangement and orientation of the helical cap with respect to the    hydrolase domain form a substrate binding crevice for large substrates the helical cap is also directly involved in catalysis by providing a substrate anchor viz  the conserved residues of arg  and tyr   the high resolution structure of ec ybff shows that the inserted helical bundle structure and its spatial orientation with respect to the    hydrolase domain are critical for creating a large inner space and constituting a specific active site thereby providing the broad substrate spectrum toward large biomolecules
