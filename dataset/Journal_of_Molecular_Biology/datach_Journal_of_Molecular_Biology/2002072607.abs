a structure for the trimeric mhc class ii associated invariant chain transmembrane domain
the major histocompatibility complex mhc associated invariant chain ii contains a single transmembrane domain that forms trimers ii is involved in the assembly of the mhc and antigen presentation and is thus central to the function of the immune system here we show by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr  ftir spectroscopy that the transmembrane domain is  helical and we provide a structural model of the transmembrane domain obtained by a combination of site specific infrared dichroism and molecular dynamics md simulations this work resolves the backbone structure of a transmembrane peptide by multiple  c   o labelling at ten different residues a second purely computational approach based on md simulations of ii transmembrane homologous sequences yields a similar structure that is consistent with our experimental results the structure presented forms a left handed coiled coil with an average helix tilt of      the residue gln  implicated in trimer formation forms strong interhelical contacts thr  points to the inside of the trimeric coil and forms a network of hydrogen bonds
