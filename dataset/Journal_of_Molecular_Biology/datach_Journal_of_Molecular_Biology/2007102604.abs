structural insight into the constitutive repression function of the nuclear receptor rev erb
the rev erb family is an orphan nuclear receptor acting as a negative regulator of transcription rev erb  and rev erb  are crucial components of the circadian clock and involved in various lipid homeostasis they are unique nuclear receptors that lack the activation function  helix af helix required for ligand dependent activation by other members of nuclear receptors here we report the crystal structure of rev erb  nr d  in a dimeric arrangement the putative ligand binding pocket lbp of rev erb  is filled with bulky hydrophobic residues resulting in a residual cavity size that is too small to allow binding of any known ligand molecules however an alternative conformation of the putative lbp observed in another crystal form suggests the flexibility of this region the kinked conformation of helix h  allows helix h  to bend toward helix h over the putative ligand binding pocket by filling and closing the cavity with its side chains in the absence of the af helix and a cognate ligand rev erb  appears to stabilize the hydrophobic cluster in the putative ligand binding pocket and provide a structural platform for co repressor binding by adopting the unique geometry of helix h  a suitable conformation for the constitutive repression activity
