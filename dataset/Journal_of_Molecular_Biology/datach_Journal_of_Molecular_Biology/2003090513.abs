sequence optimization for native state stability determines the evolution and folding kinetics of a small protein
investigating the relative importance of protein stability function and folding kinetics in driving protein evolution has long been hindered by the fact that we can only compare modern natural proteins the products of the very process we seek to understand to each other with no external references or baselines through a large scale all atom simulation of protein evolution we have created a large diverse alignment of sh domain sequences which have been selected only for native state stability with no other influencing factors although the average pairwise identity between computationally evolved and natural sequences is only   the residue frequency distributions of the computationally evolved sequences are similar to natural sh sequences at   of the positions in the domain suggesting that optimization for the native state structure has dominated the evolution of natural sh domains additionally the positions which play a consistent role in the transition state of three well characterized sh domains by phi value analysis are structurally optimized for the native state and vice versa indeed we see a specific and significant correlation between sequence optimization for native state stability and conservation of transition state structure
