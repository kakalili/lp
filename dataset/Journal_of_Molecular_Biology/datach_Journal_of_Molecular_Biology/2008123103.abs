generation affinity maturation and characterization of a human anti human nkg d monoclonal antibody with dual antagonistic and agonistic activity
in humans nkg d is an activating receptor on natural killer nk cells and a costimulatory receptor on certain t cells and plays a central role in mediating immune responses in autoimmune diseases infectious diseases and cancer monoclonal antibodies that antagonize or agonize immune responses mediated by human nkg d are considered to be of broad and potent therapeutic utility nonetheless monoclonal antibodies to nkg d that are suitable for clinical investigations have not been published yet here we describe the generation affinity maturation and characterization of a fully human monoclonal antibody to human nkg d using phage display technology based on a newly generated na ve human fab library in phage display vector pc c followed by a tandem chain shuffling process designed for minimal deviation from natural human antibody sequences we selected a human fab designated kyk   with high specificity and affinity to human nkg d kyk   fab blocked the binding of the natural human nkg d ligands mica micb and ulbp as potently as a commercially available mouse anti human nkg d monoclonal antibody in immunoglobulin g igg format conversion of kyk   fab to igg resulted in subnanomolar avidity for human nkg d kyk   igg was found to selectively recognize defined subpopulations of human lymphocytes known to express nkg d that is the majority of human cd  cd   and cd  cells as well as a small fraction of human cd  cells in solution kyk   igg interfered with the cytolytic activity of ex vivo expanded human nk cells by contrast immobilized kyk   igg was found to strongly induce human nk cell activation the dual antagonistic and agonistic activity promises a wide range of therapeutic applications for kyk   igg and its derivatives
