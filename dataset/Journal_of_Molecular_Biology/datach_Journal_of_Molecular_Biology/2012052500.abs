anti lrp lr specific antibody igg is  significantly reduces adhesion and invasion of metastatic lung cervix colon and prostate cancer cells
the  kda  kda laminin receptor laminin receptor precursor high affinity laminin receptor lrp lr  is thought to play a major role in invasion and adhesion key components of metastatic cancer lung cancer cervical cancer colon cancer and prostate cancer are among the top  cancer types worldwide here we report that lrp lr levels on the surface of lung cancer cells cervical cancer cells colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells are significantly increased compared to non tumorigenic fibroblasts adhesion of lung cancer cells cervical cancer cells colon cancer cells and prostate cancer cells to laminin  is significantly reduced employing the anti lrp lr specific antibody igg is  invasion of these cell lines into the matrigel  matrix was significantly impeded with igg is  the pearson s correlation coefficient proves a correlation between lrp lr cell surface levels and invasion potential as well as adhesion and invasion respectively our findings suggest that igg is  antibody might act as alternative therapeutic tool for treatment of various metastatic cancer types
