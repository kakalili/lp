backbone dynamics of escherichia coli thioesterase protease i evidence of a flexible active site environment for a serine protease edited by m f summers
escherichia coli thioesterase protease i tep i is a member of a novel subclass of the lipolytic enzymes with a distinctive gdsls motif in addition to possessing thioesterase and protease activities tep i also exhibits arylesterase activity we have determined the  n nuclear magnetic spin relaxation rates r and r  and the steady state h  n heteronuclear overhauser effect measured at both    t and    t of u  n tep i these data were analyzed using model free formalism with axially symmetric rotational diffusion anisotropy to extract the backbone dynamics of tep i the results reveal that the core structure of the central  sheet and the long  helices are rigid while the binding pocket appears to be rather flexible the rigid core serves as a scaffold to anchor the essential loops which form the binding pocket the most flexible residues display large amplitude fast ps ns time scale motion and lie on one stripe whose orientation is presumed to be the ligand binding orientation we also detected the presence of several residues displaying slow  s ms time scale conformational exchanging processes these residues lie around the binding pocket and are oriented perpendicularly to the orientation of the flexible stripe two of the putative catalytic triads ser  and his   and their neighbors show motion on the  s ms time scale suggesting that their slow motion may have a role in catalysis in addition to their possible roles in ligand binding the presence of a flexible substrate binding pocket may also facilitate binding to a wide range of substrates and confer the versatile functional property of this protein
