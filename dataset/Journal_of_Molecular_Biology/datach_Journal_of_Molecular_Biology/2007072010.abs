differential effects of phosphorylation on dna binding properties of n oct  are dictated by protein dna complex structures
n oct  a transcription factor member of the pou protein family is implicated in normal central nervous system development but also in melanoma growth its dna binding domain dbd comprises two subdomains pous and pouh joined by a linker peptide we have previously shown that n oct  can interact with the already described pore and more dna motifs but also with a new structural element we have termed nore having observed that both the pore and nore dna association modes depend on a strong anchoring of the pouh subdomain rigid arm into the dna target minor groove in contrast to the more mode we have formulated the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the conserved ser  residue located in the n oct  pouh arm could lead to differential results in dna binding according to the type of target here we demonstrate that in vitro ser  is phosphorylated by protein kinase a pka  either purified or contained in melanoma   mel nuclear extract and that this phosphorylation indeed significantly reduced n oct  dbd binding to pore and nore motifs most likely by hampering the pouh rigid arm insertion in the dna minor groove conversely no effect was observed on the binding of n oct  dbd to more sequences finally once bound to its dna targets n oct  dbd is less susceptible to pka activity we conclude that transcription of genes exhibiting a more motif in their promoter should be less affected by n oct  phosphorylation than that of genes switched on by pore or nore sequences
