high resolution x ray crystal structures of human  d crystallin     and the r h mutant     associated with aculeiform cataract
several human cataracts have been linked to mutations in the  crystallin gene one of these is the aculeiform cataract which is caused by an r h mutation in  d crystallin we have shown previously that this cataract is caused by crystallization of the mutant protein which is an order of magnitude less soluble than the wild type here we report the very high resolution crystal structures of the mutant and wild type proteins both proteins crystallize in the same space group and lattice thus a strict comparison of the protein  protein and protein  water intermolecular interactions in the two crystal lattices is possible overall the differences between the mutant and wild type structures are small at position   the mutant protein loses the direct ion pair intermolecular interaction present in the wild type due to the differences between histidine and arginine at the atomic level the interaction in the mutant is mediated by water molecules away from the mutation site the mutant and wild type lattice structures differ in the identity of side chains that occupy alternate conformations since the interactions in the crystal phase are very similar for the two proteins we conclude that the reduction in the solubility of the mutant is mainly due to the effect of the r h mutation in the solution phase the results presented here are also important as they are the first high resolution x ray structures of human  crystallins
