topological frustration in   repeat proteins sequence diversity modulates the conserved folding mechanisms of     sandwich proteins
the thermodynamic hypothesis of anfinsen postulates that structures and stabilities of globular proteins are determined by their amino acid sequences chain topology however is known to influence the folding reaction in that motifs with a preponderance of local interactions typically fold more rapidly than those with a larger fraction of nonlocal interactions together the topology and sequence can modulate the energy landscape and influence the rate at which the protein folds to the native conformation to explore the relationship of sequence and topology in the folding of   repeat proteins which are dominated by local interactions we performed a combined experimental and simulation analysis on two members of the flavodoxin like      sandwich fold spo f and the n terminal receiver domain of ntrc nt ntrc have similar topologies but low sequence identity enabling a test of the effects of sequence on folding experimental results demonstrated that both response regulator proteins fold via parallel channels through highly structured submillisecond intermediates before accessing their cis prolyl peptide bond containing native conformations global analysis of the experimental results preferentially places these intermediates off the productive folding pathway sequence sensitive g  model simulations conclude that frustration in the folding in spo f corresponding to the appearance of the off pathway intermediate reflects competition for intra subdomain van der waals contacts between its n and c terminal subdomains the extent of transient premature structure appears to correlate with the number of isoleucine leucine and valine ilv side chains that form a large sequence local cluster involving the central  sheet and helices      and   the failure to detect the off pathway species in the simulations of nt ntrc may reflect the reduced number of ilv side chains in its corresponding hydrophobic cluster the location of the hydrophobic clusters in the structure may also be related to the differing functional properties of these response regulators comparison with the results of previous experimental and simulation analyses on the homologous chey argues that prematurely folded unproductive intermediates are a common property of the   repeat motif
