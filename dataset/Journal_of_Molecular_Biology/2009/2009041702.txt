Antibodies contain a conserved glycosylation site that has emerged as a target for the modulation of antibody effector functions. The crystal structure of a biosynthetic intermediate of human IgG1, bearing immature oligomannose-type glycans and reported to display increased antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, demonstrates that glycan engineering can bias the Fc to an open conformation primed for receptor binding.
