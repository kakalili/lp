intra chain d segment swapping spawns the evolution of new multidomain protein architectures
multidomain proteins form in evolution through the concatenation of domains but structural domains may comprise multiple segments of the chain in this work we demonstrate that new multidomain architectures can evolve by an apparent three dimensional swap of segments between structurally similar domains within a single chain monomer by a comprehensive structural search of the current protein data bank pdb  we identified  well defined segment swapped proteins ssps belonging to  structural families nearly   of all multidomain proteins in the pdb may have a segment swapped evolutionary precursor as estimated by more permissive searching criteria the formation of ssps can be explained by two principal evolutionary mechanisms  i domain swapping and fusion dsf and ii circular permutation cp  by large scale comparative analyses using structural alignment and hidden markov model methods it was found that the majority of ssps have evolved via the dsf mechanism and a much smaller fraction via cp functional analyses further revealed that segment swapping which results in two linkers connecting the domains may impart directed flexibility to multidomain proteins and contributes to the development of new functions thus inter domain segment swapping represents a novel general mechanism by which new protein folds and multidomain architectures arise in evolution and ssps have structural and functional properties that make them worth defining as a separate group
