conformational flexibility of b dna at     resolution d ccagtactgg  edited by i tinoco
the affinity and specificity of a ligand for its dna site is a function of the conformational changes between the isolated and complexed states although the structures of a hydroxypyrrole imidazole pyrrole polyamide dimer with   ccagtactgg   and the trp repressor recognizing the sequence   gtact   are known the baseline conformation of the dna site would contribute to our understanding of dna recognition by these ligands the     resolution structure of a b dna double helix    ccagtactgg    has been determined by x ray crystallography six of the nine phosphates two of four bound calcium ions and networks of water molecules hydrating the oligonucleotide have alternate conformations by contrast nine of the ten bases have a single unique conformation with hydrogen atoms visible in most cases the polyamide molecules alter the geometry of the phosphodiester backbone and the water molecules mediating contacts in the trp repressor operator complex are conserved in the unliganded dna furthermore the multiple conformational states ions and hydration revealed by this ultrahigh resolution structure of a b form oligonucleotide are potentially general considerations for understanding dna binding affinity and specificity by ligands
