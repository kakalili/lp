distinct acidic clusters and hydrophobic residues in the alternative splice domains x and x of   integrins define specificity for laminin isoforms
the binding specificity of    integrins for different laminin isoforms is defined by the x and x splice domains located in the beta propeller domain of the   subunit in order to gain insight into the mechanism of specific laminin  integrin interactions we defined laminin binding epitopes of the  x and x domains by single amino acid substitutions and domain swapping between x and x  the interaction of mutated recombinantly prepared  x   and  x   heterodimers with various laminin isoforms was studied by surface plasmon resonance and solid phase binding assays the data show that distinct clusters of surface exposed acidic residues located in different positions of the x and the x loops are responsible for the specific recognition of laminins these residues are conserved between the respective x or x splice domains of the   chains of different species some also in the corresponding x x splice domains of   integrin interestingly ligand binding was also modulated by mutating surface exposed hydrophobic residues   x l    x y   at positions corresponding to the fibronectin binding synergy site in    integrin mutations in x that affected binding to laminin  also affected binding to laminin  and   but not to the same extent thus allowing conclusions on the specific role of individual surface epitopes in the selective recognition of laminin  versus laminins  and   the role of the identified epitopes was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations of wild type integrins and several inactivating mutations the analysis of laminin isoform interactions with various x x chimaera lend further support to the key role of negative surface charges and pointed to an essential contribution of the n terminal tarvel sequence of the x domain for recognition of laminin  and   in conclusion specific surface epitopes containing charged and hydrophobic residues are essential for ligand binding and define specific interactions with laminin isoforms
