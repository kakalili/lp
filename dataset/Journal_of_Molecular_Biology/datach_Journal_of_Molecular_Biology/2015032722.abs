unconventional secretion of fibroblast growth factor   a novel type of protein translocation across membranes
n terminal signal peptides are a hallmark of the vast majority of soluble secretory proteins that are transported along the endoplasmic reticulum golgi dependent pathway they are recognized by signal recognition particle a process that initiates membrane translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum followed by vesicular transport to the cell surface and release into the extracellular space beyond this well established mechanism of protein secretion from eukaryotic cells a number of extracellular proteins with critical physiological functions in immune surveillance and tissue organization are known to be secreted in a manner independent of signal recognition particle such processes have collectively been termed  unconventional protein secretion  and while known for more than two decades their underlying mechanisms are only beginning to emerge different types of unconventional secretory mechanisms have been described with the best characterized example being based on direct translocation of cytoplasmic proteins across plasma membranes the aim of this review is to critically assess our current knowledge of this type of unconventional secretion focusing on fibroblast growth factor  fgf  as the most established example
