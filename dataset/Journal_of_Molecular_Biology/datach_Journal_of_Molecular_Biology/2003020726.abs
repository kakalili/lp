sequence dependent nucleosome structural and dynamic polymorphism potential involvement of histone h b n terminal tail proximal domain
relaxation of nucleosomes on an homologous series pbr of ca     bp dna minicircles originating from plasmid pbr  was recently used as a tool to study their structure and dynamics these nucleosomes thermally fluctuated between three distinct dna conformations within a histone n terminal tail modulated equilibrium one conformation was canonical with   turn wrapping and negatively crossed entering and exiting dnas another was also  closed   but with these dnas positively crossed and the third was  open   with a lower than   turn wrapping and uncrossed dnas in this work a new minicircle series  s of similar size was used which contained the s nucleosome positioning sequence results showed that dna in pbr nucleosomes was untwisted by    turn relative to s nucleosomes which dnase i footprinting confirmed in revealing a   bp untwisting at each of the two dyad distal sites where h b n terminal tails pass between the two gyres in contrast both nucleosomes showed untwistings at the dyad proximal sites i e on the other gyre which were also observed in the high resolution crystal structure  s nucleosomes also differ with respect to their dynamics they hardly accessed the positively crossed conformation but had an easier access to the negatively crossed conformation simulation showed that such reverse effects on the conformational free energies could be simply achieved by slightly altering the trajectories of entering and exiting dnas we propose that this is accomplished by h b tail untwisting at the distal sites through action at a distance    bp on h tail interactions with the small groove at the nucleosome entry  exit these results may help to gain a first glimpse into the two perhaps most intriguing features of the high resolution structure the alignment of the grooves on the two gyres and the passage of h b and h n terminal tails between them
