crystal structures of nucleosome core particles containing the      strong positioning sequence
nucleosome positioning plays a key role in genomic regulation by defining histone  dna context and by modulating access to specific sites moreover the histone  dna register influences the double helix structure which in turn can affect the association of small molecules and protein factors analysis of genomic and synthetic dna has revealed sequence motifs that direct nucleosome positioning in vitro thus establishing the basis for the dna sequence dependence of positioning would shed light on the mechanics of the double helix and its contribution to chromatin structure in vivo however acquisition of well diffracting nucleosome core particle ncp crystals is extremely dependent on the dna fragment used for assembly and all previous ncp crystal structures have been based on human  satellite sequences here we describe the crystal structures of xenopus ncps containing one of the strongest known histone octamer binding and positioning sequences the so called      dna two distinct   bp   crystal forms display the same histone  dna register which coincides with the occurrence of dna stretching  overtwisting in both halves of the particle around five double helical turns from the nucleosome center giving the dna an  effective length  of   bp as we have found previously with stretching around two turns from the nucleosome center for a centromere based sequence the terminal stretching observed in the   constructs is associated with extreme kinking into the minor groove at purine  purine pyrimidine  pyrimidine dinucleotide steps in other contexts these step types display an overall nonflexible behavior which raises the possibility that dna stretching in the nucleosome or extreme distortions in general have unique sequence dependency characteristics our findings indicate that dna stretching is an intrinsically predisposed site specific property of the nucleosome and suggest how ncp crystal structures with diverse dna sequences can be obtained
