ape incision activity at abasic sites in tandem repeat sequences
repetitive dna sequences such as those present in microsatellites and minisatellites telomeres and trinucleotide repeats linked to fragile x syndrome huntington disease etc  account for nearly   of the human genome these domains exhibit enhanced susceptibility to oxidative attack to yield base modifications strand breaks and abasic sites have a propensity to adopt non canonical dna forms modulated by the positions of the lesions and when not properly processed can contribute to genome instability that underlies aging and disease development knowledge on the repair efficiencies of dna damage within such repetitive sequences is therefore crucial for understanding the impact of such domains on genomic integrity in the present study using strategically designed oligonucleotide substrates we determined the ability of human apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease  ape  to cleave at apurinic apyrimidinic ap sites in a collection of tandem dna repeat landscapes involving telomeric and cag ctg repeat sequences our studies reveal the differential influence of domain sequence conformation and ap site location relative positioning on the efficiency of ape binding and strand incision intriguingly our data demonstrate that ape endonuclease efficiency correlates with the thermodynamic stability of the dna substrate we discuss how these results have both predictive and mechanistic consequences for understanding the success and failure of repair protein activity associated with such oxidatively sensitive conformationally plastic dynamic repetitive dna domains
