multistep kinetics of the u a  sl rna complex dissociation
the u a  sl rna complex is a model system for studying interactions between rna and the rna recognition motif rrm  which is one of the most common rna binding domains we report here kinetic studies of dissociation of the u a  sl rna complex using laser temperature jump and stopped flow fluorescence methods with u a proteins labeled with the intrinsic chromophore tryptophan an analysis of the kinetic data suggests three phases of dissociation with time scales of      s     ms and    s we propose that the first step of dissociation is a fast rearrangement of the complex to form a loosely bound complex the intermediate step is assigned to be the dissociation of the u a  sl rna complex and the final step is assigned to a reorganization of the u a protein structure into the conformation of the free protein these assignments are consistent with previous proposals based on thermodynamic nmr and surface plasmon resonance experiments and molecular dynamics simulations together these results begin to build a comprehensive model of the complex dynamic processes involved in the formation and dissociation of an rrm  rna complex
