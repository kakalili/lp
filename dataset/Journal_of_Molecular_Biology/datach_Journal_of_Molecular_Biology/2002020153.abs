selection of large diversities of antiidiotypic antibody fragments by phage display edited by j karn
antiidiotypic antibodies ab  are needed as tools for a better understanding of molecular mimicry and the immunological network and for many potential applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical field antiidiotypic antibodies mimicking carbohydrate or conformational epitopes ab   are of considerable interest as surrogate immunogens for cancer vaccination however it has so far been difficult and tedious to produce ab s to a given antigen here we describe a fast and reliable technique for generating large diversities of antiidiotypic single chain antibody fragments from non immunized phagemid libraries using phage display key elements are a specific elution with the original antigen followed by trypsin treatment of the eluted phages in combination with the protease sensitive helperphage km  this novel method was compared with various conventional selection and elution methods including specific elution with or without trypsin treatment elution with glycine at ph   with or without trypsin treatment and elution by trypsin treatment only the results clearly show that specific elution in combination with trypsin treatment of the eluted phages is by far superior to the other conventional methods enabling for the first time the generation of a large variety of ab s after only two to three rounds of selection thereby maintaining maximum diversity we obtained  to  antiidiotypes out of  tested clones after two to three rounds of selection with a diversity of      this was achieved for two carbohydrate di  and tetrasaccharides and one conformational protein epitope using two large na  ve libraries and their corresponding monoclonal ab  the antiidiotypic nature of the selected scfv phages was verified by elisa and immunocytochemistry inhibition experiments
