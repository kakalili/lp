specificity of mammalian y box binding protein p  in interaction with ss and ds dna analyzed with generic oligonucleotide microchip
p  protein is a member of the y box binding transcription factor family and is a counterpart of yb  protein the generic microchip was used to analyze the sequence specificity of p  binding to single ss and double stranded ds oligodeoxyribonucleotides the generic microchip contained   single stranded octadeoxyribonucleotides in which all possible core  mers      were flanked at their   and   ends with degenerated nucleotides the oligonucleotides were chemically immobilized within polyacrylamide gel pads fixed on a glass slide the binding of p  to the generic microchip was shown to be the most specific to ss gggg motif and then to ss cacc and catc motifs gc rich ds oligonucleotides of the generic microchip and particularly those containing ggtg cacc gatg catc and gtgg ccac heterogeneous motifs were most efficiently destabilized due to interaction with p  gel shift electrophoresis has shown that the protein exhibits much higher binding specificity to  mer oligoa tggggg oligoa containing g rich  mer in comparison with  mer oligoa aaatat oligoa carrying a t rich  mer in full correspondence with the data obtained with the microchip studies of dna binding proteins using gel immobilized ss and ds dna fragments provide a unique possibility to detect low affinity complexes of these proteins with short sequence motifs and assess the role of these motifs in sequence specific interactions with long recognition sites
