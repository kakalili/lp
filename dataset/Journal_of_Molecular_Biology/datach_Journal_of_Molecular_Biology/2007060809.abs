exploration of pairing constraints identifies a  base pair core within box c d snorna  rrna duplexes
o ribose methylation of eukaryotic ribosomal rnas is guided by rna duplexes consisting of rrna and box c d small nucleolar sno rna sequences the methylated sites invariably mapping five positions apart from the d box here we have analyzed the rna duplex pairing constraints by investigating the features of   duplexes from the fungus plant and animal kingdoms and the evolution of those duplexes within the   sets they group into the d box upstream st and   th positions consist of watson  crick base pairs g u base pairs and mismatched bases with ratios close to random assortments these positions display single base differences in gt   of the rna duplex sets the d box upstream nd to  th positions have gt   watson  crick base pairs they display single base mutations with a u shaped distribution of lower values of  and   at the methylated site th and th positions and double compensatory mutations leading to new watson  crick base pairs with an inverted u shaped distribution of higher values at the th to  th positions half of the single mutations at the rd to  th positions resulted in g u base pairing mainly through a  g mutations in the rrna strands and c  t mutations in the snorna strands double compensatory mutations at the rd to  th positions are extremely frequent representing   of all mutations they frequently arose from an a  g mutation in the rrna strands followed by a t  c mutation in the snorna strands differences in the mutational pathways through which the rrna and snorna strand evolved must be related to differences in the rrna and snorna copy number and gene organization altogether these data identify the d box upstream rd to  th positions as box c d snorna  rrna duplex cores the impact of the pairing constraints on the evolution of the  base pair rna duplex cores is discussed
