processing of proteins by the molecular chaperone hsp
the molecular chaperone hsp  is an aaa atpase atpase associated with a variety of cellular activities from yeast that catalyzes protein disaggregation using mutagenesis we impaired nucleotide binding or hydrolysis in the two nucleotide binding domains nbd of hsp  and analyzed the consequences for chaperone function by monitoring atp hydrolysis polypeptide binding polypeptide processing and disaggregation our results reveal that atp binding to nbd serves as a central regulatory switch for the chaperone it triggers binding of polypeptides and stimulates atp hydrolysis in the c terminal nbd by more than two orders of magnitude implying that atp hydrolysis in this domain is important for disaggregation moreover we show that hsp  actively unfolds its polypeptide substrates during processing demonstrating that aaa proteins involved in disaggregation share a common threading mechanism with aaa proteins mediating protein unfolding degradation
