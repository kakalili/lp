structure of selenophosphate synthetase essential for selenium incorporation into proteins and rnas
selenophosphate synthetase sps catalyzes the activation of selenide with adenosine   triphosphate atp to generate selenophosphate the essential reactive selenium donor for the formation of selenocysteine sec and  selenouridine residues in proteins and rnas respectively many sps are themselves sec containing proteins in which sec replaces cys in the catalytically essential position sec cys  we solved the crystal structures of aquifex aeolicus sps and its complex with adenosine       methylene triphosphate ampcpp  the atp binding site is formed at the subunit interface of the homodimer four asp residues coordinate four metal ions to bind the phosphate groups of ampcpp in the free sps structure the two loop regions in the atp binding site are not ordered and no enzyme associated metal is observed this suggests that atp binding metal binding and the formation of their binding sites are interdependent to identify the amino acid residues that contribute to sps activity we prepared six mutants of sps and examined their selenide dependent atp consumption mutational analyses revealed that sec cys  and lys  are essential in sps ampcpp the n terminal loop including the two residues assumes different conformations   open  and  closed   between the two subunits the ampcpp  phosphate group is solvent accessible suggesting that a putative nucleophile could attack the atp  phosphate group to generate selenophosphate and adenosine   diphosphate adp  selenide attached to sec cys  as  se  se    s  se  could serve as the nucleophile in the  closed  conformation a water molecule fixed close to the  phosphate group could function as the nucleophile in subsequent adp hydrolysis to orthophosphate and adenosine   monophosphate
