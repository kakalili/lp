high yield heterologous expression of wild type and mutant ca  atpase characterization of ca  binding sites by charge transfer
high yield heterologous serca  ca  atpase expression was obtained in cos  cells infected with recombinant adenovirus vector radserca  higher transcription and expression were obtained in the presence of a his tag at the amino terminus as compared with a his tag at the carboxyl serca terminus or no tag the expressed protein was targeted extensively to intracellular membranes optimal yield of functional ca  atpase corresponded to   of total protein with phosphoenzyme levels catalytic turnover and ca  transport identical with those of native serca  this recombinant membrane bound detergent free enzyme was used for characterization of ca  binding at the two specific transmembrane sites atp free by measurements of net charge transfer upon ca  binding to the protein yielding cooperative isotherms k        m   and k        m    non cooperative binding of only one ca  and loss of atpase activation were observed following e  mutation at site ii on the other hand as a consequence of the site ii mutation the affinity of site i for ca  was increased k        m    this change was due to a pka shift of site i acidic residues and to contributions of oxygen functions from empty site ii to ca  binding at site i no charge movement was observed following e  q mutation at site i indicating no ca  binding to either site therefore calcium occupancy of site i is required to trigger cooperative binding to site ii and catalytic activation in the presence of millimolar mg  the charge movement upon addition of ca  to wt atpase was reduced by   while it was reduced by   when ca  was added to the e  q a mutants demonstrating that competitive mg  binding can occur at site i but not at site ii
