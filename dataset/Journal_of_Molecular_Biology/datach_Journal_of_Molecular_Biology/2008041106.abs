alanine scanning mutagenesis of anti trap at reveals residues involved in binding to trap
the trp rna binding attenuation protein trap regulates expression of the tryptophan biosynthetic trp genes in response to changes in intracellular levels of free l tryptophan in many gram positive bacteria when activated by binding tryptophan trap binds to the mrnas of several genes involved in tryptophan metabolism and down regulates transcription or translation of these genes anti trap at is an antagonist of trap that binds to tryptophan activated trap and prevents it from binding to its rna targets and thereby up regulates trp gene expression the crystal structure shows that at is a cone shaped trimer at  with the n terminal residues of the three subunits assembled at the apex of the cone and that these trimers can further assemble into a dodecameric at  structure using alanine scanning mutagenesis we found four residues all located on the  top  region of at  that are essential for binding to trap fluorescent labeling experiments further suggest that the top region of at is in close juxtaposition to trap in the at trap complex in vivo studies confirmed the importance of these residues on the top of at in regulating trap mediated gene regulation
