crystal structures of the met  leu and ser asp mutants of rusticyanin from thiobacillus ferrooxidans insights into the structural relationship with the cupredoxins and the multi copper proteins
the crystal structures of the met  leu and ser asp mutants of rusticyanin are presented at   and    resolution respectively both of these structures have two molecules in the asymmetric unit compared to the one present in the crystal form of the native protein this provides an opportunity to investigate intramolecular electron transfer pathways in rusticyanin the redox potential of the met  leu mutant    mv is elevated compared to that of the native protein    mv at ph   while that of the ser asp mutant    mv at ph   is decreased the effect of the ser asp mutation on the hydrogen bonding near the type  cu site is discussed and hence its role in determining acid stability is examined the type  cu site of met  leu mimics the structural and biochemical characteristics of those found in domain ii of ceruloplasmin and fungal laccase moreover the native rusticyanin s cupredoxin core and the type  cu site closely resemble those found in ascorbate oxidase and nitrite reductase structure based phylogenetic trees have been re examined in view of the additional structural data on rusticyanin and fungal laccase we confirm that rusticyanin is in the same class as nitrite reductase domain  laccase domain  and ceruloplasmin domains   and
