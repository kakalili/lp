a novel quasi species of glutathione transferase with high activity towards naturally occurring isothiocyanates evolves from promiscuous low activity variants
glutathione transferases gsts are known as promiscuous enzymes capable of catalyzing the conjugation of glutathione with a broad range of electrophilic substrates a previous study based on recombinant chimeras derived from human gst m  and gst m  demonstrated the formation of a subset of f generation gsts which had lost high activity with substrates distinguishing parental enzymes in the present study the members of this subset were recombined by dna shuffling to produce an f generation of gsts screening of   bacterial clones demonstrated that   of recombinant enzyme variants were active with at least one of three alternative substrates phenethyl isothiocyanate peitc   chloro   dinitrobenzene or p nitrophenyl acetate the majority had similar low activity as the parental gsts in the f generation however   novel enzymes displayed high activity with peitc half of these enzymes were similar to gst m   which also has high activity with the same substrate and all of these gsts featured tyr  ser  in the active site this group of f variants apparently had reverted to the gst m  type a second group of f variants with high peitc activity was characterized by his  in the active site this category represented a new variety of gsts which demonstrated higher selectivity for isothiocyanate substrates than the gst m  type the different groups of gsts can be considered as distinct molecular quasi species each of which comprises variant amino acid sequences the quasi species are structurally distinguished by active site residues that govern their substrate selectivities clearly minimal alterations of the active site can generate enzymes with highly distinctive functional properties
