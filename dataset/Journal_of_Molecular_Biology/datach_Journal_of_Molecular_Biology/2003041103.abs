structural location of disease associated single nucleotide polymorphisms
non synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism nssnp of genes introduces amino acid changes to proteins and plays an important role in providing genetic functional diversity to understand the structural characteristics of disease associated snps we have mapped a set of nssnps derived from the online mendelian inheritance in man omim database to the structural surfaces of encoded proteins these nssnps are disease associated or have distinctive phenotypes as a control dataset we mapped a set of nssnps derived from snp database dbsnp to the structural surfaces of those encoded proteins using the alpha shape method from computational geometry we examine the geometric locations of the structural sites of these nssnps we classify each nssnp site into one of three categories of geometric locations those in a pocket or a void type p  those on a convex region or a shallow depressed region type s  and those that are buried completely in the interior type i  we find that the majority    of disease associated nssnps are located in voids or pockets and they are infrequently observed in the interior of proteins    in the data set  we find that nssnps mapped from dbsnp are less likely to be located in pockets or voids    we further introduce a novel application of hidden markov models hmm for analyzing sequence homology of snps on various geometric sites for snps on surface pocket or void we find that there is no strong tendency for them to occur on conserved residues for snps buried in the interior we find that disease associated mutations are more likely to be conserved the approach of classifying nssnps with alpha shape and hmm developed in this study can be integrated with additional methods to improve the accuracy of predictions of whether a given nssnp is likely to be disease associated
