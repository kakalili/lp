the structural basis for the exo mode of action in gh  oligoxyloglucan reducing end specific cellobiohydrolase
oligoxyloglucan reducing end specific cellobiohydrolase oxg rcbh is a unique exo    glucanase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family   the enzyme recognizes the reducing end of xyloglucan oligosaccharides and releases two glucosyl residue segments from the reducing end of the main chain previously we reported that oxg rcbh consists of two seven bladed  propeller domains there is a large cleft between the two domains and a unique loop encloses one side of the active site cleft here we report the x ray crystal structure of the oxg rcbh substrate complex determined to a resolution of     the substrate bound to the cleft and its reducing end was arranged near the loop region that is believed to impart oxg rcbh with its activity we constructed a deletion mutant of the loop region and conducted a detailed analysis a deletion mutant of the loop region showed endo activity with altered substrate recognition more specifically cleavage occurred randomly instead of at specific sites most likely due to the misalignment of the substrate within the subsite we believe that the loop imparts unique substrate specificity with exo mode hydrolysis in oxg rcbh
