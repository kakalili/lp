signaling states of a short blue light photoreceptor protein ppsb lov revealed from crystal structures and solution nmr spectroscopy
light  oxygen  voltage lov domains represent the photo responsive domains of various blue light photoreceptor proteins and are widely distributed in plants algae fungi and bacteria here we report the dark state crystal structure of ppsb lov a slow reverting short lov protein from pseudomonas putida that is remarkably different from our previously published  fully light adapted  structure   a direct comparison of the two structures provides insight into the light activated signaling mechanism major structural differences involve a   movement of the c terminus in helix j     movement of h   i  loop disruption of hydrogen bonds in the dimer interface and a   rotation of chain b relative to chain a as compared to the light state dimer both crystal structures and solution nmr data are suggestive of the key roles of a conserved glutamine q  and the n cap region consisting of a    a  loop and the a   helix in controlling the light activated conformational changes the activation mechanism proposed here for the ppsb lov supports a rotary switch mechanism and provides insights into the signal propagation mechanism in naturally existing and artificial lov based two component systems and regulators
