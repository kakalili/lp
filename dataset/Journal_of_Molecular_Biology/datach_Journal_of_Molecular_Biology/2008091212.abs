the socs box domain of socs  structure and interaction with the elonginbc cullin ubiquitin ligase
suppressor of cytokine signalling  socs  is responsible for regulating the cellular response to a variety of cytokines including interleukin  and leukaemia inhibitory factor identification of the socs box domain led to the hypothesis that socs can associate with functional e ubiquitin ligases and thereby induce the degradation of bound signalling proteins this model relies upon an interaction between the socs box elonginbc and a cullin protein that forms the e ligase scaffold we have investigated this interaction in vitro using purified components and show that socs binds to elonginbc and cullin with high affinity the socs  elonginbc interaction was further characterised by determining the solution structure of the socs box  elonginbc ternary complex and by deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis of the socs box these studies revealed that conformational flexibility is a key feature of the socs  elonginbc interaction in particular the socs box is disordered in isolation and only becomes structured upon elonginbc association the interaction depends upon the first  residues of the socs box domain and particularly on a deeply buried conserved leucine the socs box when bound to elonginbc binds tightly to cullin with   nm affinity domains upstream of the socs box are not required for elonginbc or cullin association indicating that the socs box acts as an independent binding domain capable of recruiting elonginbc and cullin to promote e ligase formation
