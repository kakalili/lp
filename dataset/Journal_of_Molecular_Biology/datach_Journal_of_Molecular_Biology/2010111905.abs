loop swapped chimeras of the agouti related protein and the agouti signaling protein identify contacts required for melanocortin  receptor selectivity and antagonism
agouti related protein agrp and agouti signaling protein asip are homologs that play critical roles in energy balance and pigmentation respectively by functioning as antagonistic ligands at their cognate melanocortin receptors signaling specificity is mediated in part through receptor binding selectivity brought about by alterations in the cysteine rich carboxy terminal domains of the ligands agrp binds with high affinity to the melanocortin  receptor and the melanocortin  receptor but not to the melanocortin  receptor mc r  whereas asip binds with high affinity to all three receptors this work explores the structural basis for receptor selectivity by studying chimeric proteins developed by interchanging loops between the cysteine rich domain of asip and the cysteine rich domain of agrp binding data demonstrate that melanocortin  receptor responds to all chimeras and is therefore highly tolerant of gross loop changes by contrast mc r responds primarily to those chimeras with a sequence close to that of wild type asip further analysis of binding and functional data suggests that the asip c terminal loop a six amino acid segment closed by the final disulfide bond is essential for high affinity mc r binding and inverse agonism comparison with previously published molecular models suggests that this loop makes contact with the first extracellular loop of mc r through a series of key hydrophobic interactions
