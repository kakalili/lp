structural and functional evidence that nck interaction with cd  regulates t cell receptor activity
recruitment of signaling molecules to the cytoplasmic domains of the cd subunits of the t cell receptor tcr is crucial for early t cell activation these transient associations either do or do not require tyrosine phosphorylation of cd immune tyrosine activation motifs itams  here we show that the non itam requiring adaptor protein nck forms a complex with an atypical pxxdy motif of the cd  tail which encompasses tyr  within the itam and a tcr endocytosis signal as suggested by the structure of the complex we find that nck binding inhibits phosphorylation of the cd  itam by fyn and lck kinases in vitro moreover the cd   nck interaction downregulates tcr surface expression upon physiological stimulation in mouse primary lymph node cells this indicates that nck performs an important regulatory function in t lymphocytes by inhibiting itam phosphorylation and or removing cell surface tcr via cd  interaction
