crystal structures of mutant forms of the bacillus caldolyticus cold shock protein differing in thermal stability edited by c r matthews
the cold shock proteins bc csp from the thermophile bacillus caldolyticus and bs cspb from the mesophile bacillus subtilis differ significantly in their conformational stability although the two proteins differ by only  out of  amino acid residues the three dimensional structure of these small and compact  barrel proteins without disulfide bonds cis proline residues or tightly bound cofactors is very similar previous work has shown that bc csp displays a twofold increase in the free energy of stabilization relative to its homolog bs cspb and indicated that electrostatic interactions are in part responsible for this effect it was further described that the stability difference is almost exclusively due to surface exposed charged residues at sequence positions  and  of bc csp and bs cspb whereas all other amino acid changes between both proteins have no net effect on stability to investigate how two surface residues determine the stability of bc csp arg and leu  were replaced by glutamic acid corresponding to the bs cspb sequence the crystal structures of the resultant protein variants bc csp r e and bc csp l e were determined at    and     resolution and refined to r values of    and     respectively both structures closely resemble bc csp in their global fold and show different hydrogen bonding and salt bridge patterns when two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystal are compared to extend the study to neighbored residues that help determine the surface charge around arg and leu  the mutant proteins bc csp e a bc csp r e e a l e and bc csp v t l e  a were crystallized their structures were determined at resolutions of         and    and refined to r values of        and     respectively a systematic comparison of the crystal structures of all forms of the b caldolyticus cold shock protein shows varying patterns of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions around residues  and   thermal destabilization of the protein by mutation appears to correlate with the extent of an acidic surface patch near the c terminal carboxylate group
