amide h h exchange reveals communication between the camp and catalytic subunit binding sites in the ri  subunit of protein kinase a
the changes in backbone hydrogen deuterium h h exchange in the regulatory subunit ri       of cyclic amp dependent protein kinase a pka were probed by maldi tof mass spectrometry the three naturally occurring states of the regulatory subunit were studied   free ri       which likely represents newly synthesized protein   ri       bound to the catalytic c subunit or holoenzyme and   ri       bound to camp protection from amide exchange upon c subunit binding was observed for the helical subdomain including the a helix and b helix pointing to regions adjacent to those shown to be important by mutagenesis in addition c subunit binding caused changes in observed amide exchange in the distal camp binding pocket conversely camp binding caused protection in the camp binding pocket and increased exchange in the helical subdomain these results suggest that the mutually exclusive binding of either camp or c subunit is controlled by binding at one site transmitting long distance changes to the other site
