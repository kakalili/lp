differential recognition of phosphorylated transactivation domains of p  by different p  domains
histone acetyltransferases form crucial links in transducing extrinsic signals to actual initiation of transcription a multitude of stress signal integrations occur through the interaction of p  with p  phosphorylated at different residues of the transactivation domain how such interactions activate different gene expression programs remains largely unknown p  contains at least five domains that are known to interact with p  but their role in transcription regulation is not known we measured the binding affinity of various phosphorylated transactivation domains towards several p  binding domains of p  by fluorescence anisotropy the binding affinities of different phosphorylated transactivation domains of p  towards different domains of p  vary by several orders of magnitude indicating that interactions of different post translationally modified forms of p  may occur through different domains of p   thus different post translationally modified p  fragments may form transcription initiating complexes of different configurations leading to the activation of different promoters and pathways
