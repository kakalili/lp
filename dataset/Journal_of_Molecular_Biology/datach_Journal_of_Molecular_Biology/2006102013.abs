dcs  a novel stress induced modulator of m gpppx pyrophosphatase activity that locates to p bodies
the eukaryotic  scavenger  type decapping enzyme an m gpppx pyrophosphatase is active in cellular mrna metabolism and thereby influences posttranscriptional gene expression the yeast version of this enzyme dcs  catalyses cleavage of   end m g oligoribonucleotide fragments generated by       exonucleolytic decay and cleavage of m gdp generated by dcp dcp mediated decapping in the       decay pathway we show that dcs is active as a homodimer with low km values for cleavage of m gpppg     m and m gdp     m  previous work showed that the paralogous dcs gene is transcriptionally induced via the amp pka pathway as yeast enters diauxie the resulting dcs protein forms a heterodimer together with dcs  both modulating dcs substrate specificity and suppressing its kcat since dcs is recruited into cytoplasmic p bodies its inhibitory function may be focused in these centres of mrna storage turnover dcs is therefore a novel type of stress induced regulatory protein that modulates m gpppx pyrophosphatase activity moreover inhibition of dcs activity by dcs  like depletion of dcs  reduces chronological life span possibly by modulating m g misincorporation into nucleic acids this could potentially link control of mrna metabolism with senescence
