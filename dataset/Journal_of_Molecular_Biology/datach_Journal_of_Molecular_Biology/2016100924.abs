rna structural modules control the rate and pathway of rna folding and assembly
structured rnas fold through multiple pathways but we have little understanding of the molecular features that dictate folding pathways and determine rates along a given pathway here we asked whether folding of a complex rna can be understood from its structural modules in a two piece version of the tetrahymena group i ribozyme the separated p abc subdomain folds to local native secondary and tertiary structure in a linked transition and assembles with the ribozyme core via three tertiary contacts a kissing loop p   a metal core  receptor interaction and a tetraloop  receptor interaction the first two of which are expected to depend on native p abc structure from the local transition native gel nmr and chemical footprinting experiments showed that mutations that destabilize the native p abc structure slowed assembly up to   fold indicating that p abc folds first and then assembles with the core by conformational selection however rate decreases beyond   fold were not observed because an alternative pathway becomes dominant with nonnative p abc binding the core and then undergoing an induced fit rearrangement p  is formed in the rate limiting step along the conformational selection pathway but after the rate limiting step along the induced fit pathway strikingly the assembly rate along the conformational selection pathway resembles that of an isolated kissing loop similar to p  and the rate along the induced fit pathway resembles that of an isolated tetraloop  receptor interaction our results indicate substantial modularity in rna folding and assembly and suggest that these processes can be understood in terms of underlying structural modules
