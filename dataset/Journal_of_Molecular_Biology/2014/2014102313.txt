The chaperonin GroEL is an essential chaperone that assists in protein folding with the aid of GroES and ATP. GroEL forms a double-ring structure, and both rings can bind GroES in the presence of ATP. Recent progress on the GroEL mechanism has revealed the importance of a symmetric 1:2 GroEL:GroES2 complex (the “football”-shaped complex) as a critical intermediate during the functional GroEL cycle. We determined the crystal structure of the football GroEL:GroES2-ATP14 complex from Escherichia coli at 3.8Å, using a GroEL mutant that is extremely defective in ATP hydrolysis. The overall structure of the football complex resembled the GroES-bound GroEL ring of the asymmetric 1:1 GroEL:GroES complex (the “bullet” complex). However, the two GroES-bound GroEL rings form a modified interface by an ~7° rotation about the 7-fold axis. As a result, the inter-ring contacts between the two GroEL rings in the football complex differed from those in the bullet complex. The differences provide a structural basis for the apparently impaired inter-ring negative cooperativity observed in several biochemical analyses.
