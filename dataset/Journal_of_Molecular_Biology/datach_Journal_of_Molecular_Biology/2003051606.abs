crystal structure of the human cca adding enzyme insights into template independent polymerization
all trna molecules carry the invariant sequence cca at their   terminus for amino acid attachment the post transcriptional addition of cca is carried out by atp ctp trna nucleotidyltransferase also called ccase this enzyme catalyses a unique template independent but sequence specific nucleotide polymerization reaction in order to reveal the molecular mechanism of this activity we solved the crystal structure of human ccase by single isomorphous replacement the structure reveals a four domain architecture with a cluster of conserved residues forming a positively charged cleft between the first two domains structural homology of the n terminal ccase domain to other nucleotidyltransferases could be exploited for modeling a trna  substrate complex the model places the trna   end into the n terminal nucleotidyltransferase site close to a patch of conserved residues that provide the binding sites for ctp and atp based on our results we introduce a corkscrew model for cca addition that includes a fixed active site and a traveling trna binding region formed by flexible parts of the protein
