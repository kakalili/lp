crystal structure of cytoglobin the fourth globin type discovered in man displays heme hexa coordination
cytoglobin is a recently discovered hemeprotein belonging to the globin superfamily together with hemoglobin myoglobin and neuroglobin although distributed in almost all human tissues cytoglobin has not been ascribed a specific function human cytoglobin is composed of   amino acid residues sequence alignments show that a protein core region about   residues is structurally related to hemoglobin and myoglobin being complemented by about  extra residues both on the n and c termini in the absence of exogenous ligands e g o  the cytoglobin distal hise residue is coordinated to the heme fe atom thus decreasing the ligand affinity the crystal structure of human cytoglobin    resolution    r factor highlights a three over three  helical globin fold covering residues      the    n terminal and the      c terminal residue segments are disordered in both molecules of the crystal asymmetric unit heme hexa coordination is evident in one of the two cytoglobin chains whereas alternate conformation for the heme distal region achieving partial heme penta coordination is observed in the other human cytoglobin displays a large apolar protein matrix cavity next to the heme not related to the myoglobin cavities recognized as temporary ligand docking stations the cavity which may provide a heme ligand diffusion pathway is connected to the external space through a narrow tunnel nestled between the globin g and h helices
