quantitative analysis of secyeg mediated insertion of transmembrane  helices into the bacterial inner membrane
most integral membrane proteins both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are co translationally inserted into the membrane via sec type translocons the secyeg complex in prokaryotes and the sec  complex in eukaryotes the contributions of individual amino acids to the overall free energy of membrane insertion of single transmembrane  helices have been measured for sec  mediated insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum er membrane nature         but have not been systematically determined for secyeg mediated insertion into the bacterial inner membrane we now report such measurements carried out in escherichia coli overall there is a good correlation between the results found for the mammalian er and the e coli inner membrane but the hydrophobicity threshold for secyeg mediated insertion is distinctly lower than that for sec  mediated insertion
