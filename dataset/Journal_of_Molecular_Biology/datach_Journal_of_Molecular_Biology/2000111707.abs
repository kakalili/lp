two dna binding sites on the globular domain of histone h are required for binding to both bulk and  s reconstituted nucleosomes edited by t richmond
we have previously shown the existence of two dna binding sites on the globular domain of h  termed gh  both of which are required for nucleosome organisation as judged by the protection of a   bp chromatosome intermediate during micrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin this supports a model in which gh contacts two duplexes on the nucleosome however studies of a nucleosome assembled on the  s rrna gene have argued against the requirement for two dna binding sites for chromatosome protection which has implications for the role of linker histones we have used this proposed difference in the requirement for a second site on the globular domain in the two models as a means of investigating whether bulk and reconstituted  s nucleosomes are indeed fundamentally different gh protects a   bp chromatosome in both  bulk  and  s systems and in both cases protection is abolished when all four basic residues in site ii are replaced by alanine binding to four way dna junctions which present a pair of juxtaposed duplexes is also abolished single mutations of the basic residues did not abolish chromatosome protection in either system or binding to four way junctions suggesting that the residues function as a cluster both bulk and  s nucleosomes thus require a functional second dna binding site on gh in order to bind properly to the nucleosome this is likely to reflect a similar mode of binding in each case in which two dna duplexes are contacted in the nucleosome there is no indication from these experiments that linker histones bind fundamentally differently to  s and bulk nucleosomes
