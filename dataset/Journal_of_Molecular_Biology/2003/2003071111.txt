Integration host factor (IHF) is a DNA–bending protein that recognizes its cognate sites through indirect readout. Previous studies have shown that binding of wild-type (WT)-IHF is disrupted by a T to A mutation at the center position of a conserved TTR motif in its binding site, and that substitution of βGlu44 with Ala prevented IHF from discriminating between A and T at this position. We have determined the crystal structures and relative binding affinities for all combinations of WT-IHF and IHF-βGlu44Ala bound to the WT and mutant DNAs. Comparison of these structures reveals that DNA twist plays a major role in DNA recognition by IHF, and that this geometric parameter is dependent on the dinucleotide step and not on the bound IHF variant.
