the homologous pairing domain of reca also mediates the allosteric regulation of dna binding and atp hydrolysis a remarkable concentration of functional residues edited by m gottesman
switching between the active atp and dna bound and inactive conformations of the homologous recombination reca protein is regulated by atp hydrolysis first we use the homologous pairing domain of reca derived from its mobile loop l to show that the interaction of this random coil peptide with the  phosphate of atp results in a peptide  conformation similar to that previously shown to be induced by dna binding next we show that in the whole reca protein two residues in this l domain gln  and arg   are catalytic amino acid residues for atp hydrolysis and functionally resemble the corresponding residues engaged in gtp hydrolysis by two distinct classes of g proteins finally we show that the role of dna and high salt in the stimulation of the atpase of reca is to stabilize this highly mobile region involved in hydrolysis this is a role similar to that described for rgss in the activation of the gtpase of heterotrimeric g proteins therefore  i a prototypical dna dependent atpase and atp stimulated dna binding protein reca and eukaryotic signaling proteins share common stereochemical regulatory mechanisms and ii in a remarkable example of parsimony loop l is a molecular switch that controls both atp promoted dna binding and pairing reactions and dna stimulated atp hydrolysis
