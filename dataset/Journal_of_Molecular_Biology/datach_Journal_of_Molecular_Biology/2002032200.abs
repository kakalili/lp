reciprocal  flipping  underlies substrate recognition and catalytic activation by the human  oxo guanine dna glycosylase edited by j karn
both oxo guanine and formamidopyrimidines are major products of oxidative dna damage that can result in the fixation of transversion mutations following replication if left unrepaired these lesions are targeted by the n dna glycosylase hogg  which catalyses excision of the aberrant base followed by cleavage of the phosphate backbone directly   to the resultant abasic site in a context dependent manner we present the crystal structure of native hogg refined to     resolution that reveals a number of highly significant conformational changes on association with dna that are clearly required for substrate recognition and specificity changes of this magnitude appear to be unique to hogg and have not been observed in any of the dna glycosylase structures analysed to date where both native and dna bound forms are available it has been possible to identify a mechanism whereby the catalytic residue lys   is  primed  for nucleophilic attack of the n glycosidic bond
