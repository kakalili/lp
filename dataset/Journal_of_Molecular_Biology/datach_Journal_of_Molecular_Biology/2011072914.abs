multifaceted counter apobec g mechanisms employed by hiv  vif
in the absence of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  vif protein the host antiviral deaminase apolipoprotein b mrna editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like g a g restricts the production of infectious hiv  by deamination of dc residues in the negative single stranded dna produced by reverse transcription the vif protein averts the lethal threat of deamination by precluding the packaging of a g into assembling virions by mediating proteasomal degradation of a g in spite of this robust vif activity residual a g molecules that escape degradation and incorporate into newly assembled virions are potentially deleterious to the virus we hypothesized that virion associated vif inhibits a g enzymatic activity and therefore prevents lethal mutagenesis of the newly synthesized viral dna here we show that i vif proficient hiv  particles released from h cells contain a g with lower specific activity compared with  vif virus associated a g  ii encapsidated hiv  vif inhibits the deamination activity of recombinant a g and iii purified hiv  vif protein and the vif derived peptide vif    inhibit a g activity in vitro at nanomolar concentrations in an uncompetitive manner our results manifest the potentiality of vif to control the deamination threat in virions or in the pre integration complexes following entry to target cells hence virion associated vif could serve as a last line of defense protecting the virus against a g antiviral activity
