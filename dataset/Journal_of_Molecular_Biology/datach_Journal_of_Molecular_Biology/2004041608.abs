a  d reconstruction of smooth muscle  actinin by cryoem reveals two different conformations at the actin binding region
cryoelectron microscopy was used to obtain a  d image at   nm resolution of  d arrays of smooth muscle  actinin the reconstruction reveals a well resolved long central domain with   of left handed twist and near  fold symmetry however the molecular ends which contain the actin binding and calmodulin like domains have different structures oriented     to each other atomic structures for the  actinin domains were built by homology modeling and assembled into an atomic model model building suggests that in the  d arrays the two calponin homology domains that comprise the actin binding domain have a closed conformation at one end and an open conformation at the other end due to domain swapping the open and closed conformations of the actin binding domain suggests flexibility that may underlie ca  regulation the     orientation difference at the molecular ends may underlie  actinin s ability to crosslink actin filaments in nearly any orientation
