the histone domain of macroh a contains several dispersed elements that are each sufficient to direct enrichment on the inactive x chromosome
histone variants replace the core histones in a substantial fraction of nucleosomes affecting chromatin structure and impacting chromatin templated processes in many instances incorporation of histone variants results in formation of specialized regions of chromatin proper localization of histone variants to distinct regions of the genome is critical for their function yet how this specific localization is achieved remains unclear macroh a is enriched on the inactive x chromosome in female mammalian cells where it functions to maintain gene silencing macroh a consists of a histone h a like histone domain and a large globular c terminal macro domain that is not present in other histone proteins the histone domain of macroh a is alone sufficient to direct enrichment on the inactive x chromosome when expressed in female cells indicating that sequences important for correct localization lie in this domain here we investigate whether divergent sequences of the h a variant macroh a contribute to its correct localization we mapped the regions of the macroh a histone domain that are sufficient for localization to the inactive x chromosome using chimeras between h a and the histone domain of macroh a  multiple short sequences dispersed along the macroh a histone domain individually supported enrichment on the inactive x chromosome when introduced into h a these sequences map to the surface of the macroh a h b dimer but are buried in the crystal structure of the macroh a containing nucleosome suggesting that they may contribute to recognition by macroh a h b deposition factors
