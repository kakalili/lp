the rna polymerase ii ctd the increasing complexity of a low complexity protein domain
the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii contains a c terminal domain ctd that plays key roles in coordinating transcription with co transcriptional events the heptapeptide repeats that form the ctd are dynamically phosphorylated on serine tyrosine and threonine residues during the various steps of transcription thereby regulating the recruitment of various proteins involved in gene expression in this  perspective   we review the recent literature related to the function of the ctd to ctd kinases kin  cdk  cdk  cdk  erk  and dyrk a and to ctd phosphatases rtr  rpap  ssu  fcp and gcl  we discuss unresolved and controversial issues and try to provide constructive suggestions this review also highlights emerging themes in the ctd field such as crosstalk and feedback mechanisms as well as gene specific and tissue specific functions of the ctd finally promising therapeutic avenues for a recently developed ctd kinase inhibitor are discussed
