mechanistic basis of plasmid specific dna binding of the f plasmid regulatory protein tram
the conjugative transfer of bacterial f plasmids relies on tram a plasmid encoded protein that recognizes multiple dna sites to recruit the plasmid to the conjugative pore in spite of the high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between tram proteins many of these proteins have markedly different dna binding specificities that ensure the selective recruitment of a plasmid to its cognate pore here we present the structure of f tram rhh ribbon  helix  helix domain bound to its sbma site the structure indicates that a pair of tram tetramers cooperatively binds an underwound sbma site containing  base pairs per turn the sbma is composed of  copies of a  base pair motif each of which is recognized by an rhh domain the structure reveals that a single conservative amino acid difference in the rhh  ribbon between f and ped  tram changes its specificity for its cognate  base pair sequence motif specificity is also dictated by the positioning of  base pair spacer elements within sbma in f sbma the spacers are positioned between motifs  and  and between motifs  and  whereas in ped  sbma there is a single spacer between motifs  and  we also demonstrate that a pair of f tram tetramers can cooperatively bind its sbmc site with an affinity similar to that of sbma in spite of a lack of sequence similarity between these dna elements these results provide a basis for the prediction of the dna binding properties of the family of tram proteins
