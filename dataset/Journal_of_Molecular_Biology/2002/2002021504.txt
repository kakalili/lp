Within the Alpha class of the mammalian glutathione transferases two variants of subunit interfaces exist. One is conserved among the A4 subunits, whereas the second one is found in all other members of the Alpha class. The ability of the two Alpha class subunit interfaces to adopt a functional heterodimeric structure has been investigated here.The heterodimer GST A1-4 was obtained by co-expression of the two human Alpha class subunits A1 and A4 in Escherichia coli. A histidine tail was added to the N terminus of the A1 subunit to facilitate the purification of the heterodimer. The heterodimer was formed in a small proportion implying that the efficiency of the hybridization between subunit A1 and A4 is less than the propensity for homodimer formation. The hybrid enzyme was stable at low temperatures, but the two subunits dissociated and reassociated into homodimers at 40°C.Three different substrates were used for subunit-selective kinetic characterization of the GST A1-4 heterodimer: 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, nonenal and Δ5-androstene-3,17-dione. Both subunit A1 and subunit A4 were active in GST A1-4, but the specific activities and kcat values were lower than the average values of the two parental isoenzymes. However, at high temperatures the subunits of the hybrid enzyme dissociated and formed homodimers, and the activities increased to expected values. Hence, the low activities of the individual subunits in the heterodimer were reversible. The non-additive kinetic properties of the subunits in the heterodimer therefore highlight the importance of fine-tuned subunit interactions for optimal catalytic efficiency of GST A1-1 and GST A4-4.
