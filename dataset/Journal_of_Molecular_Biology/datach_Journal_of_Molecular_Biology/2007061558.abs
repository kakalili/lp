structural characterization of b and non b subtypes of hiv protease insights into the natural susceptibility to drug resistance development
although a majority of hiv  infections in brazil are caused by the subtype b virus also prevalent in the united states and western europe  viral subtypes f and c are also found very frequently genomic differences between the subtypes give rise to sequence variations in the encoded proteins including the hiv  protease the current anti hiv drugs have been developed primarily against subtype b and the effects arising from the combination of drug resistance mutations with the naturally existing polymorphisms in non b hiv  subtypes are only beginning to be elucidated to gain more insights into the structure and function of different variants of hiv proteases we have determined a    structure of the native subtype f hiv  protease pr in complex with the protease inhibitor tl  we have also solved crystal structures of two multi drug resistant mutant hiv prs in complex with tl  from subtype b bmut carrying the primary mutations v a and l m and from subtype f fmut carrying the primary mutation v a plus the secondary mutation m i at     and    resolution respectively the proteases bmut fwt and fmut exhibit sevenfold threefold and  fold resistance to tl  respectively in addition the structure of subtype b wild type hiv pr in complex with tl  has been redetermined in space group p  consistent with the other three structures our results show that the primary mutation v a causes the known effect of collapsing the s s   pockets that ultimately lead to the reduced inhibitory effect of tl  our results further indicate that two naturally occurring polymorphic substitutions in subtype f and other non b hiv proteases m i and l m may lead to early development of drug resistance in patients infected with non b hiv subtypes
