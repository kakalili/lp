local deformations revealed by dynamics simulations of dna polymerase  with dna mismatches at the primer terminus
nanosecond dynamics simulations for dna polymerase   pol   dna complexes with three mismatched base pairs namely gg ca or cc primer template at the dna polymerase active site are performed to investigate the mechanism of polymerase opening and how the mispairs may affect the dna extension step these trajectories are compared to the behavior of a pol  dna complex with the correct gc base pair and assessed with the aid of targeted molecular dynamics tmd simulations of all systems from the closed to the open enzyme state dna polymerase conformational changes subdomain closing and opening have been suggested to play a critical role in dna synthesis fidelity since these changes are associated with the formation of the substrate binding pocket for the nascent base pair here we observe different large c terminal subdomain thumb opening motions in the simulations of pol  with gc versus gg base pairs whereas the conformation of pol  in the former approaches the observed open state in the crystal structures the enzyme in the latter does not analyses of the motions of active site protein dna residues help explain these differences interestingly rotation of arg  toward asp   which coordinates both active site metal ions in the closed  active  complex occurs rapidly in the gg simulation we have previously suggested that this rotation is a key slow step in the closed to open transition tmd simulations also point to a unique pathway for arg  rotation in the gg mispair complex simulations of the mismatched systems also reveal distorted geometries in the active site of all the mispair complexes examined the hierarchy of the distortions gg gt cc gt ca parallels the experimentally deduced inability of pol  to extend these mispairs such local distortions would be expected to cause inefficient dna extension and polymerase dissociation and thereby might lead to proofreading by an extrinsic exonuclease thus our studies on the dynamics of pol  opening in mismatch systems provide structural and dynamic insights to explain experimental results regarding inefficient dna extension following misincorporation these details shed light on how proofreading may be invoked by the abnormal active site geometry
