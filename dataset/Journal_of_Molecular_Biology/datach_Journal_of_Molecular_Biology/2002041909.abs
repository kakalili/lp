crystal structure of the v region of streptococcus mutans antigen i ii at    resolution suggests a sugar preformed binding site
antigens i ii are large multifunctional adhesins from oral viridans streptococci that exert immunomodulatory effects on human cells and play important roles in inflammatory disorders among them streptococcus mutans plays a major role in the initiation of dental caries the structure of the v region srv  residues      of the antigen i ii of s mutans has been determined using the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing technique with seleno methionine substituted recombinant protein and subsequently refined at    resolution the crystal structure of srv revealed a lectin like fold that displays a putative preformed carbohydrate binding site stabilized by a metal ion inhibition of this binding site may confer to humans a protection against dental caries and dissemination of the bacteria to extra oral sites involved in life threatening inflammatory diseases this crystal structure constitutes a first step in understanding the structure  function relationship of antigens i ii and may help in delineating new preventive or therapeutic strategies against colonization of the host by oral streptococci
