A homologue of the Escherichia coli GroEL apical domain was obtained from thermophilic eubacterium Thermus thermophilus. The domains share 70 % sequence identity (101 out of 145 residues). The thermal stability of the T. thermophilus apical domain (Tm&gt;100°C as evaluated by circular dichroism) is at least 35°C greater than that of the E. coli apical domain (Tm=65°C). The crystal structure of a selenomethione-substituted apical domain from T. thermophilus was determined to a resolution of 1.78 Å using multiwavelength-anomalous-diffraction phasing. The structure is similar to that of the E. coli apical domain (root-mean-square deviation 0.45 Å based on main-chain atoms). The thermophilic structure contains seven additional salt bridges of which four contain charge-stabilized hydrogen bonds. Only one of the additional salt bridges would face the “Anfinsen cage” in GroEL. High temperatures were exploited to map sites of interactions between the apical domain and molten globules. NMR footprints of apical domain-protein complexes were obtained at elevated temperature using15N-1H correlation spectra of15N-labeled apical domain. Footprints employing two polypeptides unrelated in sequence or structure (an insulin monomer and the SRY high-mobility-group box, each partially unfolded at 50°C) are essentially the same and consistent with the peptide-binding surface previously defined in E. coli GroEL and its apical domain-peptide complexes. An additional part of this surface comprising a short N-terminal α-helix is observed. The extended footprint rationalizes mutagenesis studies of intact GroEL in which point mutations affecting substrate binding were found outside the “classical” peptide-binding site. Our results demonstrate structural conservation of the apical domain among GroEL homologues and conservation of an extended non-polar surface recognizing diverse polypeptides.
