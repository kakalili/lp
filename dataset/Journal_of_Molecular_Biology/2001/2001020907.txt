Calmodulin (CaM)-protein interactions are usually described by studying complexes between synthetic targets of ca 25 amino acids and CaM. To understand the relevance of contacts outside the protein-binding region, we investigated the complex between recombinant human CaM (hCaM) and P7, a 38-residue peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of human cardiac titin kinase (hTK). To expedite the structure determination of hCaM-P7 we relied upon the high degree of similarity with other CaM-kinase peptide complexes. By using a combined homonuclear NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling approach, we verified for the bound hCaM similar trends in chemical shifts as well as conservation of NOE patterns, which taken together imply the conservation of CaM secondary structure. P7 was anchored to the protein with 52 experimental intermolecular contacts. The hCaM-P7 structure is very similar to known CaM complexes, but the presence of NOE contacts outside the binding cavity appears to be novel. Comparison with the hTK crystal structure indicates that the P7 charged residues all correspond to accessible side-chains, while the putative anchoring hydrophobic side-chains are partially buried. To test this finding, we also modeled the early steps of the complex formation between Ca2+-loaded hCaM and hTK. The calculated trajectories strongly suggest the existence of an “electrostatic funnel”, driving the long-range recognition of the two proteins. On the other hand, on a nanosecond time scale, no intermolecular interaction is formed as the P7 hydrophobic residues remain buried inside hTK. These results suggest that charged residues in hTK might be the anchoring points of Ca2+/hCaM, favoring the intrasteric regulation of the kinase. Furthermore, our structure, the first of CaM bound to a peptide derived from a kinase whose three-dimensional structure is known, suggests that special care is needed in the choice of template peptides to model protein-protein interactions.
