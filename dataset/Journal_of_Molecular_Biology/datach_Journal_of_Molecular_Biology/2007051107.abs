characterization of the mechanisms by which gelatinase a neutrophil collagenase and membrane type metalloproteinase mmp  recognize collagen i and enzymatically process the two  chains
the turnover of native collagen has been ascribed to different members of the matrix metalloproteinase mmp family here the mechanisms by which neutrophil collagenase mmp   gelatinase a mmp   and the ectodomain of mt mmp ectmmp   degrade fibrillar collagen were examined in particular the hydrolysis of type i collagen at    c was investigated to identify functional differences in the processing of the two   chain types of fibrillar collagen thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were used for a quantitative comparison of the binding unwinding and hydrolysis of triple helical collagen we demonstrate that the mmp family has developed at least two distinct mechanisms for collagen unwinding and cleavage mmp  and ectmmp  display a similar mechanism although with different catalytic parameters  which is characterized by binding likely through the hemopexin like domain and cleavage of    and or    chains without distinguishing between them and keeping the gross conformation of the triple helix at least during the first cleavage step  on the other hand mmp  binds preferentially the    chains likely through the fibronectin like domain which is not present in mmp  and ectmmp   grossly altering the whole triple helical arrangement of the collagen molecule and cleaving preferentially the    chain these distinctive mechanisms underly a drastically different mode of interaction with triple helical fibrillar collagen i according to which the mmp domain is involved in binding these findings can be related to the different role exerted by these mmps on collagen homeostasis in the extracellular matrix
