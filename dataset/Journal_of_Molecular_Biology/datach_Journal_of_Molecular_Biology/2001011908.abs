how to untwist an  helix structural principles of an  helical barrel edited by j thornton
recent crystallographic studies have revealed that    helices can pack in an anti parallel fashion to form a hollow cylinder of nearly uniform radius in this architecture which we refer to as an  barrel the helices are inclined with respect to the cylindrical axis and thus they curve and twist as with conventional coiled coils the helices of the barrel associate via  knobs into holes  interactions however their packing is distinct in several important ways first the  barrel helices untwist in comparison with the helices found in two stranded coiled coils and as a consequence of this distortion their knobs approach closely one end of the complementary holes this effect defines a requirement for particular size and shape of the protruding residues and it is associated with a relative axial translation of the paired helices second as each helix packs laterally with two neighbours the helices have two sequence patterns that are phased to match the two interfaces the two types of interface are not equivalent and as one travels around the circumference of the cylinder  s interior they alternate between one type where the knobs approach the holes straight on and a second type in which they are inclined the choice of amino acid depends on the interface type with small hydrophobic side chains preferred for the direct contacts and larger aliphatic side chains for the inclined contacts third small residues are found preferentially on the inside of the tube in order to make the  wedge  angle between helices compatible with a  member tube finally hydrogen bonding interactions of side chains within and between helices support the assembly using these salient structural features we present a sequence template that is compatible with some underlying rules for the packing of helices in the barrel and which may have application to the design of higher order assemblies from peptides such as nano tubes we discuss the general implications of relative axial translation in coiled coils and in particular the potential role that this movement could play in allosteric mechanisms
