oxidation of human lens recombinant  a crystallin and cysteine deficient mutants edited by m f moody
disulfide cross linking one of the results of oxidative stress has been thought to play an important role in cataractogenesis high molecular mass hmm protein aggregation also contributes to cataract development and a prevailing speculation is that disulfide cross linking induces hmm aggregation however there is no direct evidence to support this speculation dimerization is an effect of disulfide cross linking but cannot explain the size of hmm aggregates observed in the lens  a crystallin has two cysteine residues cys  and cys   and we have prepared three cys deficient mutants two single mutants c  i and c  i and one double mutant c  i c  i  they were subjected to h o oxidation in an ascorbate fecl edta h o system the effects of oxidation on the mutants including changes in aggregate size and conformation were compared with those of the wild type  a crystallin by fplc gel filtration absorption fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements the results indicated that other amino acid residues besides cys such as trp and tyr were also oxidized by h o  disulfide dimerization alone seems to play a less important role in hmm aggregation than does the secondary conformational change resulting from the combined effect of the oxidation of trp and tyr as well as cys
