synaptotagmin  and snares form a complex that is structurally heterogeneous
synaptotagmin  syt  functions as a ca  sensor for neuronal exocytosis here site directed spin labeling was used to examine the complex formed between a soluble fragment of syt  which contains its two c domains and the neuronal core soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare complex changes in electron paramagnetic resonance lineshape and accessibility for spin labeled syt mutants indicate that in solution the assembled core snare complex contacts syt in several regions for the c b domain contact occurs in the polybasic face and sites opposite the ca  binding loops for the c a domain contact is seen with the snare complex in a region near loop  double electron electron resonance was used to estimate distances between the two c domains of syt  these distances have broad distributions in solution which do not significantly change when syt is fully associated with the core snare complex the broad distance distributions indicate that syt is structurally heterogeneous when bound to the snares and does not assume a well defined structure simulated annealing using electron paramagnetic resonance derived distance restraints produces a family of syt structures where the ca  binding regions of each domain face in roughly opposite directions the results suggest that when associated with the snares syt is configured to bind opposing bilayers but that the syt snare complex samples multiple conformational states
