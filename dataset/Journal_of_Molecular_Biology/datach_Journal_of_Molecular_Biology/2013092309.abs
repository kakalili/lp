protein kinase a and phosphodiesterase d binding to coding polymorphisms of cardiac muscle anchoring protein makap
protein kinase a pka substrate phosphorylation is facilitated through its co localization with its signaling partner by a kinase anchoring proteins akaps  makap muscle selective akap localizes pka and its substrates such as phosphodiesterase d  pde d  ryanodine receptor and protein phosphatase a pp a to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear space the genetic role of makap in modulating pka pde d molecular signaling during cardiac diseases remains unclear the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of naturally occurring mutations in human makap on pka and pde d signaling we have recently identified potentially important human makap coding non synonymous polymorphisms located within or near key protein binding sites critical to  adrenergic receptor signaling three mutations p  s s  f and l  v were cloned and transfected into a mammalian cell line for the purpose of comparing whether those substitutions disrupt makap binding to pka or pde d  immunoprecipitation study of makap p  s a mutation located in the makap pde d binding site displayed a significant reduction in binding to pde d  with no significant changes in pka binding or pka activity conversely makap s  f a mutation located in makap pp a binding site showed significant increase in both binding propensity to pka and pka activity additionally makap l  v a mutation flanking the makap spectrin repeat domain exhibited a significant increase in pka binding compared to wild type but there was no change in pka activity we also demonstrate specific binding of wild type makap to pde d  binding results were demonstrated using immunoprecipitation and confirmed with surface plasmon resonance biacore    functional results were demonstrated using activity assays ca  measurements and western blot comparative analysis of the binding responses of mutations to makap could provide important information about how these mutations modulate signaling
