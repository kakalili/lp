Native-state amide hydrogen exchange (HX) of proteins in the presence of denaturant has provided valuable details on the structures of equilibrium folding intermediates. Here, we extend HX theory to model thiol group exchange (SX) in single cysteine-containing variants of sperm whale ferric aquomyoglobin. SX is complementary to HX in that it monitors conformational opening events that expose side-chains, rather than the main chain, to solvent. A simple two-process model, consisting of EX2-limited local structural fluctuations and EX1-limited global unfolding, adequately accounts for all HX data. SX is described by the same model except at very low denaturant concentrations and when the bulky labeling reagent 5,5â€²-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) is used. Under these conditions SX can occur by a novel denaturant-dependent process. This anomalous behavior is not observed when the smaller labeling reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate is employed, suggesting that it reflects a denaturant-induced increase in the amplitudes of local structural fluctuations. It also is not seen in heme-free apomyoglobin, which may indicate that local openings are sufficiently large in the absence of denaturant to allow DTNB unhindered access. Differences in SX kinetics obtained using the two labeling reagents provide estimates of the sizes of local opening reactions at different sites in the protein. At all sequence positions examined except for position 73, the same opening event appears to facilitate exchange of both backbone amide and side-chain thiol groups. The C73 thiol group is exposed by a low-energy fluctuation that does not expose its amide group to exchange.
