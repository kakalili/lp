new local potential useful for genome annotation and d modeling
a new potential energy function representing the conformational preferences of sequentially local regions of a protein backbone is presented this potential is derived from secondary structure probabilities such as those produced by neural network based prediction methods the potential is applied to the problem of remote homolog identification in combination with a distance dependent inter residue potential and position based scoring matrices this fold recognition jury is implemented in a java application called jthread these methods are benchmarked on several test sets including one released entirely after development and parameterization of jthread in benchmark tests to identify known folds structurally similar to but not identical with the native structure of a sequence jthread performs significantly better than psi blast with   more structures identified correctly as the most likely structural match in a fold library and   more structures correctly narrowed down to a set of five possible candidates jthread also improves the average sequence alignment accuracy significantly from   to   of residues aligned correctly reliable fold assignments and alignments are identified making the method useful for genome annotation jthread is applied to predicted open reading frames orfs from the genomes of mycoplasma genitalium and drosophila melanogaster identifying  new structural annotations in the former and   in the latter
