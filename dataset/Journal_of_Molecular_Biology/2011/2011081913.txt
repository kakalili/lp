Cellular functions of an organism are maintained by protein–protein interactions. Those proteins that bind multiple partners asynchronously (date hub proteins) are important to make the interaction network coordinated. It is known that many date hub proteins bind different partners at overlapping (OV) interfaces. To understand how OV interfaces of date hub proteins can recognize multiple partners, we analyzed the difference between OV and non-overlapping (Non-OV) regions of interfaces involved in the binding of different partners. By using the structures of 16 date hub proteins with various interaction partners (ranging from 5 to 33), we compared buried surface area, compositions of amino acid residues and secondary structures, and side-chain orientations. It was found that buried interface residues are important for recognizing multiple partners, while exposed interface residues are important for determining specificity to a particular ligand. In addition, our analyses reveal that residue compositions in OV and Non-OV regions are different and that residues in OV region show diverse side-chain torsion angles to accommodate binding to multiple targets.
