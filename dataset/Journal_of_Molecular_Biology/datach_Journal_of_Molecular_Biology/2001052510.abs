on the mechanism of biological methane formation structural evidence for conformational changes in methyl coenzyme m reductase upon substrate binding edited by r huber
methyl coenzyme m reductase mcr catalyzes the final reaction of the energy conserving pathway of methanogenic archaea in which methyl coenzyme m and coenzyme b are converted to methane and the heterodisulfide com s s cob it operates under strictly anaerobic conditions and contains the nickel porphinoid f  which is present in the nickel i oxidation state in the active enzyme the known crystal structures of the inactive nickel ii enzyme in complex with coenzyme m and coenzyme b mcr ox silent and in complex with the heterodisulfide com s s cob mcr silent were now refined at     and    resolution respectively the atomic resolution structure of mcr ox silent describes the exact geometry of the cofactor f   of the active site residues and of the modified amino acid residues moreover the observation of  mg  and  na ions at the protein surface of the   kda enzyme specifies typical constituents of binding sites for either ion the mcr silent and mcr ox silent structures differed in the occupancy of bound water molecules near the active site indicating that a water chain is involved in the replenishment of the active site with water molecules the structure of the novel enzyme state mcr red silent at    resolution revealed an active site only partially occupied by coenzyme m and coenzyme b increased flexibility and distinct alternate conformations were observed near the active site and the substrate channel the electron density of the mcr red silent state aerobically co crystallized with coenzyme m displayed a fully occupied coenzyme m binding site with no alternate conformations therefore the structure was very similar to the mcr ox silent state as a consequence the binding of coenzyme m induced specific conformational changes that postulate a molecular mechanism by which the enzyme ensures that methylcoenzyme m enters the substrate channel prior to coenzyme b as required by the active site geometry the three different enzymatically inactive enzyme states are discussed with respect to their enzymatically active precursors and with respect to the catalytic mechanism
