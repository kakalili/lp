autophagosome maturation and fusion
macroautophagy or simply autophagy is a degradative pathway that delivers cytoplasmic components including cytosol and organelles to the lysosome in double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes this process is initiated at the pre autophagosomal structure or phagophore assembly site and involves a number of highly conserved autophagy related proteins these support the generation and conversion of an open membranous cistern known as the phagophore or isolation membrane into a closed autophagosome within this review we will focus on recent insights into the molecular events following the sealing completion of an autophagosome which lead to its maturation and subsequent fusion with endosomes lysosomes
