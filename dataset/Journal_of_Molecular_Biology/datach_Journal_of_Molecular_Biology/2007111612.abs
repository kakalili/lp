comparative normal mode analysis of lfa  integrin i domains
the conformational dynamics of the inserted domain i domain from the lymphocyte function associated antigen  lfa  was investigated by normal mode analysis of multiple structures of the low intermediate and high affinity states lfa  is an integrin expressed on leukocytes and is of critical importance in adhesion reactions like antigen specific responses homing and diapedesis the main ligand binding site of lfa  is the i domain which recognizes intercellular adhesion molecules icams  members of the immunoglobulin superfamily from experimental crystal structures a large scale conformational change of among others the   helix of the i domain has been observed leading to the proposal that these structural changes are linked to the conformational regulation of lfa  the results from the present calculations show that structural changes of the   helix consistent with those observed in the crystal structures are significantly sampled by the low frequency modes this was found to be particularly true for the low affinity state of the i domain indicating that low frequency motions favor the conformational transition implicated in activation however beyond the simple downward shift of the helix implied by the crystal structures the calculations further show that there is a noticeable swinging out motion of the helix the consequences of this motion are discussed in the context of integrin activation and inhibition moreover significant changes in the atomic level dynamics and in long range correlated motions of the i domain were found to occur upon binding of the natural ligand icam these changes were more local upon binding of an allosteric inhibitor the present study opens the question of how changes in dynamics may contribute to the long range transmission of signal upon icam binding by the lfa  i domain
