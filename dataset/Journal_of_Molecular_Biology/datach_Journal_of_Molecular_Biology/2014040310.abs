steric mechanism of auto inhibitory regulation of specific and non specific dna binding by the ets transcriptional repressor etv
dna binding by the ets transcriptional repressor etv  or tel is auto inhibited   fold due to an  helix that sterically blocks its ets domain binding interface using nmr spectroscopy we demonstrate that this marginally stable helix is unfolded and not displaced to a non inhibitory position when etv is bound to dna containing a consensus   ggaa   recognition site although significantly lower in affinity binding to non specific dna is auto inhibited  fold and is also accompanied by helix unfolding based on nmr chemical shift perturbations both specific and non specific dna are bound via the same canonical ets domain interface however spectral perturbations are smaller for the non specific complex suggesting weaker and less well defined interactions than in the specific complex in parallel the crystal structure of etv bound to a specific dna duplex was determined the structure of this complex reveals that a non conserved histidine residue in the ets domain recognition helix helps establish the specificity of etv for dna binding sites containing   ggaa   versus   ggat   these studies provide a unified steric mechanism for attenuating etv binding to both specific and non specific dna and expand the repertoire of characterized auto inhibitory strategies utilized to regulate ets factors
