a repeated  turn structure in poly ala gly as a model for silk i of bombyx mori silk fibroin studied with two dimensional spin diffusion nmr under off magic angle spinning and rotational echo double resonance edited by m f summers
the structure of a crystalline form of bombyx mori silk fibroin commonly found before the spinning process known as silk i  was proposed by combining data obtained from two dimensional spin diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance under off magic angle spinning rotational echo double resonance redor  previously reported x ray diffraction analyses and  c nmr chemical shifts instead of b mori silk fibroin with silk i structure we used the sequential model peptide ala gly   the structure of the sequential model peptide is characterized as silk i after dissolving the peptide in  m libr and then dialyzing against water moreover  c or  n labeled sites may be introduced easily at any position in ala gly  by the solid phase synthesis method for these nmr experiments the torsional angles of ala gly  with silk i structure were determined as              and            for ala and gly residues respectively the formation of the intra molecular hydrogen bonding along the chain was confirmed from redor nmr by determination of the inter atomic distance between the nitrogen and carbon atoms comprising the intra molecular hydrogen bonding the structure is named a repeated  turn type ii like structure
