the supramolecular assemblies of voltage dependent anion channels in the native membrane
voltage dependent anion channels vdacs are major constituents of the outer mitochondrial membrane omm  these primary transporters of nucleotides ions and metabolites mediate a substantial portion of the omm molecular traffic to study the native supramolecular organization of the vdac we have isolated characterized and imaged omms from potato tubers sds  page and mass spectrometry of omms revealed the presence of the vdac isoforms pom  and pom  as well as the translocase of the omm complex tubular two dimensional crystals of the vdac spontaneously formed after incubation of omms for two to three months at   c transmission electron microscopy revealed an oblique lattice and unit cells housing six circular depressions arranged in a hexagon atomic force microscopy of freshly isolated omms demonstrated i the existence of monomers to tetramers hexamers and higher oligomers of the vdac and ii its spatial arrangement within the oligomers in the native membrane we discuss the importance of the observed oligomerization for modulation of the vdac function for the binding of hexokinase and creatine kinase to the omm and for mitochondria mediated apoptosis
