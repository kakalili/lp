rsv capsid polymorphism correlates with polymerization efficiency and envelope glycoprotein content implications that nucleation controls morphogenesis
we used cryo electron tomography to visualize rous sarcoma virus the prototypic alpharetrovirus its polyprotein gag assembles into spherical procapsids concomitant with budding in maturation gag is dissected into its matrix capsid protein ca  and nucleocapsid moieties ca reassembles into cores housing the viral rna and replication enzymes evidence suggests that a correctly formed core is essential for infectivity the virions in our data set range from    to     nm in diameter their cores are highly polymorphic we observe angular cores including some that are distinctively  coffin shaped  for which we propose a novel fullerene geometry cores with continuous curvature including rarely fullerene cones and tubular cores angular cores are the most voluminous and densely packed tubes and some curved cores contain less material suggesting incomplete packaging from the tomograms we measured the surface areas of cores and hence their contents of ca subunits from the virion diameters we estimated their original complements of gag we find that rous sarcoma virus virions like the human immunodeficiency virus contain unassembled ca subunits and that the fraction of ca that is assembled correlates with core type angular cores incorporate    of the available subunits and open ended tubes     the number of glycoprotein spikes is variable    to   and also correlates with core type virions with angular cores average  spikes whereas those with tubular cores average  spikes these observations imply that initiation of ca assembly in which interactions of spike endodomains with the gag layer play a role is a critical determinant of core morphology
