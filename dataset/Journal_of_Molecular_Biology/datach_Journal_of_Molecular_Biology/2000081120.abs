solution structure of the catalytic domain of human collagenase  mmp   complexed to a potent non peptidic sulfonamide inhibitor binding comparison with stromelysin  and collagenase  edited by p e wright
the full three dimensional structure of the catalytic domain of human collagenase  mmp   complexed to a potent sulfonamide hydroxamic acid inhibitor cgs    has been determined by nmr spectroscopy the results reveal a core domain for the protein consisting of three  helices and five  sheet strands with an overall tertiary fold similar to the catalytic domains of other matrix metalloproteinase family members the s   pocket which is the major site of hydrophobic binding interaction was found to be a wide cleft spanning the length of the protein and presenting facile opportunity for inhibitor extension deep into the pocket comparison with the reported x ray structure of collagenase  showed evidence of flexibility for the loop region flanking the s   pocket in both nmr and x ray data this flexibility was corroborated by nmr dynamics studies inhibitor binding placed the methoxy phenyl ring in the s   pocket with the remainder of the molecule primarily solvent exposed the binding mode for this inhibitor was found to be similar with respect to stromelysin  and collagenase  however subtle comparative differences in the interactions between inhibitor and enzyme were observed for the three mmps that were consistent with their respective binding potencies
