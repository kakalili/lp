role of the interdomain linker in distance determination for remote cleavage by homing endonuclease i tevi
i tevi is a modular intron encoded endonuclease consisting of an n terminal catalytic domain and a c terminal dna binding domain joined by a  amino acid linker this linker can be divided into three regions starting at the n terminus the deletion intolerant di region the deletion tolerant dt region and a zinc finger which acts as a distance determinant for cleavage to further explore linker function we generated deletion and substitution mutants that were tested for their preference to cleave at a particular distance or at the correct sequence our results demonstrate that the i tevi linker is multi functional a property that sets it apart from junction sequences in most other proteins first the linker di region has a role in i tevi cleavage activity second the dt linker region participates in distance determination as evident from dt mutants that display a phenotype similar to that of the zinc finger mutants in their selection of a cleavage site finally nmr analysis of a freestanding  residue linker segment showed an unstructured stretch corresponding to the di region and a portion of the dt region followed by a  strand corresponding to the remainder of the dt region and containing a key distance determining arginine r   mutation of this arginine to alanine abolished distance determination and disrupted the  strand indicating that the structure of the dt linker region has a role in cleavage at a fixed distance
