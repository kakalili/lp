cytochrome c and sds a molten globule protein with altered axial ligation
saccharomices cerevisiae yeast iso  cytochrome c has been investigated in the presence of   mm sds in order to simulate the interaction of cytochrome c with membrane under these circumstances a high spin species with detached methionine axial ligand is observed through nmr in analogy to findings on the horse heart protein however at variance with the latter system for the yeast protein also a low spin species is detected which appears to be present with a concentration of about   with respect to that of the high spin species the r  r   h   n noe of backbone amides which are not affected by paramagnetism are homogeneous and allow a simultaneous analysis of the data for the two species the result is that the rotational correlation time is larger than in water and larger than expected on the basis of viscosity of the sds containing solution this finding suggests interactions of cytochrome c with sds furthermore it appears that there is subnanosecond backbone mobility which also accounts for the decreased intensity of noe cross peaks and may be associated with equilibria between helical and random coil structure the dynamic behavior appears to be a common feature of the high spin and low spin species and is consistent with the presence of a molten globule state the molten globule nature of the protein could account for the presence of the different axial coordination of the heme iron such findings are meaningful with respect to the physiology of cytochrome c as electron transfer protein and as promoter of apoptosis
