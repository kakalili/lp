identification and characterization of a novel molecular recognition and self assembly domain within the islet amyloid polypeptide
the islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp is a  amino acid residue polypeptide that was found to accumulate as amyloid fibrils in the pancreas of individuals with type ii diabetes previous studies identified various fragments of hiapp that can form amyloid fibrils in vitro e g hiapp    hiapp     and hiapp     however no comparative and systematic information was available on the role of these structural domains or others in the process of molecular recognition that mediates fibrillization in the context of the full length polypeptide to systematically map and compare potential recognition domains we studied the ability of hiapp to interact with an array of  membrane spotted overlapping peptides that span the entire sequence of hiapp i e hiapp    hiapp      hiapp     our study clearly identified a major domain of molecular recognition within hiapp as the polypeptide was found to bind with high affinity to a defined linear group of peptides ranging from hiapp    to hiapp     the maximal binding of the full length polypeptide was to the hiapp    peptide fragment with the sequence rlanflvhss  in order to define the minimal fragment within this apparent recognition motif that is capable of self association and thus may serve as the core molecular recognition motif we examined the ability of truncated analogs of the recognition sequence to self assemble into amyloid fibrils the shortest active fragments capable of self assembly were found to be the pentapeptides flvhs and nflvh the apparent role of this motif in the process of hiapp self assembly is consistent with the profile of the hiaap binding distribution to the peptide array the identification of such short recognition motifs is extremely useful in the attempts to develop means to block amyloid fibril formation by hiapp it is worth mentioning that this is only the second time in which peptides as short as a pentapeptide were shown to form amyloid fibrils the other pentapeptide is fgail
