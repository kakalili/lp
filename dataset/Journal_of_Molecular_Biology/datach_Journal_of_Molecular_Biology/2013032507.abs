potential conformational heterogeneity of p  bound to s  b
the negative regulatory domain nrd of the p  tumor suppressor is intrinsically disordered it contains several posttranslational modification ptm sites that are important for regulation of p  activity calcium dependent binding of dimeric s  b    to p  nrd blocks access to these ptm sites and disrupts the p  tetramer to inhibit p  activation previous nuclear magnetic resonance nmr structural studies have suggested that p  nrd folds into a stable helix upon binding to s  b    intriguingly despite the well converged and stably folded nature of the nmr structure ensemble experimentally resolved intermolecular nuclear overhauser enhancements noes are extremely weak most have  to   upper bounds and mainly involve the c terminal segment of p  nrd such a systematic lack of strong intermolecular noes could suggest that the p  s  b    interface is more dynamic than currently believed indeed extensive atomistic simulations in explicit solvent with   s total effective sampling revealed large heterogeneity in the s  b    bound conformation of p  nrd helix unwinding at the c terminus allows key hydrophobic residues leu  and phe   to make more extensive intermolecular contacts whereas the highly helical n terminus displays substantial flexibility in packing with s  b    importantly the predicted heterogeneous ensemble as a whole is highly consistent with experimental intermolecular noes although many conformational sub states coexist and individual sub states satisfy only subsets of the noe restraints furthermore the simulated ensemble provides similar shielding of key ptm sites to support p  inhibition this study not only provides new insights into the structural basis of the p  s  b    recognition but also highlights the importance of recognizing dynamic complexes in structural studies of intrinsically disordered protein interactions
