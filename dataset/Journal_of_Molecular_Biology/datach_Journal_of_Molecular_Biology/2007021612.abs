intermolecular interactions and characterization of the novel factor xa exosite involved in macromolecular recognition and inhibition crystal structure of human gla domainless factor xa complexed with the anticoagulant protein napc from the hematophagous nematode ancylostoma caninum
napc  an anticoagulant protein from the hematophagous nematode ancylostoma caninum evaluated in phase ii iia clinical trials inhibits the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway by a two step mechanism initially interacting with the hitherto uncharacterized factor xa exosite involved in macromolecular recognition and subsequently inhibiting factor viia ki   pm of the factor viia tissue factor complex napc is highly flexible becoming partially ordered and undergoing significant structural changes in the c terminus upon binding to the factor xa exosite in the crystal structure of the ternary factor xa napc selectide complex the binding interface consists of an intermolecular antiparallel  sheet formed by the segment of the polypeptide chain consisting of residues     of napc with the residues     of factor xa that is additional maintained by contacts between the short helical segment residues     and a turn residues     of napc with the short c terminal helix of factor xa residues       this exosite is physiologically highly relevant for the recognition and inhibition of factor x xa by macromolecular substrates and provides a structural motif for the development of a new class of inhibitors for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and angioplasty
