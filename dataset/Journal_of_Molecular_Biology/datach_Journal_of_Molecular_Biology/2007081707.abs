functional cell free synthesis of a seven helix membrane protein in situ insertion of bacteriorhodopsin into liposomes
the expression of membrane proteins for functional and structural studies or medicinal applications is still not very well established membrane spanning proteins that mediate the information flow of the extracellular side with the interior of the cell are prime targets for drug development methods that would allow screening techniques or high throughput formats are of particular interest here we describe a systematic approach to the liposome assisted cell free synthesis of functional membrane proteins we demonstrate the synthesis of bacteriorhodopsin brcf in presence of small unilamellar liposomes the yield of brcf per volume cell culture is comparable to that of bacteriorhodopsin in its native host the functional analysis of brcf was performed directly using the cell free reaction mixture photocycle measurements reveal kinetic data similar to that determined for br in halobacterium salinarum cell envelope vesicles the liposomes can be attached directly to black lipid membranes blm  which allows measuring light activated photocurrents in situ the results reveal a functional proton pump with properties identical to those established for the native protein
