crystal structure of pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase   flipped  binding geometries for steroid substrates in different redox states of the enzyme edited by a r fersht
pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase petn reductase degrades high explosive molecules including nitrate esters nitroaromatics and cyclic triazine compounds the enzyme also binds a variety of cyclic enones including steroids some steroids act as substrates whilst others are inhibitors understanding the basis of reactivity with cyclic enones requires structural information for the enzyme and key complexes formed with steroid substrates and inhibitors the crystal structure of oxidised and reduced petn reductase at    resolution establishes a close structural similarity to the    barrel flavoenzyme old yellow enzyme in complexes of oxidised petn reductase with progesterone an inhibitor    androstadiene   dione and prednisone both substrates the steroids are stacked over the si face of the flavin in an orientation different from that reported for old yellow enzyme the specifically reducible   unsaturated bonds in   androstadiene   dione and prednisone are not optimally aligned with the flavin n in oxidised enzyme complexes these structures suggest either relative  flipping  or shifting of the steroid with respect to the flavin when bound in different redox forms of the enzyme deuterium transfer from nicotinamide coenzyme to   androstadiene   dione via the enzyme bound fmn indicates   addition at the steroid c atom these studies rule out lateral motion of the steroid and indicate that the steroid orientation is  flipped  in different redox states of the enzyme
