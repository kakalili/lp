impact of single chain fv antibody fragment affinity on nanoparticle targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing tumor cells
to determine the importance of single chain fv scfv affinity on binding uptake and cytotoxicity of tumor targeting nanoparticles the affinity of the epidermal growth factor receptor egfr scfv antibody c  was increased using molecular evolution and yeast display a library containing scfv mutants was created by error prone pcr displayed on the surface of yeast and higher affinity clones selected by fluorescence activated cell sorting ten mutant scfv were identified that had a    fold improvement in affinity kd     nm for egfr expressing a  tumor cells compared to c  scfv kd   nm  by combining mutations higher affinity scfv were generated with kd ranging from   nm to   nm the highest affinity scfv had a   fold higher affinity compared to that of the parental c  scfv immunoliposome nanoparticles ils were prepared using egfr scfv with a   fold range of affinities and their binding and uptake into egfr expressing tumor cells was quantified at scfv densities greater than   scfv il there was no effect of scfv affinity on il binding and uptake into tumor cells or on cytotoxicity at lower scfv densities there was less uptake and binding for ils constructed from the very low affinity c  scfv the results show the importance of antibody fragment density on nanoparticle uptake and suggest that engineering ultrahigh affinity scfv may be unnecessary for optimal nanoparticle targeting
