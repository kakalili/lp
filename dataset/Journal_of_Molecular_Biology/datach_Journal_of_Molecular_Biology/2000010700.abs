crystal structure of human ornithine decarboxylase at    resolution structural insights to antizyme binding edited by i a wilson
the polyamines spermidine and spermine are ubiquitous and required for cell growth and differentiation in eukaryotes ornithine decarboxylase odc ec      performs the first step in polyamine biosynthesis the decarboxylation of ornithine to putrescine elevated polyamine levels can lead to down regulation of odc activity by enhancing the translation of antizyme mrna resulting in subsequent binding of antizyme to odc monomers which targets odc for proteolysis by the  s proteasome the crystal structure of ornithine decarboxylase from human liver has been determined to    resolution by molecular replacement using truncated mouse odc       as the search model and refined to a crystallographic r factor of    and an r free value of     the human odc model includes several regions that are disordered in the mouse odc crystal structure including one of two c terminal basal degradation elements that have been demonstrated to independently collaborate with antizyme binding to target odc for degradation by the  s proteasome the crystal structure of human odc suggests that the c terminus which contains basal degradation elements necessary for antizyme induced proteolysis is not buried by the structural core of homodimeric odc as previously proposed analysis of the solvent accessible surface area surface electrostatic potential and the conservation of primary sequence between human odc and trypanosoma brucei odc provides clues to the identity of potential protein binding determinants in the putative antizyme binding element in human odc
