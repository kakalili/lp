structure of the full length human rpa   complex gives insights into the mechanism of dna binding and complex formation
replication protein a rpa is the ubiquitous eukaryotic single stranded dna ssdna binding protein and is essential for dna replication recombination and repair here crystal structures of the soluble rpa heterodimer composed of the rpa  and rpa  subunits have been determined for the full length protein in multiple crystal forms in all crystals the electron density for the n terminal residues     and c terminal residues      regions of rpa  is weak and of poor quality indicating that these regions are disordered and or assume multiple positions in the crystals hence the rpa  n terminus that is hyperphosphorylated in a cell cycle dependent manner and in response to dna damaging agents appears to be inherently disordered in the unphosphorylated state the c terminal winged helix loop helix protein  protein interaction domain adopts several conformations perhaps to facilitate its interaction with various proteins although the ordered regions of rpa   resemble the previously solved protease resistant core crystal structure the quaternary structures between the heterodimers are quite different thus the four helix bundle quaternary assembly noted in the original core structure is unlikely to be related to the quaternary structure of the intact heterotrimer an organic ligand binding site between subunits rpa  and rpa  was identified to bind dioxane comparison of the ssdna binding surfaces of rpa  with rpa   showed that the lower affinity of rpa   can be attributed to a shallower binding crevice with reduced positive electrostatic charge
