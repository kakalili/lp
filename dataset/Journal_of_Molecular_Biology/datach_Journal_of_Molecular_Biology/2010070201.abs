x ray crystallographic and md simulation studies on the mechanism of interfacial activation of a family i  lipase with two lids
the interfacial activation mechanism of family i  lipase from pseudomonas sp mis  pml  which has two  helical lids lid and lid  was investigated using a combination of x ray crystallography and molecular dynamics md simulation the crystal structure of pml in an open conformation was determined at     resolution in the presence of ca  and triton x   comparison of this structure with that in the closed conformation indicates that both lids greatly change their positions and lid is anchored by the calcium ion ca  in the open conformation this structure was not seriously changed even when the protein was dialyzed extensively against the ca  free buffer containing triton x   before crystallization indicating that the open conformation is fairly stable unless a micellar substance is removed the crystal structure of the pml derivative in which the active site serine residue ser   is diethylphosphorylated by soaking the crystal of pml in the open conformation in a solution containing diethyl p nitrophenyl phosphate was also determined this structure greatly resembles that in the open conformation indicating that pml structure in the open conformation represents that in the active form md simulation of pml in the open conformation in the absence of micelles showed that lid closes first while lid maintains its open conformation likewise md simulation of pml in the closed conformation in the absence of ca  and in the presence of octane or trilaurin micelles showed that lid opens while lid remains closed these results suggest that ca functions as a hook for stabilization of a fully opened conformation of lid and for initiation of subsequent opening of lid
