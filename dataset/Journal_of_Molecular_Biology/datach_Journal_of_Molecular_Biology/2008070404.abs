acetylation of l  increases interactions in the escherichia coli ribosomal stalk complex
the ribosomal stalk complex in escherichia coli consists of l  and four copies of l l  and is largely responsible for binding and recruiting translation factors structural characterisation of this stalk complex is difficult primarily due to its dynamics here we apply mass spectrometry to follow post translational modifications and their effect on structural changes of the stalk proteins on intact ribosomes our results show that increased acetylation of l  occurs during the stationary phase on ribosomes harvested from cells grown under optimal conditions for cells grown in minimal medium l  acetylation and processing is altered resulting in deficient removal of n terminal methionine in    of the l  population while processed l  is almost   acetylated our results show also that n acetylation of l  correlates with an increased stability of the stalk complex in the gas phase to investigate further the basis of this increased stability we applied a solution phase hydrogen deuterium exchange protocol to compare the rate of deuterium incorporation in the proteins l  l  l  and l  as well as the acetylated form of l  l  in situ on the ribosome results show that deuterium incorporation is consistently slower for l relative to l  and for l  when l is predominant our results imply a tightening of the interaction between l and l  relative to that between l  and l  since acetylation is predominant when cells are grown in minimal medium we propose that these modifications form part of the cell s strategy to increase stability of the stalk complex under conditions of stress more generally our results demonstrate that it is possible to discern the influence of a   da post translational modification by mass spectrometry and to record subtle changes in hydrogen deuterium exchange within the context of an intact   mda particle
