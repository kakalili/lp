structure of the c terminal rna binding domain of hnrnp d  auf  its interactions with rna and dna and change in backbone dynamics upon complex formation with dna edited by m f summers
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp d has two ribonucleoprotein rnp  type rna binding domains rbds  each of which can specifically bind to the uuag sequence hnrnp d also binds specifically to single stranded d ttaggg n the human telomeric dna repeat we have already reported the structure and interactions with rna of the n terminal rbd rbd  here the structure of the c terminal rbd rbd  determined by nmr is presented it folds into a compact   structure comprising an antiparallel  sheet packed against two  helices which is characteristic of rnp type rbds in addition to the four  strands commonly found in rnp type rbds an extra  strand termed     was found just before the fourth  strand yielding a five stranded  sheet candidate residues of rbd involved in the interactions with rna were identified by chemical shift perturbation analysis perturbation was detected on the  sheet side not on the opposite  helix side as observed for rbd  it is notable that the    to   region of rbd is involved in the interactions in contrast to the case of rbd  the chemical shift perturbation analysis also showed that rbd interacts with dna in essentially the same way as with rna changes in the backbone dynamics upon complex formation with dna were examined by means of model free analysis of relaxation data in free rbd  the    to   region exhibits slow conformational exchange on the milli to microsecond time scale the exchange is quenched upon complex formation the flexibility of free rbd may be utilized in the recognition process by allowing different conformational states to be accessed and facilitating induced fit additionally faster flexibility on the nano to picosecond time scale was observed for loop  located between   and   in free rbd  which is retained by the complex as well
