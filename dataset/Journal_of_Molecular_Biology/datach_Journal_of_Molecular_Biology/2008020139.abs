crystal structure at     of huntingtin interacting protein  hip  coiled coil domain reveals a charged surface suitable for hip protein interactor hippi
huntington s disease is a genetic neurological disorder that is triggered by the dissociation of the huntingtin protein htt from its obligate interaction partner huntingtin interacting protein  hip  the release of the huntingtin protein permits hip protein interactor hippi to bind to its recognition site on hip to form a hippi hip complex that recruits procaspase  to begin the process of apoptosis the interaction module between hippi and hip was predicted to resemble a death effector domain our    crystal structure of the hip      subfragment that includes f  and k   which is important for hippi binding is not a death effector domain but is a partially opened coiled coil the hip      model reveals a basic surface that we hypothesize to be suitable for binding hippi there is an opened region next to the putative hippi site that is highly negatively charged the acidic residues in this region are highly conserved in hip and a related protein hip r from different organisms but are not conserved in the yeast homologue of hip  sla p we have modeled    of the coiled coil domain by joining our new hip      structure to the hip      model protein data bank code  no  finally the middle of this coiled coil domain may be intrinsically flexible and suggests a new interaction model where hippi binds to a u shaped hip molecule
