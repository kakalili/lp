structure and substrate binding properties of cobb a sir homolog protein deacetylase from escherichia coli
sirtuins are nad dependent protein deacetylase enzymes that are broadly conserved from bacteria to human and have been implicated to play important roles in gene regulation metabolism and longevity cobb is a bacterial sirtuin that deacetylates acetyl coa synthetase acs at an active site lysine to stimulate its enzymatic activity here we report the structure of cobb bound to an acetyl lysine containing non cognate histone h substrate a comparison with the previously reported archaeal and eukaryotic sirtuin structures reveals the greatest variability in a small zinc binding domain implicated to play a particularly important role in substrate specific binding by the sirtuin proteins comparison of the cobb histone h complex with other sirtuin proteins in complex with acetyl lysine containing substrates further suggests that contacts to the acetyl lysine side chain and  sheet interactions with residues directly c terminal to the acetyl lysine represent conserved features of sirtuin substrate recognition isothermal titration calorimetry studies were used to compare the affinity of cobb for a variety of cognate and non cognate acetyl lysine bearing peptides revealing an exothermic reaction with relatively little discrimination between substrates in contrast similar studies employing intact acetylated acs protein as a substrate reveal a binding reaction that is endothermic suggesting that cobb recognition of substrate involves a burial of hydrophobic surface and or structural rearrangement involving substrate regions distal to the acetyl lysine binding site together these studies suggest that substrate specific binding by sirtuin proteins involves contributions from the zinc binding domain of the enzyme and substrate regions distal to the acetyl lysine binding site
