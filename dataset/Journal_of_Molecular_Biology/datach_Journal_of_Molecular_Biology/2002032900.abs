interaction of the myogenic determination factor myogenin with e  and a dna target mechanism and kinetics edited by k yamamoto
the myogenic determination factors myod myogenin myf  and mrf are members of the basic helix loop helix bhlh family of transcription factors and crucial agents of myogenesis the bhlh regions of these proteins enable them to dimerize with e proteins another class of the bhlh family and to bind a specific dna element known as an e box canntg consensus sequence  which results in the activation of muscle specific gene expression as a model for such assembly of the myogenic determination factor e protein dna ternary complex we have studied the physiologically relevant association of myogenin e  and the   e box of the acetylcholine receptor achr   subunit gene enhancer using the technique of electrophoretic mobility shift assay combined with order of addition and time course experiments we find that heterodimerization of myogenin with e  occurs prior to dna binding in addition we deduce the dissociation kd and rate k constants for each step in the formation of the myogenin e  dna ternary complex kinetic simulations indicate that at   c myogenin and e  heterodimerize with a kd of   m kon of   m   s   and koff of    s    and that subsequently the heterodimer binds the achr  subunit gene enhancer   e box with a kd of   nm with possible kon and koff values ranging from     to      m   s   and    to   s   respectively
