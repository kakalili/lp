the fellowship of the ring the ring  b box linker region interacts with the ring in trim  ro  contains a native autoantigenic epitope in sj gren syndrome and is an integral and conserved region in trim proteins
ro  is a major autoantigen that is targeted in the autoimmune disease sj gren syndrome and belongs to the tripartite motif trim protein family disease related antigenic epitopes are mainly found in the coiled coil domain of ro  but one such epitope is located in the zn  binding region which comprises an n terminal ring followed by a b box separated by a    residue linker peptide in the present study we extend the structural biophysical and immunological knowledge of this ring  b box linker rbl by employing an array of methods our bioinformatic investigations show that the rbl sequence motif is unique to trim proteins and can be classified into three distinct subtypes the rbl regions of all three subtypes are as conserved as their known flanking domains and all are predicted to comprise an amphipathic helix this helix formation is confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and is dependent on the presence of the ring immunological studies show that the rbl is part of a conformation dependent epitope and its antigenicity is likewise dependent on a structured ring domain recombinant ro  ring  rbl exists as a monomer in vitro and binding of two zn  increases its stability regions stabilized by zn  binding are identified by limited proteolysis and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry furthermore the residues of the ring and linker that interact with each other are identified by analysis of protection patterns which together with bioinformatic and biophysical data enabled us to propose a structural model of the ring  rbl based on modeling and docking experiments sequence similarities and evolutionary sequence patterns suggest that the results obtained from ro  are extendable to the entire trim protein family
