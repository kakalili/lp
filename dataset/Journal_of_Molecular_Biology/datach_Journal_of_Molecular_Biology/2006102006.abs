solution structure of the hdm c h c ring a domain critical for ubiquitination of p
regulation of the transcriptional response to the tumor suppressor p  occurs at many levels including control of its transcriptional activity and of its stability and concentration within the cell p  stability is regulated by the protein hdm  an e ubiquitin ligase that binds to p  and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation the c terminal domain of hdm  which is critical for this activity has been classified as a ring domain on the basis of sequence homology although it lacks the canonical set of zinc ligands ring domains typically have c hc or c c zinc coordination  here we report the solution structure of the c h c ring domain of hdm       which reveals a symmetrical dimer with a unique cross brace zinc binding scheme each subunit has one cys zn site and one his cys zn site the global fold of each subunit is similar to those reported for other ring domains with a compact     fold a small hydrophobic core and two zn ions which are essential for maintaining the domain structure the dimer structure is maintained by an extensive interface that buries a large hydrophobic area on each subunit it has been proposed that hdm and its homologue hdmx form a stable heterodimer through their ring domains resulting in a synergistic increase in observed e activity to test this proposal we prepared an hdmx ring construct and showed by nmr titration that it forms a tight   complex with the hdm ring the resonances most perturbed by heterodimer formation are located within the subunit interface of the homodimer far removed from the surface expected to form the docking site of the e ubiquitin conjugating enzyme providing a structure based rationale for the function of the ring domains in p  ubiquitination
