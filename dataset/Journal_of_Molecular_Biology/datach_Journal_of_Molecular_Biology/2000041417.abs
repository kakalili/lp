a novel type of receptor protein based on the lipocalin scaffold with specificity for digoxigenin edited by r huber
we demonstrate that the bilin binding protein a member of the lipocalin family of proteins can be structurally reshaped in order to specifically complex digoxigenin a steroid ligand commonly used for the non radioactive labelling of biomolecules   amino acid residues distributed across the four loops which form the binding site of the bilin binding protein were subjected to targeted random mutagenesis from the resulting library the variant diga  was obtained by combined use of phage display and a filter sandwich colony screening assay followed by in vitro affinity maturation diga  possesses strong binding activity and high specificity for the digoxigenin group with a kd of       nm the derivative compound digitoxigenin is bound even more tightly with a kd of       nm whereas the steroid glycoside ouabain is not recognized at all fusion proteins between diga  and alkaline phosphatase were constructed and shown to retain both the digoxigenin binding function and enzymatic activity irrespective of whether the enzyme was fused to the n or the c terminus of the bilin binding protein variant our findings suggest that the lipocalin scaffold can be generally employed for the construction of specific receptor proteins so called  anticalins   which provide a promising alternative to recombinant antibody fragments
