a common structural basis for ph and calmodulin mediated regulation in plant glutamate decarboxylase
glutamate decarboxylase gad catalyzes glutamate to  aminobutyrate conversion plant gad is a     kda hexamer involved in development and stress response and regulated by ph and binding of ca  calmodulin cam to the c terminal domain we determined the crystal structure of arabidopsis thaliana gad in its cam free state obtained a low resolution structure of the calmodulin activated gad complex by small angle x ray scattering and identified the crucial residues in the c terminal domain for regulation by ph and cam binding cam activates gad in a unique way by relieving two c terminal autoinhibition domains of adjacent active sites forming a   kda gad  cam complex with an unusual   stoichiometry the complex is loosely packed thanks to the flexible linkers connecting the enzyme core with the six c terminal regulatory domains the cam molecules retain considerable positional and orientational freedom with respect to gad  the complex thus represents a prototype for a novel cam target interaction mode thanks to its two levels of regulation both targeting the c terminal domain gad can respond flexibly to different kinds of cellular stress occurring at different ph values
