oligomeric structure and functional characterization of the urea transporter from actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae
urea transporters uts facilitate urea permeation across cell membranes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes bacteria use urea as a means to survive in acidic environments and or as a nitrogen source the ut from actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae aput the pathogen that causes porcine pleurisy and pneumonia was expressed in escherichia coli and purified analysis of the recombinant protein using cross linking and blue native gel electrophoresis established that aput is a dimer in detergent solution purified protein was reconstituted into proteoliposomes and urea efflux was measured by stopped flow fluorometry to determine the urea transport kinetics of aput the measured urea flux was saturable could be inhibited by phloretin and was not affected by ph two dimensional crystals of the biologically active aput show that it is also dimeric in a lipid membrane and provide the first structural information on a member of the ut family
