fast fitting of atomic structures to low resolution electron density maps by surface overlap maximization
the complexities of x ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy for large protein complexes and the comparative ease of approaches such as electron microscopy mean that low resolution structures are often available long before their atomic resolution equivalents to help bridge this gap in knowledge we present som an approach for finding the best fit of atomic resolution structures into lower resolution density maps through surface overlap maximization high resolution templates i e partial structures or models for multi subunit complexes and targets lower resolution maps are initially represented as iso surfaces the latter are used first in a fast search for transformations that superimpose a significant portion of the target surface onto the template surface which is quantified as surface overlap the vast search space is reduced by considering key vectors that capture local surface information the set of transformations with the highest surface overlap scores are then re ranked by using more sophisticated scores including cross correlation we give a number of examples to illustrate the efficiency of the method and its restrictions for targets for which partial complexes are available the speed and performance of the method make it an attractive complement to existing methods as many different hypotheses can be tested quickly on a single processor
