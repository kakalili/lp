the crystal structure of escherichia coli moea a protein from the molybdopterin synthesis pathway edited by d rees
moea is involved in synthesis of the molybdopterin cofactor although its function is not yet clearly defined the three dimensional structure of the escherichia coli protein was solved at    resolution the locations of highly conserved residues among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic moea homologs identifies a cleft in the dimer interface as the likely functional site of the four domains of moea domain  displays a novel fold and domains  and  each have only one known structural homolog domain  in contrast is structurally similar to many other proteins the protein that resembles domain  most closely is moga another protein required for molybdopterin cofactor synthesis the overall similarity between moea and moga and the similarities in a constellation of residues that are strongly conserved in moea suggests that these proteins bind similar ligands or substrates and may have similar functions
