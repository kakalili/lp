queen bee pheromone binding protein ph induced domain swapping favors pheromone release
in honeybee apis mellifera societies the queen controls the development and the caste status of the members of the hive queen bees secrete pheromonal blends comprising  or more major and minor components mainly hydrophobic the major component  keto  e decenoic acid  oda  acts on the workers and male bees drones  eliciting social or sexual responses  oda is captured in the antennal lymph and transported to the pheromone receptor s in the sensory neuron membranes by pheromone binding proteins pbps  a key issue is to understand how the pheromone once tightly bound to its pbp is released to activate the receptor we report here on the structure at physiological ph of the main antennal pbp asp  identified in workers and male honeybees in its apo or complexed form particularly with the main component of the queen mandibular pheromonal mixture  oda  contrary to the asp structure at low ph the asp structure at ph   is a domain swapped dimer with one or two ligands per monomer this dimerization is disrupted by a unique residue mutation since asp  asn and asp  ala mutants remain monomeric at ph    as does native asp at ph    asp  is conserved in only    of medium chain pbps and is replaced by other residues such as asn ala and ser among others thus excluding that they may perform domain swapping therefore these different medium chain pbps as well as pbps from moths very likely exhibit different mechanisms of ligand release or receptor recognition
