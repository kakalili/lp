the stn  syntrophin gene of c elegans is functionally related to dystrophin and dystrobrevin
syntrophins are a family of pdz domain containing adaptor proteins required for receptor localization syntrophins are also associated with the dystrophin complex in muscles we report here the molecular and functional characterization of the caenorhabditis elegans gene stn  f a    which encodes a syntrophin with homology to vertebrate alpha and beta syntrophins stn  is expressed in neurons and in muscles of c elegans stn  mutants resemble dystrophin dys  and dystrobrevin dyb  mutants they are hyperactive bend their heads when they move forward tend to hypercontract and are hypersensitive to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb these phenotypes are suppressed when stn  is expressed under the control of a muscular promoter indicating that they are caused by the absence of stn  in muscles these results suggest that the role of syntrophin is linked to dystrophin function in c elegans
