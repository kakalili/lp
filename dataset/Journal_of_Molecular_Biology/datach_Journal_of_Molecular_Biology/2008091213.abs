the molecular structure of epoxide hydrolase b from mycobacterium tuberculosis and its complex with a urea based inhibitor
mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb  the intracellular pathogen that infects macrophages primarily is the causative agent of the infectious disease tuberculosis in humans the mtb genome encodes at least six epoxide hydrolases ehs a to f  ehs convert epoxides to trans dihydrodiols and have roles in drug metabolism as well as in the processing of signaling molecules herein we report the crystal structures of unbound mtb ehb and mtb ehb bound to a potent low nanomolar ic     nm urea based inhibitor at   and     resolution respectively the enzyme is a homodimer each monomer adopts the classical    hydrolase fold that composes the catalytic domain there is a cap domain that regulates access to the active site the catalytic triad comprising asp   his  and asp   protrudes from the catalytic domain into the substrate binding cavity between the two domains the urea portion of the inhibitor is bound in the catalytic cavity mimicking in part the substrate binding the two urea nitrogen atoms donate hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic carboxylate of asp   and the carbonyl oxygen of the urea moiety receives hydrogen bonds from the phenolic oxygen atoms of tyr  and tyr   the phenolic oxygen groups of these two residues provide electrophilic assistance during the epoxide hydrolytic cleavage upon inhibitor binding the binding site residues undergo subtle structural rearrangement in particular the side chain of ile  exhibits a rotation of around    about its c   c  bond in order to accommodate the inhibitor these findings have not only shed light on the enzyme mechanism but also have opened a path for the development of potent inhibitors with good pharmacokinetic profiles against all mtb ehs of the    type
