on the divalent metal ion dependence of dna cleavage by restriction endonucleases of the ecori family
restriction endonucleases of the pd  d exk family need mg  for dna cleavage whereas mg  or mn  promotes catalysis ca  without mg  only supports dna binding the role of mg  in dna cleavage by restriction endonucleases has elicited many hypotheses differing mainly in the number of mg  involved in catalysis to address this problem we measured the mg  and mn  concentration dependence of dna cleavage by bamhi bglii cfr i ecori ecorii catalytic domain  mboi ngomiv pspgi and ssoii which were reported in co crystal structure analyses to bind one bglii and ecori or two bamhi and ngomiv me  per active site dna cleavage experiments were carried out at various mg  and mn  concentrations at constant ionic strength all enzymes show a qualitatively similar mg  and mn  concentration dependence in general the mg  concentration optimum between   and   mm is higher than the mn  concentration optimum between    and  mm  at still higher mg  or mn  concentrations the activities of all enzymes tested are reduced but can be reactivated by ca  based on these results we propose that one mg  or mn  is critical for restriction enzyme activation and binding of a second me  plays a role in modulating the activity steady state kinetics carried out with ecori and bamhi suggest that binding of a second mg  or mn  mainly leads to an increase in km such that the inhibitory effect of excess mg  or mn  can be overcome by increasing the substrate concentration our conclusions are supported by molecular dynamics simulations and are consistent with the structural observations of both one and two me  binding to these enzymes
