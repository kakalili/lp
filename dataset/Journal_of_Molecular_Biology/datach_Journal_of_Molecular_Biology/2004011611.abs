features of the plasmid pmv  encoded mobm a protein involved in its mobilization   dedicated to the late brian m wilkins an excellent scientist and gentleman
the streptococcal promiscuous plasmid pmv  can be mobilized between a number of bacterial species by means of three elements  i the plasmid encoded nicking closing protein mobm involved in the initiation and termination of the conjugative transfer  ii the dna sequence where the mobm mediated nick takes place the oritpmv   and iii the function s provided by auxiliary plasmids mobm belongs to the pre mob family of plasmid encoded dna relaxing proteins relaxases  purified mobm protein has been used to assay cleavage conditions on plasmid supercoiled dna some structural features of mobm have been addressed by analytical ultracentrifugation circular dichroism thermal denaturation and fluorescence emission the protein behaved as a dimer of identical subunits with an ellipsoidal shape mobm showed a high about   alpha helical content and a midpoint denaturation of about   c cell fractionation assays showed that mobm was associated to the cell membrane this association was abolished when a great alteration was introduced within a putative coiled coil located at the c terminal region of the protein emission fluorescence suggested that the three trp residues of mobm are located within a hydrophobic environment a molecular model of mobm on the known structure of colicin ia has been built
