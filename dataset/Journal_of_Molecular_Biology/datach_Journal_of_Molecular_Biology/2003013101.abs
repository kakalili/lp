analysis of regions within the bacteriophage t asia protein involved in its binding to the   subunit of e coli rna polymerase and its role as a transcriptional inhibitor and co activator
bacteriophage t asia a protein of  amino acid residues binds to the   subunit of escherichia coli rna polymerase and inhibits host or t early transcription or together with the t mota protein activates t middle transcription to investigate which regions within asia are involved in forming a complex with   and in providing transcriptional functions we generated random mutations throughout asia and targeted mutations within the c terminal region we tested mutant proteins for their ability to complement the growth of t asia am phage under non suppressing conditions to inhibit e coli growth to interact with   region  in a two hybrid assay to bind to   in a native protein gel and to inhibit or activate transcription in vitro using a t middle promoter that is active with rna polymerase alone is inhibited by asia and is activated by mota asia we find that substitutions within the n terminal half of asia at amino acid residues v  l  and i  rendered the protein defective for binding to    these residues reside at the monomer  monomer interface in recent nmr structures of the asia dimer in contrast asia missing the c terminal  amino acid residues interacted well with   region  in the two hybrid assay and asia missing the c terminal  amino acid residues       bound to   and was fully competent in standard in vitro transcription assays however the presence of the c terminal region delayed formation of transcriptionally competent species when the asia polymerase complex was pre incubated with the promoter in the absence of mota our results suggest that amino acid residues within the n terminal half of asia are involved in forming or maintaining the asia   complex the c terminal region of asia while not absolutely required for inhibition or co activation aids inhibition by slowing the formation of transcription complexes between a promoter and the asia polymerase complex
