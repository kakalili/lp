inter oligomer interactions of the human prion protein are modulated by the polymorphism at codon
the common polymorphism at codon   in the human prion protein prp has been shown in many studies to influence not only the pathology of prion disease but also the misfolding propensity of prp here we used nmr cd and atomic force microscopy in solution to investigate differences in  oligomer  o formation and inter oligomer interaction depending on the polymorphism at codon   nmr investigations assigned the observable amide resonances to the  o n terminal segments showing that it is the core region of prp residues      that is involved in  o formation atomic force microscopy revealed distinctive       nm disk like structures that form stacks through inter oligomer interactions the propensity to form stacks and the number of oligomers involved depended on the polymorphism at codon   with a significantly lower degree of stacking for  o with valine at position   this result provides evidence for conformational differences between the  o allelic forms showing that the core region of the protein including position   is actively involved in inter oligomer interactions consistent with nmr observations
