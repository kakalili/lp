temperature dependent dynamics of the villin headpiece helical subdomain an unusually small thermostable protein
n spin relaxation experiments were used to measure the temperature dependence of protein backbone conformational fluctuations in the thermostable helical subdomain hp  of the f actin binding headpiece domain of chicken villin hp  is the smallest domain of a naturally occurring protein that folds cooperatively to a compact native state spin  lattice spin  spin and heteronuclear nuclear overhauser effect relaxation data for backbone amide  n spins were collected at five temperatures in the range of     k the data were analyzed using a model free formalism to determine generalized order parameters s that describe the distribution of n  h bond vector orientations in a molecular reference frame a novel parameter   dln   s dlnt is introduced to characterize the temperature dependence of s an average value of    is obtained for residues in helical conformations in hp  this value of  is not reproduced by model potential energy functions commonly used to parameterize s the maximum entropy principle was used to derive a new model potential function that reproduces both s and   contributions to the entropy sr and heat capacity cpr from reorientational conformational fluctuations were analyzed using this potential energy function values of sr show a qualitative dependence on s similar to that obtained for the diffusion in a cone model however quantitative differences of up to  k in which k is the boltzmann constant are observed values of cpr approach zero for small values of s and approach k for large values of s the largest values of cpr are predicted to occur for intermediate values of s the results suggest that backbone dynamics as probed by relaxation measurements make very little contribution to the heat capacity difference between folded and unfolded states for hp
