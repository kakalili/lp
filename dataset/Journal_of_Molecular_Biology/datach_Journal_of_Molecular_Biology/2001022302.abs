a new target for shigellosis rational design and crystallographic studies of inhibitors of trna guanine transglycosylase edited by r huber
eubacterial trna guanine transglycosylase tgt is involved in the hyper modification of cognate trnas leading to the exchange of g  at the wobble position in the anticodon loop by preq   amino  aminomethyl pyrrolo   d pyrimidin  h one as part of the biosynthesis of queuine q  mutation of the tgt gene in shigella flexneri results in a significant loss of pathogenicity of the bacterium revealing tgt as a new target for the design of potent drugs against shigellosis the x ray structure of zymomonas mobilis tgt in complex with preq was used to search for new putative inhibitors with the computer program ludi an initial screen of the available chemical directory a database compiled from commercially available compounds suggested several hits of these  aminophthalhydrazide aph showed an inhibition constant in the low micromolar range the     crystal structure of aph in complex with z mobilis tgt served as a starting point for further modification of this initial lead
