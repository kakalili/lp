asymmetric binding of histone h stabilizes mmtv nucleosomes and the interaction of progesterone receptor with the exposed hre
packaging of mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv promoter sequences in nucleosomes modulates access of dna binding proteins and influences the interaction among dna bound transcription factors here we analyze the binding of histone h to mmtv mononucleosomes assembled with recombinant histones and study its influence on nucleosome structure and stability as well as on progesterone receptor pr binding to the hormone responsive elements hres  the mmtv nucleosomes can be separated into three main populations two of which exhibited precise translational positioning histone h bound preferentially to the   distal nucleosomal dna protecting additional    nt from digestion by micrococcal nuclease binding of histone h was unaffected by prior crosslinking of protein and dna in nucleosomes with formaldehyde neither the translational nor the rotational nucleosome positioning was altered by histone h binding but the nucleosomes were stabilized as judged by the kinetics of nuclease cleavage unexpectedly binding of recombinant pr to the exposed distal hre i in nucleosomes was enhanced in the presence of histone h  as demonstrated by band shift and footprinting experiments this enhanced pr affinity may contribute to the reported positive effect of histone h on the hormonal activation of mmtv reporter genes
