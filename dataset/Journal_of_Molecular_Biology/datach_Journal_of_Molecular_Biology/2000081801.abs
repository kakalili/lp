preferential binding of fd gene  protein to tetraplex nucleic acid structures edited by a klug
the gene  protein of filamentous bacteriophage fd is a single stranded dna binding protein that binds non specifically to all single stranded nucleic acid sequences but in addition is capable of specific binding to the sequence d gt g ct c and the rna equivalent r gu g cu c  the latter interaction being important for translational repression we show that this sequence preference arises from the formation of a tetraplex structure held together by a central block of g quartets the structure of which persists in the complex with gene  protein binding of gene  protein to the tetraplex leads to formation of a    kda nucleoprotein complex consisting of four oligonucleotide strands and eight gene  protein dimers with a radius of gyration of    and an overall maximum dimension of        a model of the complex is presented that is consistent with the data obtained it is proposed that the g quartet may act as a nucleation site for binding gene  protein to adjacent single stranded regions suggesting a novel mechanism for translational repression
