crystal structure of a fab complex formed with pfmsp   the c terminal fragment of merozoite surface protein  from plasmodium falciparum a malaria vaccine candidate
merozoite surface protein  msp  is the major protein component on the surface of the merozoite the erythrocyte invasive form of the malaria parasite plasmodium present in all species of plasmodium it undergoes two distinct proteolytic maturation steps during the course of merozoite development that are essential for invasion of the erythrocyte antibodies specific for the c terminal maturation product msp   can inhibit erythrocyte invasion and parasite growth this polypeptide is therefore considered to be one of the more promising malaria vaccine candidates we describe here the crystal structure of recombinant msp   from p falciparum pfmsp    the most virulent species of the parasite in humans as a complex with the fab fragment of the monoclonal antibody g    this antibody recognises a discontinuous epitope comprising  residues on the first epidermal growth factor egf like domain of pfmsp   although g   was raised against the recombinant antigen expressed in an insect cell baculovirus system it binds uniformly to the surface of merozoites from the late schizont stage showing that the cognate epitope is exposed on the naturally occurring msp polypeptide complex although the epitope includes residues that have been mapped to regions recognised by invasion inhibiting antibodies studied by other workers g   does not inhibit erythrocyte invasion or msp processing
