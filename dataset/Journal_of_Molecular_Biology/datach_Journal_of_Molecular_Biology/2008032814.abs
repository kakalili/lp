structural lability in stem  loop  drives a   utr    utr interaction in coronavirus replication
the leader rna of the   untranslated region utr of coronaviral genomes contains two stem  loop structures denoted sl and sl  herein we show that sl is functionally and structurally bipartite while the upper region of sl is required to be paired we observe strong genetic selection against viruses that contain a deletion of a  an extrahelical nucleotide that destabilizes sl  in favor of genomes that contain a diverse panel of destabilizing second site mutations due to introduction of a noncanonical base pair near a  viruses containing destabilizing sl  a  mutations also contain one of two specific mutations in the   utr thermal denaturation and imino proton solvent exchange experiments reveal that the lower half of sl is unstable and that second site sl  a  substitutions are characterized by one or more features of the wild type sl  we propose a  dynamic sl   model in which the base of sl has an optimized lability required to mediate a physical interaction between the   utr and the   utr that stimulates subgenomic rna synthesis although not conserved at the nucleotide sequence level these general structural characteristics of sl appear to be conserved in other coronaviral genomes
