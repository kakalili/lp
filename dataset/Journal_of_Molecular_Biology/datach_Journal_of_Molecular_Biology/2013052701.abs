towards an understanding of channelrhodopsin function simulations lead to novel insights of the channel mechanism
channelrhodopsins chrs are light gated cation channels that mediate ion transport across membranes in microalgae vectorial catalysis  chrs gain increasing attention as useful tools for the analysis of neural networks in tissues and living animals optogenetics  in fact various mutagenesis approaches have realized practical applications with high reliability by enhancement of the expression level channel kinetics control and color tuning furthermore the recently published x ray structure has provided valuable information for further atomistic studies and engineering chrs for a wider application the present study is a computational attempt to describe the functional mechanism at the atomic level based on the x ray structure we present several structural characteristics that are highly involved in ion channel gating and ion transport including   water distribution   cation binding sites   intrahelical hydrogen bond   dc gate and   active site
