rapid kinetic analysis of transcription elongation by escherichia coli rna polymerase
nucleotide incorporation during transcription by rna polymerase is accompanied by pyrophosphate formation rapid release of pyrophosphate from the elongation complex at a rate consistent with productive transcription elongation occurs only in the presence of the correct next nucleotide for incorporation into the transcript
