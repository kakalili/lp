reconstitution and engineering of apoptotic protein interactions on the bacterial cell surface
the interactions between pro and anti apoptotic members of the bcl  class of proteins control whether a cell lives or dies and the study of these protein  protein interactions has been an area of intense research in this report we describe a new tool for the study and engineering of apoptotic protein interactions that is based on the flow cytometric detection of these interactions on the surface of escherichia coli after validation of the assay with the well studied interaction between the bak     peptide and the anti apoptotic protein bcl xl the effect of both increasing and decreasing bak peptide length on bcl xl binding was investigated previous work demonstrated that the bak     peptide also binds to the anti apoptotic protein bcl  albeit with lower binding affinity compared to bcl xl here we demonstrate that a slightly longer bak peptide corresponding to amino acids     of bak binds bcl xl and bcl  equally well approximate binding affinity calculations on these peptide  protein complexes confirm the experimental observations the flow cytometric assay was also used to screen a saturation mutagenesis library of bak     variants for improved affinity to bcl xl the best variants obtained from this library exhibit an apparent kd to bcl xl  fold lower than that of wild type bak
