crystal structure of the d s mutant of bacteriorhodopsin model of an o like photocycle intermediate edited by d rees
crystal structures are reported for the d s and d s f  l mutants of the light driven proton hydroxyl pump bacteriorhodopsin these mutants crystallize in the orthorhombic c   spacegroup and provide the first demonstration that monoolein based cubic lipid phase crystallization can support the growth of well diffracting crystals in non hexagonal spacegroups both structures exhibit similar and substantial differences relative to wild type bacteriorhodopsin suggesting that they represent inherent features resulting from neutralization of the schiff base counterion asp  we argue that these structures provide a model for the last photocycle intermediate o of bacteriorhodopsin in which asp  is protonated the proton release group is deprotonated and the retinal has reisomerized to all trans unlike for the m and n photointermediates where structural changes occur mainly on the cytoplasmic side here the large scale changes are confined to the extracellular side as in the m intermediate the side chain of arg  is in a downward configuration and in addition a  cloud hydrogen bond forms between trp  ne and trp   on the cytoplasmic side there is increased hydration near the surface suggesting how asp  might communicate with the bulk during the rise of the o intermediate
