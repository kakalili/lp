structural changes in  crystallin and whole eye lens during heating observed by low angle x ray diffraction
whole eye lens and  crystallin gels and solutions were investigated using x ray scattering techniques at temperatures ranging from   c to   c in whole lens isolated in phosphate buffered saline the spacing of the dominant x ray reflection seen with low angle scattering was constant from   c to   c but increased at   c from   nm to   nm at room temperature the small angle x ray diffraction pattern of the intact lens was very similar to the pattern of  crystallin gels at near physiological concentration     mg ml  so it is reasonable to assume that the  crystallin pattern dominates the pattern of the intact lens our results therefore indicate that in whole lens  crystallin is capable of maintaining its structural properties over a wide range of temperature this property would be useful in providing protection for other lens proteins super aggregating in the  crystallin gels a moderate increase in both the spacing and intensity of the reflection was observed from   c to   c followed by an accelerated increase from   c to   c upon cooling this effect was found to be irreversible over  hours qualitatively similar results were observed for  crystallin solutions at a variety of lower concentrations
