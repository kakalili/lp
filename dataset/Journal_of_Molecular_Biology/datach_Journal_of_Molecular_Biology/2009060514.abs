the first n terminal amino acids of  synuclein are essential for  helical structure formation in vitro and membrane binding in yeast
synuclein   syn  a protein implicated in parkinson s disease is structurally diverse in addition to its random coil state   syn can adopt an  helical structure upon lipid membrane binding or a  sheet structure upon aggregation we used yeast biology and in vitro biochemistry to detect how sequence changes alter the structural propensity of  syn the n terminus of the protein which adopts an  helical conformation upon lipid binding is essential for membrane binding in yeast and variants that are more prone to forming an  helical structure in vitro are generally more toxic to yeast   sheet structure and inclusion formation on the other hand appear to be protective possibly by sequestering the protein from the membrane surprisingly sequential deletion of residues  through  caused a dramatic drop in  helical propensity vesicle binding in vitro and membrane binding and toxicity in yeast part of which could be mimicked by mutating aspartic acid at position  to alanine variants with distinct structural preferences identified here by a reductionist approach provide valuable tools for elucidating the nature of toxic forms of  syn in neurons
