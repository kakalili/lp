In eubacteria, ribosome stalling during protein synthesis is rescued by a tmRNA-derived trans-translation system. Because ribosomal protein S1 specifically binds to tmRNA with high affinity, it is considered to be involved in the trans-translation system. However, the role of S1 in trans-translation is still unclear. To study the function of S1 in the trans-translation system, we constructed an S1-free cell-free translation system. We found that trans-translation proceeded even in the absence of S1. Addition of S1 into the S1-free system did not affect trans-translation efficiency. These results suggest that S1 does not play a role in the trans-translation machinery.
