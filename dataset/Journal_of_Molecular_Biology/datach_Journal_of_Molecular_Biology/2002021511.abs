the crystal structure of human mrp  s  a  a ca  dependent regulator protein in inflammatory process edited by r huber
human mrp  hmrp  is a ca  binding protein from the s  family of proteins this protein is co expressed with human mrp  hmrp  a homologue protein in myeloid cells and plays an indispensable role in ca  dependent functions during inflammation this role includes the activation of mac  the   integrin which is involved in neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells the crystal structure of the holo form of hmrp  was analyzed at    resolution hmrp  is distinguished from other s  member proteins by its long c terminal region and its structure shows that the region is extensively flexible in this crystal structure of hmrp  chaps molecules bind to the hinge region that connects two ef hand motifs which suggests that this region is a target binding site of this protein based on a structural comparison of hmrp  with hmrp and human s  a  hs  a  that is another homologue protein the character of mrp   hetero complex and the functional significance of the flexibility of the c terminal region of hmrp  are discussed
