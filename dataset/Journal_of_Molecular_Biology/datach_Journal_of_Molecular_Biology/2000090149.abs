specificity in protein protein interactions the structural basis for dual recognition in endonuclease colicin immunity protein complexes edited by a r fersht
bacteria producing endonuclease colicins are protected against their cytotoxic activity by virtue of a small immunity protein that binds with high affinity and specificity to inactivate the endonuclease dnase binding by the immunity protein occurs through a  dual recognition  mechanism in which conserved residues from helix iii act as the binding site anchor while variable residues from helix ii define specificity we now report the    crystal structure of the   kda complex formed between the endonuclease domain of colicin e and its cognate immunity protein im  which provides a molecular rationale for this mechanism conserved residues of im form a binding energy hotspot through a combination of backbone hydrogen bonds to the endonuclease many via buried solvent molecules and hydrophobic interactions at the core of the interface while the specificity determining residues interact with corresponding specificity side chains on the enzyme comparison between the present structure and that reported recently for the colicin e endonuclease domain in complex with im highlights how specificity is achieved by very different interactions in the two complexes predominantly hydrophobic in nature in the e im complex but charged in the e im complex a key feature of both complexes is the contact between a conserved tyrosine residue from the immunity proteins im tyr  with a specificity residue on the endonuclease directing it toward the specificity sites of the immunity protein remarkably this tyrosine residue and its neighbour im tyr  are the pivots of a    rigid body rotation that relates the positions of im and im in the two complexes this rotation does not affect conserved immunity protein interactions with the endonuclease but results in different regions of the specificity helix being presented to the enzyme
