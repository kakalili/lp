mapping the molecular interface between the   subunit of e coli rna polymerase and t asia edited by m gottesman
bacteriophage t antisigma protein asia   kda orchestrates a switch from the host and early viral transcription to middle viral transcription by binding to the   subunit of e coli rna polymerase the molecular determinants of   asia complex formation are not known here we used combinatorial peptide chemistry protein protein crosslinking and mutational analysis to study the interaction between asia and its target the  amino acid residues long   peptide containing conserved region   many region   amino acid residues contact asia which likely completely occludes the dna binding surface of region   though none of region   amino acid residues is singularly responsible for the very tight interaction with asia    lys  and arg  which lie outside the putative dna recognition element of region   contribute the most in asia the first  amino acid residues are both necessary and sufficient for interactions with    our results clarify details of   asia interaction and open the way for engineering asia derivatives with altered specificities
