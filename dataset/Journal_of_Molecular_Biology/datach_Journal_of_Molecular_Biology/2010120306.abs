a divergent substrate binding loop within the pro oncogenic protein anterior gradient  forms a docking site for reptin
anterior gradient  agr  functions in a range of biological systems including goblet cell formation limb regeneration inhibition of p  and metastasis there are no well validated binding proteins for agr protein despite the wealth of data implicating an important cellular function in vertebrates the yeast two hybrid system was used to isolate the atp binding protein reptin as an agr interacting protein agr formed a stable complex in human cell lysates with reptin thus validating reptin as an agr binding protein in cells reptin was also shown to be overproduced in a panel of primary breast cancer biopsy specimens relative to normal adjacent tissue from the same patient suggesting a role in cancer growth in vivo mutations were made at the two atp binding motifs in reptin to evaluate the effects of atp on reptin  agr complex stability loss of atp binding mutations at the walker a motif k a or gain of atp binding mutations at the walker b motif d  n resulted in reptin mutants with altered oligomerization thermostability and agr binding properties these data indicate that the two atp binding motifs of reptin play a role in regulating the stability of the agr  reptin complex the minimal region of agr interacting with reptin was localized using overlapping peptide libraries derived from the agr protein sequence the reptin docking site was mapped to a divergent octapeptide loop in the agr superfamily between amino acids   and   mutations at codon y  or f  in full length agr destabilized the binding of reptin these data highlight the existence of a protein docking motif on agr and an atp regulated peptide binding activity for reptin this knowledge has implications for isolating other agr interacting proteins for developing assays to isolate small molecules that target the reptin atp binding site and for measuring the effects of the reptin  agr complex in cancer cell growth
