direct in vivo intracellular selection of conformation sensitive antibody domains targeting alzheimer s amyloid  oligomers
the development of conformation sensitive antibody domains targeting the misfolding beta amyloid a  peptide is of great interest for research into alzheimer s disease ad we describe the direct selection by the intracellular antibody capture technology iact  of a panel of anti a  single chain fv antibody fragments scfvs  targeting pathologically relevant conformations of a  a lexa a    fusion protein was expressed in yeast cells as the  intracellular antigen   two different scfv antibody libraries single pot libraries of intracellular antibodies splint were used for the intracellular selections  i a na ve library derived from a natural non immune source of mouse antibody variable region v genes and ii an immune library constructed from the repertoire of antibody v genes of a  immunized mice this led to the isolation of  different anti a  scfvs which bind a  both in the yeast cell as well as in vitro if used as purified recombinant proteins surprisingly all the anti a  scfvs isolated are conformation sensitive showing a high degree of specificity towards a  oligomers with respect to monomeric a  while also displaying some degree of sequence specificity recognizing either the n terminal or the c terminal part of a    in particular the scfvs selected from a  immune splint library show a relevant n terminal epitope bias representative candidates from this panel of the anti a  scfvs were shown to recognize in vivo produced a   deposits  in histological sections from human ad brains and to display good neutralization properties significantly inhibiting a  oligomer induced toxicity and synaptic binding of a  oligomers in neuronal cultured cells the properties of these anti a  antibody domains as well as their direct availability for intra or extra cellular  genetic delivery  make them ideally suited for new experimental approaches to study and image the intracellular processing and trafficking of a  oligomers
