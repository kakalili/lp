c elegans sti  the homolog of sti hop is involved in aging and stress response
environmental and physiological stresses such as heat shock oxidative stress heavy metals and pathogenic conditions induce cellular stress response this response is often mediated by heat shock proteins that function as molecular chaperones a stress inducible cochaperone sti hop hsp organizer protein  functions as an adaptor protein that simultaneously binds with hsp  and hsp  to transfer client proteins from hsp  to hsp  however the biological role of sti  in vivo is poorly understood in metazoans here we report the characterization of the caenorhabditis elegans homolog of sti hop which is approximately   identical with human sti  c elegans sti  cesti  is expressed in the pharynx intestine nervous system and muscle from larvae to adults analysis of proteins immunoprecipitated with anti sti  antibody by mass spectrometry revealed that cesti  can bind with both hsp  and hsp  homologs like its mammalian counterpart sti  expression is elevated by heat stress and an sti  jh   null mutant shows decreased fertility under heat stress conditions these mutants also show abnormally high lethality in extreme heat and may be functioning with daf  in thermotolerance in addition sti  jh   mutants have a shortened life span our results confirm that cesti  is a cochaperone protein that may maintain homeostatic functions during episodes of stress and can regulate longevity in nematodes
