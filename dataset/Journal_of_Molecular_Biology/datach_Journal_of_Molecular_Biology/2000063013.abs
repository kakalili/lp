structural characterization and membrane binding properties of the matrix protein vp  of ebola virus edited by j karn
the matrix protein vp  of ebola virus is believed to play a central role in viral assembly as it targets the plasma membrane of infected cells and subsequently forms a tightly packed layer on the inner side of the viral envelope expression of vp  in escherichia coli and subsequent proteolysis yielded two structural variants differing by a c terminal truncation   amino acid residues long as indicated by chemical cross linking studies and electron microscopy the larger polypeptide was present in a monomeric form whereas the truncated one formed hexamers when analyzed for their in vitro binding properties both constructs showed that only monomeric vp  efficiently associated with membranes containing negatively charged lipids membrane association of truncated hexameric vp  was inefficient indicating a membrane recognition role for the c terminal part based on these observations we propose that assembly of ebola virus involves the formation of vp  hexamers that is mediated by the n terminal part of the polypeptide
