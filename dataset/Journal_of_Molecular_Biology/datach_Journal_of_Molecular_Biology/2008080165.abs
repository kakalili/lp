the solution structure of the simian foamy virus protease reveals a monomeric protein
in contrast to orthoretroviruses foamy viruses fvs express their pol polyprotein from a separate pol specific transcript only the integrase domain is cleaved off leading to a protease reverse transcriptase pr rt protein we purified the separate pr domain prshort of simian fv from macaques by expressing the recombinant gene in escherichia coli sedimentation analyses and size exclusion chromatography indicate that prshort is a stable monomer in solution this allowed us to determine the structure of the prshort monomer using   experimental restraints derived from nmr spectroscopy the superposition of  conformers resulted in a backbone atom rmsd of     for residues gln  leu  although the overall folds are similar the macaque simian fv prshort reveals significant differences in the dimerization interface relative to other retroviral prs such as hiv  human immunodeficiency virus type  pr which appear to be rather stable dimers especially the flap region and the n and c termini of prshort are highly flexible neglecting these regions the backbone atom rmsd drops to      highlighting the good definition of the central part of the protein to exclude that the monomeric state of prshort is due to cleaving off the rt we purified the complete pr rt and performed size exclusion chromatography our data show that pr rt is also monomeric we thus conclude adoption of a monomeric state of pr rt to be a regulatory mechanism to inhibit pr activity before virus assembly in order to reduce packaging problems dimerization might therefore be triggered by additional viral or cellular factors
