surface for catalysis by poliovirus rna dependent rna polymerase
the poliovirus rna dependent rna polymerase  dpol replicates the viral genomic rna on the surface of virus induced intracellular membranes macromolecular assemblies of dpol form linear arrays of subunits that propagate along a strong protein  protein interaction called interface i as was observed in the crystal structure of wild type poliovirus polymerase these  filaments  recur with slight modifications in planar sheets and with additional modifications that accommodate curvature in helical tubes of the polymerase by packing filaments together via a second set of interactions periodic variations of subunit orientations within dpol tubes give rise to  ghost reflections  in diffraction patterns computed from electron cryomicrographs of helical arrays the ghost reflections reveal that polymerase tubes are formed by bundles of four to five interface i filaments which are then connected to the next bundle of filaments with a perturbation of interface interactions between bundles while enzymatically inactive polymerase is also capable of oligomerization much thinner tubes that lack interface i interactions between adjacent subunits are formed suggesting that long range allostery produces conformational changes that extend from the active site to the protein  protein interface macromolecular assemblies of poliovirus polymerase show repeated use of flexible interface interactions for polymerase lattice formation suggesting that adaptability of polymerase  polymerase interactions facilitates rna replication in addition the presence of a positively charged groove identified in polymerase arrays may help position and stabilize the rna template during replication
