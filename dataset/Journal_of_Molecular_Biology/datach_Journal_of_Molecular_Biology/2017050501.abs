interactions between tau and different conformations of tubulin implications for tau function and mechanism
tau is a multifaceted neuronal protein that stabilizes microtubules mts  but the mechanism of this activity remains poorly understood questions include whether tau binds mts laterally or longitudinally and whether tau s binding affinity depends on the nucleotide state of tubulin we observed that tau binds tightly to dolastatin  tubulin rings and promotes the formation of dolastatin  ring stacks implying that tau can crosslink mt protofilaments laterally in addition we found that tau prefers gdp like tubulin conformations which implies that tau binding to the mt surface is biased away from the dynamic gtp rich mt tip to investigate the potential impact of these tau activities on mt stabilization we incorporated them into our previously developed dimer scale computational model of mt dynamics we found that lateral crosslinking activities have a much greater effect on mt stability than do longitudinal crosslinking activities and that introducing a bias toward gdp tubulin has little impact on the observed mt stabilization to address the question of why tau is gdp tubulin biased we tested whether tau might affect mt binding of the tip eb  we confirmed recent reports that tau binds directly to eb and that tau competes with eb for mt binding our results lead to a conceptual model where tau stabilizes the mt lattice by strengthening lateral interactions between protofilaments we propose that tau s gdp preference allows the cell to independently regulate the dynamics of the mt tip and the stability of the lattice
