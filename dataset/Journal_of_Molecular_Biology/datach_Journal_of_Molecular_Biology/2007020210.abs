the role of the s s bridge in retroviral protease function and virion maturation
retroviral proteases are translated as a part of gag related polyproteins and are released and activated during particle release mason pfizer monkey virus m pmv gag polyproteins assemble into immature capsids within the cytoplasm of the host cells however their processing occurs only after transport to the plasma membrane and subsequent release thus the activity of m pmv protease is expected to be highly regulated during the replication cycle it has been proposed that reversible oxidation of protease cysteine residues might be responsible for such regulation we show that cysteine residues in m pmv protease can form an intramolecular s s bridge the disulfide bridge shifts the monomer dimer equilibrium in favor of the dimer and increases the proteolytic activity significantly to investigate the role of this disulfide bridge in virus maturation and replication we engineered an m pmv clone in which both protease cysteine residues were replaced by alanine m pmvprc a c  a  surprisingly the cysteine residues were dispensable for gag polyprotein processing within the virus indicating that even low levels of protease activity are sufficient for polyprotein processing during maturation however the long term infectivity of m pmvprc a c  a was noticeably compromised these results show clearly that the proposed redox mechanism does not rely solely on the formation of the stabilizing s s bridge in the protease thus in addition to the protease disulfide bridge reversible oxidation of cysteine and or methionine residues in other domains of the gag polyprotein or in related cellular proteins must be involved in the regulation of maturation
