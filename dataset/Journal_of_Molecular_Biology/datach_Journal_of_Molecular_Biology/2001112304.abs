a novel functional co operation between myod mef and tr  is sufficient for the induction of glut gene transcription edited by m yaniv
we report tripartite co operation between myod myocyte enhancer factor  mef  and the thyroid hormone receptor tr   that takes place in the context of an  bp muscle specific enhancer in the rat insulin responsive glucose transporter glut  gene that is active in both cardiac and skeletal muscle in the l e skeletal muscle cell line and in  t  fibroblasts a powerful synergistic activation of the glut enhancer relied on the over expression of myod mef and tr  and the integrity of their respective binding sites and occurred when linked to either a heterologous promoter or in the context of the native glut promoter in cardiac myocytes enhancer activity was dependent on the binding sites for mef and tr   furthermore we show that in  t  fibroblasts the forced expression of myod mef and tr  induced the expression of the endogenous otherwise silent glut gene in all our results indicate a novel functional co operation between these three factors which is required for full activation of glut transcription
