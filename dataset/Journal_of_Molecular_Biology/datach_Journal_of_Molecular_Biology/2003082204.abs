transmembrane organization of the bacillus subtilis chemoreceptor mcpb deduced by cysteine disulfide crosslinking
the bacillus subtilis chemoreceptor mcpb is a dimer of identical subunits containing two transmembrane tm segments tm  residues     tm  residues      in each monomer with a  fold axis of symmetry to study the organization of the tm domains the wild type receptor was mutated systematically at the membrane bilayer extracytoplasmic interface with  single cysteine cys substitutions in each of the two tm domains each single cys substitution was capable of complementing a null allele in vivo suggesting that no significant perturbation of the native tertiary or quaternary structure of the chemoreceptor was introduced by the mutations on the basis of patterns of disulfide crosslinking between subunits of the dimeric receptor an  helical interface was identified between tm and tm   containing residues       and   and between tm and tm   containing residues          and    pairs of cysteine substitutions positions    and     in tm and tm were used to further elucidate specific contacts within a monomer subunit enabling a model to be constructed defining the organization of the tm domain crosslinking of residues that were       removed from position   positions     and   suggested that the receptors may be organized as an array of trimers of dimers in vivo all crosslinking was unaffected by deletion of cheb and cher loss of receptor demethylation methylation enzymes or by deletion of chew and chev loss of proteins that couple receptors with the autophosphorylating kinase  these findings indicate that the organization of the transmembrane region and the stability of the quaternary complex of receptors are independent of covalent modifications of the cytoplasmic domain and conformations in the cytoplasmic domain induced by the coupling proteins
