structure of the soluble domain of a membrane anchored thioredoxin like protein from bradyrhizobium japonicum reveals unusual properties edited by r huber
tlpa is an unusual thioredoxin like protein present in the nitrogen fixing soil bacterium bradyrhizobium japonicum a hydrophobic n terminal transmembrane domain anchors it to the cytoplasmic membrane whereby the hydrophilic thioredoxin domain becomes exposed to the periplasmic space there tlpa catalyses an essential reaction probably a reduction in the biogenesis of cytochrome aa  the soluble thioredoxin domain tlpasol  devoid of the membrane anchor was purified and crystallized oxidized tlpasol crystallized as a non covalent dimer in the space group p    the x ray structure analysis was carried out by isomorphous replacement using a xenon derivative this resulted in a high resolution     three dimensional structure that displayed all of the features of a classical thioredoxin fold a number of peculiar structural details were uncovered  i only one of the two active site cysteine sulphurs cys  the one closer to the n terminus is exposed on the surface making it the likely nucleophile for the reduction of target proteins  ii tlpasol possesses a unique structural disulphide bond formed between cys  and cys   which connects an unprecedented n terminal  helix with a  sheet near the c terminus  iii an insertion of about  amino acid residues not found in the thioredoxin prototype of escherichia coli contributes only marginally to the thioredoxin fold but forms an extra surface exposed  helix this region plus another surface exposed stretch  ile gly arg ala  which is absent even in the closest tlpa relatives might be considered as specificity determinants for the recognition of target proteins in the periplasm the tlpasol structure paves the way towards unraveling important structure function relationships by rational mutagenesis
