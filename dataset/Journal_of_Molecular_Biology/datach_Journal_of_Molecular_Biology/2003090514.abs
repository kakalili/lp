selective regulation of gene expression by nuclear factor   a member of the nf  family of double stranded rna binding proteins
members of the nuclear factor   nf  family of double stranded rna dsrna binding proteins have been implicated in several biological processes including the regulation of gene expression cdna sequences predict that the proteins have a functional nuclear localization signal and two dsrna binding motifs dsrbms  and are identical at their n termini isoforms are predicted to diverge at their c termini as well as by the insertion of four amino acid residues nvkq between the two dsrbms in this study we verified the expression of four of the isoforms by cdna cloning and mass spectrometric analysis of proteins isolated from human cells cell fractionation studies showed that nf  and its heteromeric partner nf  are predominantly nuclear and largely chromatin associated the c terminally extended nf  species nf   are almost exclusively chromatin bound both nf  isoforms are more active than nf  isoforms in stimulating transcription from the proliferating cell nuclear antigen reporter in a transient expression system nf  b which carries the nvkq insert was identified as the strongest activator it stimulated transcription of some but not all promoters in a fashion that suggested that it functions in concert with other transcription factors finally we demonstrate that nf  b associates with the dsrbm containing transcriptional co activator rna helicase a independently of rna binding
