probing the substrate recognition mechanism of the human mth protein by nucleotide analogs
to examine the substrate recognition mechanism of the human mth protein which hydrolyzes  hydroxy datp  hydroxy datp and  hydroxy dgtp ten nucleotide analogs  bromo datp  bromo dgtp deoxyisoinosine triphosphate  hydroxy ditp  aminopurine deoxyriboside triphosphate  amino datp deoxyxanthosine triphosphate deoxyoxanosine triphosphate ditp and dutp were incubated with the mth protein of these the former five nucleotides were hydrolyzed with various efficiencies the fact that the syn oriented brominated nucleotides were hydrolyzed suggests that the mth protein binds to deoxynucleotides adopting the syn conformation however  hydroxy ditp which lacks the  amino group of  hydroxy dgtp was degraded with tenfold less efficiency as compared with  hydroxy dgtp in addition deoxyisoinosine triphosphate lacking the  amino group of  hydroxy datp was hydrolyzed as efficiently as  hydroxy dgtp but less efficiently than  hydroxy datp these results clarify the effects of the anti syn conformation and the functional groups on the  and  positions of the purine ring on the recognition by the human mth protein
