The Dlx5 homeodomain is a transcription factor related to the Drosophila distal-less gene that is associated with breast and lung cancer, lymphoma, Rett syndrome and osteoporosis in humans. Mutations in the DLX5 gene have been linked to deficiencies in craniofacial and limb development in higher eukaryotes, including split hand and foot malformation 1 in humans. Our characterization of a Dlx5 homeodomain:(CGACTAATTAGTCG)2 complex by NMR spectroscopy paved the way for determination of its crystal structure at 1.85Ã… resolution that enabled rationalization of the effects of disease-related mutations on the protein function. A Q186H mutation linked to split hand and foot malformation 1 likely affects affinity of DNA binding by disrupting water-mediated interactions with the DNA major groove. A more subtle effect is implicated for the Q178P mutation, which is not in direct contact with the DNA. Our data indicate that these mutations diminish the ability of the Dlx5 homeodomain to recognize and bind target DNAs, and they likely destabilize the formation of functional complexes.
