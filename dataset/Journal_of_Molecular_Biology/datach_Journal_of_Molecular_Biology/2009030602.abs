cryo electron microscopy of the vacuolar atpase motor reveals its mechanical and regulatory complexity
the vacuolar h atpase v atpase is an atp driven rotary molecular motor that is a transmembrane proton pump in all eukaryotic cells although its activity is fundamental to many physiological processes our understanding of the structure and mechanism of the v atpase is poor using cryo electron microscopy of the tobacco hornworm manduca sexta enzyme we have calculated the first d reconstruction of the intact pump in its native state the resolution of     is significantly higher than that of previous cryo electron microscopy models of either v atpase or the related f f atpase a network of four stalk structures connecting the v catalytic domain and the v membrane domain is now fully resolved demonstrating substantially greater complexity than that found in the f atpase three peripheral stator stalks connect these domains to a horizontal collar that partly encircles the region between v and v  the fourth stalk is a central axle that connects to v but makes minimal contact with v  several subunit crystal structures can be fit accurately into the reconstruction the model thus provides new insights into the organisation of key components involved in mechanical coupling between the domains and regulation of activity
