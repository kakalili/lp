the dna binding domain of human parp  interacts with dna single strand breaks as a monomer through its second zinc finger
poly adp ribose polymerase  parp  is a highly abundant chromatin associated enzyme present in all higher eukaryotic cell nuclei where it plays key roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control it binds to dna single and double strand breaks through an n terminal region containing two zinc fingers f and f  following which its c terminal catalytic domain becomes activated via an unknown mechanism causing formation and addition of polyadenosine ribose par to acceptor proteins including parp  itself here we report a biophysical and structural characterization of the f and f fingers of human parp  both as independent fragments and in the context of the  kda dna binding domain f f  we show that the fingers are structurally independent in the absence of dna and share a highly similar structural fold and dynamics the f f fragment recognizes dna single strand breaks as a monomer and in a single orientation using a combination of nmr spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques we show that recognition is primarily achieved by f  which binds the dna in an essentially identical manner whether present in isolation or in the two finger fragment f interacts much more strongly with nicked or gapped dna ligands than does f  and we present a mutational study that suggests origins of this difference our data suggest that different dna lesions are recognized by the dna binding domain of parp  in a highly similar conformation helping to rationalize how the full length protein participates in multiple steps of dna single strand breakage and base excision repair
