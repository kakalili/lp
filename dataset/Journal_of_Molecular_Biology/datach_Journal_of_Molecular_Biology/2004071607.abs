structural convergence of antibody binding of carbohydrate determinants in lewis y tumor antigens
antibodies targeting human epithelial carcinomas bearing lewis y ley carbohydrate antigens provide a striking illustration of convergent immune recognition we report a    resolution crystal structure of the fab of a humanized antibody hu s   in complex with the ley tetrasaccharide fuc     gal     fuc     glcnac comparisons of the hu s  and br  antibodies bound to ley tumor antigens revealed extremely similar mechanisms for recognition of the carbohydrate epitopes solvent plays a critical role in hu s  antibody binding to the ley carbohydrate epitope specificity for ley is maintained because a conserved pocket accepts an n acetyl group of the core gal     glcnac disaccharide closely related blood group determinants lea and leb cannot enter the specificity pocket making the ley antibodies promising candidates for immunotherapy of epithelial cancer
