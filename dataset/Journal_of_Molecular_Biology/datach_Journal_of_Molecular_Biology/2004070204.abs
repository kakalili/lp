computational and experimental probes of symmetry mismatches in the arc repressor  dna complex
arc repressor from bacteriophage p  is a homodimeric member of the ribbon helix helix family of transcription factors two dimers bind cooperatively to adjacent sites on operator dna with the antiparallel beta sheet of each arc dimer contacting the major groove despite the  fold symmetry of the dimer the sequence of the dna half site is not symmetric and thus there is an inherent symmetry mismatch in the complex here using a combination of computational and experimental methods we further characterize this symmetry mismatch continuum electrostatic calculations show that the dna contacting side chains of gln  asn  and arg  each make better electrostatic interactions in one subunit of the arc dimer than in the other based on the computational results one or both gln side chains were substituted with arg or his and asn  was similarly substituted with ile in the context of a single chain variant of arc repressor although the double mutants that maintain the symmetry of the protein bind much more weakly than scarc mutants with single q r or n i substitutions bind operator dna with affinities close to wild type whereas the effects are nearly additive for the mutations at position  the effects of single n i mutations are non additive the calculations thus enabled the identification of functionally tolerated mutations in the dna binding surface of arc repressor which in turn revealed energetic consequences of asymmetric environments in this protein  dna interaction
