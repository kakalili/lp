the c terminal tail of human neuronal calcium sensor  regulates the conformational stability of the ca  activated state
neuronal calcium sensor  ncs  and orthologs are expressed in all organisms from yeast to humans in the latter ncs  plays an important role in neurotransmitter release and interacts with a plethora of binding partners mostly through a large solvent exposed hydrophobic crevice the structural basis behind the multispecific binding profile is not understood to begin to address this we applied nmr spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of calcium bound human ncs  the structure in solution demonstrates interdomain flexibility and in the absence of a binding partner the c terminal tail residues occupy the hydrophobic crevice as a ligand mimic a variant with a c terminal tail deletion shows lack of a defined structure but maintained cooperative unfolding and dramatically reduced global stability the results suggest that the c terminal tail is important for regulating the conformational stability of the ca  activated state furthermore a single amino acid mutation that was recently diagnosed in a patient with autistic spectrum disorder was seen to affect the c terminal tail and binding crevice in ncs
