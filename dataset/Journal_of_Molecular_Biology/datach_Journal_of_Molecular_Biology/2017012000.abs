structural basis of arp  complex inhibition by gmf coronin and arpin
the evolutionarily conserved arp  complex plays a central role in nucleating the branched actin filament arrays that drive cell migration endocytosis and other processes to better understand arp  complex regulation we used single particle electron microscopy to compare the structures of arp  complex bound to three different inhibitory ligands glia maturation factor gmf  coronin and arpin although the three inhibitors have distinct binding sites on arp  complex they each induced an  open  nucleation inactive conformation coronin promoted a standard previously described open conformation of arp  complex with the n terminal  propeller domain of coronin positioned near the p  arpc subunit of arp  complex gmf induced two distinct open conformations of arp  complex which correlated with the two suggested binding sites for gmf furthermore gmf synergized with coronin in inhibiting actin nucleation by arp  complex arpin which uses vca related acidic a motifs to interact with the arp  complex induced the standard open conformation and two new masses appeared at positions near arp and arp  furthermore arpin showed additive inhibitory effects on arp  complex with coronin and gmf together these data suggest that arp  complex conformation is highly polymorphic and that its activities can be controlled combinatorially by different inhibitory ligands
