Pyrrolysine, the 22nd amino acid, is encoded by amber (TAG=UAG) codons in certain methanogenic archaea and bacteria. PylS, the pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase, ligates pyrrolysine to tRNAPyl for amber decoding as pyrrolysine. PylS and tRNAPyl have potential utility in making tailored recombinant proteins. Here, we probed interactions necessary for recognition of substrates by archaeal PylS via synthesis of close pyrrolysine analogs and testing their reactivity in amino acid activation assays. Replacement of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine with cyclopentane indicated that solely hydrophobic interactions with the ring-binding pocket of PylS are sufficient for substrate recognition. However, a 100-fold increase in the specificity constant of PylS was observed with an analog, 2-amino-6-((R)-tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamido)hexanoic acid (2Thf-lys), in which tetrahydrofuran replaced the pyrrolysine methylpyrroline ring. Other analogs in which the electronegative atom was moved to different positions suggested PylS preference for a hydrogen-bond-accepting group at the imine nitrogen position in pyrrolysine. 2Thf-lys was a preferred substrate over a commonly employed pyrrolysine analog, but the specificity constant for 2Thf-lys was 10-fold lower than for pyrrolysine itself, largely due to the change in Km. The in vivo activity of the analogs in supporting UAG suppression in Escherichia coli bearing genes for PylS and tRNAPyl was similar to in vitro results, with l-pyrrolysine and 2Thf-lys supporting the highest amounts of UAG translation. Increasing concentrations of either PylS substrate resulted in a linear increase in UAG suppression, providing a facile method to assay bioactive pyrrolysine analogs. These results illustrate the relative importance of the H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions in the recognition of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine and provide a promising new series of easily synthesized pyrrolysine analogs that can serve as scaffolds for the introduction of novel functional groups into recombinant proteins.
