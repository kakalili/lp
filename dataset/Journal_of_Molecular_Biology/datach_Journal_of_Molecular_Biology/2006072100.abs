the structure of the rna m c methyltransferase yebu from escherichia coli reveals a c terminal rna recruiting pua domain
nucleotide methylations are the most common type of rrna modification in bacteria and are introduced post transcriptionally by a wide variety of site specific enzymes three  methylcytidine m c bases are found in the rrnas of escherichia coli and one of these at nucleotide   in  s rrna is the modification product of the methyltransferase mtase yebu also called rsmf  yebu requires s adenosyl l methionine sam and methylates c   within assembled  s subunits but not in naked  s rrna or within tight couple  s ribosomes here we describe the three dimensional structure of yebu determined by x ray crystallography and we present a molecular model for how yebu specifically recognizes binds and methylates its ribosomal substrate the yebu protein has an n terminal sam binding catalytic domain with structural similarity to the equivalent domains in several other m c rna mtases including rsmb and ph   the c terminal one third of yebu contains a domain similar to that in pseudouridine synthases and archaeosine specific transglycosylases pua domain  which was not predicted by sequence alignments furthermore yebu is predicted to contain extended regions of positive electrostatic potential that differ from other rna mtase structures suggesting that yebu interacts with its rna target in a different manner docking of yebu onto the  s subunit indicates that the pua and mtase domains make several contacts with  s rrna as well as with the ribosomal protein s  the ribosomal protein interactions would explain why the assembled  s subunit and not naked  s rrna is the preferred substrate for yebu
