thermodynamics of gtp and gdp binding to bacterial initiation factor  suggests two types of structural transitions
during initiation of messenger rna translation in bacteria the gtpase initiation factor if  plays major roles in the assembly of the preinitiation  s complex and its docking to the  s ribosomal subunit leading to the  s initiation complex ready to form the first peptide bond in a nascent protein rapid and accurate initiation of bacterial protein synthesis is driven by conformational changes in if  induced by gdp  gtp exchange and gtp hydrolysis we have used isothermal titration calorimetry and linear extrapolation to characterize the thermodynamics of the binding of gdp and gtp to free if in the temperature interval      c if binds with about  fold and  fold higher affinity for gdp than for gtp at  and    c respectively the binding of if to both gtp and gdp is characterized by a large heat capacity change       and       cal mol   k   respectively  associated with compensatory changes in binding entropy and enthalpy from our data we propose that gtp binding to if leads to protection of hydrophobic amino acid residues from solvent by the locking of switch i and switch ii loops to the  phosphate of gtp as in the case of elongation factor g from the large heat capacity change also upon gdp binding not seen in the case of elongation factor g we propose the existence of yet another type of conformational change in if  which is induced by gdp and gtp alike also this transition is likely to protect hydrophobic groups from solvent and its functional relevance is discussed
