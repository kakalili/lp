structural basis for conserved regulation and adaptation of the signal recognition particle targeting complex
the signal recognition particle srp is a ribonucleoprotein complex with a key role in targeting and insertion of membrane proteins the two srp gtpases srp  ffh in bacteria and ftsy sr  in eukaryotes  form the core of the targeting complex tc regulating the srp cycle the architecture of the tc and its stimulation by rna has been described for the bacterial srp system while this information is lacking for other domains of life here we present the crystal structures of the gtpase heterodimers of archaeal sulfolobus solfataricus  eukaryotic homo sapiens  and chloroplast arabidopsis thaliana srp systems the comprehensive structural comparison combined with brownian dynamics simulations of tc formation allows for the description of the general blueprint and of specific adaptations of the quasi symmetric heterodimer our work defines conserved external nucleotide binding sites for srp gtpase activation by rna structural analyses of the gdp bound post hydrolysis states reveal a conserved magnesium sensitive switch within the i box overall we provide a general model for srp cycle regulation by rna
