crystal structure of human rna helicase a dhx  structural basis for unselective nucleotide base binding in a dead box variant protein
rna helicases of the dexd h box superfamily are critically involved in all rna related processes no crystal structures of human dexh box domains had been determined previously and their structures were difficult to predict owing to the low level of homology among dexh motif containing proteins from diverse species here we present the crystal structures of the conserved domain  of the deih motif containing helicase dhx and of the dead box helicase ddx  both contain a reca like core but dhx differs from dead box proteins in the arrangement of secondary structural elements and is more similar to viral helicases such as ns  the n terminus of the dhx core contains two long  helices that reside on the surface of the core without contributing to nucleotide binding the rna polymerase ii interacting minimal transactivation domain sequence forms an extended loop structure that resides in a hydrophobic groove on the surface of the deih domain dhx lacks base selective contacts and forms an unspecific but important stacking interaction with the base of the bound nucleotide and our biochemical analysis confirms that the protein can hydrolyze atp guanosine   triphosphate cytidine   triphosphate and uridine   triphosphate together these findings allow the localization of functional motifs within the three dimensional structure of a human deih helicase and show how these enzymes can bind nucleotide with high affinity in the absence of a q motif
