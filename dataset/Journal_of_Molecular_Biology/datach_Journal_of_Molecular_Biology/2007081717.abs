the endoplasmic reticulum ca  pump serca b interacts with g protein coupled receptors and enhances their expression at the cell surface
calcium ca  plays a pivotal role in both cellular signaling and protein synthesis however it is not well understood how calcium metabolism and synthesis of secreted and membrane bound proteins are related here we demonstrate that the sarco endo plasmic reticulum ca  atpase b serca b  which maintains high ca  concentration in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum interacts specifically with the human  opioid receptor during early steps of receptor biogenesis in human embryonic kidney   cells the interaction involves newly synthesized incompletely folded receptor precursors because the association between the  opioid receptor and serca b i was short lived and took place soon after receptor translation  ii was not affected by misfolding of the receptor and iii decreased if receptor folding was enhanced by opioid receptor pharmacological chaperone the physical association with serca b was found to be a universal feature among g protein coupled receptors within family a and was shown to occur also between the endogenously expressed luteinizing hormone receptor and serca b in rat ovaries importantly active serca b rather than undisturbed ca  homeostasis was found to be essential for  opioid receptor biogenesis as inhibition of its ca  pumping activity by thapsigargin reduced the interaction and impaired the efficiency of receptor maturation two phenomena that were not affected by a ca  ionophore a    nevertheless inhibition of serca b did not compromise the functionality of receptors that were able to mature thus we propose that the association with serca b is required for efficient folding and or membrane integration of g protein coupled receptors
