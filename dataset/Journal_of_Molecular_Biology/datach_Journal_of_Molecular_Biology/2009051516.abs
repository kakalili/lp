structural and dynamic implications of an effector induced backbone amide cis  trans isomerization in cytochrome p  cam
experimental evidence has been provided for a functionally relevant cis  trans isomerization of the ile   pro  peptide bond in cytochrome p  cam cyp   the isomerization is proposed to be a key element of the structural reorganization leading to the catalytically competent form of cyp  upon binding of the effector protein putidaredoxin pdx  a detailed comparison of the results of molecular dynamics simulations on the cis and trans conformations of substrate and carbonmonoxy bound ferrous cyp  with sequence specific pdx induced structural perturbations identified by nuclear magnetic resonance is presented providing insight into the structural and dynamic consequences of the isomerization the mechanical coupling between the pdx binding site on the proximal face of cyp  and the site of isomerization is described
