towards a comprehensive analysis of the protein phosphatase  interactome in drosophila
protein phosphatase type  pp  is one of the major classes of serine threonine protein phosphatases and has been found in all eukaryotic cells examined to date metazoans from drosophila to humans have multiple genes encoding catalytic subunits of pp  pp c  which are involved in a wide range of biological processes different pp c isoforms have pleiotropic and overlapping functions this has complicated the analysis of their biological roles and the identification of specific in vivo substrates pp c isoforms are associated in vivo with regulatory subunits that target them to specific locations and modify their substrate specificity and activity the pp c binding proteins are therefore the key to understanding the role of pp in particular biological processes the existence of isoform specific pp c binding subunits may also help to explain the unique roles of different pp c isoforms here we report the identification of  genes encoding drosophila pp c binding proteins in the yeast two hybrid system sequence analysis identified a minimal interacting fragment and putative pp c binding motif for each protein delimiting the region involved in binding to pp c further two hybrid analysis showed that virtually all of the interactors were capable of binding all drosophila pp c isoforms one of the novel interactors cg   was examined further and shown to interact with multiple isoforms by co immunoprecipitation from drosophila extracts and functional interaction with pp c isoforms in vivo bioinformatic analyses implicate the putative pp c associated subunits in a diverse array of intracellular processes our identification of a large number of pp c binding proteins with the potential for directing pp c s specific functions in drosophila represents a significant step towards a full understanding of the range of pp complexes and function in animals
