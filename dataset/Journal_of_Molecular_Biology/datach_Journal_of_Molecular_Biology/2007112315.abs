nautilus pompilius hemocyanin    cryo em structure and molecular model reveal the subunit pathway and the interfaces between the  functional units
hemocyanins are giant extracellular oxygen carriers in the hemolymph of many molluscs nautilus pompilius cephalopoda hemocyanin is a cylindrical decamer of a   kda polypeptide subunit that in turn is a  pearl chain  of seven different functional units fu a to fu g  each globular fu has a binuclear copper centre that reversibly binds one o molecule and the  fu decamer is a highly allosteric protein its primary structure and an    cryo electron microscopy cryo em structure have recently been determined and the crystal structures of two related fu types are available in the databanks however in molluscan hemocyanin the precise subunit pathway within the decamer the inter fu interfaces and the allosteric unit are still obscure but this knowledge is crucial to understand assembly and allosterism of these proteins here we present the cryo em structure of nautilus hemocyanin at     resolution fsc  bit criterion  and its molecular model obtained by rigid body fitting of the individual fus in this model we identified the subunit dimer the subunit pathway and  types of inter fu interface four interface types correspond to the association mode of the two protomers in the published octopus fu g crystal other interfaces explain previously described morphological structures such as the fenestrated wall which shows d symmetry  the three horizontal wall tiers the major and minor grooves the anchor structure and the internal collar which unexpectedly has c symmetry  moreover the potential calcium magnesium and n glycan binding sites have emerged many interfaces have amino acid constellations that might transfer allosteric interaction between fus from their topologies we propose that the prime allosteric unit is the oblique segment between major and minor groove consisting of seven fus from two different subunits thus the    structure of nautilus hemocyanin provides fundamentally new insight into the architecture and function of molluscan hemocyanins
