the structural basis of  glucan recognition by a family  carbohydrate binding module from thermotoga maritima
starch recognition by carbohydrate binding modules cbms is important for the activity of starch degrading enzymes the n terminal family  cbm tmcbm  from pullulanase pula secreted by thermotoga maritima was shown to have  glucan binding activity with specificity for    glucans but was able to tolerate the    linkages found roughly every three or four glucose units in pullulan using x ray crystallography the structures were solved for tmcbm  in an uncomplexed form and in complex with maltotetraose and    d glucosyl maltotriose gm  ligand binding was facilitated by stacking interactions between the  faces of the glucose residues and two tryptophan side chains in the two main subsites of the carbohydrate binding site overall this mode of starch binding is quite well conserved by other starch binding modules the structure in complex with gm revealed a third binding subsite with the flexibility to accommodate an     or an    linked glucose
