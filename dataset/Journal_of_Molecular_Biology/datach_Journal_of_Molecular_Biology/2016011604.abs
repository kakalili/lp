the type  dutpase of bacteriophage  nm initiates mobilization of staphylococcus aureus bovine pathogenicity island
staphylococcus aureus pathogenicity islands sapis are genetic elements that are mobilized by specific helper phages the initial step in mobilization is the derepression of the sapi by the interaction of a phage protein with the sapi master repressor stl stl proteins are highly divergent between different sapis and respond to different phage encoded derepressors one such sapi sapibov  is derepressed by the dutpase dut of bacteriophage    dut   and its phage   homolog dut  we previously showed that sapibov could also be mobilized by phage  nm  even though its dut gene is not homologous with that of    here we show that  nm dut encodes a type  dutpase dutnm  which has an  helical structure that is distinct from the type  trimeric   sheet structure of dut   deletion of dutnm abolishes the ability of  nm to mobilize sapibov  like dut   dutnm forms a direct interaction with sapibov stl both in vivo and in vitro leading to inhibition of the dutpase activity and stl release from its target dna this work provides novel insights into the diverse mechanisms of genetic mobilization in s aureus
