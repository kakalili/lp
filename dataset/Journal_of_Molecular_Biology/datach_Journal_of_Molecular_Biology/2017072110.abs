single strand consensus sequencing reveals that hiv type but not subtype significantly impacts viral mutation frequencies and spectra
a long standing question of human immunodeficiency virus hiv genetic variation and evolution has been whether differences exist in mutation rate and or mutation spectra among hiv types i e  hiv  versus hiv  and among hiv groups i e  hiv  groups m  p and hiv  groups a  h and hiv  group m subtypes i e  subtypes a  d f  h and j  k  to address this we developed a new single strand consensus sequencing assay for the determination of hiv mutation frequencies and spectra using the illumina sequencing platform this assay enables parallel and standardized comparison of hiv mutagenesis among various viral vectors with lower background error than traditional methods of illumina library preparation we found significant differences in viral mutagenesis between hiv types but intriguingly no significant differences among hiv  group m subtypes more specifically hiv  exhibited higher transition frequencies than hiv  due mostly to single g to a mutations and to a lesser extent g to a hypermutation these data suggest that hiv  rt exhibits higher fidelity during viral replication and taken together these findings demonstrate that hiv type but not subtype significantly affects viral mutation frequencies and spectra these differences may inform antiviral and vaccine strategies
