a new pii protein structure identifies the  oxoglutarate binding site
pii proteins of bacteria archaea and plants regulate many facets of nitrogen metabolism they do so by interacting with their target proteins which can be enzymes transcription factors or membrane proteins a key feature of the ability of pii proteins to sense cellular nitrogen status and to interact accordingly with their targets is their binding of the key metabolic intermediate  oxoglutarate  og  however the binding site of this ligand within pii proteins has been controversial we have now solved the x ray structure at     resolution of the azospirillum brasilense pii protein glnz complexed with mgatp and  og this structure is in excellent agreement with previous biochemical data on  og binding to a variety of pii proteins and shows that  oxglutarate binds within the cleft formed between neighboring subunits of the homotrimer the  oxo acid moiety of bound  og ligates the bound mg  together with three phosphate oxygens of atp and the side chain of the t loop residue gln  our structure is in stark contrast to an earlier structure of the methanococcus jannaschii glnk protein in which the authors reported  og binding to the t loop of that pii protein in the light of our new structure three families of t loop conformations each associated with a distinct effector binding mode and characterized by a different interaction partner of the ammonium group of the conserved residue lys  emerge as a common structural basis for effector signal output by pii proteins
