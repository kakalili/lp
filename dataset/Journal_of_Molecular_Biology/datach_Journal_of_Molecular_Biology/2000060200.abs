biochemical analyses of the af  protein the extended lap phd finger mediates oligomerisation edited by t richmond
leukaemogenesis correlates with alterations in chromatin structure brought about by the gain or loss of interactive domains from regulatory factors that are disrupted by chromosomal translocations the gene mll a target of such translocation events forms chimaeric fusion products with a variety of partner genes while mll appears to be involved in chromatin mediated gene regulation the functions of its partner genes are largely speculative we report the biochemical analysis of the mll partner gene af  and its possible role in leukaemogenesis af  has been reported to be re arranged with genes other than mll leading to the same phenotype a myeloid leukaemia we have identified a novel protein protein interaction motif in the af  protein comprising the extended lap phd finger this domain mediates homo oligomerisation of recombinant af  and is conserved in several proteins including mll itself af  binds cruciform dna via a specific interaction with an at hook motif and is localised to the nucleus by a defined bipartite nuclear localisation signal in the n terminal region
