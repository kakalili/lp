tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases  undergoes microsecond to millisecond motions at sites of matrix metalloproteinase induced fit edited by p e wright
the n terminal matrix metalloproteinase mmp inhibitory fragment of recombinant human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases timp  exhibits varied backbone dynamics and rigidity most striking is the presence of chemical exchange in the mmp binding ridge reported to undergo conformational change upon mmp binding conformational exchange fluctuations in microseconds to milliseconds map to the sites of mmp induced fit at residues val  through leu  of the ab loop and to the ala  and cys   hinges  of the cd loop of timp  slow chemical exchange is also present at the type i turn of the ef loop at the base of the mmp binding ridge these functional slow motions and other fast internal motions are evident from backbone  n spin relaxation at   and   mhz whether interpreted by the model free formalism with axial diffusion anisotropy or by the reduced spectral density approach the conformational exchange is confirmed by its deviation from the trend between r and the cross correlation rate   the magnetic field dependence indicates that the chemical exchange broadening in the ab and cd loops is fast on the time scale of chemical shift differences the conformational exchange rates for most of these exchanging residues which can closely approach mmp appear to be a few thousand to several thousand per second the slow dynamics of the timp  ab loop contrast the picosecond to nanosecond dynamics reported in the longer timp  ab loop
