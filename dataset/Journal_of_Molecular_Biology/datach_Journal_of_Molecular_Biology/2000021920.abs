structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase from triticum aestivum and arabidopsis thaliana edited by r huber
catalyzing the first step in the de novo synthesis of adenylmonophosphate adenylosuccinate synthetase adss is a known target for herbicides and antibiotics we have purified and crystallized recombinant adss from arabidopsis thaliana and tritium aestivum expressed in escherichia coli the structures of a thaliana and t aestivum adss in complex with gdp were solved at    and    resolution respectively comparison with the known structures from e coli reveals that the overall fold is very similar to that of the e coli protein the longer n terminus in the plant sequences is at the same place as the longer c terminus of the e coli sequence in the d structure the gdp binding sites have one additional hydrogen bonding partner which is a plausible explanation for the lower km value due to its special position this partner may also enable gtp to initiate a conformational change which was in e coli adss exclusively activated by ligands at the imp binding site the dimer interfaces show up to six hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges more than in the e coli structure although the contact areas have approximately the same size
