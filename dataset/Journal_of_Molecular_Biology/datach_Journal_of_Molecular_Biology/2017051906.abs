structural basis of mecp distribution on non cpg methylated and hydroxymethylated dna
the rett syndrome associated methyl cpg binding protein  mecp  selectively binds methylated dna to regulate transcription during the development of mature neurons like other members of the methyl cpg binding domain mbd family mecp functions through the recognition of symmetrical  methylcytosines in cpg mcg dinucleotides advances in base level resolution epigenetic mapping techniques have revealed however that mecp can bind asymmetrically methylated and hydroxymethylated cpa dinucleotides and that this alternative binding selectivity modifies gene expression in the developing mammalian brain the structural determinants of binding to methylated cpa mca and hydroxymethylated dna have not been previously investigated here we employ isothermal titration calorimetry and nmr spectroscopy to characterize mecp binding to methylated and hydroxymethylated mcg and mca dna examine the effects of rett syndrome associated missense mutations and make comparisons to the related and evolutionarily most ancient protein mbd  these analyses reveal that mecp binds mca with high affinity in a strand specific and orientation dependent manner in contrast mbd does not show high affinity or methyl specific binding to mca the rett associated missense mutations t  m r  w and p  s destabilize the mecp mbd and disrupt the recognition of mcg and mca equally finally hydroxymethylation of a high affinity mca site does not alter the binding properties whereas hemi hydroxylation of the equivalent cytosine in an mcg site decreases affinity and specificity based on these findings we suggest that mecp recognition of methylated hydroxymethylated cpa dinucleotides functions as an epigenetic switch redistributing mecp among mcg and mca loci
