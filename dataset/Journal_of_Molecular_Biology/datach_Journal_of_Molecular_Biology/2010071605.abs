t rmsd a fine grained structure based classification method and its application to the functional characterization of tnf receptors
this study addresses the relation between structural and functional similarity in proteins we introduce a novel method named tree based on root mean square deviation t rmsd  which uses distance rmsd drmsd variations to build fine grained structure based classifications of proteins the main improvement of the t rmsd over similar methods such as dali is its capacity to produce the equivalent of a bootstrap value for each cluster node we validated our approach on two domain families studied extensively for their role in many biological and pathological pathways the small gtpase ras superfamily and the cysteine rich domains crds associated with the tumor necrosis factor receptors tnfrs family our analysis showed that t rmsd is able to automatically recover and refine existing classifications in the case of the small gtpase arf subfamily t rmsd can distinguish gtp from gdp bound states while in the case of crds it can identify two new subgroups associated with well defined functional features ligand binding and formation of ligand pre assembly complex  we show how hidden markov models hmms can be built on these new groups and propose a methodology to use these models simultaneously in order to do fine grained functional genomic annotation without known d structures t rmsd an open source freeware incorporated in the t coffee package is available online
