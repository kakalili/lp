apobec multimerization correlates with hiv  packaging and restriction activity in living cells
apobec g belongs to a family of dna cytosine deaminases that are involved in the restriction of a broad number of retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv   prior studies have identified two distinct mechanistic steps in vif deficient hiv  restriction packaging into virions and deaminating viral cdna apobec a for example although highly active is not packaged and is therefore not restrictive apobec g on the other hand although having weaker enzymatic activity is packaged into virions and is strongly restrictive although a number of studies have described the propensity for apobec oligomerization its relevance to hiv  restriction remains unclear here we address this problem by examining apobec oligomerization in living cells using molecular brightness analysis we find that apobec g forms high order multimers as a function of protein concentration in contrast apobec a apobec c and apobec are monomers at all tested concentrations among other members of the apobec family we show that the multimerization propensities of apobec b apobec d apobec f and apobec h haplotype ii bear more resemblance to apobec g than to apobec a c  prior studies have shown that all of these multimerizing apobec proteins but not the monomeric family members have the capacity to package into hiv  particles and restrict viral infectivity this correlation between oligomerization and restriction is further evidenced by two different apobec g mutants which are each compromised for multimerization packaging and hiv  restriction overall our results imply that multimerization of apobec proteins may be related to the packaging mechanism and ultimately to virus restriction
