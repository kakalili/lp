synergistic binding of the phosphorylated s   and s  binding sites of c raf to one     dimer
c raf kinase is a central component of the ras raf mek mitogen  activated protein kinase extracellular signal  regulated kinase erk extracellular signal  regulated kinase pathway which has been shown to be activated in   of human tumors     proteins inactivate c raf by binding to the two n terminal phosphorylation dependent binding sites surrounding s  and s      proteins can bind two target sequences located on one polypeptide chain simultaneously thereby increasing binding affinity compared to single  site binding and possibly allowing regulated    binding through gatekeeper phosphorylation to date it was unclear whether    proteins can bind the two n terminal phosphorylation dependent binding sites of c raf simultaneously fluorescence polarization using phosphorylated peptides demonstrated that s  is the low affinity and s  is the high affinity binding site while simultaneous engagement of both sites by     enhances affinity compared to single  site binding determination of a   stoichiometry for the di phosphorylated peptide binding to one     dimer with isothermal titration calorimetry was supported by the crystal structure of the     c rafps  ps  complex cellular localization studies validate the significance of these sites for cytoplasmic retention of c raf suggesting an extended mechanism of raf regulation by    proteins
