a minimal system for tn transposition the transposon encoded proteins tnsa and tnsb can execute dna breakage and joining reactions that generate circularized tn species edited by m gottesman
in the presence of atp and mg  the bacterial transposon tn translocates via a cut and paste mechanism executed by the transposon encoded proteins tnsa tnsb tnsc tnsd we report here that in the presence of mn  tnsa tnsb alone can execute the dna breakage and joining reactions of tn recombination atp is not essential in this minimal system revealing that this cofactor is not directly involved in the chemical steps of recombination in both the tnsab and tnsabc d systems recombination initiates with double strand breaks at each transposon end that cut tn away from flanking donor dna in the minimal system breakage occurs predominantly at a single transposon end and the subsequent end joining reactions are intramolecular with the exposed   termini of a broken transposon end joining near the other end of the tn element in the same donor molecule to form circular transposon species in contrast in tnsabc d recombination breaks occur at both ends of tn and the two ends join to a target site on a different dna molecule to form an intermolecular simple insertion this demonstration of the capacity of tnsab to execute breakage and joining reactions supports the view that these proteins form the tn transposase
