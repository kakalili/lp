gene duplication of the eight stranded  barrel ompx produces a functional pore a scenario for the evolution of transmembrane  barrels
the repeating unit of outer membrane  barrels from gram negative bacteria is the  hairpin and representatives of this protein family always have an even strand number between eight and   two dominant structural forms have eight and  strands respectively suggesting gene duplication as a possible mechanism for their evolution we duplicated the sequence of ompx an eight stranded  barrel protein of known structure and obtained a  barrel designated omp x which can fold in vitro and in vivo using single channel conductance measurements and peg exclusion assays we found that omp x has a pore size similar to that of ompc a natural  stranded barrel fusions of the homologous proteins ompx ompa and ompw were able to fold in vitro in all combinations tested revealing that the general propensity to form a  barrel is sufficient to evolve larger barrels by simple genetic events
