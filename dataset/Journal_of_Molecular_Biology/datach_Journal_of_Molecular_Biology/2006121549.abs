a   is more rigid than a   at the c terminus implications for a  aggregation and toxicity
a   and a   are the major forms of amyloid  peptides a  in the brain although a   differs from a   by only two residues a   is much more prone to aggregation and more toxic to neurons than a   to probe whether dynamics contribute to such dramatic difference in function backbone ps  ns dynamics of native a  monomers were characterized by  n spin relaxation at    k and   mhz a   aggregates much faster than a   in the nmr tube the effect of a  aggregation was removed from the relaxation measurement by interleaved data collection r  r and nuclear overhauser enhancement noe values are similar in a   and a   except at the c terminus indicating a   and a   monomers have identical global motions comparisons of the spectral density function j    h and order parameters s  indicate that the a   c terminus is more rigid than the a   c terminus at    k and    k the a   c terminus remains more rigid than the a   c terminus suggesting such a dynamical difference is likely present at the physiological temperature the a   monomer likely has less configurational entropy due to restricted motion in the c terminus and may pay a smaller entropic price to form fibrils than the a   monomer we hypothesize that the entropic difference between a   and a   monomers might partly account for the fact that a   is the major a  species in parenchymal senile plaques in most alzheimer s diseased brains in spite of the predominance of a   in plasma the increased rigidity of the a   c terminus is likely due to its pre ordering for  conformation present in soluble oligomers and fibrils the a   c terminus may therefore serve as an internal seed for aggregation
