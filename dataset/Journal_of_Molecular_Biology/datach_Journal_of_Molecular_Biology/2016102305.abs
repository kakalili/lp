structural basis for the interaction between the ius spry domain of ranbpm and ddx  in germ cell development
ranbpm and ranbp  are non canonical members of the ran binding protein family that lack the ran binding domain and do not associate with ran gtpase in vivo rather they have been shown to be scaffolding proteins that are important for a variety of cellular processes and both of these proteins contain a spry domain which has been implicated in mediating protein  protein interactions with a variety of targets including the dead box containing atp dependent rna helicase ddx   in this study we have determined the crystal structures of the spia and the ryanodine receptor domain and of approximately  upstream residues immediate upstream to spry motif of both ranbpm and ranbp  they are almost identical composed of a  sandwich fold with a set of two helices on each side located at the edge of the sheets a unique shallow binding surface is formed by highly conserved loops on the surface of the  sheet with two aspartates on one end a positive patch on the opposite end and a tryptophan lining at the bottom of the surface the  mer peptide residues      of human ddx  an atp dependent rna helicase known to regulate germ cell development binds to this surface with a kd of   m the crystal structure of the peptide complex and the mutagenesis studies elucidate how ranbpm can recognize its interaction partners to function in gametogenesis
