regulation of ncd by the oligomeric state of tubulin edited by a r fersht
we have compared the interaction of ncd non claret disjunctional  a kinesin related protein with microtubules and tubulin heterodimer ultracentrifugation experiments revealed that the ncd motor domain residues      ncd   does not induce tubulin polymerization but stabilizes pre formed microtubules with a maximum effect at a   ncd  tubulin ratio ncd  binding to tubulin or microtubules was estimated by following the change in fluorescence polarization of an exogenous dye attached to cys  of ncd   ncd  binding to tubulin containing gtp or gdp bound is characterized by a   stoichiometry a higher affinity and an increased sensitivity towards salt adp atp and amppnp as compared with ncd  binding to microtubules maximum atpases were       sec   and      sec   for the ncd  tubulin and ncd  microtubules complexes respectively only the polymerized complex is fully functional suggesting the presence of additional contacts between adjacent protofilaments moreover the data reveal that the oligomeric state of microtubules is a potent regulator for the activity of kinesin related proteins
