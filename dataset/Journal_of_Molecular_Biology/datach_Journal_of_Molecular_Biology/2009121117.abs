identification of a new region of sars cov s protein critical for viral entry
infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov is initiated by specific interactions between the sars cov spike s protein and its receptor ace  in this report we screened a peptide library representing the sars cov s protein sequence using a human immunodeficiency virus based pseudotyping system to identify specific regions that affect viral entry one of the   peptides screened peptide    s residues       inhibited sars cov s mediated entry of the pseudotyped virions in  t cells expressing a functional sars cov receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme  in a dose dependent manner ic      m  alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to assess the roles of individual residues within this region of s which was previously uncharacterized the effects included significant reductions in expression k  a  viral incorporation l  a i  a and n  a  and reduced viral entry l  a l  a i  a t  a and f  a  taken together these results reveal a new region of the s protein that is crucial for sars cov entry
