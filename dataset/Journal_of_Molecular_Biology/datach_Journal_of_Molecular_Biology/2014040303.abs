the folding of a family of three helix bundle proteins spectrin r  has a robust folding nucleus unlike its homologous neighbours
three homologous spectrin domains have remarkably different folding characteristics we have previously shown that the slow folding r  and r  spectrin domains can be altered to resemble the fast folding r  in terms of speed of folding and unfolding  landscape roughness and folding mechanism simply by substituting five residues in the core here we show that by contrast r  cannot be engineered to resemble r  and r  it is possible to engineer a slow folding version of r  but our analysis shows that this protein neither has a rougher energy landscape nor does change its folding mechanism quite remarkably r  appears to be a rare example of a protein with a folding nucleus that does not change in position or in size when its folding nucleus is disrupted thus while two members of this protein family are remarkably plastic the third has apparently a restricted folding landscape
