visualisation of a kinesin  motor on microtubule end mimics
an expanding collection of proteins localises to microtubule ends to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and architecture by unknown molecular mechanisms electron microscopy is invaluable for studying microtubule structure but because microtubule ends are heterogeneous their structures are difficult to determine we therefore investigated whether tubulin oligomers induced by the drug dolastatin could mimic microtubule ends the microtubule end dependent atpase of kinesin  motors is coupled to microtubule depolymerisation significantly kinesin  motor atpase activity is stimulated by dolastatin  tubulin oligomers suggesting first that these oligomers share properties with microtubule ends and second that the physical presence of an end is less important than terminal tubulin flexibility for microtubule end recognition by the kinesin  motor using electron microscopy we visualised the kinesin  motor  dolastatin  tubulin oligomer interaction in nucleotide states mimicking steps in the atpase cycle this enabled us to detect conformational changes that the motor undergoes during depolymerisation our data suggest that such tubulin oligomers can be used to examine other microtubule end binding proteins
