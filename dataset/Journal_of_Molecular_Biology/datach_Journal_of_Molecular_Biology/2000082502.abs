a bayesian system integrating expression data with sequence patterns for localizing proteins comprehensive application to the yeast genome edited by f cohen
we develop a probabilistic system for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins and estimating the relative population of the various compartments in yeast our system employs a bayesian approach updating a protein  s probability of being in a compartment based on a diverse range of  features these range from specific motifs e g signal sequences or the hdel motif to overall properties of a sequence e g surface composition or isoelectric point to whole genome data e g absolute mrna expression levels or their fluctuations  the strength of our approach is the easy integration of many features particularly the whole genome expression data we construct a training and testing set of     yeast proteins with an experimentally known localization from merging filtering and standardizing the annotation in the mips swiss prot and ypd databases and we achieve   accuracy on individual protein predictions using this dataset moreover we are able to estimate the relative protein population of the various compartments without requiring a definite localization for every protein this approach which is based on an analogy to formalism in quantum mechanics gives better accuracy in determining relative compartment populations than that obtained by simply tallying the localization predictions for individual proteins on the yeast proteins with known localization    versus    our training and testing also highlights which of the  features are informative and which are redundant   being particularly useful  after developing our system we apply it to the   yeast proteins with currently unknown localization and estimate the relative population of the various compartments in the entire yeast genome an unbiased prior is essential to this extrapolated estimate for this we use the mips localization catalogue and adapt recent results on the localization of yeast proteins obtained by snyder and colleagues using a minitransposon system our final localizations for all     proteins in the yeast genome are available over the web at http  bioinfo mbb yale edu genome localize
