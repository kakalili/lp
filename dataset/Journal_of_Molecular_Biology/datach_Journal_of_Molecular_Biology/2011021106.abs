mesophilic and hyperthermophilic adenylate kinases differ in their tolerance to random fragmentation
the extent to which thermostability influences the location of protein fragmentation sites that allow retention of function is not known to evaluate this we used a novel transposase based approach to create libraries of vectors that express structurally related fragments of bacillus subtilis adenylate kinase bsak and thermotoga neapolitana adenylate kinase tnak with identical modifications at their termini and we selected for variants in each library that complement the growth of escherichia coli with a temperature sensitive adenylate kinase ak  mutants created using the hyperthermophilic tnak were found to support growth with a higher frequency    than those generated from the mesophilic bsak    and selected tnak mutants complemented e coli growth more strongly than homologous bsak variants sequencing of functional clones from each library also identified a greater dispersion of fragmentation sites within tnak nondisruptive fission sites were observed within the amp binding and core domains of both ak homologs however only tnak contained sites within the lid domain which undergoes dynamic fluctuations that are critical for catalysis these findings implicate the flexible lid domain as having an increased sensitivity to fission events at physiological temperatures in addition they provide evidence that comparisons of nondisruptive fission sites in homologous proteins could be useful for finding dynamic regions whose conformational fluctuations are important for function and they show that the discovery of protein fragments that cooperatively function in mesophiles can be aided by the use of thermophilic enzymes as starting points for protein design
