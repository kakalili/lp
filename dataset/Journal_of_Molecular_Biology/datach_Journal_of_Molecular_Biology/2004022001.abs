p  inhibits strand exchange and replication fork regression promoted by human rad
we explore the effects of p  on strand exchange as well as regression of stalled replication forks promoted by human rad  we have found that p  specifically inhibits strand exchange mediated by human rad  but not by escherichia coli reca in addition we provide in vitro evidence that human rad  can promote regression of a stalled replication fork and p  also inhibits this fork regression furthermore we show that two cancer related p  mutant proteins cannot inhibit strand exchange and fork regression catalyzed by human rad  the results establish a direct functional link between p  and human rad  and reveal that one of p  s functions in genome stabilization may be to prevent detrimental genome rearrangements promoted by human rad  thus the results support the hypothesis that p  contributes to genome stability by a transcription independent modulation of homologous recombination
