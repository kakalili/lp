single turnover kinetic analysis of the mutagenic potential of  oxo   dihydro   deoxyguanosine during gap filling synthesis catalyzed by human dna polymerases  and
in the presence of  oxo   dihydro   deoxyguanosine  oxodg damage many dna polymerases exhibit a dual coding potential which facilitates efficient incorporation of matched dctp or mismatched datp this also holds true for the insertion of  oxodgtp opposite template bases dc and da employing single turnover kinetic methods we examined human dna polymerase  and its novel x family homolog human dna polymerase   to determine which nucleotide and template base was preferred when encountering  oxodg and  oxodgtp respectively while dna polymerase  preferentially incorporated dctp over datp dna polymerase  did not modulate a preference for either dctp or datp when opposite  oxodg in single nucleotide gapped dna as incorporation proceeded with essentially equal efficiency and probability moreover dna polymerase  is more efficient than dna polymerase  to fill this oxidized single nucleotide gap insertion of  oxodgtp by both dna polymerases  and  occurred predominantly against template da thereby reiterating how the asymmetrical design of the polymerase active site differentially accommodated the anti and syn conformations of  oxodg and  oxodgtp although the electronegative oxygen at the c position of  oxodg may induce dna structural perturbations human dna ligase i was found to effectively ligate the incorporated  oxodgmp to a downstream strand which sealed the nicked dna consequently the erroneous nucleotide incorporations catalyzed by dna polymerases  and  as well as the subsequent ligation catalyzed by a dna ligase during base excision repair are a threat to genomic integrity
