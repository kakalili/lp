the crystal structures of psoralen cross linked dnas drug dependent formation of holliday junctions edited by i tinoco
the single crystal structures are presented for two dna sequences with the thymine bases covalently cross linked across the complementary strands by   hydroxymethyl     trimethylpsoralen hmt  the hmt adduct of d ccgctagcgg forms a psoralen induced holliday junction showing for the first time the effect of this important class of chemotheraputics on the structure of the recombination intermediate in contrast hmt d ccggtaccgg forms a sequence dependent junction in both structures the dna duplex is highly distorted at the thymine base linked to the six member pyrone ring of the drug the psoralen cross link defines the intramolecular interactions of the drug induced junction while the sequence dependent structure is nearly identical to the native holliday junction of d ccggtaccgg alone the two structures contrast the effects of drug and sequence dependent interactions on the structure of a holliday junction suggesting a role for psoralen in the mechanism to initiate repair of psoralen lesions in mammalian dna
