resurrection of an urbilaterian u a u b  snf protein
the u a u b  snf family of proteins found in the u and u spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins is highly conserved in spite of the high degree of sequence and structural conservation modern members of this protein family have unique rna binding properties these differences have necessarily resulted from evolutionary processes and therefore we reconstructed the protein phylogeny in order to understand how and when divergence occurred and how protein function has been modulated contrary to the conventional understanding of an ancient human u a u b  gene duplication we show that the last common ancestor of bilaterians contained a single ancestral protein urb  the gene for urb was synthesized the protein was overexpressed and purified and we assessed rna binding to modern snrna sequences we find that urb binds human and drosophila u snrna slii and u snrna sliv with higher affinity than do modern homologs suggesting that both drosophila snf and human u a u b  have evolved into weaker binders of one rna or both rnas
