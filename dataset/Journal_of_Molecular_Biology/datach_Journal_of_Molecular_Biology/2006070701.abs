quantitative actin folding reactions using yeast cct purified via an internal tag in the cct   subunit
the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin cct is an essential atp dependent protein folding machine whose action is required for folding the cytoskeletal proteins actin and tubulin and a small number of other substrates including members of the wd  propellor repeat containing protein family an efficient purification protocol for cct from saccharomyces cerevisiae has been developed it uses the calmodulin binding peptide as an affinity tag in an internal loop in the apical domain of the cct subunit which is predicted to be located on the outside of the double ring assembly this purified yeast cct was used for a novel quantitative actin folding assay with human  actin or yeast act p protein folding intermediates aci pre synthesised in an escherichia coli translation system the formation of native actin follows approximately a first order reaction with a rate constant of about    min   yeast cct catalyses the folding of yeast act p and human  actin with nearly identical rate constants and yields the results from this controlled cct actin folding assay are consistent with a model where cct and aci are in a binding pre equilibrium with a rate limiting binding step followed by a faster atp driven processing to native actin in this pure in vitro system the human  actin mutants d  s and g  p show impaired folding behaviour in the manner predicted by our sequence specific recognition model for cct  actin interaction
