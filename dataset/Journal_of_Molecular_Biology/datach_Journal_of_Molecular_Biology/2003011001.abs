characterization of the abca transporter subfamily identification of prokaryotic and eukaryotic members phylogeny and topology
an alignment of the mammalian abca transporters enabled the identification of sequence segments specific to the abca subfamily which were used as queries to search for eukaryotic and prokaryotic homologues thirty seven eukaryotic half and full length transporters were found and a close relationship with prokaryotic subfamily  transporters was detected each half of the abca full transporters is predicted to comprise a membrane spanning domain msd composed of six helices and a large extracellular loop followed by a nucleotide binding domain nbd and a conserved cytoplasmic  residue sequence which might have a regulatory function the topology predicted for the abca transporters was compared to the crystal structures of the msba and btucd bacterial transporters the alignment of the msd and nbd domains provided an estimate of the degree of residue conservation in the cytoplasmic extracellular and transmembrane domains of the abca transporter subfamily the phylogenic tree of eukaryotic abca transporters based upon the nbd sequences consists of three major clades corresponding to the half transporter single nbds and to the full transporter nbdls and nbd s a phylogenic tree of prokaryotic transporters and the eukaryotic abca transporters confirmed the evolutionary relationship between prokaryotic subfamily  transporters and eukaryotic abca half and full transporters
