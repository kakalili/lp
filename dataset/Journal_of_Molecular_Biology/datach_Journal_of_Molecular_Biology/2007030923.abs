essential role of proline isomerization in stefin b tetramer formation
here we present the tetrameric structure of stefin b which is the result of a process by which two domain swapped dimers of stefin b are transformed into tetramers the transformation involves a previously unidentified process of extensive intermolecular contacts termed hand shaking which occurs concurrently with trans to cis isomerization of proline   this proline residue is widely conserved throughout the cystatin superfamily a member of which human cystatin c is the key protein in cerebral amyloid angiopathy these results are consistent with the hypothesis that isomerization of proline residues can play a decisive role in amyloidogenesis
