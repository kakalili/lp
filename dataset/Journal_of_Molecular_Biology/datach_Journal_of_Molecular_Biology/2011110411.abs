the structures of thermoplasma volcanium phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase bound to ribose  phosphate and atp analogs
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate prpp synthetase catalyzes the transfer of the pyrophosphate group from atp to ribose  phosphate r p yielding prpp and amp prpp is an essential metabolite that plays a central role in cellular metabolism the enzyme from a thermophilic archaeon thermoplasma volcanium tv was expressed in escherichia coli crystallized and its x ray molecular structure was determined in a complex with its substrate r p and with substrate analogs    methylene atp and adp in two monoclinic crystal forms p  the    methylene atp and the adp bound binary structures were determined from crystals grown from ammonium sulfate solutions these crystals diffracted to     and     resolutions respectively crystals of the ternary complex with adp  mg  and r p were grown from a polyethylene glycol solution in the absence of sulfate ions and they diffracted to     resolution the unit cell is approximately double the size of the unit cell of the crystals grown in the presence of sulfate the tv prpp synthetase adopts two conformations open and closed at different stages in the catalytic cycle the binding of substrates r p and atp occurs with prpp synthetase in the open conformation whereas catalysis presumably takes place with prpp synthetase in the closed conformation the tv prpp synthetase forms a biological dimer in contrast to the tetrameric or hexameric quaternary structures of the methanocaldococcus jannaschii and bacillus subtilis prpp synthetases respectively
