the structure of ribonuclease p protein from staphylococcus aureus reveals a unique binding site for single stranded rna edited by r huber
ribonuclease p rnasep catalyses the removal of the   leader sequence from pre trna to produce the mature   terminus the prokaryotic rnasep holoenzyme consists of a catalytic rna component and a protein subunit rnasep protein  which plays an auxiliary but essential role in vivo by binding to the   leader sequence and broadening the substrate specificity of the ribozyme we determined the three dimensional high resolution structure of the rnasep protein from staphylococcus aureus   amino acid residues by nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy in solution the protein has an   fold similar to the ribonucleoprotein domain we used small nucleic acid molecules as a model for the   leader sequence to probe the propensity for generic single stranded rna binding on the protein surface the nmr results reveal a contiguous interaction site which is identical with the previously identified leader sequence binding site in rnasep holoenzyme the conserved arginine rich motif does not bind single stranded rna it is likely that this peptide segment binds selectively to double stranded sections of p rna which are conformationally more rigid given the essentiality of rnasep for the viability of the organism knowledge of the s aureus protein structure and insight into its interaction with rna will help us to develop rnasep and rnasep protein as targets for novel antibiotics against this pathogen
