crystal structure of osmoporin ompc from e coli at
porins form transmembrane pores in the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria with matrix porin ompf and osmoporin ompc from escherichia coli being differentially expressed depending on environmental conditions the three dimensional structure of ompc has been determined to     resolution by x ray crystallography as expected from the high sequence similarity ompc adopts the ompf like  stranded hollow  barrel fold with three  barrels associated to form a tight trimer unlike in ompf the extracellular loops form a continuous wall at the perimeter of the vestibule common to the three pores due to a  residues insertion in loop l  the pore constriction and the periplasmic outlet are very similar to ompf with   of the pore lining residues being conserved overall only few ionizable residues are exchanged at the pore lining the ompc structure suggests that not pore size but electrostatic pore potential and particular atomic details of the pore linings are the critical parameters that physiologically distinguish ompc from ompf
