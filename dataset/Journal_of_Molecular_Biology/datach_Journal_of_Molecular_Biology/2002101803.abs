glutamine  is a gatekeeper residue in the fk  binding protein
the effect of non random conformational averaging in the urea unfolded state on the folding pathway has been investigated in a variant of the fk  binding protein with three additional residues at the amino terminus fkbp   three mutations asparagine aspartate and threonine were introduced into position q  to enhance formation of non native helix observed in this part of the protein in the urea unfolded state nmr analysis showed minor structural changes in the native state of each mutant but additional medium range  n i i  of each mutant nuclear overhauser enhancements were observed in the urea unfolded state that were not in fkbp   indicating that the mutations had a more substantial effect on the unfolded state ensemble than on the native state ensemble isothermal equilibrium denaturation measurements showed that the q t and q d mutants were destabilized whereas the q n mutant was stabilized relative to fkbp  with little change in the equilibrium m values the unfolding rates of q n and q t were similar to that of fkbp   but q d unfolded twice as fast as fkbp   in contrast the mutations had a more pronounced effect on the refolding kinetics q n refolded slightly faster and exhibited a kinetic folding intermediate similar to that of fkbp   the q d and q t mutants also refolded faster than fkbp  but lacked the folding intermediate indicating that these mutants experienced a different folding trajectory and transition state than fkbp  and q n the refolding kinetic  values were      and   for q n q t and q d respectively the data point to q  functioning as a gatekeeper residue in the folding of fkbp   this study shows that perturbing the unfolded state ensemble via mutagenesis can provide insights into residues that play important roles in the folding pathway and represents an attractive strategy for mapping the high energy portions of the folding energy landscape
