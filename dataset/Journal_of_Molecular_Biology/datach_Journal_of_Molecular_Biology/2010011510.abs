a novel mechanism of sugar selection utilized by a human x family dna polymerase
during dna synthesis most dna polymerases and reverse transcriptases select against ribonucleotides via a steric clash between the ribose   hydroxyl group and the bulky side chain of an active site residue in this study we demonstrated that human dna polymerase  used a novel sugar selection mechanism to discriminate against ribonucleotides whereby the ribose   hydroxyl group was excluded mostly by a backbone segment and slightly by the side chain of y   such steric clash was further demonstrated to be dependent on the size and orientation of the substituent covalently attached at the ribonucleotide c   position
