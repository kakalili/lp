non homologous recombination of deoxyribonucleoside kinases from human and drosophila melanogaster yields human like enzymes with novel activities
in antiviral and cancer therapy deoxyribonucleoside kinases dnks are often the rate limiting step in activating nucleoside analog na prodrugs into their cytotoxic phosphorylated forms we have constructed libraries of hybrid enzymes by non homologous recombination of the pyrimidine specific human thymidine kinase  and the broad specificity dnk from drosophila melanogaster their low sequence identity has precluded engineering by conventional homology dependent shuffling techniques from these libraries we identified chimeras that phosphorylate nucleoside analogs with higher activity than either parental enzyme and that possess new activity towards the anti hiv prodrug      didehydro   deoxythymidine d t  these results demonstrate the potential of non homologous recombination within the dnk family for creating enzymes with new and improved activities towards nucleoside analogs in addition our results exposed a previously unknown role for the c terminal regions of these dnks in determining substrate selectivity
