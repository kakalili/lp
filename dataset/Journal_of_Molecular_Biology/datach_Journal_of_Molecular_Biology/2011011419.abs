atomic level characterization of the ensemble of the a      monomer in water using unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and spectral algorithms
a      is the highly pathologic isoform of amyloid   the peptide constituent of fibrils and neurotoxic oligomers involved in alzheimer s disease recent studies on the structural features of a  in water have suggested that the system can be described as an ensemble of distinct conformational species in fast exchange here we use replica exchange molecular dynamics remd simulations to characterize the conformations accessible to a   in explicit water solvent under the ff sb force field monitoring the correlation between j coupling jhnh  and residual dipolar coupling rdc data calculated from the remd trajectories to their experimental values as determined by nmr indicates that the simulations converge towards sampling an ensemble that is representative of the experimental data after   ns replica of simulation time we further validate the converged md derived ensemble through direct comparison with jhnh  and rdc experimental data our analysis indicates that the ff sb derived remd ensemble can reproduce the experimental j coupling values with high accuracy and further provide good agreement with the rdc data our results indicate that the peptide is sampling a highly diverse range of conformations by implementing statistical learning techniques laplacian eigenmaps spectral clustering and laplacian scores  we are able to obtain an otherwise hidden structure in the complex conformational space of the peptide using these methods we characterize the peptide conformations and extract their intrinsic characteristics identify a small number of different conformations that characterize the whole ensemble and identify a small number of protein interactions such as contacts between the peptide termini that are the most discriminative of the different conformations and thus can be used in designing experimental probes of transitions between such molecular states this is a study of an important intrinsically disordered peptide system that provides an atomic level description of structural features and interactions that are relevant during the early stages of the oligomerization and fibril nucleation pathways
