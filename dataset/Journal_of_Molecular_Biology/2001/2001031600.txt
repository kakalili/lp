β-Ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III (FabH) is a condensing enzyme that plays central roles in fatty acid biosynthesis. Three-dimensional structures of E. coli FabH in the presence and absence of ligands have been refined to 1.46 Å resolution. The structures of improved accuracy revealed detailed interactions involved in ligand binding. These structures also provided new insights into the FabH mechanism, e.g. the possible role of a water or hydroxyl anion in Cys112 deprotonation. A structure of the apo enzyme uncovered large conformational changes in the active site, exemplified by the disordering of four essential loops (84–86, 146–152, 185–217 and 305–307) and the movement of catalytic residues (Cys112 and His244). The disordering of the loops leads to greater than 50 % reduction in the FabH dimer interface, suggesting a dynamic nature for an unusually large portion of the dimer interface. The existence of a large solvent-accessible channel in the dimer interface as well as two cis-peptides (cis-Pro88 and cis-Phe308) in two of the disordered loops may explain the observed structural instabilities.
