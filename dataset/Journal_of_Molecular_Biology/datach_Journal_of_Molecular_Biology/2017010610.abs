reassessing apobec g inhibition by hiv  vif derived peptides
the human apobec g a g enzyme restricts hiv  in the absence of the viral accessory protein viral infectivity factor vif by deaminating viral cdna cytosines to uracils these uracil lesions base pair with adenines during the completion of reverse transcription and result in a g signature g to a mutations in the viral genome vif protects hiv  from a g mediated restriction by forming an e ubiquitin ligase complex to polyubiquitinate a g and trigger its degradation prior studies indicated that vif may also directly block the enzymatic activity of a g and provocatively that vif derived peptides vif     and vif      are similarly inhibitory here we show that vif     does not inhibit a g enzymatic activity and that the inhibitory effect of vif      and that of a shorter derivative vif      although recapitulated are non specific we also elaborate a simple method for assaying dna cytosine deaminase activity that eliminates potential polymerase chain reaction induced biases our results show that these vif derived peptides are unlikely to be useful as tools to study a g function or as leads for the development of future therapeutics
