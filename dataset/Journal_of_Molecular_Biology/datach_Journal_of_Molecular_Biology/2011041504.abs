a proteomic study of myosin ii motor proteins during tumor cell migration
myosin ii motor proteins play important roles in cell migration although myosin ii filament assembly plays a key role in the stabilization of focal contacts at the leading edge of migrating cells the mechanisms and signaling pathways regulating the localized assembly of lamellipodial myosin ii filaments are poorly understood we performed a proteomic analysis of myosin heavy chain mhc phosphorylation sites in mda mb   breast cancer cells to identify mhc phosphorylation sites that are activated during integrin engagement and lamellar extension on fibronectin fibronectin activated mhc phosphorylation was identified on novel and previously recognized consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase c and casein kinase ii ck ii  s   a ck ii consensus site was highly phosphorylated in response to matrix engagement and phosphoantibody staining revealed phosphorylation on myosin ii assembled into leading edge lamellae surprisingly neither pharmacological reduction nor small inhibitory rna reduction in ck ii activity reduced this stimulated s   phosphorylation our data demonstrate that s   phosphorylation is upregulated during lamellar protrusion and that ck ii does not appear to be the kinase responsible for this matrix induced phosphorylation event
