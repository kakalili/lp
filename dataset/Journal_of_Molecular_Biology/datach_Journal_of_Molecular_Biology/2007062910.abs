the structure of human thioredoxin reductase  provides insights into c terminal rearrangements during catalysis
human thioredoxin reductase htrxr is a homodimeric flavoprotein crucially involved in the regulation of cellular redox reactions growth and differentiation the enzyme contains a selenocysteine residue at its c terminal active site that is essential for catalysis this redox center is located on a flexible arm solvent exposed and reactive towards electrophilic inhibitors thus representing a target for antitumor drug development during catalysis reducing equivalents are transferred from the cofactor nadph to fad then to the n terminal active site cysteine residues and from there to the flexible c terminal part of the other subunit to be finally delivered to a variety of second substrates at the molecule s surface here we report the first crystal structure of htrxr  sec  cys in complex with fad and nadp at a resolution of     from the crystals three different conformations of the carboxy terminal arm could be deduced the predicted movement of the arm is facilitated by the concerted action of the three side chain residues of n   n  and w   which act as a guiding bar for the c terminal sliding process as supported by previous kinetic data the three visualized conformations might reflect different stages in enzymatic catalysis comparison with other disulfide reductases including human glutathione reductase revealed specific inhibitor binding sites in the intersubunit cavity of htrxr that can be exploited for structure based inhibitor development
