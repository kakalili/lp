location of tyrosine   a target for phosphorylation by cabl tyrosine kinase at the edge of the subunit  subunit interface of the human rad  filament
rad  is a key element of recombinational dna repair and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at position   by cabl kinase this phosphorylation could be involved in the resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy we have investigated the role of this residue by comparing the three dimensional structures of human rad  and its prokaryotic homologue escherichia coli reca the residue appeared to be on the edge of the subunit  subunit interacting site the fluorescence intensity of the tryptophan residue inserted at position   of human rad  in the place of tyrosine was decreased by adding  m urea although the protein was not unfolded as there was no large change in the fluorescence peak position or circular dichroism signal this change in fluorescence occurred at a lower urea concentration when the protein was diluted which favours dissociation these results indicate that the change is related to the dissociation of rad  polymer and that residue   is close to the subunit  subunit interacting site atp and adp which affect the filament structure caused a blue shift in the fluorescence peak these nucleotides probably altered the subunit  subunit contacts and may thus affect the filament structure phosphorylation of this residue could therefore affect the formation and structure of the rad  filament correct prediction of subunit  subunit interface of rad  by simple comparison of structures of rad  and reca supports the idea that rad  forms the filament in a similar way as does reca
