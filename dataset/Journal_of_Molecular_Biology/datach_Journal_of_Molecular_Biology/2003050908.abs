the complete mouse nebulin gene sequence and the identification of cardiac nebulin
nebulin is a giant mr     kda  modular sarcomeric protein proposed to regulate the assembly and to specify the precise lengths of actin thin filaments in vertebrate skeletal muscles nebulin s potential role as a molecular template is based on its structural and biochemical properties its central    kda portion associates with actin along the entire length of the thin filament its n terminal region extends to thin filament pointed ends and   kda of its c terminal region integrates within the z line lattice here we determined the exon intron organization of the entire mouse nebulin gene which contains   exons in a  kb segment we identified  novel exons   of which encode nebulin repeat motifs   from its central region and  from its z line region  one novel exon shares high sequence homology to the  residue repeats of the tight junction protein zo  rt pcr analyses revealed that all  novel exons are expressed in mouse skeletal muscle surprisingly we also amplified mrna transcripts from mouse and human heart cdna using primers designed along the entire length of nebulin the expression of cardiac specific nebulin transcripts was confirmed by in situ hybridization in fetal rat cardiomyocytes and in embryonic xenopus laevis frog heart on the protein level antibodies specific for skeletal muscle nebulin s n and c terminal regions stained isolated rat cardiac myofibrils at the pointed and barbed ends of thin filaments respectively these data indicate a conserved molecular layout of the nebulin filament systems in both cardiac and skeletal myofibrils we propose that thin filament length regulation in cardiac and skeletal muscles may share conserved nebulin based mechanisms and that nebulin isoform diversity may contribute to thin filament length differences in cardiac and skeletal muscle
