The wild-type p53 protein can be driven into a conformation corresponding to that adopted by structural mutant forms by heterodimerization with a mutant subunit. To seek partially folded states of the wild-type p53 core domain (p53C) we used high hydrostatic pressure (HP) and subzero temperatures. Aggregation of the protein was observed in parallel with its pressure denaturation at 25 and 37 °C. However, when HP experiments were performed at 4 °C, the extent of denaturation and aggregation was significantly less pronounced. On the other hand, subzero temperatures under pressure led to cold denaturation and yielded a non-aggregated, alternative conformation of p53C. Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H15N-NMR) data showed that the alternative p53C conformation resembled that of the hot-spot oncogenic mutant R248Q. This alternative state was as susceptible to denaturation and aggregation as the mutant R248Q when subjected to HP at 25 °C. Together these data demonstrate that wild-type p53C adopts an alternative conformation with a mutant-like stability, consistent with the dominant-negative effect caused by many mutants. This alternative conformation is likely related to inactive forms that appear in vivo, usually driven by interaction with mutant proteins. Therefore, it can be a valuable target in the search for ways to interfere with protein misfolding and hence to prevent tumor development.
