substrate recognition by family  alginate lyase from sphingomonas sp a
sphingomonas sp a alginate lyase a ii   a member of polysaccharide lyase family  shows a broad substrate specificity acting on poly  l guluronate poly g  poly  d mannuronate poly m  and the heteropolymer poly mg  in alginate molecules a ii  with a glove like  sandwich as a basic scaffold forms a cleft covered with two lid loops l and l  here we demonstrate the loop flexibility for substrate binding and structural determinants for broad substrate recognition and catalytic reaction the two loops associate mutually over the cleft through the formation of a hydrogen bond between their edges asn  and asn   a double mutant a ii  n  c n  c has a disulfide bond between cys  and cys   and shows little enzyme activity adding dithiothreitol to the enzyme reaction mixture leads to a tenfold increase in its molecular activity suggesting the significance of flexibility in lid loops for accommodating the substrate into the active cleft in alginate trisaccharide ggg or mmg bound a ii  y  f the enzyme interacts appropriately with substrate hydroxyl groups at subsites  and  and accommodates g or m while substrate carboxyl groups are strictly recognized by specific residues this mechanism for substrate recognition enables a ii  to show the broad substrate specificity the structure of a ii  h  n y  f complexed with a tetrasaccharide bound at subsites   to  suggests that gln  functions as a neutralizer for the substrate carboxyl group his  as a general base and tyr  as a general acid this is to our knowledge the first report on the structure and function relationship in family
