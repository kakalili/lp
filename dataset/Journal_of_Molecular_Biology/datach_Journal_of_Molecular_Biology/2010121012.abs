biosynthesis of isoprenoids crystal structure of the  fe  s cluster protein ispg
ispg protein serves as the penultimate enzyme of the recently discovered non mevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of the universal isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate the enzyme catalyzes the reductive ring opening of c methyl d erythritol   cyclodiphosphate which affords  hydroxy  methyl  e butenyl  diphosphate the protein was crystallized under anaerobic conditions and its three dimensional structure was determined to a resolution of     each subunit of the c symmetric homodimer folds into two domains connected by a short linker sequence the n terminal domain n domain is an eight stranded  barrel that belongs to the large tim barrel superfamily the c terminal domain c domain consists of a  sheet that is flanked on both sides by helices one glutamate and three cysteine residues of the c domain coordinate a  fe  s cluster homodimer formation involves an extended contact area about      between helices  and  of each respective  barrel moreover each c domain contacts the n domain of the partner subunit but the interface regions are small about      we propose that the enzyme substrate binds to the positively charged surface area at the c terminal pole of the  barrel the c domain carrying the iron  sulfur cluster could then move over to form a closed conformation where the substrate is sandwiched between the n domain and the c domain this article completes the set of three dimensional structures of the non mevalonate pathway enzymes which are of specific interest as potential targets for tuberculostatic and antimalarial drugs
