methylation of arginine residues interferes with citrullination by peptidylarginine deiminases in vitro
peptidylarginine deiminase pad enzymes catalyze the conversion of arginine residues in proteins to citrulline residues citrulline is a non standard amino acid that is not incorporated in proteins during translation but can be generated post translationally by the pad enzymes although the existence of citrulline residues in proteins has been known for a long time only a few proteins have been reported to contain this amino acid under normal conditions these include the nuclear histones which also contain a wide variety of other post translational modifications as for instance methylation of arginine residues it has been suggested that citrullination and methylation of arginine residues are competing processes and that pad enzymes might  reverse  the methylation of arginine residues by converting monomethylated arginine into citrulline however conflicting data have been reported on the capacity of pads to citrullinate monomethylated peptidylarginine using synthetic peptides that contain either arginine or methylated arginine residues we show that the human pad  pad and pad enzymes and pad enzyme present in several mouse tissues in vitro can only convert non methylated peptidylarginine into peptidylcitrulline and that hpad does not show any deiminating activity at all a comparison of bovine histones either treated or untreated with pad by amino acid analysis also supported the interference of deimination by arginine methylation taken together these data indicate that it is unlikely that methyl groups at the guanidino position of peptidylarginine can be removed by peptidylarginine deiminases which has important implications for the recently reported role of these enzymes in gene regulation
