in vivo roles of bama bamb and bamd in the biogenesis of bama a core protein of the  barrel assembly machine of escherichia coli
assembly of the  barrel outer membrane proteins omps is an essential cellular process in gram negative bacteria and in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of eukaryotes  two organelles of bacterial origin central to this process is the conserved  barrel omp that belongs to the omp  superfamily in escherichia coli bama is the core  barrel omp and together with four outer membrane lipoproteins bambcde constitutes the  barrel assembly machine bam  in this paper we investigated the roles of bamd an essential lipoprotein and bamb in bama biogenesis depletion of bamd caused impairment in bama biogenesis and cessation of cell growth these defects of bamd depletion were partly reversed by single amino acid substitutions mapping within the  barrel domain of bama however in the absence of bamb the positive effects of the  barrel substitutions on bama biogenesis under bamd depletion conditions were nullified by employing a bama protein bearing one such substitution f  l it was demonstrated that the mutant bama protein could not only assemble without bamd but also facilitate the assembly of wild type bama expressed in trans based on these data we propose a model in which the bam lipoproteins which are localized to the outer membrane by the bam independent lol pathway aid in the creation of new bam complexes by serving as outer membrane receptors and folding factors for nascent bama molecules the newly assembled bam holocomplex then catalyzes the assembly of substrate omps and bama these in vivo findings are corroborated by recently published in vitro data
