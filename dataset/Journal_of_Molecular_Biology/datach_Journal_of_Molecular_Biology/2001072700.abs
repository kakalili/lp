real time kinetic studies of the interaction between folded antisense and target rnas using surface plasmon resonance edited by j a doudna
antisense rnas interact with their complementary target rnas as folded structures the formation of early binding intermediates is the most important step in determining the overall rates of stable complex formation in vitro and the efficiency of control in vivo in the case of copa and copt antisense target rna pair of plasmid r  recent studies have identified a four way junction structure as the major binding intermediate previously the kinetics of antisense target rna interaction was studied by indirect methods here we have used surface plasmon resonance to follow the binding of copi a truncated variant of copa to copt in real time a protocol was developed that permitted the determination of association and dissociation rate constants for wild type and mutant copi copt pairs the kd values calculated from these rate constants were in good agreement with the results obtained by indirect methods in comparison to earlier model studies of interactions between simple complementary nucleic acids we observe a different temperature dependence for dissociation rate constants this may be indicative of the complexity of the steps required for interacting folded rnas intramolecular structure competes with intermolecular helix progression during complex formation the association rate constants were not significantly dependent on temperature the analysis presented shows that the stability of a kissing complex is not the primary determinant of the rate of stable copa copt complex formation
