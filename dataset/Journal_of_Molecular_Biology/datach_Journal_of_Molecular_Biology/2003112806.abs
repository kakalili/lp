the solution structure of human mitochondria fission protein fis reveals a novel tpr like helix bundle
fis in yeast localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane and facilitates mitochondrial fission by forming protein complexes with dnm and mdv  fis orthologs exist in higher eukaryotes suggesting that they are functionally conserved in the present study we cloned the human fis ortholog that was predicted in a database and determined the protein structure using nmr spectroscopy following a flexible n terminal tail six  helices connected with short loops construct a single core domain the c terminal tail containing a transmembrane segment appears to be disordered in the core domain each of two sequentially adjacent helices forms a hairpin like conformation resulting in a six helix assembly forming a slightly twisted slab similar to that of a tandem array of tetratrico peptide repeat tpr motif folds within this tpr like core domain no significant sequence similarity to the typical tpr motif is found the structural analogy to the tpr containing proteins suggests that fis binds to other proteins at its concave hydrophobic surface a simple composition of fis comprised of a binding domain and a transmembrane segment indicates that the protein may function as a molecular adaptor on the mitochondrial outer membrane in hela cells however increased levels in mitochondria associated fis did not result in mitochondrial translocation of drp  a potential binding partner of fis implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial fission suggesting that the interaction between drp and fis is regulated
