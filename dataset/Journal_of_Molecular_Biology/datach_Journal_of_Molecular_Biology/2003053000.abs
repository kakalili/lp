investigation of the role of the histidine  aspartate pair in the human exonuclease iii like abasic endonuclease ape
hydrogen bonded histidine  aspartate his  asp pairs are critical constituents in several key enzymatic reactions to date the role that these pairs play in catalysis is best understood in serine and trypsin like proteases where structural and biochemical nmr studies have revealed important pka values and hydrogen bonding patterns within the catalytic pocket however the role of the his  asp pair in metal assisted catalysis is less clear here we apply liquid state nmr to investigate the role of a critical histidine residue of apurinic endonuclease  ape  a human dna repair enzyme that cleaves adjacent to abasic sites in dna using one or more divalent cations and an active site his  asp pair the results of these studies suggest that the ape his  asp pair does not function as either a general base catalyst or a metal ligand rather the pair likely stabilizes the pentavalent transition state necessary for phospho transfer
