dsb im mobility and dna repair compartmentalization in mammalian cells
chromosomal translocations are considered as causal in approximately   of cancers therefore understanding their mechanisms of formation is crucial in the prevention of carcinogenesis the first step of translocation formation is the concomitant occurrence of double strand dna breaks dsbs in two different chromosomes dsbs can be repaired by different repair mechanisms including error free homologous recombination hr  potentially error prone non homologous end joining nhej and the highly mutagenic alternative end joining alt ej pathways regulation of dna repair pathway choice is crucial to avoid genomic instability in yeast dsbs are mobile and can scan the entire nucleus to be repaired in specialized dna repair centers or if they are persistent in order to associate with the nuclear pores or the nuclear envelope where they can be repaired by specialized repair pathways dsb mobility is limited in mammals therefore raising the question of whether the position at which a dsb occurs influences its repair here we review the recent literature addressing this question we first present the reports describing the extent of dsb mobility in mammalian cells in a second part we discuss the consequences of non random gene positioning on chromosomal translocations formation in the third part we discuss the mobility of heterochromatic dsbs in light of our recent data on dsb repair at the nuclear lamina and finally we show that dsb repair compartmentalization at the nuclear periphery is conserved from yeast to mammals further pointing to a role for gene positioning in the outcome of dsb repair when regarded as a whole the different studies reviewed here demonstrate the importance of nuclear architecture on dsb repair and reveal gene positioning as an important parameter in the study of tumorigenesis
