mechanism of tet repressor induction by tetracyclines length compensates for sequence in the     loop edited by a r fersht
natural tet repressor tetr variants are  helical proteins bearing a large loop between helices  and  which is variable in sequence and length we have deleted this loop consisting of  amino acid residues in tetr d and rebuilt it stepwise with up to  alanine residues all except the mutant with the longest alanine loop show wild type repression but none is inducible with tetracycline this demonstrates the importance of the     loop and its amino acid sequence for induction the induction efficiencies increase with loop length when the more tightly binding inducer anhydrotetracycline is used the largest increase of inducibility was observed for tetr mutants with loop lengths between eight and  alanine residues since loop residues asp glu  and arg  are conserved in the natural tetr sequence variants we constructed a mutant in which all other residues of the loop were replaced by alanine this mutant exhibits increased anhydrotetracycline induction compared to the corresponding alanine variant thus these residues are important for induction binding constants for the anhydrotetracycline tetr interaction are below the detection level of   m   for the mutant with a loop of two alanine residues and increase sharply until a loop size of ten residues is reached tetr variants with longer loops have similar anhydrotetracycline binding constants ranging between     m   and     m   about   fold lower than wild type tetr the increase of the affinity occurs at shorter loop lengths than that of inducibility we conclude that the induction defect of the polyalanine variants arises from two increments  i the loop must have a minimal length to allow efficient inducer binding  ii the loop must structurally participate in the conformational change associated with induction
