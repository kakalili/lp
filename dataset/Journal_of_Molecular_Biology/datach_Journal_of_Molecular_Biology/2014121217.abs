structural and mechanistic insights into the interaction between pyk and paxillin ld motifs
proline rich tyrosine kinase  pyk  is a member of the focal adhesion kinase fak subfamily of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases the c terminal pyk focal adhesion targeting fat domain binds to paxillin an adhesion molecule paxillin has five leucine aspartate ld motifs ld  ld  here we show that the second ld motif of paxillin ld  interacts with pyk fat similar to the known pyk fat ld interaction both ld motifs can target two ligand binding sites on pyk fat interestingly they also share similar binding affinity for pyk fat with preferential association to one site relative to the other nevertheless the ld ld region of paxillin paxillin     binds to pyk fat as a   complex however our data suggest that the pyk fat and paxillin complex is dynamic and it appears to be a mixture of two distinct conformations of paxillin that almost equally compete for pyk fat binding these studies provide insight into the underlying selectivity of paxillin for pyk and fak that may influence the differing behavior of these two closely related kinases in focal adhesion sites
