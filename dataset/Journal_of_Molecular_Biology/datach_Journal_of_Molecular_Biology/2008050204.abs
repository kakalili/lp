oligomerization of the spp scaffolding protein
viral scaffolding proteins direct polymerization of major capsid protein subunits into icosahedral procapsid structures the scaffolding protein of bacteriophage spp was engineered with a c terminal hexahistidine tag gp  his  and purified the protein is an  helical rich molecule with a very elongated shape as found for internal scaffolding proteins from other phages it is a   s tetramer of    kda at micromolar concentrations intersubunit cross linking of these tetramers generated preferentially covalently bound dimers revealing that gp  his is structurally a dimer of dimers incubation at temperatures above    c correlated with a reduction of its  helical content and a less effective intersubunit cross linking complete loss of secondary structure was observed at temperatures above    c refolding of gp  his thermally denatured at    c led to reacquisition of the protein native ellipticity spectrum but the resulting population of molecules was heterogeneous its hydrodynamic behavior was compatible with a mix of   s elongated tetramers     and a smaller fraction of   s dimers      this population of gp  his was competent to direct polymerization of the spp major capsid protein gp  into procapsid like structures in a newly developed assembly assay in vitro although native tetramers were active in assembly refolded gp  his showed enhanced binding to gp  revealing a more active species for interaction with the major capsid protein than native gp  his
