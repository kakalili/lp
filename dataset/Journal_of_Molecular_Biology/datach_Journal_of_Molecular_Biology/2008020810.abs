opus psp an orientation dependent statistical all atom potential derived from side chain packing
here we report an orientation dependent statistical all atom potential derived from side chain packing named opus psp it features a basis set of  rigid body blocks extracted from the chemical structures of all  amino acid residues the potential is generated from the orientation specific packing statistics of pairs of those blocks in a non redundant structural database the purpose of such an approach is to capture the essential elements of orientation dependence in molecular packing interactions tests of opus psp on commonly used decoy sets demonstrate that it significantly outperforms most of the existing knowledge based potentials in terms of both its ability to recognize native structures and consistency in achieving high z scores across decoy sets as opus psp excludes interactions among main chain atoms its success highlights the crucial importance of side chain packing in forming native protein structures moreover opus psp does not explicitly include solvation terms and thus the potential should perform well when the solvation effect is difficult to determine such as in membrane proteins overall opus psp is a generally applicable potential for protein structure modeling especially for handling side chain conformations one of the most difficult steps in high accuracy protein structure prediction and refinement
