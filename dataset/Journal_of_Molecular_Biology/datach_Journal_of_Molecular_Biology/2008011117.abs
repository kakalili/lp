exclusion of the native  helix from the amyloid fibrils of a mixed    protein
members of the cystatin superfamily are involved in an inherited form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and readily form amyloid fibrils in vitro we have determined the structured core of human stefin b cystatin b amyloid fibrils using quenched hydrogen exchange and nmr the core contains residues from four of the five strands of the native  sheet delimited by unprotected loop regions analogous to those of the native monomeric structure however non native features are also apparent the most striking of which is the exclusion of the native  helix before forming amyloid in vitro cystatins dimerise via d domain swapping and assemble into tetramers with trans to cis isomerism of a conserved proline in the fibril the hinge loop that forms an extended  structure in the dimer remains protected consistent with the domain swapping interface being maintained however the fibril data are not compatible with a simple d domain swapping model for amyloid formation and the displacement of the helix points to alternative packing arrangements of native like  structure in which proline isomerism is important in preventing steric clashing
