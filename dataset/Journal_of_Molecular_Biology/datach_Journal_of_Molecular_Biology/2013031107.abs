vibrio cholerae cytolysin recognizes the heptasaccharide core of complex n glycans with nanomolar affinity
pathogens selectively target host cells using adhesion molecules and secreted virulence factors that may utilize protein lipid or carbohydrate ligands on the cell surface the human intestinal pathogen vibrio cholerae secretes a pore forming toxin v cholerae cytolysin vcc  which contains two domains that are structurally similar to known carbohydrate binding proteins these tandem domains are attached to the carboxy terminus of the cytolytic domain and contain a  trefoil fold and a  prism fold vcc has been shown to bind glycosylated proteins and removal of the  prism domain leads to a large decrease in lytic activity against rabbit erythrocytes despite these clues the identity of the glycan receptors of vcc and the role of glycan binding in toxin activity remain unknown to better understand this specificity we used a combination of structural and functional approaches to characterize the carbohydrate binding activity of the vcc toxin we first probed the monosaccharide binding activity of vcc and demonstrated that the toxin exhibits millimolar affinity for aldohexoses to understand this specificity we solved the crystal structure of the vcc  prism domain bound to methyl  mannose next we utilized a mammalian glycan screen to determine that the  prism domain preferentially binds complex n glycans with a heptasaccharide glcnac man core nga  fluorescence anisotropy and surface plasmon resonance indicated an approximately   nm affinity of the  prism domain for the heptasaccharide core our results suggest that carbohydrate binding domains on the vcc toxin facilitate high affinity targeting of mammalian cell membranes which may contribute to the ability of vcc to lyse cells at picomolar concentrations
