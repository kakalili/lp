the solution and crystal structures of a module pair from the staphylococcus aureus binding site of human fibronectin  a tale with a twist
an important goal of structural studies of modular proteins is to determine the inter module orientation which often influences biological function the n terminal domain of human fibronectin fn is composed of a string of five type  modules f  despite their small size to date f modules have proved intractable to x ray structure solution although there are several nmr structures available here we present the first structures two x ray models and an nmr derived model of the f f module pair which forms part of the binding site for fn binding proteins from pathogenic bacteria the crystallographic structure determination was aided by the novel technique of uv radiation damage induced phasing the individual module structures are very similar in all three models in the nmr structure and one of the x ray structures a similar but smaller interdomain interface than that observed previously for f f is seen the other x ray structure has a different interdomain orientation this work underlines the benefits of combining x ray and nmr data in the studies of multi domain proteins
