myosin binding protein c positioned to play a key role in regulation of muscle contraction structure and interactions of domain c
myosin binding protein c mybp c is a thick filament protein involved in the regulation of muscle contraction mutations in the gene for mybp c are the second most frequent cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mybp c binds to myosin with two binding sites one at its c terminus and another at its n terminus the n terminal binding site consisting of immunoglobulin domains c and c connected by a flexible linker interacts with the s segment of myosin in a phosphorylation regulated manner it is assumed that the function of mybp c is to act as a tether that fixes the s heads in a resting position and that phosphorylation releases the s heads into an active state here we report the structure and binding properties of domain c  using a combination of site directed mutagenesis and nmr interaction experiments we identified the binding site of domain c in the immediate vicinity of the s  s hinge very close to the light chains in addition we identified a zinc binding site on domain c in close proximity to the s binding site its zinc binding affinity kd of approximately      m might not be sufficient for a physiological effect however the familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy related mutation of one of the zinc ligands glutamine   to histidine will significantly increase the binding affinity suggesting that this mutation may affect s binding the close proximity of the c binding site to the hinge the light chains and the s heads also provides an explanation for recent observations that a shorter fragments of mybp c unable to act as a tether still have an effect on the actomyosin atpase and b as to why the myosin head positions in phosphorylated wild type mice and mybp c knockout mice are so different domain c bound to the s  s hinge is able to manipulate s head positions thus influencing force generation without tether the potentially extensive extra interactions of c are expected to keep it in place while phosphorylation dislodges the c  c linker and domain c  as a result the myosin heads would always be attached to a tether that has phosphorylation dependent length regulation
