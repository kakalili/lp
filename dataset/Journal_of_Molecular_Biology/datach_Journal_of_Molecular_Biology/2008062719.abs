cross linking of phospholipid membranes is a conserved property of calcium sensitive synaptotagmins
synaptotagmins are vesicular proteins implicated in many membrane trafficking events they are highly conserved in evolution and the mammalian family contains  isoforms we now show that the tandem c domains of several calcium sensitive synaptotagmin isoforms tested including drosophila synaptotagmin rapidly cross link phospholipid membranes in contrast to the tandem structure individual c domains failed to trigger membrane cross linking in several novel assays large scale liposomal aggregation driven by tandem c domains in response to calcium was confirmed by the following techniques turbidity assay dynamic light scattering and both confocal and negative stain electron microscopy firm cross linking of membranes was evident from laser trap experiments high resolution cryo electron microscopy revealed that membrane cross linking by tandem c domains results in a constant distance of    nm between the apposed membranes our findings show the conserved nature of this important property of synaptotagmin demonstrate the significance of the tandem c domain structure and provide a plausible explanation for the accelerating effect of synaptotagmins on membrane fusion
