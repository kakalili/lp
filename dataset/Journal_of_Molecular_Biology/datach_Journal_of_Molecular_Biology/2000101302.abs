analysis and prediction of functional sub types from protein sequence alignments edited by j thornton
the increasing number and diversity of protein sequence families requires new methods to define and predict details regarding function here we present a method for analysis and prediction of functional sub types from multiple protein sequence alignments given an alignment and set of proteins grouped into sub types according to some definition of function such as enzymatic specificity the method identifies positions that are indicative of functional differences by comparison of sub type specific sequence profiles and analysis of positional entropy in the alignment alignment positions with significantly high positional relative entropy correlate with those known to be involved in defining sub types for nucleotidyl cyclases protein kinases lactate malate dehydrogenases and trypsin like serine proteases we highlight new positions for these proteins that suggest additional experiments to elucidate the basis of specificity the method is also able to predict sub type for unclassified sequences we assess several variations on a prediction method and compare them to simple sequence comparisons for assessment we remove close homologues to the sequence for which a prediction is to be made by a sequence identity above a threshold  this simulates situations where a protein is known to belong to a protein family but is not a close relative of another protein of known sub type considering the four families above and a sequence identity threshold of    our best method gives an accuracy of   compared to   obtained for sequence similarity and   for blast we describe the derivation of a set of sub type groupings derived from an automated parsing of alignments from pfam and the swissprot database and use this to perform a large scale assessment the best method gives an average accuracy of   compared to   for sequence similarity and   for blast we discuss implications for experimental design genome annotation and the prediction of protein function and protein intra residue distances
