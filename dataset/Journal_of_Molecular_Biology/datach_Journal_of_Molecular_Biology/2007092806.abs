crystal structure of the bir domain of xiap in two crystal forms
x linked inhibitor of apoptosis xiap is a potent negative regulator of apoptosis it also plays a role in bmp signaling tgf  signaling and copper homeostasis previous structural studies have shown that the baculoviral iap repeat bir and bir  domains of xiap interact with the iap binding motifs ibm in several apoptosis proteins such as smac and caspase  via the conserved ibm binding groove here we report the crystal structure in two crystal forms of the bir domain of xiap which does not possess this ibm binding groove and cannot interact with smac or caspase  instead the bir domain forms a conserved dimer through the region corresponding to the ibm binding groove structural and sequence analyses suggest that this dimerization of bir in xiap may be conserved in other iap family members such as ciap and ciap and may be important for the action of xiap in tgf  and bmp signaling and the action of ciap and ciap in tnf receptor signaling
