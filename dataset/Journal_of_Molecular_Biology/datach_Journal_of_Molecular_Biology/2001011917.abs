solution structure of a sweet protein nmr study of mnei a single chain monellin edited by r huber
the sweet protein mnei is a construct of  amino acid residues engineered by linking with a gly phe dipeptide chains b and a of monellin a sweet protein isolated from discoreophyllum cuminsii here the solution structure of mnei was determined on the basis of   nuclear overhauser enhancement derived distance restraints and   dihedral angle restraints obtained from direct measurement of three bond spin coupling constants the identification of hydrogen bonded nh groups was obtained by a combination of h h exchange data and nh resonance temperature coefficients derived from a series of hsqc spectra in the temperature range      k the good resolution of the structure is reflected by the z score of the quality checking program in what if      the topology of mnei like that of natural monellin and of scm another single chain monellin is typical of the cystatin superfamily an  helix cradled into the concave side of a five strand anti parallel  sheet the high resolution   restraints residue  d structure of mnei shows close similarity to the crystal structures of natural monellin and of scm but differs from the solution structure of scm the structures of scm in the crystal and in solution differ in some of the secondary structure elements but most of all in the relative arrangement of the elements the four main  strands that surround the helix in the crystal structure of scm are displaced far from the helix in the solution structure of scm these differences were attributed to the fact that scm is a monomer in solution and a dimer in the crystal this result is at variance with the observation that our solution structure like that of scm corresponds to a monomeric state of the protein as demonstrated by the insensitivity of hsqc spectra to extreme dilution down to   m  on the basis of the solution structure of mnei it is possible to propose that the main glucophores are hosted on loop l  whereas the n terminal and c terminal regions host two other important interaction regions centered around segments    and
