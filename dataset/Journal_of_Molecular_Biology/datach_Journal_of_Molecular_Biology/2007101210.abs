increasing protein conformational stability by optimizing  turn sequence
protein conformational stability is an important concern in many fields here we describe a strategy for significantly increasing conformational stability by optimizing  turn sequence proline and glycine residues are statistically preferred at several  turn positions presumably because their unique side chains contribute favorably to conformational stability in certain  turn positions however   turn sequences often deviate from preferred proline or preferred glycine therefore our strategy involves replacing non proline and non glycine  turn residues with preferred proline or preferred glycine residues here we develop guidelines for selecting appropriate mutations and present results for five mutations s p s g s p t p and q g that significantly increase the conformational stability of rnase sa the increases in stability ranged from   kcal mol to   kcal mol the strategy was successful in overlapping or isolated  turns at buried up to   or completely exposed sites and at relatively flexible or inflexible sites considering the significant number of  turn residues in every globular protein and the frequent deviation of  turn sequences from preferred proline and preferred glycine residues this simple efficient strategy will be useful for increasing the conformational stability of proteins
