c terminal regions of hsp  are important for trapping the nucleotide during the atpase cycle edited by r huber
hsp  is an abundant molecular chaperone that functions in an atp dependent manner in vivo the atp binding site is located in the n terminal domain of hsp  here we dissect the atpase cycle of hsp  kinetically we find that hsp  binds atp with a two step mechanism the rate limiting step of the atpase cycle is the hydrolysis of atp importantly atp becomes trapped and committed to hydrolyze during the cycle in the isolated atp binding domain of hsp  however the bound atp was not committed and the turnover numbers were markedly reduced analysis of a series of truncation mutants of hsp  showed that c terminal regions far apart in sequence from the atp binding domain are essential for trapping the bound atp and for maximum hydrolysis rates our results suggest that atp binding and hydrolysis drive conformational changes that involve the entire molecule and lead to repositioning of the n and c terminal domains of hsp
