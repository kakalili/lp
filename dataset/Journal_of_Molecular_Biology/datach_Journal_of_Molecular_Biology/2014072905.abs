apobec g inhibits hiv  rna elongation by inactivating the viral trans activation response element
deamination of cytidine residues in viral dna is a major mechanism by which apobec g a g inhibits vif deficient human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  replication dc to du transition following rnase h activity leads to viral cdna degradation production of non functional proteins formation of undesired stop codons and decreased viral protein synthesis here we demonstrate that a g provides an additional layer of defense against hiv  infection dependent on inhibition of proviral transcription hiv  transcription elongation is regulated by the trans activation response tar element a short stem  loop rna structure required for elongation factors binding vif deficient hiv  infected cells accumulate short viral transcripts and produce lower amounts of full length hiv  transcripts due to a g deamination of the tar apical loop cytidine highlighting the requirement for tar loop integrity in hiv  transcription we further show that free single stranded dna ssdna termini are not essential for a g activity and a gap of ccc motif blocked with juxtaposed dna or rna on either or      ends is sufficient for a g deamination these results identify a g as an efficient mutator and that deamination of   ssdna results in an early block of hiv  transcription
