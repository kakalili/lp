solution structure of pisum sativum defensin  by high resolution nmr plant defensins identical backbone with different mechanisms of action edited by m f summers
pisum sativum defensin  psd  is a  amino acid residue plant defensin isolated from seeds of pea the three dimensional structure in solution of psd was determined by two dimensional nmr data recorded at   mhz experimental restraints were used for structure calculation using cns and torsion angle molecular dynamics the  lowest energy structures were selected and further subjected to minimization giving a root mean square deviation of         in the backbone and         for over all atoms of the molecule the protein has a globular fold with a triple stranded antiparalell  sheet and an  helix from residue asn  to leu   psd presents the so called  cysteine stabilized    motif  and presents identical three dimensional topology in the backbone with other defensins and neurotoxins comparison of the electrostatic surface potential among proteins with high three dimensional selected using the softwares top and dali topology gave insights into the mode of action of psd  the surface topologies between proteins that present antifungal activity or sodium channel inhibiting activity are different on the other hand the surface topology presents several common features with potassium channel inhibitors suggesting that psd presents this activity other common features with potassium channel inhibitors were found including the presence of a lysine residue essential for inhibitory activity the identity of psd in primary sequence is not enough to infer a mechanism of action in contrast with the strategy proposed here
