rna hairpin invasion and ribosome elongation arrest by mixed base pna oligomer
recently we have shown that peptide nucleic acid pna tridecamers targeted to the codon     and   regions of ha ras mrna arrested translation elongation in vitro our data demonstrated for the first time that pnas with mixed base sequence targeted to the coding region of a messenger rna could arrest the translation machinery and polypeptide chain elongation the peculiarity of the complexes formed with pna tridecamers and ha ras mrna rests upon the stability of pna  mrna hybrids which are not dissociated by cellular proteins or multiple denaturing conditions in the present study we show that shorter pnas such as a dodecamer or an undecamer targeted to the codon  region arrest translation elongation in vitro the     and  mer pnas contain eight and the  mer pna seven contiguous pyrimidine residues upon binding with parallel hoogsteen base pairing to the pna  rna duplex six of the cytosine bases and one thymine base of a second pna can form c g  c and t a  t triplets melting experiments show two well resolved transitions corresponding to the dissociation of the third strand from the core duplex and to melting of duplex at higher temperature the enzymatic structure mapping of a target  mer rna revealed a hairpin structure that is disrupted upon binding of tri  dodeca  undeca and decamer pnas we show that the non bonded nucleobase overhangs on the rna stabilize the pna  rna hybrids and probably assist the pna in overcoming the stable secondary structure of the rna target the great stability of pna  rna duplex and triplex structures allowed us to identify both   and   pna  rna complexes using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry therefore it is possible to successfully target mixed sequences in structured regions of messenger rna with short pna oligonucleotides that form duplex and triplex structures that can arrest elongating ribosomes
