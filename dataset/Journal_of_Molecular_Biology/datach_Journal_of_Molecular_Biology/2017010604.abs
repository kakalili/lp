s  a  regulates ulk localization to er  mitochondria contact sites in ifn  triggered autophagy
during the process of autophagy the autophagy related proteins are translocated to autophagosome formation sites here we demonstrate that s  a  is required for ulk localization to autophagosome formation sites silencing of s  a  reduces ifn  induced autophagosome formation we also determined the role of annexin a  anxa  a binding partner of s  a  which has been reported to promote phagophore assembly silencing of anxa reduced s  a  expression however overexpression of s  a  in anxa silenced cells was still able to enhance autophagosome formation suggesting that anxa regulates ifn  induced autophagy through s  a  we also observed that s  a  interacted with ulk after ifn  stimulation and s  a  knockdown prevented ulk localization to autophagosome formation sites finally the release of high mobility group protein b  one of the functions mediated by ifn  induced autophagy was inhibited in s  a  knockdown cells these results elucidate the importance of s  a  in autophagosome formation and reveal the relationship between s  a  and ulk in ifn  induced autophagy
