the identification of the determinants of the cyclic sequential binding of elongation factors tu and g to the ribosome
experiments dedicated to gaining an understanding of the mechanism underlying the orderly sequential association of elongation factor tu ef tu and elongation factor g ef g with the ribosome during protein synthesis were undertaken the binding of one ef is always followed by the binding of the other despite the two sharing the same  or a largely overlapping  site and despite the two having isosteric structures aminoacyl trna peptidyl trna and deacylated trna were bound in various combinations to the a site p site or e site of ribosomes and their effect on conformation in the peptidyl transferase center the gtpase associated center and the sarcin ricin domain srd was determined in addition the effect of the ribosome complexes on sensitivity to the ribotoxins sarcin and pokeweed antiviral protein and on the binding of ef g  gtp were assessed the results support the following conclusions the ef tu ternary complex binds to the a site whenever it is vacant and the p site has peptidyl trna and association of the ef tu ternary complex is prevented simply by steric hindrance when the a site is occupied by peptidyl trna on the other hand the affinity of the ribosome for ef g  gtp is increased when peptidyl trna is in the a site and the increase is the result of a conformational change in the srd we propose that peptidyl trna in the a site is an effector that initiates a series of changes in tertiary interactions between nucleotides in the peptidyl transferase center the srd and the gtpase associated center of  s rrna and that the signal transmitted through a transduction pathway informs the ribosome of the position of peptidyl trna and leads to a conformational change in the srd that favors binding of ef g
