interaction of the neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase cyt  protein with the group i intron p p domain thermodynamic analysis and the role of metal ions edited by d e draper
the neurospora crassa mitochondrial tyrosyl trna synthetase cyt  protein functions in splicing group i introns by promoting the formation of the catalytically active structure of the intron  s catalytic core previous studies suggested a model in which the protein binds first to the intron  s p p domain and then makes additional contacts with the p p domain to stabilize the two domains in the correct relative orientation to form the intron  s active site here we analyzed the interaction of cyt  with a small rna p p rna corresponding to the isolated p p domain of the n crassa mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal rna intron rna footprinting and modification interference experiments showed that cyt  binds to this small rna around the junction of the p p stacked helices on the side opposite the active site cleft as it does to the p p domain in the intact intron the binding is inhibited by chemical modifications that disrupt base pairing in p  p  and p a indicating that a partially folded structure of the p p domain is required the temperature dependence of binding indicates that the interaction is driven by a favorable enthalpy change but is accompanied by an unfavorable entropy change the latter may reflect entropically unfavorable conformational changes or decreased conformational flexibility in the complex cyt  binding is inhibited at    mm kcl indicating a strong dependence on phosphodiester backbone interactions on the other hand mg  is absolutely required for cyt  binding with titration experiments showing    magnesium ions bound per complex metal ion cleavage experiments identified a divalent cation binding site near the boundary of p and j  a and chemical modification showed that mg  binding induces rna conformational changes in this region as well as elsewhere particularly in j   together these findings suggest a model in which the binding of mg  near j  a and possibly at one additional location in the p p rna induces formation of a specific phosphodiester backbone geometry that is required for cyt  binding the binding of cyt  may then establish the correct structure at the junction of the p p stacked helices for assembly of the p p domain the interaction of cyt  with the p p domain appears similar to the tyrrs interaction with the d anticodon arm stacked helices of trnatyr
