Halorhodopsin (HR) was investigated with atomic force microscopic techniques (AFM) in aqueous solution. Two-dimensional (2D) crystals of HR were obtained by purifying an HR membrane fraction with the same buoyant density as the purple membrane (HR-PM) from the overexpressing strain Halobacterium salinarum D2. The membrane patches of HR were immobilized on mica. Images with a resolution up to 14 Ã… were recorded. Crystals showed an orthogonal structure and the orientation of the molecules showed p4212 symmetry; thus, alternate tetramers are inverted in the membrane. The crystal surface was found to display different structures depending on the imaging force used, indicating that some parts of the HR molecule are more rigid but others more compressible. From samples with single tetramers missing in the crystalline patches dimensions of the unit cell could be determined. Helix-connecting loops in single molecules of halorhodopsin were assigned. The images indicate that the large extracellular BC loop covers the whole molecule and is very flexible.
