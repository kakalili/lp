identification of protein  protein interaction sites from docking energy landscapes
protein recognition is one of the most challenging and intriguing problems in structural biology despite all the available structural sequence and biophysical information about protein  protein complexes the physico chemical patterns if any that make a protein surface likely to be involved in protein  protein interactions remain elusive here we apply protein docking simulations and analysis of the interaction energy landscapes to identify protein  protein interaction sites the new protocol for global docking based on multi start global energy optimization of an all atom model of the ligand with detailed receptor potentials and atomic solvation parameters optimized in a training set of  complexes explores the conformational space around the whole receptor without restrictions the ensembles of the rigid body docking solutions generated by the simulations were subsequently used to project the docking energy landscapes onto the protein surfaces we found that highly populated low energy regions consistently corresponded to actual binding sites the procedure was validated on a test set of  known protein  protein complexes not used in the training set as much as   of the predicted high propensity patch residues were located correctly in the native interfaces this approach can guide the design of mutations on the surfaces of proteins provide geometrical details of a possible interaction and help to annotate protein surfaces in structural proteomics
