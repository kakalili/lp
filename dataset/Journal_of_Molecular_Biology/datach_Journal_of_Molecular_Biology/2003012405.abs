determinants that target the integrase of phage hk  into the mammalian nucleus
the integrase int protein of coliphage hk  catalyzes the site specific integration and excision of the phage into and from its escherichia coli host chromosome int expressed from a plasmid in cos monkey cells is localized in the nucleus as is a fusion protein between int and the green fluorescent protein gfp  mutation analysis of the gfp  int fusion has revealed in int two regions of positively charged amino acid residues that cooperate in the nuclear localization one region harbors residues arg  and arg  the other which spans residues      belongs to the catalytic domain of int is rich in basic residues and is strongly conserved within the int protein family being localized in the nucleus renders int of hk  as a potential recombinase for site specific gene manipulations in mammals
