molecular evolution of the hbii  snorna cluster
hbii  is a human brain specific c d box snorna that potentially regulates the editing and or alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor forty two nearly identical copies of the hbii  gene are located immediately downstream of the snrpn protein coding gene in an imprinted locus associated with prader  willi syndrome other eutherian mammals with genomic assemblies covering the corresponding locus also have multiple orthologous copies of hbii   the snrpb gene which is known to have given rise to snrpn through gene duplication expresses a c d box snorna snord   from its fifth intron here we show that despite the fact that they lie in different positions relative to the orthologous snrpb snrpn coding sequences there are significant sequence similarities between snord  and hbii   including the antisense element and the stem forming regions by analysing these snornas in marsupial and eutherian mammal genomes we reconstruct the likely evolutionary history of the hbii  cluster and snord  and suggest that they have evolved from a common ancestor
