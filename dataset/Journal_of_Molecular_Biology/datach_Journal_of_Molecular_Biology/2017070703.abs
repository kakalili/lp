redirecting sr protein nuclear trafficking through an allosteric platform
although phosphorylation directs serine arginine sr proteins from nuclear storage speckles to the nucleoplasm for splicing function dephosphorylation paradoxically induces similar movement raising the question of how such chemical modifications are balanced in these essential splicing factors in this new study we investigated the interaction of protein phosphatase  pp  with the sr protein splicing factor srsf  to understand the foundation of these opposing effects in the nucleus we found that rna recognition motif  rrm  in srsf binds pp and represses its catalytic function through an allosteric mechanism disruption of rrm  pp interactions reduces the phosphorylation status of the rs domain in vitro and in cells redirecting srsf in the nucleus the data imply that an allosteric sr protein phosphatase platform balances phosphorylation levels in a  goldilocks  region for the proper subnuclear storage of an sr protein splicing factor
