We report the first detailed thermodynamic analysis of simplified proteins by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The experiments were carried out with five simplified BPTI variants, whose structures and activities have been reported, in which several residues not essential for specifying the tertiary structure were replaced by alanine. In most aspects, the thermodynamics of simplified proteins were very similar to, if not essentially identical with, those of natural proteins. In particular, they undergo a highly cooperative two-state thermal unfolding process with a large enthalpy change, which is a thermodynamic hallmark of the native state of natural globular proteins. Furthermore, the specific enthalpy and entropy changes upon unfolding at 110 °C were close to values invariably observed for small natural globular proteins (55 J g−1 and ~16 J K−1 g−1, respectively). On the other hand, two simplified BPTI variants, BPTI-21 and BPTI-22 (containing 21 and 22 alanine residues), were enthalpically stabilized while entropically destabilized with respect to the reference BPTI-[5,55] molecule. This peculiar type of entropy–enthalpy compensation is in sharp contrast to the usual enthalpy destabilization/entropy stabilization observed in mutational studies of natural proteins. Overall, we conclude that a thermodynamic native state can be achieved by proteins encoded with extensively simplified sequences.
