enzyme catalysis via control of activation entropy site directed mutagenesis of   dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase
dimethyl  ribityllumazine synthase lumazine synthase catalyses the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in bacillus subtilis   lumazine synthase subunits form an icosahedral capsid enclosing a homotrimeric riboflavin synthase unit the ribh gene specifying the lumazine synthase subunit can be expressed in high yield all amino acid residues exposed at the surface of the active site cavity were modified by pcr assisted mutagenesis polar amino acid residues in direct contact with the enzyme substrates  amino  ribitylamino   h h pyrimidinedione and   dihydroxy  butanone  phosphate could be replaced with relative impunity with regard to the catalytic properties only the replacement of arg   which forms a salt bridge with the phosphate group of   dihydroxy  butanone  phosphate reduced the catalytic rate by more than one order of magnitude replacement of his  which is believed to assist in proton transfer reactions reduced the catalytic activity by about one order of magnitude surprisingly the activation enthalpy  h  of the lumazine synthase reaction exceeds that of the uncatalysed reaction on the other hand the free energy of activation  g  of the uncatalysed reaction is characterised by a large entropic term t s   of    kjmol   whereas the entropy of activation t s   of the enzyme catalysed reaction is    kjmol   this suggests that the rate enhancement by the enzyme is predominantly achieved by establishing a favourable topological relation of the two substrates whereas acid base catalysis may play a secondary role
