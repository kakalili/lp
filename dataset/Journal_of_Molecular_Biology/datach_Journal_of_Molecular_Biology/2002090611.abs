de novo prediction of three dimensional structures for major protein families
we use the rosetta de novo structure prediction method to produce three dimensional structure models for all pfam a sequence families with average length under   residues and no link to any protein of known structure to estimate the reliability of the predictions the method was calibrated on   proteins of known structure for approximately   of the proteins one of the top five models was correctly predicted for  or more residues and for approximately   the correct scop superfamily was identified in a structure based search of the protein data bank using one of the models this performance is consistent with results from the fourth critical assessment of structure prediction casp  correct and incorrect predictions could be partially distinguished using a confidence function based on a combination of simulation convergence protein length and the similarity of a given structure prediction to known protein structures while the limited accuracy and reliability of the method precludes definitive conclusions the pfam models provide the only tertiary structure information available for the   of publicly available sequences represented by these large protein families
