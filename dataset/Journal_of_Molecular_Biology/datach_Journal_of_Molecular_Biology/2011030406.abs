variation in mutation rates caused by rb pol fidelity mutants can be rationalized on the basis of their kinetic behavior and crystal structures
we have previously observed that stepwise replacement of amino acid residues in the nascent base pair binding pocket of rb  dna polymerase rb pol with ala or gly expanded the space in this pocket resulting in a progressive increase in misincorporation however in vivo results with similar rb pol nascent base pair binding pocket mutants showed that mutation rates as determined by the t phage ri forward assay and rii reversion assay were significantly lower for the rb pol s  g y  a double mutant than for the y  a single mutant the opposite of what we would have predicted to investigate the reasons for this unexpected result we have determined the pre steady state kinetic parameters and crystal structures of relevant ternary complexes we found that the s  g y  a mutant generally had greater base selectivity than the y  a mutant and that the kinetic parameters for dnmp insertion excision of the   terminal nucleotide residue and primer extension beyond a mispair differed not only between these two mutants but also between the two highly mutable sequences in the t ri complementary strand comparison of the crystal structures of these two mutants with correct and incorrect incoming dntps provides insight into the unexpected increase in the fidelity of the s  g y  a double mutant taken together the kinetic and structural results provide a basis for integrating and interpreting in vivo and in vitro observations
