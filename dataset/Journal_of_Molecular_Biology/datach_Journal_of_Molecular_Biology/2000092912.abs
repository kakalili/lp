heterodimeric cd   extracellular domain fragments production purification and structural analysis edited by i wilson
the cd polypeptides     and   are non covalently associated signaling subunits of the t cell receptor which form non disulfide linked   and   heterodimers with the goal of investigating their structure escherichia coli expression was utilized to produce cd ectodomain fragments including the murine cd  subunit n terminal ig like extracellular domain alone or as a single chain construct with that of cd   the latter links the cd  segment to the c terminus of the cd  segment via a  amino acid peptide sccd     although cd  could be produced at high yield when directed to inclusion bodies the refolded monomeric cd  was not native as judged by monoclonal antibody binding using surface plasmon resonance and was largely unstructured by  n h two dimensional nmr analysis in contrast sccd    could be refolded readily into a native state as shown by cd nmr and mab reactivity the linker length between cd  and cd  is critical since sccd    containing a  residue connector failed to generate a stable heterodimer collectively the results demonstrate that  i soluble heterodimeric fragments of cd can be produced  ii cotranslation of cd chains insures proper folding even in the absence of the conserved ectodomain stalk region cxxcxe  and iii cd  has a more stable tertiary protein fold than cd
