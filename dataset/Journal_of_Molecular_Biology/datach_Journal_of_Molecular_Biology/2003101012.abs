structural characterisation of neuronal voltage sensitive k channels heterologously expressed in pichia pastoris
neuronal voltage dependent k channels of the delayed rectifier type consist of multiple kv  subunit variants which assemble as hetero or homotetramers together with four kv  auxiliary subunits direct structural information on these proteins has not been forthcoming due to the difficulty in isolating the native k channels we have overexpressed the subunit genes in the yeast pichia pastoris the kv  subunit expressed alone is shown to fold into a native conformation as determined by high affinity binding of  i labelled  dendrotoxin while co expressed kv  and kv  subunits co assembled to form native like oligomers sites of post translational modifications causing apparent heterogeneity on sds page were identified by site directed mutagenesis engineering to include affinity tags and scale up of production by fermentation allowed routine purification of milligram quantities of homo and heteroligomeric channels single particle electron microscopy of the purified channels was used to generate a d volume to   nm resolution protein domains were assigned by fitting crystal structures of related bacterial proteins addition of exogenous lipid followed by detergent dialysis produced well ordered d crystals that exhibited mostly p  symmetry projection maps of negatively stained crystals show the constituent molecules to be  fold symmetric as expected for the octameric k channel complex
