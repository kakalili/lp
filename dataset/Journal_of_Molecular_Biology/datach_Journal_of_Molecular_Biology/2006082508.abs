structural differences in a  amyloid protofibrils and fibrils mapped by hydrogen exchange   mass spectrometry with on line proteolytic fragmentation
we report here structural differences between a     protofibrils and mature amyloid fibrils associated with alzheimer s disease as determined using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry hx ms coupled with on line proteolysis specifically we have identified regions of the a     peptide containing backbone amide hydrogen atoms that are protected from hx or exposed when this peptide is incorporated into protofibrils or amyloid fibrils formed in phosphate buffered saline without stirring at    c study of protofibrils was facilitated by use of the protofibril stabilizing agent calmidazolium chloride our data clearly show that both the c terminal segment     and the n terminal segment    are highly exposed to hx in both fibrils and protofibrils in contrast the internal fragment     is highly protected from exchange in fibrils but much less so in protofibrils the data suggest that the  sheet elements comprising the amyloid fibril are already present in protofibrils but that they are expanded into some adjacent residues upon the formation of mature amyloid the n terminal  ten residues appear to be unstructured in both protofibrils and fibrils the     segment of a     is more ordered in fibrils than in protofibrils suggesting that if protofibrils are a mechanistic precursor of fibrils the transition from protofibril to fibril involves substantial ordering of this region of the a  peptide
