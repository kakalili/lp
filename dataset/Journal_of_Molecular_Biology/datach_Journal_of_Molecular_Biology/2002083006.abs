one fold with many functions the evolutionary relationships between tim barrel families based on their sequences structures and functions
the eightfold    barrel structure first observed in triose phosphate isomerase occurs ubiquitously in nature it is nearly always an enzyme and most often involved in molecular or energy metabolism within the cell in this review we bring together data on the sequence structure and function of the proteins known to adopt this fold we highlight the sequence and functional diversity in the  homologous superfamilies which include  different sequence families in many structures the barrels are  mixed and matched  with other domains generating additional variety global and local structure based alignments are used to explore the distribution of the associated functional residues on this common structural scaffold many of the substrates co factors include a phosphate moiety which is usually but not always bound towards the c terminal end of the sequence some but not all of these structures exhibit a structurally conserved  phosphate binding motif   in contrast metal ligating residues and catalytic residues are distributed along the sequence however we also found striking structural superposition of some of these residues lastly we consider the possible evolutionary relationships between these proteins whose sequences are so diverse that even the most powerful approaches find few relationships yet whose active sites all cluster at one end of the barrel this extreme example of the  one fold many functions  paradigm illustrates the difficulty of assigning function through a structural genomics approach for some folds
