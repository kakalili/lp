atp binding and hydrolysis by mcm regulate dna binding by mcm complexes
the essential minichromosome maintenance mcm proteins mcm through mcm likely comprise the replicative helicase in eukaryotes in addition to mcm    other subcomplexes including one comprising mcm  mcm  and mcm  unwind dna using mcm   as a tool we reveal a role for nucleotide binding by saccharomyces cerevisiae mcm in modulating dna binding by mcm complexes previous studies have shown that mcm inhibits dna unwinding by mcm    here we show that interaction of mcm and mcm   is not sufficient for inhibition rather mcm requires nucleotides for its regulatory role an mcm mutant that is defective for atp hydrolysis k  a  as well as atp analogues was used to show that adp binding by mcm is required to inhibit dna binding and unwinding by mcm    this mcm mediated regulation of mcm   is independent of mcm   furthermore the importance of atp hydrolysis by mcm to the regulation of the native complex was apparent from the altered dna binding properties of mcm ka   moreover together with the finding that mcm k  a does not support yeast viability these results indicate that the nucleotide bound state of mcm is critical in regulating the activities of mcm   and mcm   complexes
