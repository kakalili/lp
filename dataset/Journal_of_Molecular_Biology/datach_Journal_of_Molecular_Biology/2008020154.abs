structural basis for the interaction between focal adhesion kinase and cd
focal adhesion kinase fak and cd fulfil vital functions in cellular signal transduction fak is a central component in integrin signalling whereas cd plays essential roles in the immune defence in t lymphocytes fak and cd localise to the same signalling complexes after stimulation by either the human immunodeficiency virus hiv gp  glycoprotein or an antigen suggesting the concerted action of fak and cd in these cells using crystallography and microcalorimetry we here show that the focal adhesion targeting fat domain of fak binds specifically to the cd endocytosis motif in vitro this fat  cd complex is structurally and thermodynamically similar to the one fat forms with paxillin ld motifs the cd binding site on fat presents the same features as the established cd binding site on the hiv  nef protein the binding of fat to cd is incompatible with the binding of lck to cd  we further show that hiv  gp  triggers the association of cd with fak in t cells under conditions that are known to dissociate lck from cd  our results suggest that the fak  cd complex represents an alternative route for eliciting t cell specific signals and that it links gp  engagement to distinctive t cell signalling during hiv infection in infected cells hiv  nef may displace fak from cd to protect the cells from apoptosis
