comparative analyses of complex formation and binding sites between human tumor necrosis factor alpha and its three antagonists elucidate their different neutralizing mechanisms
tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf  blocking therapy using biologic tnf  antagonists has been approved for the treatment of several diseases including rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and crohn s disease there have been few detailed studies of binding characterizations for the complex formation by tnf  and clinically relevant antagonists particularly infliximab remicade  and etanercept enbrel   here we characterized the binding stoichiometry and size of soluble tnf   antagonist complexes and identified energetically important binding sites on tnf  for the three antagonists etanercept infliximab and the recently developed humanized tnf  neutralizing monoclonal antibody yhb    size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering analyses revealed that the three antagonists formed distinct thermodynamically stable tnf   antagonist complexes that exhibited differences in their size and composition energetically important binding residues on tnf  were identified for each antagonist by a sequence of experiments that consisted of competition binding assays fragmentations loop mutations and single point mutations using yeast surface displayed tnf  which was further confirmed for solubly purified tnf  mutants by surface plasmon resonance technique analyses of the binding geometry based on binding site location spatial constraints and valency satisfaction allowed us to interpret the thermodynamically stable complexes as follows one molecule of etanercept and one molecule of trimeric tnf  etanercept    tnf   infliximab  tnf   and yhb     tnf   the distinct features of the soluble antagonist  tnf  complex formation among the antagonists may give further insights into their different neutralizing mechanisms and pharmacokinetic profiles
