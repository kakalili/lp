core and heterogeneity of   microglobulin amyloid fibrils as revealed by h d exchange
dialysis related amyloidosis which occurs in the patients receiving a long term hemodialysis with high frequency accompanies the deposition of amyloid fibrils composed of   microglobulin   m  in vitro   m forms two kinds of fibrous structures at acidic ph one is a rigid  mature fibril   and the other is a flexible thin filament often called an  immature fibril   in addition a  residue peptide k peptide corresponding to ser  to lys  of intact   m forms rigid amyloid like fibrils similar to mature fibrils we compared the core of these three fibrils at single residue resolution using a recently developed hydrogen deuterium h d exchange method with the dissolution of fibrils by dimethylsulfoxide dmso  the exchange time course of these fibrils showed large deviations from a single exponential curve showing that because of the supramolecular structures the same residue exists in different environments from molecule to molecule even in a single fibril the exchange profiles revealed that the core of the immature fibril is restricted to a narrow region compared to that of the mature fibril in contrast all residues were protected from exchange in the k fibril indicating that a whole region of the peptide is engaged in the  sheet network these results suggest the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation in which the core  sheet formed by a minimal sequence propagates to form a rigid and extensive  sheet network
