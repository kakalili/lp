determination of the interface of a large protein complex by transferred cross saturation measurements
in an earlier paper it was shown that the cross saturation method enables us to identify the contact residues of large protein complexes in a more rigorous manner than is possible using chemical shift perturbation and hydrogen  deuterium exchange experiments however there are limitations within the determination of the contact residues by the cross saturation method in that the method is difficult to apply to protein complexes with a molecular mass over  kda and or with weak binding since the resonances originating from the complexes should be observed directly in the method in the present work to overcome these limitations we carried out the cross saturation measurements under conditions of a fast exchange between free and bound states on the nmr time scale and determined the contact residues of the complex of the b domain of protein a and intact igg which has a molecular mass of  kda and shows weak binding
