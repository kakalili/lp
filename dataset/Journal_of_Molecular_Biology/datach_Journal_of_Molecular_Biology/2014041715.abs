immunoglobulin g fc domain motions implications for fc engineering
the fragment crystallizable fc region links the key pathogen identification and destruction properties of immunoglobulin g igg  pathogen opsonization positions fcs to activate pro inflammatory fc  receptors fc rs on immune cells the cellular response and committal to a damaging though protective immune response are tightly controlled at multiple levels control mechanisms are diverse and in many cases unclear but one frequently suggested contribution originates in fc r affinity being modulated through shifts in fc conformational sampling here we report a previously unseen igg fc conformation this observation motivated an extensive molecular dynamics investigation of polypeptide and glycan motions that revealed greater amplitude of motion for the n terminal c  domains and n glycan than previously observed residues in the c  c  interface and disulfide bonded hinge were identified as influencing the c  motion our results are consistent with a model of fc that is structurally dynamic conformational states that are competent to bind immune stimulating fc rs interconverted with fc conformations distinct from those observed in fc r complexes which may represent a transient nonbinding population
