in silico structural and functional analysis of the human cytomegalovirus hhv  genome edited by f cohen
the open reading frames of human cytomegalovirus human herpesvirus  hhv  encode some   unique proteins with mostly unknown functions using the threading program proceryon we calculated possible matches between the amino acid sequences of these proteins and the protein data bank library of three dimensional structures thirty six proteins were fully identified in terms of their structure and often function   proteins were recognized as members of narrow structural functional families e g dna binding factors cytokines enzymes signaling particles cell surface receptors etc  and  proteins were assigned to broad structural classes e g all    layer     multidomain etc  genes encoding proteins with similar folds or containing identical structural traits extreme sequence length runs of unstructured pro and or gly rich residues transmembrane segments etc  often formed tandem clusters throughout the genome in the course of this work benchmarks on about  known folds were used to optimize adjustable parameters of threading calculations i e gap penalty weights used in sequence structure alignments new scores obtained as simple combinations of existing scoring functions and number of threading runs conducive to meaningful results an introduction of summed per residue normalized scores has been essential for discovery of subdomains egf like sh  sh  in longer protein sequences such as the eight  open sandwich  cytokine domains     amino acids long and having the    fold with one or two disulfide bridges present in otherwise unrelated proteins
