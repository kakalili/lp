dynactin d structure implications for assembly and dynein binding
the multisubunit protein complex dynactin is an essential component of the cytoplasmic dynein motor high resolution structural work on dynactin and the dynein dynactin supercomplex has been limited to small subunits and recombinant fragments that do not report fully on either   mda assembly in the present study we used negative stain electron microscopy and image analysis based on random conical tilt reconstruction to obtain a three dimensional  d structure of native vertebrate dynactin the  nm long dynactin molecule has a v shaped shoulder at one end and a flattened tip at the other end both offset relative to the long axis of the actin related protein arp backbone the shoulder projects dramatically away from the arp filament core in a way that cannot be appreciated in two dimensional images which has implications for the mechanism of dynein binding the d structure allows the helical parameters of the entire arp filament core which includes the actin capping protein cp to be determined for the first time this structure exhibits near identity to f actin and can be well fitted into the dynactin envelope molecular fitting of modeled cp arp polymers into the envelope shows that the filament contains between  and  arp protomers and is capped at both ends in the  arp model which agrees best with measured arp stoichiometry and other structural information actin capping protein cp is not present at the distal tip of the structure unlike what is seen in the other models the d structure suggests a mechanism for dynactin assembly and length specification
