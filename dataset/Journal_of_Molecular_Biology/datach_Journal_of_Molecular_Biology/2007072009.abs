structural insight into a molecular switch in tandem winged helix motifs from elongation factor selb
elongation factor selb is responsible for co translational incorporation of selenocysteine sec into proteins the uga stop codon is recoded as a sec codon in the presence of a downstream mrna hairpin in prokaryotes in addition to the ef tu like n terminal domains a c terminal extension containing four tandem winged helix motifs wh   recognizes the mrna hairpin the     resolution crystal structure of the escherichia coli wh  domains bound to mrna with mutagenesis data reveal that the two wh motifs use the same structural elements to bind rna the structure together with the     resolution structure of the wh  domains from moorella thermoacetica bound to rna revealed that a salt bridge connecting wh to wh modules is disrupted upon mrna binding the results provide a structural basis for the molecular switch that may allow communication between trna and mrna binding sites and illustrate how rna acts as an activator of the switch the structures show that tandem wh motifs not only provide an excellent scaffold for rna binding but can also have an active role in the function of protein  rna complexes
