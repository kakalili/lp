the pre derived nmr model of the   kda tri domain isdh protein from staphylococcus aureus suggests that it adaptively recognizes human hemoglobin
staphylococcus aureus is a medically important bacterial pathogen that during infections acquires iron from human hemoglobin hb  it uses two closely related iron regulated surface determinant isd proteins to capture and extract the oxidized form of heme hemin from hb isdh and isdb both receptors rapidly extract hemin using a conserved tri domain unit consisting of two neat near iron transporter domains connected by a helical linker domain to gain insight into the mechanism of extraction we used nmr to investigate the structure and dynamics of the   kda tri domain isdh protein isdhn n  a   d  with a y  a mutation that prevents hemin binding  the structure was modeled using long range paramagnetic relaxation enhancement pre distance restraints dihedral angle small angle x ray scattering residual dipolar coupling and inter domain noe nuclear overhauser effect data the receptor adopts an extended conformation wherein the linker and n domains pack against each other via a hydrophobic interface in contrast the n domain contacts the linker domain via a hydrophilic interface and based on nmr relaxation data undergoes inter domain motions enabling it to reorient with respect to the body of the protein ensemble calculations were used to estimate the range of n domain positions compatible with the pre data a comparison of the hb free and hb bound forms reveals that hb binding alters the positioning of the n domain we propose that binding occurs through a combination of conformational selection and induced fit mechanisms that may promote hemin release from hb by altering the position of its f helix
