structural fine tuning of mit interacting motif  mim  and allosteric regulation of escrt iii by vps in yeast
the endosomal sorting complex required for transport escrt facilitates roles in membrane remodeling such as multivesicular body biogenesis enveloped virus budding and cell division in yeast vps plays a crucial role in intraluminal vesicle formation by disassembling escrt proteins vps is recruited by escrt iii proteins to the endosomal membrane through the interaction between the microtubule interacting and trafficking mit domain of vps and the c terminal mit interacting motif mim of escrt iii proteins here we have determined the crystal structure of vps  mit in a complex with vps  a member of escrt iii and revealed that vps  adopts a unique mim conformation based on structural comparisons with other known mim s we have refined the consensus sequence of mim  we have shown that another escrt iii protein ist  binds to vps  mit via its c terminal mim with higher affinity than vps  but lacks mim by surface plasmon resonance surprisingly the ist mim competed with the mim of vfa  a regulator of vps  for binding to vps  mit even though these mims bind in non overlapping sites on the mit these findings provide insight into the allosteric recognition of mims of escrt iii by vps and also the regulation of escrt machinery at the last step of membrane remodeling
