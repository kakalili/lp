roles of the minor capsid protein p in the assembly and replication of double stranded rna bacteriophage
the polymerase complexes of double stranded rna dsrna viruses are multifunctional rna processing machineries that carry out viral genome packaging replication and transcription the polymerase complex forms the innermost virion shell and is structurally related in dsrna viruses infecting a diversity of host organisms in this study we analyzed the properties and functions of the minor polymerase complex protein p of dsrna bacteriophage   using terminally truncated p polypeptides and an in vitro self assembly system established for the   polymerase complex the n terminally truncated p failed to dimerize whereas c terminally truncated p polypeptides formed functional dimers that were incorporated into the polymerase complex nevertheless the polymerase complex assembly kinetics and stability were altered by the incorporation of the c terminally truncated p  using the in vitro assembly system for   nucleocapsids and subsequent infectivity assays we confirmed that full length p is necessary for the formation of infectious viral particles contrary to previous results we found that p must be incorporated into polymerase complexes during shell assembly
