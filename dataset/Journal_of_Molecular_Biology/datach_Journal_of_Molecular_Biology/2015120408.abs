solution nmr studies of an alternative mode of sin engagement by the sds subunit in the histone deacetylase associated sin l rpd l corepressor complex
the sds transcriptional corepressor facilitates the assembly of the  to  mda histone deacetylase associated sin l rpd l complex by providing a crucial homodimerization activity sds engages the scaffolding protein sin a via a bipartite motif within the sin interaction domain sid comprising a helix and an extended segment here we show that the sid samples two discrete substantially populated conformations with lifetimes in the tens of milliseconds range the two conformations differ via a translation of the main chain and the corresponding side chains in the  to   range given the close proximity of the sid to other functional motifs in sds at the sequence level the conformational exchange has the potential to regulate these activities
