surrobodies with functional tails
surrobodies the surrobody and surrobodies marks are trademarks of sea lane biotechnologies llc are a unique type of binding protein based on the pre b cell receptor pre bcr  the pre bcr is transiently expressed during development of the antibody repertoire unlike heterotetrameric canonical antibodies that are composed of identical pairs of heavy and light chains the pre bcr is a heterohexameric complex composed of identical pairs of heavy chains that are each paired with a two subunit surrogate light chain slc  the slc contains nonimmunoglobulin like peptide extensions on each of the two slc components this arrangement provides unique opportunities for protein engineering by functional derivatization of these nonimmunoglobulin like tails here we report recombinant fusions to these tails with either a fully active cytokine or with single chain variable fragment scfv domains to generate surrobodies with unique functions or surrobodies that are bispecific with respect to targeted binding
