structural insights into the second step of rna dependent cysteine biosynthesis in archaea crystal structure of sep trna cys trna synthase from archaeoglobus fulgidus
in the ancient organisms methanogenic archaea lacking the canonical cysteinyl trna synthetase cys trnacys is produced by an indirect pathway in which o phosphoseryl trna synthetase ligates o phosphoserine sep to trnacys and sep trna cys trna synthase sepcyss converts sep trnacys to cys trnacys in this study the crystal structure of sepcyss from archaeoglobus fulgidus has been determined at     resolution sepcyss forms a dimer composed of monomers bearing large and small domains the large domain harbors the seven stranded  sheet which is typical of the pyridoxal   phosphate plp dependent enzymes in the active site which is located near the dimer interface plp is covalently bound to the side chain of the conserved lys   in the proximity of plp a sulfate ion is bound by the side chains of the conserved arg  his   and tyr  residues the active site is located deep within the large basic cleft to accommodate sep trnacys on the basis of the surface electrostatic potential the amino acid residue conservation mapping the position of the bound sulfate ion and the substrate amino acid binding manner in other plp dependent enzymes a binding model of sep trnacys to sepcyss was constructed one of the three strictly conserved cys residues cys  cys  or cys   of one subunit may play a crucial role in the catalysis in the active site of the other subunit
