substitution f  s converts uapa a specific uric acid xanthine transporter into a broad specificity transporter for purine related solutes edited by m yaniv
uapa a highly specific uric acid xanthine transporter in aspergillus nidulans is a member of a large family of nucleobase ascorbate transporters conserved in all domains of life we have investigated structure function relationships in uapa by studying chimeric transporters and missense mutations and showed that specific polar or charged amino acid residues e   e   q   n   t   on either side of an amphipathic  helical transmembrane segment tms  are critical for purine binding and transport here the mutant q  e having no uric acid xanthine transport activity at   c was used to isolate second site revertants that restore function seven of them were found to have acquired the capacity to transport novel substrates hypoxanthine and adenine in addition to uric acid and xanthine all seven revertants were found to carry the mutation f  s within the last transmembrane segment tms  of uapa further kinetic analysis of a selected suppressor showed that uapa q  e f  s transports with high affinity km values of    m xanthine hypoxanthine and uracil uptake competition experiments suggested that uapa q  e f  s also binds guanine  thioguanine adenosine or ascorbic acid a strain carrying mutation f  s by itself conserves high capacity high affinity km values of     m  transport activity for purine uracil transport compared to uapa q  e f  s uapa f  s has a distinct capacity to bind several nucleobase related compounds and different kinetic parameters of transport these results show that molecular determinants external to the central functional domain l tms  l  are critical for the uptake specificity and transport kinetics of uapa
