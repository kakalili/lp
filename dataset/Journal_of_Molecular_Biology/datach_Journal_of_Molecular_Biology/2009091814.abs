amino acid architecture that influences dntp insertion efficiency in y family dna polymerase v of e coli
y family dna polymerases dnaps are often required in cells to synthesize past dna containing lesions such as  ta b a p n dg which is the major adduct of the potent mutagen carcinogen benzo a pyrene the current model for the non mutagenic pathway in escherichia coli involves dnap iv inserting deoxycytidine triphosphate opposite  ta b a p n dg and dnap v doing the next step s  extension we are investigating what structural differences in these related y family dnaps dictate their functional differences x ray structures of y family dnaps reveal a number of interesting features in the vicinity of the active site including   the  roof amino acid   roof aa  which is the amino acid that lies above the nucleobase of the deoxynucleotide triphosphate dntp and is expected to play a role in dntp insertion efficiency and   a cluster of three amino acids including the roof aa which anchors the base of a loop whose detailed structure dictates several important mechanistic functions since no x ray structures existed for umuc the polymerase subunit of dnap v or dnap iv we previously built molecular models herein we test the accuracy of our umuc v model by investigating how amino acid replacement mutants affect lesion bypass efficiency a ssm  vector containing a single  ta b a p n dg is transformed into e coli carrying mutations at i  which is the roof aa in our umuc v model and output progeny vector yield is monitored as a measure of the relative efficiency of the non mutagenic pathway findings show that   the roof aa is almost certainly i  whose  carbon branching r group is key for optimal activity and   i  a  v  form a hydrophobic cluster that anchors an important mechanistic loop aa     in addition bypass efficiency is significantly lower both for the i a mutation of the roof aa and for the adjacent a t mutation however the i a a t double mutant is almost as active as wild type umuc v  which probably reflects the following y family dnaps fall into several classes with respect to the roof aa next amino acid  one class has isoleucine alanine and includes umuc v and dnap   from many species  while the second class has alanine or serine threonine and includes dnap iv dnap   from many species  and dpo  thus the high activity of the i a a t double mutant probably arises because umuc v was converted from the v  class to the iv  class with respect to the roof aa next amino acid  structural and mechanistic aspects of these two classes of y family dnaps are discussed
