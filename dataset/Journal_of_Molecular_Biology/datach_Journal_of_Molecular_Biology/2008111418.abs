ca  induced tropomyosin movement in scallop striated muscle thin filaments
striated muscle contraction in most animals is regulated at least in part by the troponin  tropomyosin tn tm switch on the thin actin containing filaments the only group that has been suggested to lack actin linked regulation is the mollusks where contraction is regulated through the myosin heads on the thick filaments however molluscan gene sequence data suggest the presence of troponin tn components consistent with actin linked regulation and some biochemical and immunological data also support this idea the presence of actin linked in addition to myosin linked regulation in mollusks would simplify our general picture of muscle regulation by extending actin linked regulation to this phylum as well we have investigated this question structurally by determining the effect of ca  on the position of tm in native thin filaments from scallop striated adductor muscle three dimensional reconstructions of negatively stained filaments were determined by electron microscopy and single particle image analysis at low ca  tm appeared to occupy the  blocking  position on the outer domain of actin identified in earlier studies of regulated thin filaments in the low ca  state in this position tm would sterically block myosin binding switching off filament activity at high ca  tm appeared to move toward a position on the inner domain similar to that induced by ca  in regulated thin filaments this ca  induced movement of tm is consistent with the hypothesis that scallop thin filaments are ca  regulated
