structural analysis of arabidopsis cnfu protein an iron  sulfur cluster biosynthetic scaffold in chloroplasts
cnfu a key iron  sulfur fe  s cluster biosynthetic scaffold that is required for biogenesis of ferredoxin and photosystem i in chloroplasts consists of two tandemly repeated domains in which only the n terminal domain contains a conserved cxxc motif we have determined the crystal structure of the metal free dimer of atcnfu v from arabidopsis thaliana at     resolution the n terminal domains of the two monomers are linked together through two intermolecular disulfide bonds between the cxxc motifs at the dimer interface a total of four cysteine sulfur atoms provide a fe  s cluster assembly site surrounded by uncharged but hydrophilic structurally mobile segments the c terminal domain of one monomer interacts with the n terminal domain of the opposing monomer and thereby stabilizes dimer formation furthermore fe k edge x ray absorption spectroscopic analysis of the holo cnfu dimer in solution suggests the presence of a typical  fe  s type cluster coordinated by four thiolate ligands based on these data a plausible model of the holo atcnfu v dimer containing a surface exposed  fe  s cluster assembled in the dimer interface was deduced we propose that such a structural framework is important for cnfu to function as a fe  s cluster biosynthetic scaffold
