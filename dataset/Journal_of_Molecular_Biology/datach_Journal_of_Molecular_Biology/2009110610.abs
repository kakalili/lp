defining the determinants for dual targeting of amino acyl trna synthetases to mitochondria and chloroplasts
most of the organellar amino acyl trna synthetases aarss are dually targeted to both mitochondria and chloroplasts using dual targeting peptides dtps  we have investigated the targeting properties and domain structure of dtps of seven aarss by studying the in vitro and in vivo import of n terminal deleted constructs of dtps fused to green fluorescent protein the deletion constructs were designed based on prediction programs targetp and predotar as well as logoplots derived from organellar proteomes in arabidopsis thaliana in vitro import was performed either into a single isolated organelle or as dual import i e  into a mixture of isolated mitochondria and chloroplasts followed by reisolation of the organelles  in vivo import was investigated as transient expression of the green fluorescent protein constructs in nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts characterization of recognition determinants showed that the n terminal portions of tyrrs  valrs and thrrs dtps     and  amino acids respectively are required for targeting into both mitochondria and chloroplasts surprisingly these n terminal portions contain no or very few arginines or lysines but very high number of hydroxylated residues       for two aarss a domain structure of the dtp became evident removal of  residues from the dtp of prors abolished chloroplastic import indicating that the n terminal region was required for chloroplast targeting whereas deletion of  n terminal amino acids from asprs dtp inhibited the mitochondrial import showing that in this case the n terminal portion was required for the mitochondrial import finally deletion of n terminal regions of dtps for ilers and lysrs did not affect dual targeting in summary it can be concluded that there is no general rule for how the determinants for dual targeting are distributed within dtps in most cases the n terminal portion is essential for import into both organelles but in a few cases a domain structure was observed
