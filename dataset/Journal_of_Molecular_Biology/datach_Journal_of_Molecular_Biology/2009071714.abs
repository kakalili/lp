crystal structure of the human rad  hus  rad clamp
three evolutionarily conserved proteins rad  hus  and rad  form a heterotrimeric      complex that plays critical roles in cellular responses to dna damage by activating checkpoints and by recruiting dna repair enzymes to dna lesions we have determined the crystal structure of the human rad  residues      hus  rad complex at     resolution the         complex forms a closed ring with each subunit having a similar structure despite its high level of similarity to proliferating cell nucleus antigen in terms of overall structure the         complex exhibits notable differences in local structures including interdomain connecting loops h and h helices and loops in the vicinity of the helices of each subunit these local structural variations provide several unique features to the      heterotrimeric complex  including structures of intermolecular interfaces and the inner surface around the central hole and different electrostatic potentials at and near the interdomain connecting loops of each      subunit  compared to the proliferating cell nucleus antigen trimer we propose that these structural features allow the      complex to bind to a damaged dna during checkpoint control and to serve as a platform for base excision repair we also show that the         complex but not the full length      complex forms a stable complex with the   recessed dna suggesting that the c terminal tail of rad is involved in the regulation of the      complex in dna binding
