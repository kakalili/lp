the structure of arabidopsis thaliana ost provides insights into the kinase regulation mechanism in response to osmotic stress
snrk snf  sucrose non fermenting  related protein kinase    open stomata  ost  is well characterized at molecular and physiological levels to control stomata closure in response to water deficit stress ost is a member of a family of  protein kinases from arabidopsis thaliana snrk  that integrates abscisic acid aba dependent and aba independent signals to coordinate the cell response to osmotic stress a subgroup of protein phosphatases type c binds ost and keeps the kinase dephosphorylated and inactive activation of ost relies on the aba dependent inhibition of the protein phosphatases type c and the subsequent self phosphorylation of the kinase the ost aba independent activation depends on a short sequence motif that is conserved among all the members of the snrk family however little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation the crystallographic structure of ost shows that aba independent regulation motif stabilizes the conformation of the kinase catalytically essential  c helix and it provides the basis of the aba independent regulation mechanism for the snrk family of protein kinases
