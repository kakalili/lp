nucleobindin  caps human islet amyloid polypeptide protofibrils to prevent amyloid fibril formation
many human diseases are associated with amyloid fibril deposition including type  diabetes mellitus where human islet amyloid polypeptide hiapp forms fibrils in the pancreas we report here that engineered soluble forms of the human ca  binding protein nucleobindin  nucb  prevent hiapp fibril formation and disaggregate preexisting hiapp fibrils scanning transmission electron microscopy stem and atomic force microscopy indicate that nucb binds to and stabilizes heterogeneous prefibrillar hiapp species the nucb stabilized prefibrillar species were isolated by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed by stem dynamic light scattering and multi angle light scattering the stabilized prefibrillar species show a size range of    million da and have other similarities to hiapp protofibrils but they do not progress to become mature fibrils the effects of nucb are absent in the presence of ca  we postulate that the engineered forms of nucb prevent hiapp fibril formation by a mechanism where protofibril like species are  capped  to prevent further fibril assembly and maturation this mode of action appears to be different from other protein based inhibitors suggesting that nucb may offer a new approach to inhibiting amyloid formation and disaggregating amyloid fibrils
