programmed ribosomal frameshifting mediates expression of the  carboxysome
many bacteria employ a protein organelle the carboxysome to catalyze carbon dioxide fixation in the calvin cycle only  genes from halothiobacillus neapolitanus are sufficient for heterologous expression of carboxysomes in escherichia coli opening the door to detailed mechanistic analysis of the assembly process of this complex more than  mda  one of these genes csos  has been implicated in assembly but ascribing a molecular function is confounded by the observation that the single csos gene yields expression of two gene products and both display an apparent molecular weight incongruent with the predicted amino acid sequence here we elucidate the co translational mechanism responsible for the expression of the two protein isoforms specifically csos was found to possess   frameshifting elements that lead to the production of the full length protein csos b and a truncated protein csos a which possesses a c terminus translated from the alternate frame the frameshifting elements comprise both a ribosomal slippery sequence and a   secondary structure and ablation of either sequence is sufficient to eliminate the slip using these mutants we investigated the individual roles of csos b and csos a on carboxysome formation in this in vivo formation assay cells expressing only the csos b isoform were capable of producing intact carboxysomes while those with only csos a were not thus we have answered a long standing question about the nature of csos in this model microcompartment and demonstrate that csos b is functionally distinct from csos a in the assembly of  carboxysomes
