deciphering communicating and engineering the crispr pam
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr loci and their flanking crispr associated cas genes make up rna guided adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes whose effector proteins have become powerful tools for basic research and biotechnology while the cas effector proteins are remarkably diverse they commonly rely on protospacer adjacent motifs pams as the first step in target recognition pam sequences are known to vary considerably between systems and have proven to be difficult to predict spurring the need for new tools to rapidly identify and communicate these sequences recent advances have also shown that cas proteins can be engineered to alter pam recognition opening new opportunities to develop crispr based tools with enhanced targeting capabilities in this review we discuss the properties of the crispr pam and the emerging tools for determining visualizing and engineering pam recognition we also propose a standard means of orienting the pam to simplify how its location and sequence are communicated
