nmr solution structure and dynamics of the peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerase domain of the trigger factor from mycoplasma genitalium compared to fk  binding protein
we have solved the solution structure of the peptidyl prolyl cis  trans isomerase ppiase domain of the trigger factor from mycoplasma genitalium by homo and heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy our results lead to a well defined structure with a backbone rmsd of     as predicted the ppiase domain of the trigger factor adopts the fk  binding protein fkbp fold furthermore our nmr relaxation data indicate that the dynamic behavior of the trigger factor ppiase domain and of fkbp are similar structural variations when compared to fkbp exist in the flap region and within the bulges of strand  of the  sheet although the active site crevice is similar to that of fkbp subtle steric variations in this region can explain why fk  does not bind to the trigger factor sequence variability   identity between trigger factor and fkbp results in significant differences in surface charge distribution and the absence of the first strand of the central  sheet our data indicate however that this strand may be partially structured as  nascent    strand this makes the trigger factor ppiase domain the most minimal representative of the fkbp like protein family of ppiases
