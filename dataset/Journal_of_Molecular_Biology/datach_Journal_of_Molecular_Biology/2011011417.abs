analysis of disease linked rhodopsin mutations based on structure function and protein stability calculations
retinitis pigmentosa rp refers to a heterogeneous group of inherited diseases that result in progressive retinal degeneration characterized by visual field constriction and night blindness a total of   mutations in rhodopsin are linked to rp to date and the phenotypes range from severe to asymptomatic to study the relation between phenotype and rhodopsin stability in disease mutants we used a structure based approach for  of the mutants located at the protein  lipid interphase we used the von heijne water  membrane transfer scale and we find that  of the mutations could affect membrane insertion for  mutants we used the protein design algorithm foldx the  asymptomatic mutations had no significant reduced stability  were unsuitable for foldx analysis since the structure was incorrect in this region   mutations had a significant change in protein stability  gt   kcal mol  and  mutations had energy change values under the prediction error threshold  lt   kcal mol  out of these   the disease causing effect could be explained by the involvement in other functions e g  glycosylation motifs the interface with arrestin and transducin and the cilia binding motif for  mutants the remaining  mutants were probably incorrectly associated with rp or have functionalities not discovered yet for destabilizing mutations where clinical data were available we found a highly significant correlation between foldx energy changes and the average age of night blindness and between foldx energy changes and daytime vision loss onset our detailed structural functional and energetic analysis provides a complete picture of the rhodopsin mutations and can guide mutation specific therapies
