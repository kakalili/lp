hydrophobic surface patches on lola of pseudomonas aeruginosa are essential for lipoprotein binding
many lipoproteins reside in the outer membrane om of gram negative bacteria and their biogenesis is dependent on the lol localization of lipoproteins system the periplasmic chaperone lola accepts om destined lipoproteins that are released from the inner membrane by the lolcde complex and transfers them to the om receptor lolb the exact nature of the lola  lipoprotein complex is still unknown the crystal structure of escherichia coli lola features an open  barrel covered by  helices that together constitute a hydrophobic cavity which would allow the binding of one acyl chain however om lipoproteins contain three acyl chains and the stoichiometry of the lola  lipoprotein complex is   here we present the crystal structure of pseudomonas aeruginosa lola that projects clear hydrophobic surface patches since these patches are large enough to accommodate acyl chains their role in lipoprotein binding was investigated several lola mutant proteins were created and their functionality was assessed by studying their capacity to release lipoproteins produced in sphaeroplasts interruption of the largest hydrophobic patch completely destroyed the lipoprotein releasing capacity of lola while interruption of smaller patches apparently reduced efficiency thus the results show a new lipoprotein transport model that places some of the acyl chains on the hydrophobic surface patches
