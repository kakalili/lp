changes in nucleoporin domain topology in response to chemical effectors
nucleoporins represent the molecular building blocks of nuclear pore complexes npcs  which mediate facilitated macromolecular trafficking between the cytoplasm and nucleus of eukaryotic cells phenylalanine glycine fg repeat motifs are found in about one third of the nucleoporins and they provide major binding or docking sites for soluble transport receptors we have shown recently that localization of the fg repeat domains of vertebrate nucleoporins nup  and nup  within the npc is influenced by its transport state to test whether chemical effectors such as calcium and atp influence the localization of the fg repeat domains of nup  and nup  within the npc we performed immuno electron microscopy of xenopus oocyte nuclei using domain specific antibodies against nup  and nup   respectively ca  and atp are known to induce conformational changes in the npc architecture especially at the cytoplasmic face but also at the nuclear basket of the npc we have found concentrations of calcium in the micromolar range or  mm atp in the surrounding buffer leaves the spatial distribution of the fg repeat of nup  and nup  largely unchanged in contrast atp depletion calcium store depletion by egta or thapsigargin and high concentrations of divalent cation i e   mm ca  and  mm mg  constrain the distribution of the fg repeats of nup  and nup   our data suggest that the location of the fg repeat domains of nup  and nup  is sensitive to chemical changes within the near field environment of the npc
