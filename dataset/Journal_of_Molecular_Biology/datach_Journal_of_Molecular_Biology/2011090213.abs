nonlinear viscoelasticity of actin transiently cross linked with mutant  actinin
filamentous actin and associated actin binding proteins play an essential role in governing the mechanical properties of eukaryotic cells they can also play a critical role in disease for example mutations in  actinin  actn  a dynamic actin cross linking protein cause proteinuric disease in humans and mice amino acid substitutions strongly affect the binding affinity and protein structure of actn  to study the physical impact of such substitutions on the underlying cytoskeletal network we examine the bulk mechanical behavior of in vitro actin networks cross linked with wild type and mutant actn  these networks exhibit a complex viscoelastic response and are characterized by fluid like behavior at the longest timescales a feature that can be quantitatively accounted for through a model governed by dynamic cross linking the elastic behavior of the network is highly nonlinear becoming much stiffer with applied stress this nonlinear elastic response is also highly sensitive to the mutations of actn  in particular we observe that actin networks cross linked with actn bearing the disease causing k  e mutation are more brittle with a lower breaking stress in comparison to networks cross linked with wild type actn  furthermore a mutation that ablates the first actin binding site abs  in actn abrogates the network s ability to stress stiffen is standard nomenclature these changes in the mechanical properties of actin networks cross linked with mutant actn may represent physical determinants of the underlying disease mechanism in inherited focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
