scrapie infected transgenic mice expressing a laminin receptor decoy mutant reveal a prolonged incubation time associated with low levels of prpres
the  kda  kda laminin receptor lrp lr was identified as a cell surface receptor for prion proteins the laminin receptor mutant lrp      flag interfered with prpsc propagation in murine neuronal cells presumably acting as a decoy in a transdominant negative fashion by trapping prp molecules in the extracellular matrix here we generated hemizygous transgenic mice expressing lrp      flag in the brain scrapie infected transgenic mice exhibit a significantly prolonged incubation time in comparison to scrapie infected wild type fvb mice at the terminal stage transgenic mice revealed significantly reduced proteinase k resistant prp levels by   compared to wild type mice our results recommend the laminin receptor decoy mutant as an alternative therapeutic tool for treatment of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
