crystal structure of the cyanobacterial signal transduction protein pii in complex with pipx
pii proteins are highly conserved signal transducers in bacteria archaea and plants they have a large flexible loop t loop that adopts different conformations after covalent modification or binding to different effectors to regulate the functions of diverse protein partners the pii partner pipx pii interaction protein x  first identified from synechococcus sp pcc    exists uniquely in cyanobacteria pipx also interacts with the cyanobacterial global nitrogen regulator ntca the mutually exclusive binding of pii and ntca by pipx in a  oxoglutarate  og dependent manner enables pii to indirectly regulate the transcriptional activity of ntca however the structural basis for these exclusive interactions remains unknown we solved the crystal structure of the pii  pipx complex from the filamentous cyanobacterium anabaena sp pcc   at     resolution a homotrimeric pii captures three subunits of pipx through the t loops similar to pii from synechococcus the core structure consists of an antiparallel  sheet with four  strands and two  helices at the lateral surface pipx adopts a novel structure composed of five twisted antiparallel  strands and two  helices which is reminiscent of the pii structure the t loop of each pii subunit extends from the core structure as an antenna that is stabilized at the cleft between two pipx monomers via hydrogen bonds in addition the interfaces between the  sheets of pipx and pii core structures partially contribute to complex formation comparative structural analysis indicated that pipx and  og share a common binding site that overlaps with the  signature residues of cyanobacterial pii proteins our structure of pipx and the recently solved ntca structure enabled us to propose a putative model for the ntca  pipx complex taken together these findings provide structural insights into how pii regulates the transcriptional activity of ntca via pipx upon accumulation of the metabolite  og
