expanding the genetic code selection of efficient suppressors of four base codons and identification of  shifty  four base codons with a library approach in escherichia coli edited by m gottesman
naturally occurring trna mutants are known that suppress  frameshift mutations by means of an extended anticodon loop and a few have been used in protein mutagenesis in an effort to expand the number of possible ways to uniquely and efficiently encode unnatural amino acids we have devised a general strategy to select trnas with the ability to suppress four base codons from a library of trnas with randomized  or  nt anticodon loops our selectants included both known and novel suppressible four base codons and resulted in a set of very efficient non cross reactive trna four base codon pairs for agga uaga cccu and cuag the most efficient four base codon suppressors had watson crick complementary anticodons and the sequences of the anticodon loops outside of the anticodons varied with the anticodon additionally four base codon reporter libraries were used to identify  shifty  sites at which  frameshifting is most favorable in the absence of suppressor trnas in escherichia coli we intend to use these trnas to explore the limits of unnatural polypeptide biosynthesis both in vitro and eventually in vivo in addition this selection strategy is being extended to identify novel five and six base codon suppressors
