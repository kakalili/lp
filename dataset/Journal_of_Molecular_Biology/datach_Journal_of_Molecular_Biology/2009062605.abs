the three dimensional structure of a mycobacterial dapd provides insights into dapd diversity and reveals unexpected particulars about the enzymatic mechanism
the enzyme tetrahydrodipicolinate n succinyltransferase dapd is part of the l lysine biosynthetic pathway this pathway is crucial for the survival of the pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis mtb and consequently the enzymes of the pathway are potential drug targets we report here the crystal structures of mtb dapd and of mtb dapd in complex with the co factor succinyl coa scoa at     and     resolution respectively each subunit of the trimeric enzyme consists of three domains of which the second a left handed parallel  helix l h domain  is the common structural motif of enzymes belonging to the hexapeptide repeat superfamily the trimeric quaternary structure is stabilized by mg  and na located on the  fold axis the binary complex of mtb dapd and scoa reveals the binding mode s of the co factor and a possible covalent reaction intermediate the n terminal domain of mtb dapd exhibits a unique architecture including an interior water filled channel which allows access to a magnesium ion located at the  fold symmetry axis
