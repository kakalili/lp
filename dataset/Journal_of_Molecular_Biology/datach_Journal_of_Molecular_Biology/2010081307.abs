regulatory insertion removal restores maturation stability and function of  f  cftr
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr epithelial anion channel is a large multidomain membrane protein that matures inefficiently during biosynthesis its assembly is further perturbed by the deletion of f  from the first nucleotide binding domain nbd  responsible for most cystic fibrosis the mutant polypeptide is recognized by cellular quality control systems and is proteolyzed cftr nbd contains a  residue segment termed the regulatory insertion ri not present in other atp binding cassette transporters we report here that ri deletion enabled f  cftr to mature and traffic to the cell surface where it mediated regulated anion efflux and exhibited robust single chloride channel activity long term pulse chase experiments showed that the mature  ri  f  had a t  of    h in cells similar to the wild type ri deletion restored atp occlusion by nbd of  f  cftr and had a strong thermostabilizing influence on the channel with gating up to at least    c none of these effects of ri removal were achieved by deletion of only portions of ri discrete molecular dynamics simulations of nbd indicated that ri might indirectly influence the interaction of nbd with the rest of the protein by attenuating the coupling of the f  containing loop with the f like atp binding core subdomain so that ri removal overcame the perturbations caused by f  deletion restriction of ri to a particular conformational state may ameliorate the impact of the disease causing mutation
