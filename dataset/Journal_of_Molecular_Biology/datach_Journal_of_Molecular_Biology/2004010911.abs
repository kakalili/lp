the  rhodanese  fold and catalytic mechanism of  mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases crystal structure of ssea from escherichia coli
mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferases msts catalyze in vitro the transfer of a sulfur atom from substrate to cyanide yielding pyruvate and thiocyanate as products they display clear structural homology with the protein fold observed in the rhodanese sulfurtransferase family composed of two structurally related domains the role of msts in vivo as well as their detailed molecular mechanisms of action have been little investigated here we report the crystal structure of ssea a mst from escherichia coli which is the first mst three dimensional structure disclosed to date ssea displays specific structural differences relative to eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhodaneses in particular conformational variation of the rhodanese active site loop hosting the family invariant catalytic cys residue may support a new sulfur transfer mechanism involving cys  as the nucleophilic species and his  arg  and asp  as residues assisting catalysis
