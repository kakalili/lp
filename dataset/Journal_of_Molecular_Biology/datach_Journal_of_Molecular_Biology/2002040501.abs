conformational plasticity in folding of the split     protein s  evidence for burst phase disruption of the native state edited by a r fersht
an increasing number of folding studies of two state proteins shows that point mutations sometimes change the kinetic m values leading to kinks and curves in the chevron plots the molecular origin of these changes is yet unclear although it is speculated that they are linked to structural rearrangement of the transition state or to accumulation of meta stable intermediates to shed more light on this issue we present here a combined m and  value analysis of the split     protein s  wild type s displays classical two state kinetics with v shaped chevron plot but a majority of its mutants display distinct m value changes or curved chevrons we observe that this kinetic aberration of s is linked to mutations that are clustered in distinct regions of the native structure the most pronounced changes i e decrease in the m value for the unfolding rate constant are seen upon truncation of interactions between the n and c termini whereas mutations in the centre of the hydrophobic core show smaller or even opposed effects as a consequence the calculated  values display a systematic increase upon addition of denaturant in the case of s  the phenomenon seems to arise from a general plasticity of the different species on the folding pathway that is the structure of the denatured ensemble the transition state and the native ground state for unfolding seem to change upon mutation from these changes it is concluded that interactions spanning the centre of the hydrophobic core form early in folding whereas the entropically disfavoured interactions linking the n and c termini consolidate very late mainly on the down hill side of the folding barrier copyright   elsevier science ltd
