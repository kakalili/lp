identification of quaternary structure and functional domains of the ci repressor from bacteriophage tp
the bacteriophage encoded repressor protein plays a key role in determining the life cycle of a temperate phage following infection of a sensitive host the repressor protein ci which is encoded by the temperate lactococcal phage tp    represses transcription from both the lytic promoter pl and the lysogenic promoter pr by binding to multiple operator sites on the dna in this study we used a small bistable genetic switch element from phage tp   to study the effect of ci deletions in vivo and showed that   amino acids could be removed from the c terminal end of ci without destroying the ability of ci to repress transcription from the pl or the bistable switch properties we showed that a helix  turn  helix motif located in the n terminal part of ci is involved in dna binding by introducing specific point mutations purification of ci and truncated forms of ci followed by analytical gel filtration and chemical cross linking demonstrated that the c terminal end of ci was required for oligomerization and that ci may exist as a hexamer in solution furthermore expression and purification of the c terminal part of ci amino acids      showed that this part of the protein contained all the amino acids required to form an oligomer with an apparent molecular weight corresponding to a hexamer we found that the c terminal end of ci was required for de repression of the pl following sos induction suggesting that the hexameric form of ci is needed for this or that this part of the protein is involved in the interaction with host proteins by using small angle x ray scattering we show for the first time the overall solution structure of a full length wild type bacteriophage repressor at low resolution revealing that the tp   repressor forms a flat oligomer most probably a trimer of dimers
