identification and characterization of key kinetic intermediates in amyloid  protein fibrillogenesis edited by f cohen
amyloid  protein a  assembly into toxic oligomeric and fibrillar structures is a seminal event in alzheimer  s disease therefore blocking this process could have significant therapeutic benefit a rigorous mechanistic understanding of a  assembly would facilitate the targeting and design of fibrillogenesis inhibitors prior studies have shown that a  fibrillogenesis involves conformational changes leading to the formation of extended  sheets and that an  helix containing intermediate may be involved however the significance of this intermediate has been a matter of debate we report here that the formation of an oligomeric   helix containing assembly is a key step in a  fibrillogenesis the generality of this phenomenon was supported by conformational studies of  different a  peptides including wild type a      and a      biologically relevant truncated and chemically modified a  peptides and a  peptides causing familial forms of cerebral amyloid angiopathy without exception fibrillogenesis of these peptides involved an oligomeric  helix containing intermediate and the kinetics of formation of the intermediate and of fibrils was temporally correlated the kinetics varied depending on amino acid sequence and the extent of peptide n and c terminal truncation the ph dependence of helix formation suggested that asp and his exerted significant control over this process and over fibrillogenesis in general consistent with this idea a  peptides containing asp   asn or his   gln substitutions showed altered fibrillogenesis kinetics these data emphasize the importance of the dynamic interplay between a  monomer conformation and oligomerization state in controlling fibrillogenesis kinetics
