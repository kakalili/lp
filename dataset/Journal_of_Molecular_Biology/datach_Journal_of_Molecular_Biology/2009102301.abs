mapping transient partial unfolding by protein engineering and native state proteolysis
transient partial unfolding of proteins under native conditions may have significant consequences in the biochemical and biophysical properties of proteins native state proteolysis offers a facile way to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic accessibilities of partially unfolded forms cleavable forms under native conditions however determination of the structure of the cleavable form which is populated only transiently remains challenging although in some cases partially cleaved products from proteolysis provide information on the structure of this elusive form proteolysis of many proteins does not accumulate detectable intermediates here we describe a systematic approach to determining structures of cleavable forms by protein engineering and native state proteolysis by devising  c analysis which is analogous to conventional  analysis we have determined the structure of the cleavable form of escherichia coli maltose binding protein mbp  which does not accumulate any partially cleaved products we mutated  buried residues in mbp to alanine and determined  c values from the effects of the mutations on global stability and proteolytic susceptibility the result of this analysis suggests that two c terminal helices in mbp are unfolded in their cleavable form the effect of ligand binding on proteolytic susceptibility and c terminal deletion mutations also confirms the proposed structure our approach and methodology are generally applicable not only in elucidating the mechanism of proteolysis but also in investigating other important processes involving partial unfolding under native conditions such as protein misfolding and aggregation
