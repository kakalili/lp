nylon oligomer degrading enzyme substrate complex catalytic mechanism of  aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase
we performed x ray crystallographic analyses of  aminohexanoate dimer hydrolase hyb  dn  an enzyme responsible for the degradation of nylon  an industry by product and of a complex between hyb  dn a   s  a mutant of hyb  dn and  aminohexanoate linear dimer ald at     and     resolution respectively in hyb  dn asp  o  forms hydrogen bonds with tyr  o   two of the catalytic and binding amino acids and a loop between asn  and val   this state is the so called open form allowing its substrate to bind in the space between the loop and catalytic residues upon substrate binding in hyb  dn a  ald complex  the loop is shifted     at tyr  c  and the side chain of tyr  is rotated by the combined effect tyr  o  moves a total of      resulting in the formation of hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen of amide linkage in ald closed form  in addition electrostatic interaction between asp  o  and the amino group in ald stabilizes the substrate binding we propose here that the enzyme catalysis proceeds according to the following steps  i ald induced transition from open to closed form  ii nucleophilic attack of ser  to ald and formation of a tetrahedral intermediate  iii formation of acyl enzyme and transition to open form  iv deacylation amino acid substitutions reducing the enzyme ald interaction at positions   or   drastically decreased the ald hydrolytic activity but had very little effect on esterolytic activity suggesting that esterolytic reaction proceeds regardless of conversion present models illustrate why new activity against the nylon oligomer has evolved in an esterase with  lactamase folds while retaining the original esterolytic functions
