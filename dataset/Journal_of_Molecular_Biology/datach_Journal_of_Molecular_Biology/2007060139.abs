immunophysical exploration of c d  cr ccp   interaction using molecular dynamics and electrostatics
the formation of the complex between the d fragment of the complement component c  c d and the modular complement receptor  cr  is important for cross linking foreign antigens with surface bound antibodies and c d on the surface of b cells the first two modules of cr  complement control protein modules ccps  participate in non bonded interactions with c d we have used computational methods to analyze the dynamic and electrostatic properties of the c d  cr ccp   complex the interaction between c d and cr is known to depend on ph and ionic strength also the intermodular mobility of the cr modules has been questioned before we performed a   ns molecular dynamics simulation to generate a relaxed structure from crystal packing effects for the c d  cr ccp   complex and to study the energetics of the c d  cr ccp   association the md simulation suggests a tendency for intermodular twisting in cr ccp   we propose a two step model for recognition and binding of c d with cr ccp   driven by long and short medium range electrostatic interactions we have calculated the matrix of specific short medium range pairwise electrostatic free energies of interaction involved in binding and in intermodular communications electrostatic interactions may mediate allosteric effects important for c d  cr ccp   association we present calculations for the ph and ionic strength dependence of c d  cr ccp   ionization free energies which are in overall agreement with experimental binding data we show how comparison of the calculated and experimental data allows for the decomposition of the contributions of electrostatic from other effects in association we critically compare predicted stabilities for several mutants of the c d  cr ccp   complex with the available experimental data for binding ability finally we propose that cr ccp   is capable of assuming a large array of intermodular topologies ranging from closed v shaped to open linear states with similar recognition properties for c d but we cannot exclude an additional contact site with c d
