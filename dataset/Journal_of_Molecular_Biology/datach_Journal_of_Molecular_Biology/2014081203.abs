rtr is a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates tyr and ser on the rna polymerase ii ctd
the phosphorylation state of heptapeptide repeats within the c terminal domain ctd of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii polii controls the transcription cycle and is maintained by the competing action of kinases and phosphatases rtr was recently proposed to be the enzyme responsible for the transition of polii into the elongation and termination phases of transcription by removing the phosphate marker on serine  but this attribution was questioned by the apparent lack of enzymatic activity here we demonstrate that rtr is a phosphatase of new structure that is auto inhibited by its own c terminus the enzymatic activity of the protein in vitro is functionally important in vivo as well a single amino acid mutation that reduces activity leads to the same phenotype in vivo as deletion of the protein coding gene from yeast surprisingly rtr dephosphorylates not only serine  on the ctd but also the newly described anti termination tyrosine  marker supporting the hypothesis that rtr and its homologs promote the transition from transcription to termination
