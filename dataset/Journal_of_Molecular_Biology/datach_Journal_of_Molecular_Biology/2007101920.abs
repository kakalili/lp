molecular mechanism of the redox dependent interaction between nadh dependent ferredoxin reductase and rieske type  fe s ferredoxin
the electron transfer system of the biphenyl dioxygenase bpha which is derived from acidovorax sp  formally pseudomonas sp  strain kks   is composed of an fad containing nadh ferredoxin reductase bpha  and a rieske type  fe s ferredoxin bpha  biochemical studies have suggested that the whole electron transfer process from nadh to bpha comprises three consecutive elementary electron transfer reactions in which bpha and bpha interact transiently in a redox dependent manner initially bpha receives two electrons from nadh the reduced bpha then delivers one electron each to the  fe s cluster of the two bpha molecules through redox dependent transient interactions the reduced bpha transports the electron to bpha a  a terminal oxygenase to support the activation of dioxygen for biphenyl dihydroxylation in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the sequential reaction and the redox dependent interaction between bpha and bpha  we determined the crystal structures of the productive bpha  bpha complex and of free bpha and bpha in all the redox states occurring in the catalytic cycle the crystal structures of these reaction intermediates demonstrated that each elementary electron transfer induces a series of redox dependent conformational changes in bpha and bpha  which regulate the interaction between them in addition the conformational changes induced by the preceding electron transfer seem to induce the next electron transfer the interplay of electron transfer and induced conformational changes seems to be critical to the sequential electron transfer reaction from nadh to bpha
