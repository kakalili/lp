the biochemistry and fidelity of synthesis by the apicoplast genome replication dna polymerase pfprex from the malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum
plasmodium falciparum the major causative agent of human malaria contains three separate genomes the apicoplast an intracellular organelle contains an    kb circular dna genome of unusually high a t content  gt   that is replicated by the nuclear encoded replication complex pfprex herein we have expressed and purified the dna polymerase domain of pfprex kpom  klenow like polymerase of malaria   and measured its fidelity using a lacz based forward mutation assay in addition we analyzed the kinetic parameters for the incorporation of both complementary and noncomplementary nucleotides using kpom lacking       exonucleolytic activity kpom exhibits a strongly biased mutational spectrum in which t  c is the most frequent single base substitution and differs significantly from the closely related escherichia coli dna polymerase i using e coli harboring a temperature sensitive polymerase i allele we established that kpom can complement the growth defective phenotype at an elevated temperature we propose that the error bias of kpom may be exploited in the complementation assay to identify nucleoside analogs that mimic this base mispairing and preferentially inhibit apicoplast dna replication
