allosteric changes in protein structure computed by a simple mechanical model hemoglobin t  r transition
information on protein dynamics has been usually inferred from spectroscopic studies of parts of the proteins or indirectly from the comparison of the conformations assumed in the presence of different substrates or ligands while molecular simulations also provide information on protein dynamics they usually suffer from incomplete sampling of conformational space and become prohibitively expensive when exploring the collective dynamics of large macromolecular structures here we explore the dynamics of a well studied allosteric protein hemoglobin hb  to show that a simple mechanical model based on gaussian fluctuations of residues can efficiently predict the transition between the tense t unliganded and relaxed r or r  o or co bound forms of hb the passage from t into r is shown to be favored by the global mode of motion which in turn is driven by entropic effects the major difference between the dynamics of the t and r forms is the loss of the hinge bending role of      or      interfacial residues at  phe  his  and  thr  asn  in the r form which implies a decreased cooperativity in the higher affinity r  form of hb consistent with many experimental studies the involvement of the proximal histidine  his  in this hinge region suggests that the allosteric propagation of the local structural changes induced upon o binding into global ones occur via hinge regions this is the first demonstration that there is an intrinsic tendency of hb to undergo t  r transition induced by purely elastic forces of entropic origin that are uniquely defined for the particular contact topology of the t form
