production of authentic sars cov mpro with enhanced activity application as a novel tag cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction
the viral proteases have proven to be the most selective and useful for removing the fusion tags in fusion protein expression systems as a key enzyme in the viral life cycle the main protease mpro is most attractive for drug design targeting the sars coronavirus sars cov  the etiological agent responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in    in this study sars cov mpro was used to specifically remove the gst tag in a new fusion protein expression system we report a new method to produce wild type wt sars cov mpro with authentic n and c termini and compare the activity of wt protease with those of three different types of sars cov mpro with additional residues at the n or c terminus our results show that additional residues at the n terminus but not at the c terminus of mpro are detrimental to enzyme activity to explain this the crystal structures of wt sars cov mpro and its complex with a michael acceptor inhibitor were determined to     and     resolution respectively these crystal structures reveal that the first residue of this protease is important for sustaining the substrate binding pocket and inhibitor binding this study suggests that sars cov mpro could serve as a new tag cleavage endopeptidase for protein overproduction and the wt sars cov mpro is more appropriate for mechanistic characterization and inhibitor design
