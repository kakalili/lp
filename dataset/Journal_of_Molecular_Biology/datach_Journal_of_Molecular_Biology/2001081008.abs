the folding mechanism of a  sheet the ww domain edited by c r matthews
the folding thermodynamics and kinetics of the pin ww domain a three stranded antiparallel  sheet have been characterized extensively folding and activation free energies were determined as a function of temperature for  mutants which sample all strands and turns of the molecule the mutational phi value  m diagram is a smooth function of sequence indicating a prevalence of local interactions in the transition state ts  at   c the diagram has a single pronounced maximum at turn  the rate limiting step during folding is the formation of loop  in contrast key residues for thermodynamic stability are located in the strand hydrophobic clusters indicating that factors contributing to protein stability and folding kinetics are not correlated the location of the ts along the entropic reaction coordinate  t obtained by temperature tuning the kinetics reveals that sufficiently destabilizing mutants in loop  or in the leu trp  tyr  pro  hydrophobic cluster can cause a switch to a late ts  m analysis is usually applied  perturbatively   methyl truncation  but with  t to quantitatively assess ts shifts along a reaction coordinate more severe mutations can be used to probe regions of the free energy surface beyond the ts
