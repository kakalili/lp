gene function analysis by amber stop codon suppression cmbf is a nuclear protein that supports growth and development of dictyostelium amoebae edited by j karn
the c module binding factor cmbf is a nuclear dna binding protein which was originally identified through its specific binding to a promoter element within the retrotransposable element tre a of dictyostelium discoideum ax cells in order to analyse putative physiological functions of cmbf for the tre a hosting d discoideum cells we used a novel strategy to create mutant cell lines which stably underexpressed functional cmbf an amber uag translation stop codon was introduced into the chromosomal copy of the cmbf encoding gene cbfa  and an amber suppressor trna gene was expressed in the same mutant cells due to the low efficiency of translation stop codon suppression in this system all recovered cell lines expressed lt   of wild type cmbf levels the mutant cell lines displayed strong growth phenotypes when plated on their natural food source bacteria we show evidence that growth reduction was due to impaired phagocytosis of bacteria in the mutants all obtained mutants showed a strong developmental defect which was defined by the formation of very small fruiting bodies the strength of the developmental phenotype appeared to depend upon the residual cmbf levels maintained in the mutants we propose that cmbf is a general transcription regulator which supports the normal expression of several genes required for the maintenance of high proliferation rates of d discoideum amoebae as well as proper aggregation and development our results demonstrate that amber stop codon suppression may be a useful strategy to stably underexpress proteins whose coding genes cannot be successfully disrupted by homologous recombination
