mutations in desmin s carboxy terminal  tail  domain severely modify filament and network mechanics
inherited mutations in the gene coding for the intermediate filament protein desmin have been demonstrated to cause severe skeletal and cardiac myopathies unexpectedly some of the mutated desmins in particular those carrying single amino acid alterations in the non  helical carboxy terminal domain   tail   have been demonstrated to form apparently normal filaments both in vitro and in transfected cells thus it is not clear if filament properties are affected by these mutations at all for this reason we performed oscillatory shear experiments with six different desmin  tail  mutants in order to characterize the mesh size of filament networks and their strain stiffening properties moreover we have carried out high frequency oscillatory squeeze flow measurements to determine the bending stiffness of the respective filaments characterized by the persistence length lp interestingly mesh size was not altered for the mutant filament networks except for the mutant desr  w which apparently did not form proper filament networks also the values for bending stiffness were in the same range for both the  tail  mutants lp       m and the wild type desmin lp       m  however most investigated desmin mutants exhibited a distinct reduction in strain stiffening compared to wild type desmin and promoted nonaffine network deformation therefore we conclude that the mutated amino acids affect intrafilamentous architecture and colloidal interactions along the filament in such a way that the response to applied strain is significantly altered in order to explore the importance of the  tail  domain as such for filament network properties we employed a  tail  truncated desmin under standard conditions it formed extended regular filaments but failed to generate strain stiffening hence these data strongly indicate that the  tail  domain is responsible for attractive filament  filament interactions moreover these types of interactions may also be relevant to the network properties of the desmin cytoskeleton in patient muscle
