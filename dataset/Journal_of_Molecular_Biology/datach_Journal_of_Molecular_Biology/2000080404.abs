crystal structure of the  apical domain of the thermosome reveals structural plasticity in the protrusion region edited by d rees
the crystal structure of the  apical domain of the thermosome an archaeal group ii chaperonin from thermoplasma acidophilum has been determined at    resolution the structure shows an invariant globular core from which a    long protrusion emanates composed of an elongated  helix h  and a long extended stretch consisting of residues glub  thrb   a comparison with previous apical domain structures reveals a large segmental displacement of the protruding part of helix h  via the hinge glub  valb   the region comprising residues glub  thrb  adopts an extended  like conformation rather than the  helix seen in the  apical domain consequently it appears that the protrusions of the apical domains from group ii chaperonins might assume a variety of context dependent conformations during an open substrate accepting state of the chaperonin sequence variations in the protrusion regions that are found in the eukaryotic tric cct subunits may provide different structural propensities and hence serve different roles in substrate recognition
