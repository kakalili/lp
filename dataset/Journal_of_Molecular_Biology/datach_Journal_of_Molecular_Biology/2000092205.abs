a specific intermolecular association between the regulatory domains of a tec family kinase edited by p wright
interleukin  tyrosine kinase itk  is a t cell specific tyrosine kinase of the tec family we have examined a novel intermolecular interaction between the sh and sh domains of itk in addition to the interaction between the isolated domains we have found that the dual sh sh domain containing fragment of itk self associates in a specific manner in solution tec family members contain the sh  sh and catalytic domains common to many kinase families but are distinguished by a unique amino terminal sequence which contains a proline rich stretch previous work has identified an intramolecular regulatory association between the proline rich region and the adjacent sh domain of itk the intermolecular interaction between the sh and sh domains of itk that we describe provides a possible mechanism for displacement of this intramolecular regulatory sequence a step that may be required for full tec kinase activation additionally localization of the interacting surfaces on both the sh and sh domains by chemical shift mapping has provided information about the molecular details of this recognition event the interaction involves the conserved aromatic binding pocket of the sh domain and a newly defined binding surface on the sh domain the interacting residues on the sh domain do not conform to the consensus motif for an sh proline rich ligand interestingly we note a striking correlation between the sh residues that mediate this interaction and those residues that when mutated in the tec family member btk cause the hereditary immune disorder x linked agamaglobulinemia
