design and crystal structure of bacteriophage t mini fibritin nccf
fibritin is a fibrous protein that forms  whiskers  attached to the neck of bacteriophage t  whiskers interact with the long tail fibers regulating the assembly and infectivity of the virus the fibritin trimer includes the n terminal domain responsible for attachment to the phage particle and for the collar formation the central domain forming a    long segmented coiled coil structure and the c terminal  foldon  domain we have designed a  mini  fibritin with most of the coiled coil domain deleted and solved its crystal structure the non helical n terminal part represents a new protein fold that tightly interacts with the coiled coil segment forming a single domain as revealed by calorimetry the analysis of the crystal structure and earlier electron microscopy data on the collar  whisker complex suggests the necessity of other proteins to participate in the collar formation crystal structure determination of the n terminal domain of fibritin is the first step towards elucidating the detailed structure and assembly mechanism of the collar  whisker complex
