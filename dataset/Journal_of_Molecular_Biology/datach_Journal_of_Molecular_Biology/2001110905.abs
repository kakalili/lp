defining the peptide nucleic acids pna length requirement for pna binding induced transcription and gene expression edited by j karn
induction of gene expression has great potential in the treatment of many human diseases peptide nucleic acid pna as a novel dna binding reagent provides an ideal system to induce gene specific expression in our recent studies we have demonstrated that pna bound to double stranded dna targets and therefore generated single stranded d loops and induced transcription of target genes both in vitro and in vivo most importantly we have demonstrated that treatment of cultured human cells with pnas led to expression of an endogenous target gene therefore the study of the molecular mechanism of pna binding induced gene expression will have great implications for the gene therapy of many human diseases in the current study we have investigated the pna length requirement for pna binding induced transcription initiation using a series of pnas with different lengths we have determined that pnas with lengths of     nt induce very high levels of transcription in a hela nuclear extract in vitro transcription system transfection of the pna bound gfp reporter gene plasmid into human normal fibroblast nf cells led to a similar result gel mobility shift assays revealed very strong binding affinities of these pnas dna footprinting analysis further demonstrated the specificity of pnas binding to the targets these results lead to important understanding of the molecular mechanism of transcription initiation and highly valuable information in pna design especially for pna binding induced gene specific expression
