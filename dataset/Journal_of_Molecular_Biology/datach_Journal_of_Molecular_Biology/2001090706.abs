helix packing in the lactose permease of escherichia coli localization of helix vi edited by g von heijne
plasmids encoding  split  lactose permease constructs with discontinuities in either the periplasmic loop between helices v and vi n c  or between helices vi and vii n c  were used to localize helix vi within the tertiary structure by site directed thiol cross linking a total of  double cys pairs with one cys residue in helix vi and another in helix v or viii were studied with homobifunctional cross linking agents significant cross linking is observed between the periplasmic ends of helices v position   or   and vi position   with rigid  or    reagents furthermore the cys residue at position   helix vi also cross links to a cys residue at either position   or   helix viii with a    cross linking agent the data indicate that helices v vi and viii are in close proximity at the periplasmic face of the membrane with helix vi significantly closer to helix v in addition   d galactopyranosyl  thio  d galactopyranoside induces a significant increase in cross linking efficiency between helices vi and viii and between helices v and viii with no significant change in cross linking between helices v and vi
