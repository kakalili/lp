evaluation of structural and evolutionary contributions to deleterious mutation prediction
methods for automated prediction of deleterious protein mutations have utilized both structural and evolutionary information but the relative contribution of these two factors remains unclear to address this we have used a variety of structural and evolutionary features to create simple deleterious mutation models that have been tested on both experimental mutagenesis and human allele data we find that the most accurate predictions are obtained using a solvent accessibility term the c  density and a score derived from homologous sequences sift a classification tree using these two features has a cross validated prediction error of    on an experimental mutagenesis test set when the prior probability for deleterious and neutral cases is equal whereas this prediction error is    and    using either the c  density or sift alone the improvement imparted by structure increases when fewer homologs are available when restricted to three homologs the prediction error improves from    using sift alone to    using sift and the c  density or    using sift and a noisy c  density term approximating the inaccuracy of ab initio structures modeled by the rosetta method we conclude that methods for deleterious mutation prediction should include structural information when fewer than five to ten homologs are available and that ab initio predicted structures may soon be useful in such cases when high resolution structures are unavailable
