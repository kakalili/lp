structures of ligand free and inhibitor complexes of dihydroorotase from escherichia coli implications for loop movement in inhibitor design
dihydroorotase dhoase catalyzes the reversible cyclization of n carbamyl l aspartate ca asp to l dihydroorotate dho in the de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides dhoase is a potential anti malarial drug target as malarial parasites can only synthesize pyrimidines via the de novo pathway and do not possess a salvage pathway here we report the structures of escherichia coli dhoase crystallized without ligand     resolution and in the presence of the inhibitors  oxo     tetrahydropyrimidine   dicarboxylate hddp      and  fluoroorotate foa      these are the first crystal structures of dhoase inhibitor complexes providing structural information on the mode of inhibitor binding hddp possesses features of both the substrate and product and ligates the zn atoms in the active site in addition hddp forms hydrogen bonds to the flexible loop residues      stabilizing the  loop in  conformation of the flexible loop normally associated with the presence of ca asp in the active site by contrast foa a product like inhibitor binds to the active site in a similar fashion to dho but does not ligate the zn atoms directly nor stabilize the loop in conformation these structures define the necessary features for the future design of improved inhibitors of dhoase
