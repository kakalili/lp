probing the structure of f actin cross links constrain atomic models and modify actin dynamics edited by m f moody
cross links between protomers in f actin can be used as a very sensitive probe of both the dynamics and structure of f actin we have characterized filaments formed from a previously described yeast actin q c mutant where disulfide bonds can be formed between the cys  that is introduced into subdomain  and cys  on an adjacent protomer we find that the distribution of cross linked n mers shows no cooperativity and corresponds to a random probability cross linking reaction the random distribution suggests that disulfide formation does not cause a significant perturbation of the f actin structure consistent with this lack of perturbation three dimensional reconstructions of extensively cross linked filaments using a new approach to helical image analysis show very small structural changes with respect to uncross linked filaments this finding is in conflict with refined models but in agreement with the original holmes et al model for f actin under conditions where   of the protomers are linked by disulfide bonds the distribution of filament twist becomes more heterogeneous with respect to control filaments a molecular model suggests that strain introduced by the disulfide is relieved by increasing the twist of the long pitch actin helices disulfide formation makes yeast actin filaments  three times less flexible in terms of bending and similar in this respect to vertebrate skeletal muscle f actin these observations support previous reports that the rigidity of f actin can be controlled by the position of subdomain  and that this region is more flexible in yeast f actin than in skeletal muscle f actin
