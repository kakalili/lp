saccharomyces cerevisiae msh  msh and msh  msh complexes display distinct requirements for dna binding domain i in mismatch recognition
in eukaryotic mismatch repair mmr msh  msh initiates the repair of base  base and small insertion deletion mismatches while msh  msh repairs larger insertion deletion mismatches here we show that the msh   mutation containing a complete deletion of the conserved mismatch recognition domain i of msh  conferred a separation of function phenotype with respect to msh  msh and msh  msh functions strains bearing the msh   mutation were nearly wild type in msh  msh mediated mmr and in suppressing recombination between dna sequences predicted to form mismatches recognized by msh  msh  however these strains were completely defective in msh  msh mediated mmr and recombination functions this information encouraged us to analyze the contributions of domain i to the mismatch binding specificity of msh  msh in genetic and biochemical assays we found that domain i in msh contributed a non specific dna binding activity while domain i of msh appeared important for mismatch binding specificity and for suppressing non specific dna binding these observations reveal distinct requirements for the msh dna binding domain i in the repair of dna mismatches and suggest that the binding of msh  msh to mismatch dna involves protein  dna contacts that appear very different from those required for msh  msh mismatch binding
