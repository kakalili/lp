beyond dna rna editing and steps toward alu exonization in primates
the exaptation of transposed elements into protein coding domains by a process called exonization is one important evolutionary pathway for generating novel variant functions of gene products adenosine to inosine a to i modification is a recently discovered rna editing mediated mechanism that contributes to the exonization of previously unprocessed mrna introns in the human nuclear prelamin a recognition factor gene transcript the alternatively spliced exon  results from an a to i editing generated   splice site located within an intronic alu short interspersed element sequence comparisons of representatives of all primate infraorders revealed the critical evolutionary steps leading to this editing mediated exonization the source of exon  was seeded within the primary transcript about     million years ago by the head to head insertions of two primate specific alu short interspersed elements in the common ancestor of anthropoids the latent protein coding potential was realized     million years later in a common ancestor of gorilla chimpanzee and human as a result of numerous changes at the rna and dna level comparisons of   processed mrna clones from various primate species with their genomic sequences identified seven different rna editing mediated alternative splice variants in total   a to i editing sites were identified the gorilla chimpanzee and human nuclear prelamin a recognition factor genes exemplify the versatile interplay of pre and posttranscriptional modifications leading to novel genetic potential
