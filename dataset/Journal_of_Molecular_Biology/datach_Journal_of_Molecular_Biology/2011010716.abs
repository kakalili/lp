an rna conformational switch regulates pre  s rrna cleavage
to produce mature ribosomal rnas rrnas  polycistronic rrna transcripts are cleaved in an ordered series of events we have uncovered the molecular basis for the ordering of two essential cleavage steps at the   end of  s rrna using in vitro and in vivo structure probing rna binding and cleavage experiments and yeast genetics we demonstrate that a conserved rna sequence in the spacer region between the  s and  s rrnas base pairs with the decoding site of  s rrna in early assembly intermediates nucleolar cleavage at site a excises this sequence element leading to a conformational switch in pre  s rrna by which the ribosomal decoding site is formed this conformational switch positions the nuclease nob for cytoplasmic cleavage at the   end of  s rrna and is required for the final maturation step of  s rrna in vivo and in vitro more generally our data show that the intrinsic ability of rna to form stable structural switches is exploited to order and regulate rna dependent biological processes
