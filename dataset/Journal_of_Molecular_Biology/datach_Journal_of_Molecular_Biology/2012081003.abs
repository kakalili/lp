the effect of a  on iapp aggregation in the presence of an isolated  cell membrane
fibrillar aggregates of the islet amyloid polypeptide iapp and amyloid   a  are known to deposit at pancreatic  cells and neuronal cells and are associated with the cell degenerative diseases type  diabetes mellitus t dm and alzheimer s disease ad  respectively since iapp is secreted by  cells and a membrane damaging effect of iapp has been discussed as a reason for  cell dysfunction and the development of t dm studies of the interaction of iapp with the  cell membrane are of high relevance for gaining a molecular level understanding of the underlying mechanism recently it has also been shown that patients suffering from t dm exhibit an increased risk to develop ad and vice versa and a molecular link between ad and t dm has been suggested in this study membrane lipids from the rat insulinoma derived ins e  cell line were isolated and their interaction with the amyloidogenic peptides iapp and a  and a mixture of both peptides has been studied to yield insight into the associated peptides conformational changes and their effect on the membrane integrity during aggregation we have carried out attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy experiments the iapp  a  heterocomplexes formed were shown to adsorb aggregate and permeabilize the isolated  cell membrane significantly slower than pure iapp however at a rate that is much faster than that of pure a  in addition it could be shown that isolated  cell membranes cause similar effects on the kinetics of iapp and iapp  a  fibril formation as anionic heterogeneous model membranes
