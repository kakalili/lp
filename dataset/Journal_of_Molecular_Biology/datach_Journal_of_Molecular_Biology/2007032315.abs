structural basis of sspb tail recognition by the zinc binding domain of clpx
the degradation of ssra aandenyalaa tagged proteins in the bacterial cytosol is carried out by the clpxp protease and is markedly stimulated by the sspb adaptor protein it has previously been reported that the amino terminal zinc binding domain of clpx zbd is involved in complex formation with the sspb tail xb clpx binding motif  in an effort to better understand the recognition of sspb by clpx and the mechanism of delivery of ssra tagged substrates to clpxp we have determined the structures of zbd alone at      and     resolution in each different crystal form and also in complex with xb peptide at     resolution the xb peptide forms an antiparallel  sheet with two  strands of zbd and the structure shows a   stoichiometric complex between zbd and xb suggesting that there are two independent sspb tail binding sites in zbd the high resolution zbd xb complex structure in combination with biochemical analyses can account for key determinants in the recognition of the sspb tail by clpx and sheds light on the mechanism of delivery of target proteins to the prokaryotic degradation machine
