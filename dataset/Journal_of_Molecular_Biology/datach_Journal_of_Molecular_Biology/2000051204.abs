methyl specific dna binding by mcrbc a modification dependent restriction enzyme  edited by j karn
mcrbc a gtp requiring modification dependent endonuclease of escherichia coli k   specifically recognizes dna sites of the form   rmc    dna cleavage normally requires translocation mediated coordination between two such recognition elements at distinct sites we have investigated assembly of the cleavage competent complex with gel shift and dnase i footprint analysis in the gel shift system mcrbl binding resulted in a fast migrating specific shifted band in a manner requiring both gtp and mg  the binding was specific for methylated dna and responded to local sequence changes in the same way that cleavage does single stranded dna competed for mcrbl binding in a modification and sequence specific fashion a supershifted species was formed in the presence of mcrc and gtp s dnase i footprint analysis showed modest cooperativity in binding to two sites and a two site substrate displayed protection in non specific spacer dna in addition to the recognition elements the addition of mcrc did not affect the footprint obtained we propose that mcrc effects a conformational change in the complex rather than a reorganization of the dna protein interface
