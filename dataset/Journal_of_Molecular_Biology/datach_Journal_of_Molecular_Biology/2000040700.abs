structure based evaluation of sequence comparison and fold recognition alignment accuracy edited by b honig
the biological role biochemical function and structure of uncharacterized protein sequences is often inferred from their similarity to known proteins a constant goal is to increase the reliability sensitivity and accuracy of alignment techniques to enable the detection of increasingly distant relationships development tuning and testing of these methods benefit from appropriate benchmarks for the assessment of alignment accuracy here we describe a benchmark protocol to estimate sequence to sequence and sequence to structure alignment accuracy the protocol consists of structurally related pairs of proteins and procedures to evaluate alignment accuracy over the whole set the set of protein pairs covers all the currently known fold types the benchmark is challenging in the sense that it consists of proteins lacking clear sequence similarity correct target alignments are derived from the three dimensional structures of these pairs by rigid body superposition an evaluation engine computes the accuracy of alignments obtained from a particular algorithm in terms of alignment shifts with respect to the structure derived alignments using this benchmark we estimate that the best results can be obtained from a combination of amino acid residue substitution matrices and knowledge based potentials
