productive folding to the native state by a group ii intron ribozyme edited by d draper
group ii introns are large catalytic rna molecules that fold into compact structures essential for the catalysis of splicing and intron mobility reactions despite a growing body of information on the folded state of group ii introns at equilibrium there is currently no information on the folding pathway and little information on the ionic requirements for folding folding isotherms were determined by hydroxyl radical footprinting for the  individual protections that are distributed throughout a group ii intron ribozyme derived from intron ai   the isotherms span a similar range of mg  concentrations and share a similar index of cooperativity time resolved hydroxyl radical footprinting studies show that all regions of the ribozyme fold slowly and with remarkable synchrony into a single catalytically active structure at a rate comparable to those of other ribozymes studied thus far the rate constants for the formation of tertiary contacts and recovery of catalytic activity are identical within experimental error catalytic activity analyses in the presence of urea provide no evidence that the slow folding of the ai  intron is attributable to the presence of unproductive kinetic traps along the folding pathway taken together the data suggest that the rate limiting step for folding of group ii intron ai  occurs early along the reaction pathway we propose that this behavior resembles protein folding that is limited in rate by high contact order or the need to form key tertiary interactions from partners that are located far apart in the primary or secondary structure
