design of a highly reactive hdv ribozyme sequence uncovers facilitation of rna folding by alternative pairings and physiological ionic strength
the hepatitis delta virus hdv ribozyme is a self cleaving rna that resides in the hdv genome and regulates its replication the native fold of the ribozyme is complex having two pseudoknots earlier work implicated four non native pairings in slowing pseudoknot formation alt  alt  alt  and alt p  the goal of the present work was design of a kinetically simplified and maximally reactive construct for in vitro mechanistic and structural studies the initial approach chosen was site directed mutagenesis in which known alternative pairings were destabilized while leaving the catalytic core intact based on prior studies the g c u   double mutant was prepared however biphasic kinetics and antisense oligonucleotide response trends opposite those of the well studied g c mutant were observed suggesting that new alternative pairings with multiple registers termed alt x and alt y had been created enzymatic structure mapping of oligonucleotide models supported this notion this led to a model wherein alt  and the phylogenetically conserved alt  act as  folding guides   facilitating folding of the major population of the rna molecules by hindering formation of the alt x and alt y registers attempts to eliminate the strongest of the alt x pairings by rational design of a quadruple mutant only resulted in more complex kinetic behavior in an effort to simultaneously destabilize multiple alternative pairings studies were carried out on g c u   in the presence of urea or increased monovalent ion concentration inclusion of physiological ionic strength allowed the goal of monophasic fast folding kobs   min   kinetics to be realized to account for this a model is developed wherein na  which destabilizes secondary and tertiary structures in the presence of mg  facilitates native folding by destabilizing the multiple alternative secondary structures with a higher order dependence
