recombineering reveals a diverse collection of ribosomal proteins l and l  that confer resistance to macrolide antibiotics
mutations in ribosomal proteins l and l  confer resistance to erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics in a variety of bacteria l and l  have elongated loops whose tips converge in the peptide exit tunnel near the macrolide binding site and resistance mutations typically affect residues within these loops here we used bacteriophage  red mediated recombination or  recombineering   to uncover new l and l  alleles that confer macrolide resistance in escherichia coli we randomized residues at the tips of the l and l  loops using recombineered oligonucleotide libraries and selected the mutagenized cells for erythromycin resistant mutants these experiments led to the identification of   resistance mutations encoding   unique l and l  proteins  the overwhelming majority of which are novel many resistance mutations were complex involving multiple missense mutations in frame deletions and insertions transfer of l and l  mutations into wild type cells by phage p mediated transduction demonstrated that each allele was sufficient to confer macrolide resistance although l and l  mutants are typically resistant to most macrolides selections carried out on different antibiotics revealed macrolide specific resistance mutations l  lys trp is one such allele that confers resistance to erythromycin but not to tylosin and spiramycin purified l  lys trp ribosomes show reduced erythromycin binding but have the same affinity for tylosin as wild type ribosomes moreover dimethyl sulfate methylation protection assays demonstrated that l  lys trp ribosomes bind tylosin more readily than erythromycin in vivo this work underscores the exceptional functional plasticity of the l and l  proteins and highlights the utility of red mediated recombination in targeted genetic selections
