phage displayed antibody libraries of synthetic heavy chain complementarity determining regions
a structure based approach was used to design libraries of synthetic heavy chain complementarity determining regions cdrs  the cdr libraries were displayed as either monovalent or bivalent single chain variable fragments scfvs with a single heavy chain variable domain scaffold and a fixed light chain variable domain using the structure of a parent antibody as a guide we restricted library diversity to cdr positions with significant exposure to solvent we introduced diversity with tailored degenerate codons that ideally only encoded for amino acids commonly observed in natural antibody cdrs with these design principles we reasoned that we would produce libraries of diverse solvent exposed surfaces displayed on stable scaffolds with minimal structural perturbations the libraries were sorted against a panel of proteins and yielded multiple unique binding clones against all six antigens tested the bivalent library yielded numerous unique sequences while the monovalent library yielded fewer unique clones selected scfvs were converted to the fab format and the purified fab proteins retained high affinity for antigen the results support the view that synthetic heavy chain diversity alone may be sufficient for the generation of high affinity antibodies from phage displayed libraries thus it may be possible to dispense with the light chain altogether as is the case in natural camelid immunoglobulins
