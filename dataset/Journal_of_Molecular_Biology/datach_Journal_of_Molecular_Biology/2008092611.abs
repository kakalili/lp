the role of aromatic phenylalanine residues in binding carotenoid to light harvesting model and wild type complexes
the mode of carotenoid crt binding to polypeptide and specifying its function is as yet largely unknown statistical analysis of major photosystems i and ii suggests that aromatic residues make up a significant part of the crt binding pockets phenylalanine residues ensure approximately    at some carbon atoms even up to    of the total contacts with crts by use of an alanine  leucine model transmembrane helix that replaces the native helix of the bacterial light harvesting complex  lh   subunit we study the effects of polypeptide residues on cofactor binding in a model sequence context here it is shown that phenylalanine residues located in the close vicinity of the crts polyene backbone significantly contribute to the binding of the crt to the model protein the replacement of a phenylalanine with leucine in the model helix results in significant reduction in the complexes crt content this effect is strongly enhanced by the removal of a second phenylalanine in close vicinity to the crt i e  of the wild type wt   subunit remarkably the mutation of only two phenylalanine residues in the lh wt sequence   phe at position    and  phe at    results in the loss of nearly   of functional crt resonance raman spectra indicate that the crt conformation is fundamentally altered by the absence of the phenylalanines aromatic side chains suggesting that they lock the crt into a precise well defined configuration thus binding and specific functionalisation of crt in the model and wt light harvesting complex is reliant on the aromatic residue phenylalanine the use of the light harvesting complex as a model system thus substantiates the notion that the aromatic residue phenylalanine is a key factor for the binding of crt to transmembrane proteins
