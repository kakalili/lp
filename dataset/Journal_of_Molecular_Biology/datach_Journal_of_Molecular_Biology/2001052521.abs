appropriate initiation of the strand exchange reaction promoted by reca protein requires atp hydrolysis edited by m gotesman
the dna dependent atpase activity of the escherichia coli reca protein has been recognized for more than two decades yet the role of atp hydrolysis in the reca promoted strand exchange reaction remains unclear here we demonstrate that atp hydrolysis is required as part of a proofreading process during homology recognition it enables the reca ssdna complex after determining that the strand exchanged duplex is mismatched to dissociate from the synaptic complex which allows it to re initiate the search for a  true  homologous region furthermore the results suggest that when non homologous sequences are present at the proximal end atp hydrolysis is required to allow ssdna reca to reinitiate the strand exchange from an internal homologous region
