differential display detects host nucleic acid motifs altered in scrapie infected brain
the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies tses including scrapie have been attributed to an infectious protein or prion infectivity is allied to conversion of the endogenous nucleic acid binding protein prp to an infectious modified form known as prpsc the protein only theory does not easily explain the enigmatic properties of the agent including strain variation it was previously suggested that a short nucleic acid perhaps host encoded might contribute to the pathoetiology of the tses no candidate host molecules that might explain transmission of strain differences have yet been put forward differential display is a robust technique for detecting nucleic acid differences between two populations we applied this technique to total nucleic acid preparations from scrapie infected and control brain independent rna preparations from eight normal and eight scrapie infected strain  k hamster brains were randomly amplified and visualized in parallel though the nucleic acid patterns were generally identical in scrapie infected versus control brain some rare bands were differentially displayed molecular species consistently overrepresented or underrepresented in all eight infected brain samples versus all eight controls were excised from the display sequenced and assembled into contigs only seven ros contigs rnas over or underrepresented in scrapie emerged representing lt  kb from the transcriptome all contained highly stable regions of secondary structure the most abundant scrapie only ros sequence was homologous to a repetitive transposable element line long interspersed nuclear element  other ros sequences identified cellular rna sl clathrin heavy chain visinin like protein  and three highly specific subregions of ribosomal rna ros    the ribosomal ros sequences accurately corresponded to line retrotransposon insertion sites in ribosomal dna p lt    these differential motifs implicate specific host rnas in the pathoetiology of the tses
