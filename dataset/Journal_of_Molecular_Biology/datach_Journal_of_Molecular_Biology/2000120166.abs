a core promoter region functions bi directionally for human opioid receptor like gene orl and its   adjacent gene gaip edited by m yaniv
we report the genomic structure and functional activities of the promoter regions of the human opioid receptor like gene orl and its   adjacent gene gaip g alpha interacting protein  the transcription and alternative splicing of human orl are controlled by two alternate promoters located approximately  kb apart the two promoter regions lack a tata box and are gc rich promoter a initiates from a single transcription start point tsp  two transcripts one consisting of exons a  b   etc  the other without exon b a potential atg codon upstream of the initiation codon of orl starts a new open reading frame encoding a theoretical polypeptide of   amino acid residues the promoter b transcribes from multiple tsps only one mrna starting with exon b two different repeat sequence polymorphisms are found in the orl promoter regions luciferase reporter gene assays with promoter regions and a series of deletion mutants have mapped the core promoter a and b within two short fragments dna sequencing and a database search reveal that the human gaip gene is located upstream of orl and is oriented in the opposite direction the transcription and alternative splicing of gaip are also under the control of alternate promoters the first exons of orl and gaip are separated by only  bp this  bp fragment together with short surrounding sequences from both first exons functions bi directionally as a core promoter for both genes the transcription and alternative splicing of human orl and gaip are cell type specific while gaip is expressed in both nt precursor cells and differentiated nt neuronal cells orl is only expressed in differentiated nt neurons since orl is a g protein coupled receptor and gaip interacts with g protein  subunits their physical linkage in the genome and co operative transcriptional regulation may play a significant role in orl receptor signal transduction
