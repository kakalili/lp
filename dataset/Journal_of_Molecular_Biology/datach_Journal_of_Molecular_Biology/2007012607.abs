stabilizing i b  by  consensus  design
i b  is the major regulator of transcription factor nf  b function the ankyrin repeat region of i b  mediates specific interactions with nf  b dimers but ankyrin repeats   and  display a highly dynamic character when not in complex with nf  b using chemical denaturation we show here that i b  displays two folding transitions a non cooperative conversion under weak perturbation and a major cooperative folding phase upon stronger insult taking advantage of a native trp residue in ankyrin repeat ar  and engineered trp residues in ar  ar and ar  we show that the cooperative transition involves ar and ar  while the non cooperative transition involves ar and ar  the major structural transition can be affected by single amino acid substitutions converging to the  consensus  ankyrin repeat sequence increasing the native state stability significantly we further characterized the structural and dynamic properties of the native state ensemble of i b  and the stabilized mutants by h h exchange mass spectrometry and nmr the solution experiments were complemented with molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the microscopic origins of the stabilizing effect of the consensus substitutions which can be traced to the fast conformational dynamics of the folded ensemble
