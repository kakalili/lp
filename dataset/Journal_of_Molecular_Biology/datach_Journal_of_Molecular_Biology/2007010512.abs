site directed mutagenesis in the fingers subdomain of hiv  reverse transcriptase reveals a specific role for the      hairpin loop in dntp selection
hiv  reverse transcriptase shares the key features of high fidelity polymerases such as a closed architecture of the active site but displays a level of fidelity that is intermediate to that of high fidelity replicative polymerases and low fidelity translesion synthesis tls polymerases the      loop of the hiv  rt fingers subdomain makes transient contacts with the dntp and template base to investigate the role of active site architecture in hiv  rt fidelity we truncated the      loop eliminating contact between lys  and the  phosphate of dntp the mutant in a manner reminiscent of tls polymerases was only able to incorporate a nucleotide that was capable of base pairing with the template nucleotide but not a nucleotide shape analog incapable of watson  crick hydrogen bonding unexpectedly however the deletion mutant differed from the tls polymerases in that it displayed an increased fidelity the increased fidelity was associated with reduced dntp binding affinity as measured using the dead end complex formation in an effort to delineate the specific amino acid residue in the deleted segment responsible for this phenotype we examined the k  residue two substitution mutants k r and k a were studied the k a mutant behaved similarly to the deletion mutant displaying dependence on watson  crick hydrogen bonding increased fidelity and reduced dntp binding while the k r was more akin to wild type enzyme these results underscore the key role of the k  residue in the phenotype observed in the deletion mutant based on the well known electrostatic interaction between k  and the  phosphate moiety of incoming dntp substrate in the ternary complex structure of hiv  rt we conclude that non discriminatory interactions between      loop and the dntp in wild type hiv  rt help lower dntp selectivity our results show that the fidelity of dntp insertion is influenced by protein interactions with the triphosphate moiety
