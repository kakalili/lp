acidic conditions stabilise intermediates populated during the folding of im and im  edited by c r matthews
the helical bacterial immunity proteins im and im have been shown to fold via kinetic mechanisms of differing complexity despite having   sequence identity at ph   and   c im folds in a three state mechanism involving an on pathway intermediate while im folds in an apparent two state transition in order to examine the folding mechanisms of these proteins in more detail the folding kinetics of both im and im  at   c in   m sodium sulphate have been examined as a function of ph kinetic modelling of the folding and unfolding data for im between ph   and   shows that the on pathway intermediate is stabilised by more acidic conditions whilst the native state is destabilised the opposing effect of ph on the stability of these states results in a significant population of the intermediate at equilibrium at ph   and below at ph   the folding and unfolding kinetics for im can be fitted adequately by a two state model in accord with previous results however under acidic conditions there is a clear change of slope in the plot of the logarithm of the folding rate constant versus denaturant concentration consistent with the population of one or more intermediate s early during folding the kinetic data for im at these ph values can be fitted to a three state model where the intermediate ensemble is stabilised and the native state destabilised as the ph is reduced rationalising previous results that showed that an intermediate is not observed experimentally at ph   the data suggest that intermediate formation is a general step in immunity protein folding and demonstrate that it is necessary to explore a wide range of refolding conditions in order to show that intermediates do not form in the folding of other small single domain proteins
