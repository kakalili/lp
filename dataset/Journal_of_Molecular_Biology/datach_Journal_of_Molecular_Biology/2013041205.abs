biophysical characterization of two different stable misfolded monomeric polypeptides that are chaperone amenable substrates
misfolded polypeptide monomers may be regarded as the initial species of many protein aggregation pathways which could accordingly serve as primary targets for molecular chaperones it is therefore of paramount importance to study the cellular mechanisms that can prevent misfolded monomers from entering the toxic aggregation pathway and moreover rehabilitate them into active proteins here we produced two stable misfolded monomers of luciferase and rhodanese which we found to be differently processed by the hsp  chaperone machinery and whose conformational properties were investigated by biophysical approaches in spite of their monomeric nature they displayed enhanced thioflavin t fluorescence non native  sheets and tertiary structures with surface accessible hydrophobic patches but differed in their conformational stability and aggregation propensity interestingly minor structural differences between the two misfolded species could account for their markedly different behavior in chaperone mediated unfolding refolding assays indeed only a single dnak molecule was sufficient to unfold by direct clamping a misfolded luciferase monomer while by contrast several dnak molecules were necessary to unfold the more resistant misfolded rhodanese monomer by a combination of direct clamping and cooperative entropic pulling
