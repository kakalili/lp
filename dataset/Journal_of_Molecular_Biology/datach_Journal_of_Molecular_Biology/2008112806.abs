the polybasic n terminal region of the prion protein controls the physical properties of both the cellular and fibrillar forms of prp
individual variations in structure and morphology of amyloid fibrils produced from a single polypeptide are likely to underlie the molecular origin of prion strains and control the efficiency of the species barrier in the transmission of prions previously we observed that the shape of amyloid fibrils produced from full length prion protein prp      varied substantially for different batches of purified recombinant prp variations in fibril morphology were also observed for different fractions that corresponded to the highly pure prp peak collected at the last step of purification a series of biochemical experiments revealed that the variation in fibril morphology was attributable to the presence of miniscule amounts of n terminally truncated prps where a prp encompassing residue     was the most abundant of the truncated polypeptides subsequent experiments showed that the presence of small amounts of recombinant prp           in mixtures with full length prp     had a dramatic impact on fibril morphology and conformation furthermore the deletion of the short polybasic n terminal region     was found to reduce the folding efficiency to the native  helical forms and the conformational stability of  prp these findings are very surprising considering that residues     are very distant from the c terminal globular folded domain in  prp and from the prion folding domain in the fibrillar form however our studies suggest that the n terminal polybasic region     is essential for effective folding of prp to its native cellular conformation this work also suggests that this region could regulate diversity of prion strains or subtypes despite its remote location from the prion folding domain
