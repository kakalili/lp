calibrating sickle cell disease
sickle cell disease is fundamentally a kinetic disorder in which cells containing the mutated hemoglobin hemoglobin s hbs will cause occlusion if they sickle in the microvasculature but have minimal or no consequences if they sickle in the venous return physiologically sickling always occurs when some ligands are present nonetheless the kinetics in the presence of ligands are virtually unstudied sickling arises from nucleation controlled polymer formation triggered when the hbs loses ligands e g  oxygen  thus understanding how nucleation responds to the presence of oxygen is the key to understanding how sickling proceeds in a physiological context we have measured the rate of nucleus formation in hbs partially liganded with no or co which we find have equivalent effects in reducing the nucleation rates we find that hemoglobin must be in the t tense quaternary structure for nucleation but the presence of ligands inhibits nucleus formation even when the correct quaternary structure is present from these results we can predict the fraction of cells that will sickle at any given partial ligand saturations the ability to make such predictions may prove especially useful in designing future therapies particularly those where the oxygen affinity is perturbed
