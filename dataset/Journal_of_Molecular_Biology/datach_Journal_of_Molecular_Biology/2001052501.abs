computer assisted identification of cell cycle related genes new targets for e f transcription factors edited by j karn
the processes that take place during development and differentiation are directed through coordinated regulation of expression of a large number of genes one such gene regulatory network provides cell cycle control in eukaryotic organisms in this work we have studied the structural features of the   regulatory regions of cell cycle related genes we developed a new method for identifying composite substructures modules in regulatory regions of genes consisting of a binding site for a key transcription factor and additional contextual motifs potential targets for other transcription factors that may synergistically regulate gene transcription applying this method to cell cycle related promoters we created a program for context specific identification of binding sites for transcription factors of the e f family which are key regulators of the cell cycle we found that e f composite modules are found at a high frequency and in close proximity to the start of transcription in cell cycle related promoters in comparison with other promoters using this information we then searched for e f sites in genomic sequences with the goal of identifying new genes which play important roles in controlling cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay we then experimentally verified the binding of e f in vivo to the promoters predicted by the computer assisted methods our identification of new e f target genes provides new insight into gene regulatory networks and provides a framework for continued analysis of the role of contextual promoter features in transcriptional regulation the tools described are available at http  compel bionet nsc ru funsite sitescan html
