detection and characterization of the in vitro e ligase activity of the human mid protein
human mid  midline  is a microtubule associated protein that is postulated to target the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase a for degradation it binds alpha that then recruits the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase a as a member of the trim tripartite motif family mid has three consecutive zinc binding domains  ring really interesting new gene  bbox  and bbox  that have similar    folds here we describe the in vitro characterization of these domains individually and in tandem we observed that the ring domain exhibited greater ubiquitin ub e ligase activity compared to the bbox domains the amount of autopolyubiquitinated products with ring  bbox and ring  bbox  bbox domains in tandem was significantly greater than those of the individual domains however no polyubiquitinated products were observed for the bbox  bbox domains in tandem using mutants of ub we observed that these mid domain constructs facilitate ub chain elongation via lys  of ub in addition we observed that the high molecular weight protein products were primarily due to polyubiquitination at one site lys   on the bbox domain of the ring  bbox and ring  bbox  bbox constructs we observed that mid e domains could interact with multiple e conjugating enzymes lastly a  amino acid peptide derived from the c terminus of alpha that binds tightly to bbox was observed to be monoubiquitinated in the assay and appears to down regulate the amount of polyubiquitinated products formed these studies shed light on mid e ligase activity and show how its three zinc binding domains can contribute to mid s overall function
