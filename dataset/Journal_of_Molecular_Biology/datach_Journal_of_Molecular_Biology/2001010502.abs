concerted kinetic folding of a multidomain ribozyme with a disrupted loop receptor interaction edited by d e draper
the free energy landscape for the folding of large multidomain rnas is rugged and kinetically trapped misfolded intermediates are a hallmark of rna folding reactions here we examine the role of a native loop receptor interaction in determining the ruggedness of the energy landscape for folding of the tetrahymena ribozyme we demonstrate a progressive smoothing of the energy landscape for ribozyme folding as the strength of the loop receptor interaction is reduced remarkably with the most severe mutation global folding is more rapid than for the wild type ribozyme and proceeds in a concerted fashion without the accumulation of long lived kinetic intermediates the results demonstrate that a complex interplay between native tertiary interactions divalent ion concentration and non native secondary structure determines the ruggedness of the energy landscape furthermore the results suggest that kinetic folding transitions involving large regions of highly structured rnas can proceed in a concerted fashion in the absence of significant stable preorganized tertiary structure
