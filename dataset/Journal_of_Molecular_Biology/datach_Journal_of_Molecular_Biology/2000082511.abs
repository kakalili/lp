identification of residues involved in the specificity and regulation of the highly efficient multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase from drosophila melanogaster edited by a r fersht
in contrast to all known deoxyribonucleoside kinases a single highly efficient deoxyribonucleoside kinase from drosophila melanogaster dm dnk is able to phosphorylate all precursor nucleosides for dna synthesis dm dnk was mutated in vitro by high frequency random mutagenesis expressed in the thymidine kinase deficient escherichia coli strain ky  and clones were selected for sensitivity to the nucleoside analogs  beta d arabinofuranosylcytosine arac cytarabine    azido      dideoxythymidine azt zidovudine retrovir        dideoxyadenosine dda and      dideoxycytidine ddc zalcitabine hivid   thirteen mutants with increased sensitivity compared to the wild type dm dnk were isolated from a relatively small pool of less than    clones eight mutant dm dnks increased the sensitivity of ky  to more than one analog and two of these mutants even to all four nucleoside analogs surprisingly the mutations did not map to the five regions which are highly conserved among deoxyribonucleoside kinases the molecular background of improved sensitivity was characterized for the double mutant mud n d n d  where the ld  value of transformed ky  decreased   fold for azt and more than  fold for ddc when compared to wild type dm dnk purified recombinant mud displayed higher km values for the native substrates than wild type dm dnk and the vmax values were substantially lower on the other hand the km and vmax values for azt and the km value for ddc were nearly unchanged between mud and wild type dm dnk additionally a decrease in feedback inhibition of mud by thymidine triphosphate ttp was found this study demonstrates how high frequency mutagenesis combined with a parallel selection for desired properties provides an insight into the structure function relationships of the multisubstrate kinase from d melanogaster at the same time these mutant enzymes exhibit properties useful in biotechnological and medical applications
