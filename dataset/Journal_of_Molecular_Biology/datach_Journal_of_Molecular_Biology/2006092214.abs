improving the stability of an antibody variable fragment by a combination of knowledge based approaches validation and mechanisms
numerous approaches have been described to obtain variable fragments of antibodies fv or scfv that are sufficiently stable for their applications here we combined several knowledge based methods to increase the stability of pre existing scfvs by design firstly the consensus sequence approach was used in a non stringent way to predict a large basic set of potentially stabilizing mutations these mutations were then prioritized by other methods of design mainly the formation of additional hydrogen bonds an increase in the hydrophilicity of solvent exposed residues and previously described mutations in other antibodies we validated this combined method with antibody mabd   directed against lysozyme fourteen potentially stabilizing mutations were designed and introduced into scfvd  by site directed mutagenesis either individually or in combinations we characterized the effects of the mutations on the thermodynamic stability of scfvd  by experiments of unfolding with urea monitored by spectrofluorometry and tested the additivity of their effects by double mutant cycles we also quantified the individual contributions of the resistance to denaturation  urea   and cooperativity of unfolding m to the variations of stability and the energy of coupling between mutations by a novel approach most mutations    were stabilizing and none was destabilizing the progressive recombination of the mutations into the same molecule of scfvd  showed that their effects were mostly additive or synergistic provided a large overall increase in protein stability    kcal mol  and resulted in a highly stable scfvd  derivative the mechanisms of the mutations and of their combinations involved variations in the resistance to denaturation cooperativity of unfolding and likely residual structures of the denatured state which was constrained by two disulfide bonds this combined method should be applicable to any recombinant antibody fragment through a single step of mutagenesis
