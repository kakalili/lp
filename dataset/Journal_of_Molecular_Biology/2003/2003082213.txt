To investigate the codon dependence of human eRF1 binding to the mRNA–ribosome complex, we examined the formation of photocrosslinks between ribosomal components and mRNAs bearing a photoactivable 4-thiouridine probe in the first position of the codon located in the A site. Addition of eRF1 to the phased mRNA–ribosome complexes triggers a codon-dependent quenching of crosslink formation. The concentration of eRF1 triggering half quenching ranges from low for the three stop codons, to intermediate for s4UGG and high for other near-cognate triplets. A theoretical analysis of the photochemical processes occurring in a two-state bimolecular model raises a number of stringent conditions, fulfilled by the system studied here, and shows that in any case sound KD values can be extracted if the ratio mT/KD≪1 (mT is total concentration of mRNA added). Considering the KD values obtained for the stop, s4UGG and sense codons (≈0.06 μM, 0.45 μM and 2.3 μM, respectively) and our previous finding that only the stop and s4UGG codons are able to promote formation of an eRF1–mRNA crosslink, implying a role for the NIKS loop at the tip of the N domain, we propose a two-step model for eRF1 binding to the A site: a codon-independent bimolecular step is followed by an isomerisation step observed solely with stop and s4UGG codons. Full recognition of the stop codons by the N domain of eRF1 triggers a rearrangement of bound eRF1 from an open to a closed conformation, allowing the universally conserved GGQ loop at the tip of the M domain to come into close proximity of the peptidyl transferase center of the ribosome. UGG is expected to behave as a cryptic stop codon, which, owing to imperfect eRF1-codon recognition, does not allow full reorientation of the M domain of eRF1. As far as the physical steps of eRF1 binding to the ribosome are considered, they appear to closely mimic the behaviour of the tRNA/EF-Tu/GTP complex, but clearly eRF1 is endowed with a greater conformational flexibility than tRNA.
