the bacterial protein  translocation complex secyeg dimers associate with one or two seca molecules
in bacteria the sec protein transport complex facilitates the passage of most secretory and membrane proteins across and into the plasma membrane the core complex secyeg forms the protein channel and engages either ribosomes or the atpase seca which drive translocation of unfolded polypeptide chains through the complex and into the periplasmic space escherichia coli secyeg forms dimers in membranes but in detergent solution the population of these dimers is low however we find that stable dimers can be assembled by the addition of a monoclonal antibody normally a stable secyeg  seca complex can only form on isolated membranes or on reconstituted proteo liposomes the antibody stabilised secyeg dimer binds one seca molecule in detergent solution in the presence of amppnp a non hydrolysable analogue of atp a complex forms containing one antibody and two each of secyeg and seca secyeg monomers or tetramers do not associate to a significant degree with seca the observed variability in the stoichiometry of secyeg and seca association and its nucleotide modulation may be important and necessary for the protein translocation reaction
