pathways and intermediates of amyloid fibril formation
the lack of understanding of amyloid fibril formation at the molecular level is a major obstacle in devising strategies to interfere with the pathologies linked to peptide or protein aggregation in particular little is known on the role of intermediates and fibril elongation pathways as well as their dependence on the intrinsic tendency of a polypeptide chain to self assembly by  sheet formation   aggregation propensity  here coarse grained simulations of an amphipathic polypeptide show that a decrease in the  aggregation propensity results in a larger heterogeneity of elongation pathways despite the essentially identical structure of the final fibril protofibrillar intermediates that are thinner shorter and less structured than the final fibril accumulate along some of these pathways moreover the templated formation of an additional protofilament on the lateral surface of a protofibril is sometimes observed as a collective transition conversely for a polypeptide model with a high  aggregation propensity elongation proceeds without protofibrillar intermediates therefore changes in intrinsic  aggregation propensity modulate the relative accessibility of parallel routes of aggregation
