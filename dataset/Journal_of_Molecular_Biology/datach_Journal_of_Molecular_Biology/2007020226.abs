evidence for the location of the allosteric activation switch in the multisubunit phosphorylase kinase complex from mass spectrometric identification of chemically crosslinked peptides
phosphorylase kinase phk  an       complex regulates glycogenolysis its activity catalyzed by the  subunit is tightly controlled by phosphorylation and activators acting through allosteric sites on its regulatory    and  subunits activation by phosphorylation is predominantly mediated by the regulatory  subunit which undergoes a conformational change that is structurally linked with the  subunit and that is characterized by the ability of a short chemical crosslinker to form    dimers to determine potential regions of interaction of the  and  subunits we have used chemical crosslinking and two hybrid screening the  and  subunits were crosslinked to each other in phosphorylated phk and crosslinked peptides from digests were identified by fourier transform mass spectrometry beginning with a search engine developed  in house  that generates a hypothetical list of crosslinked peptides a conjugate between  and  that was verified by ms ms corresponded to crosslinking between k  in the c terminal regulatory domain of    crd and r  in the n terminal regulatory region of        which contains the phosphorylatable serines  and   a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues    of  inhibited the crosslinking between  and   and was itself crosslinked to k  of   in two hybrid screening the     region controlled  subunit self interactions in that they were favored by truncation of this region or by mutation of the phosphorylatable serines  and   thus providing structural evidence for a phosphorylation dependent subunit communication network in the phk complex involving at least these two regulatory regions of the  and  subunits the sum of our results considered together with previous findings implicates the  crd as being an allosteric activation switch in phk that interacts with all three of the enzyme s regulatory subunits and is proximal to the active site cleft
