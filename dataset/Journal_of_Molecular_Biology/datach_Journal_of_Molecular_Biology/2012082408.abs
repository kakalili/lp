amphiphilic adsorption of human islet amyloid polypeptide aggregates to lipid aqueous interfaces
many amyloid proteins misfold into  sheet aggregates upon interacting with biomembranes at the onset of diseases such as parkinson s disease and type ii diabetes the molecular mechanisms triggering aggregation depend on the orientation of  sheets at the cell membranes however understanding how  sheets adsorb onto lipid aqueous interfaces is challenging here we combine chiral sum frequency generation sfg spectroscopy and ab initio quantum chemistry calculations based on a divide and conquer strategy to characterize the orientation of human islet amyloid polypeptides hiapps at lipid aqueous interfaces we show that the aggregates bind with  strands oriented at   relative to the interface this orientation reflects the amphiphilic properties of hiapp  sheet aggregates and suggests the potential disruptive effect on membrane integrity
