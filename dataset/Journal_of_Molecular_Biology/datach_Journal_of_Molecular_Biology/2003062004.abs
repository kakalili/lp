crystal structure of the type ii isopentenyl diphosphate dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase from bacillus subtilis
two types of isopentenyl diphosphate dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerases idi have been characterized at present the long known idi  is only dependent on divalent metals for activity whereas idi  requires a metal fmn and nadph here we report the first structure of an idi  from bacillus subtilis at    resolution in the ligand free form and of the fmn bound form at    resolution the enzyme is an octamer that forms a d symmetrical open cage like structure the monomers of  kda display a classical tim barrel fold fmn is bound only with very moderate affinity and is therefore completely lost during purification however the enzyme can be reconstituted in the crystals by soaking with fmn three glycine rich sequence stretches that are characteristic for idi  participate in fmn binding within the interior of the cage regions harboring strictly conserved residues that are implicated in substrate binding or catalysis remain largely disordered even in the presence of fmn
