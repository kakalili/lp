sequence variability analysis of human class i and class ii mhc molecules functional and structural correlates of amino acid polymorphisms
major histocompatibility complex class i mhci and class ii mhcii molecules display peptides on antigen presenting cell surfaces for subsequent t cell recognition within the human population allelic variation among the classical mhci and ii gene products is the basis for differential peptide binding thymic repertoire bias and allograft rejection while available d structural analysis suggests that polymorphisms are found primarily within the peptide binding site a broader informatic approach pinpointing functional polymorphisms relevant for immune recognition is currently lacking to this end we have now analyzed known human class i    and class ii    alleles at each amino acid position using a variability metric v  polymorphisms v gt  have been identified in residues that contact the peptide and or t cell receptor tcr  using sequence logos to investigate tcr contact sites on hla molecules we have identified conserved mhci residues distinct from those of conserved mhcii residues in addition specific class ii hla dp  dq  dr and class i hla a  b  c contacts for tcr binding are revealed we discuss these findings in the context of tcr restriction and alloreactivity
