rapid cooperative two state folding of a miniature     protein and design of a thermostable variant
there is a great deal of interest in developing small stably folded miniature proteins a limited number of these molecules have been described however they typically have not been characterized in depth in particular almost no detailed studies of the thermodynamics and folding kinetics of these proteins have been reported here we describe detailed studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of folding of a  residue mixed     protein ntl     derived from the n terminal domain of the ribosomal protein l  the protein folds cooperatively and rapidly in a two state fashion to a native state typical of those found for normal globular proteins at ph   in  mm sodium acetate   mm nacl the temperature of maximum stability is  c the tm is    c  h  tm is between   kcalmol   and   kcalmol   and  cp  is   kcalmol  deg   the thermodynamic parameters are in the range expected on the basis of per residue values determined from databases of globular proteins h h exchange measurements reveal a set of amides that exchange via global unfolding exactly as expected for a normal cooperatively folded globular protein kinetic measurements show that folding is two state folding the folding rate is  s   and the value of  g  calculated from the folding and unfolding rates is in excellent agreement with the equilibrium value a designed thermostable variant generated by mutating k  to m was characterized and found to have a tm of   c equilibrium and kinetic measurements demonstrate that its folding is cooperative and two state
