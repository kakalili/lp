structure of the blm    s proteasome complex by cryo electron microscopy insights into the mechanism of activation of mature yeast proteasomes
the  s proteasome is regulated at multiple levels including association with endogenous activators two activators have been described for the yeast  s proteasome the  s regulatory particle and the blm  protein the sequence of blm  is   identical to the mammalian pa  protein recent studies have shown that the sequences of blm  and pa  each contain multiple heat repeats and that each binds to the ends of mature proteasomes suggesting a common structural and biochemical function in order to advance structural studies we have developed an efficient purification method that produces high yields of stoichiometric blm   mature yeast  s proteasome complexes and we constructed a three dimensional  d model of the blm    s complex from cryo electron microscopy images this reconstruction shows that blm  binds in a defined orientation to both ends of the  s particle and contacts all the proteasome  subunits blm  displays the solenoid folding predicted by the presence of multiple heat like repeats and the axial gates on the  rings of the proteasome appear to be open in the complex we also performed a genetic analysis in an effort to identify the physiological role of blm  these experiments however did not reveal a robust phenotype upon gene deletion overexpression or in a screen for synthetic effects this leaves the physiological role of blm  unresolved but challenges earlier findings of a role in dna repair
