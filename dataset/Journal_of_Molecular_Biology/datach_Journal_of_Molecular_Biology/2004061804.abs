a biophysical characterisation of factors controlling dimerisation and selectivity in the nf  b and nfat families
the rel nf  b family of eukaryotic transcription factors bind dna with high specificity and affinity as homo or heterodimers to mediate a diverse range of biological processes by comparison the nuclear factor of activated t cells nfat family has been recognised as rel homologues due to structural similarities between the dna binding domains yet they bind dna as lower affinity monomers the structural and functional overlap between the nf  b and nfat families suggests that they may be evolutionarily divergent from a common monomeric ancestor but have evolved different mechanisms to achieve high affinity binding to their target dna sequences in order to understand the origin of these mechanistic differences we constructed two chimeric proteins based on molecular modelling comprising the dna binding domain of nfat and the dimerisation domain of nf  b p  differing only in the position of the splice site biophysical characterisation of the wild type and chimeric proteins revealed that one of the chimeras bound dna as a high affinity nf  b like cooperative dimer whilst the other bound as a lower affinity nfat like monomer demonstrating the importance of the interdomain linker in controlling the intrinsic ability of nfatc to form dimers in addition we have studied the rate of exchange of monomers between preformed nf  b dimers and have determined for the first time the intrinsic homodimerisation constant for nf  b p  these data support a model in which nf  b proteins bind dna both in vitro and in vivo as high affinity preformed homo or heterodimers which in an unbound form can still exchange monomer units on a physiologically relevant timescale in vivo
