structures of the human eif e homologous protein h ehp in its m gtp bound and unliganded forms
all eukaryotic cellular mrnas contain a   m gpppn cap in addition to conferring stability to the mrna the cap is required for pre mrna splicing nuclear export and translation by providing an anchor point for protein binding in translation the interaction between the cap and the eukaryotic initiation factor e eif e is important in the recruitment of the mrnas to the ribosome human ehp h ehp is a homologue of eif e like eif e it is able to bind the cap but it appears to play a different cellular role possibly being involved in the fine tuning of protein expression levels here we use x ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry itc to investigate further the binding of cap analogues and peptides to h ehp m gtp binds to ehp   fold more weakly than it does to eif e with the guanine base sandwiched by a tyrosine and a tryptophan instead of two tryptophan residues as seen in eif e the tyrosine resides on a loop that is longer in h ehp than in eif e the consequent conformational difference between the proteins allows the tyrosine to mimic the six membered ring of the tryptophan in eif e and adopt an orientation that is similar to that seen for equivalent residues in other non homologous cap binding proteins in the absence of ligand the binding site is incompletely formed with one of the aromatic residues being disordered and the side chain of the other adopting a novel conformation a peptide derived from the eif e inhibitory protein  e bp binds h ehp   fold less strongly than eif e but in a similar manner overall the data combined with sequence analyses of ehp from evolutionary diverse species strongly support the hypothesis that ehp plays a physiological role utilizing both cap binding and protein binding functions but which is distinct from eif e
