solution structure of an archaeal rnase p binary protein complex formation of the  kda complex between pyrococcus furiosus rpp  and rpp  is accompanied by coupled protein folding and highlights critical features for protein  protein and protein  rna interactions
ribonuclease p rnase p is a ribonucleoprotein rnp enzyme that catalyzes the mg  dependent   maturation of precursor trnas in all domains of life it is a ribozyme the rnase p rna rpr component has been demonstrated to be responsible for catalysis however the number of rnase p protein subunits rpps varies from  in bacteria to  or  in eukarya the archaeal rpr is associated with at least  rpps which function in pairs rpp   rpp  and rpp   pop  we used solution nmr spectroscopy to determine the three dimensional structure of the protein  protein complex comprising pyrococcus furiosus rpp  and rpp  we found that the protein  protein interaction is characterized by coupled folding of secondary structural elements that participate in interface formation in addition to detailing the intermolecular contacts that stabilize this  kda binary complex the structure identifies surfaces rich in conserved basic residues likely vital for recognition of the rpr and or precursor trna furthermore enzymatic footprinting experiments allowed us to localize the rpp   rpp  complex to the specificity domain of the rpr these findings provide valuable new insights into mechanisms of rnp assembly and serve as important steps towards a three dimensional model of this ancient rnp enzyme
