crystal structures of mouse and human rp  md  complexes reveal unique dimer organization of the toll like receptor family
the toll like receptor tlr  md  heterodimer senses lipopolysaccharide lps  rp   radioprotective   kda  a tlr related molecule is similar to tlr in that the extracellular leucine rich repeats associate with md  the md  like molecule md  has a unique hydrophobic cavity that directly binds to lipid a the active center of lps lps bound md  opens the secondary interface with tlr  leading to dimerization of tlr md  md  also has a hydrophobic cavity that accommodates lipid iva a precursor of lipid a suggesting a role for the rp  md  heterodimer in sensing lps or related microbial products little is known however about the structure of the rp  md  heterodimer or its oligomer here we have determined the crystal structures of mouse and human rp  md  complexes at   and     resolutions respectively both mouse and human rp  md  exhibit dimerization of the   rp  md  complex demonstrating a novel organization the  m  shaped   rp  md  complex exhibits an inverse arrangement with n termini interacting in the middle thus the dimerization interface of rp  md  is located on the opposite side of the complex compared to the   tlr md  complex these results demonstrate that the   rp  md  complex is distinct from previously reported tlr dimers including tlr md  tlr tlr  tlr tlr  and tlr  all of which facilitate homotypic or heterotypic interaction of the c terminal cytoplasmic signaling domain
