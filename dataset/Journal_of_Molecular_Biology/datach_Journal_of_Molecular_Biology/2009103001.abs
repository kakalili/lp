a method for helical rna global structure determination in solution using small angle x ray scattering and nmr measurements
we report a  top  down  method that uses mainly duplexes global orientations and overall molecular dimension and shape restraints which were extracted from experimental nmr and small angle x ray scattering data respectively to determine global architectures of rna molecules consisting of mostly a form like duplexes the method is implemented in the g g from global measurement to global structure toolkit of programs we demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the method by determining the global structure of a  nt rna using experimental data the backbone root mean square deviation of the ensemble of the calculated global structures relative to the x ray crystal structure is       using the experimental data and is only       for the three duplexes that were orientation restrained during the calculation the global structure simplifies interpretation of multidimensional nuclear overhauser spectra for high resolution structure determination the potential general application of the method for rna structure determination is discussed
