mechanical measurement of single molecule binding rates kinetics of dna helix destabilization by t gene  protein
bacteriophage t gene  protein gp  is a single stranded dna ssdna binding protein and is essential for dna replication recombination and repair while gp  binds preferentially and cooperatively to ssdna it has not been observed to lower the thermal melting temperature of natural double stranded dna dsdna  however in single molecule stretching experiments gp  significantly destabilizes  dna in this study we develop a theory of the effect of the protein on single dsdna stretching curves and apply it to the measured dependence of the dna overstretching force on pulling rate in the presence of the full length and two truncated forms of the protein this allows us to calculate the rate of cooperative growth of single clusters of protein along ssdna that are formed as the dsdna molecule is stretched as well as determine the site size of the protein binding to ssdna the rate of cooperative binding ka of both gp  and of its proteolytic fragment  i which lacks  residues from the c terminus varies non linearly with protein concentration and appears to exceed the diffusion limit we develop a model of protein association with the ends of growing clusters of cooperatively bound protein enhanced by  d diffusion along dsdna under the condition of protein excess upon globally fitting ka versus protein concentration we determine the binding site size and the non cooperative binding constants to dsdna for gp  and  i our experiment mimics the growth of clusters of gp  that likely exist at the dna replication fork in vivo and explains the origin of the  kinetic block  to dsdna melting by gene  protein observed in thermal melting experiments
