crystal structure of d erythronate  phosphate dehydrogenase complexed with nad
pyridoxal   phosphate the active form of vitamin b  is an essential cofactor in many enzymatic reactions while animals lack any of the pathways for de novo synthesis and salvage of vitamin b  it is synthesized by two distinct biosynthetic routes in bacteria fungi parasites and plants one of them is the pdxa pdxj pathway found in the  subdivision of proteobacteria it depends on the pdxb gene which encodes erythronate  phosphate dehydrogenase pdxb  a member of the d isomer specific  hydroxyacid dehydrogenase superfamily although three dimensional structures of other functionally related dehydrogenases are available no structure of pdxb has been reported to provide the missing structural information and to gain insights into the catalytic mechanism we have determined the first crystal structure of erythronate  phosphate dehydrogenase from pseudomonas aeruginosa in the ligand bound state it is a homodimeric enzyme consisting of   residue subunits each subunit consists of three structural domains the lid domain the nucleotide binding domain and the c terminal dimerization domain the latter domain has a unique fold and is largely responsible for dimerization interestingly two subunits of the dimeric enzyme are bound with different combinations of ligands in the crystal and they display significantly different conformations subunit a is bound with nad and a phosphate ion while subunit b with a more open active site cleft is bound with nad and l  tartrate our structural data allow a detailed understanding of cofactor and substrate recognition thus providing substantial insights into pdxb catalysis
