structure of the food poisoning clostridium perfringens enterotoxin reveals similarity to the aerolysin like pore forming toxins
clostridium perfringens enterotoxin cpe is a major cause of food poisoning and antibiotic associated diarrhea upon its release from c perfringens spores cpe binds to its receptor claudin at the tight junctions between the epithelial cells of the gut wall and subsequently forms pores in the cell membranes a number of different complexes between cpe and claudin have been observed and the process of pore formation has not been fully elucidated we have determined the three dimensional structure of the soluble form of cpe in two crystal forms by x ray crystallography to a resolution of   and     respectively and found that the n terminal domain shows structural homology with the aerolysin like  pore forming family of proteins we show that cpe forms a trimer in both crystal forms and that this trimer is likely to be biologically relevant but is not the active pore form we use these data to discuss models of pore formation
