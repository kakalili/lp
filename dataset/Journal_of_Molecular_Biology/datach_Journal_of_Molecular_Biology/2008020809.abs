assembly of the   and   minor domains of  s ribosomal rna as monitored by tethered probing from ribosomal protein s
the ribosomal protein r protein s  is a primary binding protein as such it interacts directly and independently with the   domain as well as the   minor domain of  s ribosomal rna rrna in minimal particles and the fully assembled  s subunit the interactions observed between r protein s  and the   domain of  s rrna are quite extensive while those between r protein s  and the   minor domain are significantly more limited in this study directed hydroxyl radical probing mediated by fe ii derivatized s  proteins was used to monitor the folding of  s rrna during r protein association and  s subunit assembly an analysis of the cleavage patterns in the minimal complexes  s rrna and fe ii s  and the fully assembled  s subunit containing the same fe ii derivatized proteins shows intriguing similarities and differences these results suggest that the two domains    and   minor are organized relative to s  at different stages of assembly the   domain acquires in a less complex ribonucleoprotein particle than the   minor domain the same architecture as observed in mature subunits these results are similar to what would be predicted of subunit assembly by the   to   direction assembly model
