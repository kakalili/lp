glycosidic bond conformation preference plays a pivotal role in catalysis of rna pseudouridylation a combined simulation and structural study
the most abundant chemical modification on rna is isomerization of uridine or pseudouridylation catalyzed by pseudouridine synthases the catalytic mechanism of this essential process remains largely speculative partly due to lack of knowledge of the pre reactive state that is important to the identification of reactive chemical moieties in the present study we showed using orthogonal space random walk free energy simulation that the pre reactive states of uridine and its reactive derivative  fluorouridine bound to a ribonucleoprotein particle pseudouridine synthase strongly prefer the syn glycosidic bond conformation while that of the nonreactive  bromouridine containing substrate is largely populated in the anti conformation state a high resolution crystal structure of the  bromouridine containing substrate bound to the ribonucleoprotein particle pseudouridine synthase and enzyme activity assay confirmed the anti nonreactive conformation and provided the molecular basis for its confinement the observed preference for the syn pre reactive state by the enzyme bound uridine may help to distinguish among currently proposed mechanisms
