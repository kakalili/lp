activation of p  facilitates the target search in dna by enhancing the target recognition probability
tumor suppressor p  binds to the target in a genome and regulates the expression of downstream genes p  searches for the target by combining three dimensional diffusion and one dimensional sliding along the dna to examine the regulation mechanism of the target binding we constructed the pseudo wild type pseudo wt  activated s  e  and inactive r  q mutants of p  and observed their target binding in long dna using single molecule fluorescence imaging the pseudo wt sliding along the dna showed many pass events over the target and possessed target recognition probability trp of    the trp increased to    for the activated mutant but decreased to  for the inactive mutant furthermore the fraction of the target binding by the one dimensional sliding among the total binding events increased from    for the pseudo wt to    for the activated mutant control of trp upon activation as demonstrated here for p  might be a general activation mechanism of transcription factors
