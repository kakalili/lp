identification of collagen fibril fusion during vertebrate tendon morphogenesis the process relies on unipolar fibrils and is regulated by collagen proteoglycan interaction edited by m f moody
the synthesis of an extracellular matrix containing long   mm in length collagen fibrils is fundamental to the normal morphogenesis of animal tissues in this study we have direct evidence that fibroblasts synthesise transient early fibril intermediates     m in length that interact by tip to tip fusion to generate long fibrils seen in older tissues examination of early collagen fibrils from tendon showed that two types of early fibrils occur unipolar fibrils with carboxyl c and amino n ends and bipolar fibrils with two n ends  end to end fusion requires the c end of a unipolar fibril proteoglycans coated the shafts of the fibrils but not the tips in the absence of proteoglycans the fibrils aggregated by side to side interactions therefore proteoglycans promote tip to tip fusion and inhibit side to side fusion this distribution of proteoglycan along the fibril required co assembly of collagen and proteoglycan prior to fibril assembly the study showed that collagen fibrillogenesis is a hierarchical process that depends on the unique structure of unipolar fibrils and a novel function of proteoglycans
