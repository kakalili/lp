bacillus anthracis lethal toxin represses mmtv promoter activity through transcription factors
we have recently shown that the anthrax lethal toxin letx selectively represses nuclear hormone receptors in this study we found that letx repressed the activation of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter related to overexpression of the transcription factors hepatocyte nuclear factor  octamer binding protein  and c jun letx transcriptional repression was associated with a decrease in the protein levels of these transcription factors in a lethal factor protease activity dependent manner early administration of letx antagonists partially or completely abolished the repressive effects of letx in contrast to the rapid cleavage of mitogen activated protein kinase kinases by letx the degradation of these transcription factors occurred at a relatively late stage after letx treatment in addition letx repressed phorbol  myristate  acetate induced mouse mammary tumor virus promoter activity and phorbol  myristate  acetate induction of endogenous c jun protein collectively these findings suggest that transcription factors are intracellular targets of letx and expand our understanding of the molecular action of letx at a later stage of low dose exposure
