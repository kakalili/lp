high affinity human antibodies from phage displayed synthetic fab libraries with a single framework scaffold
phage displayed synthetic antibody libraries were built on a single human framework by introducing synthetic diversity at solvent exposed positions within the heavy chain complementarity determining regions cdrs  the design strategy of mimicking natural diversity using tailored codons had been validated previously with scfv libraries which produced antibodies that bound to antigen murine vascular endothelial growth factor mvegf  with affinities in the  nm range to improve library performance we constructed monovalent and bivalent antigen binding fragment fab libraries and explored different cdr h diversities by varying the amino acid composition and cdr length a fab with sub nanomolar affinity for mvegf was obtained from a library with cdr h diversity designed to contain all  naturally occurring amino acids we then expanded the library by increasing the variability of cdr h length and using tailored codons that mimicked the amino acid composition of natural cdr h sequences the library was tested against a panel of  protein antigens and high affinity fabs were obtained for most antigens furthermore the heavy chain of an anti mvegf clone was recombined with a library of light chain cdrs and the affinity was improved from low nanomolar to low picomolar the results demonstrated that high affinity human antibodies can be generated from libraries with completely synthetic cdrs displayed on a single scaffold
