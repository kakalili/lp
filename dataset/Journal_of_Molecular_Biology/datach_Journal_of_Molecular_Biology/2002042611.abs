in vivo topography of rap p  dna complex at saccharomyces cerevisiae tef uasrpg during transcriptional regulation
we have analyzed in detail the structure of rap  uasrpg complexes in saccharomyces cerevisiae cells using multi hit kmno  uv and micrococcal nuclease high resolution footprinting three copies of the rap protein are bound to the promoter simultaneously in exponentially growing cells as shown by kmno multi hit footprinting analysis causing extended and diagnostic changes in the dna structure of the region containing the uasrpg amino acid starvation does not cause loss of rap p from the complex however in vivo uv footprinting reveals the occurrence of structural modifications of the complex moreover low resolution micrococcal nuclease digestion shows that the chromatin of the entire region is devoid of positioned nucleosomes but is susceptible to changes in accessibility to the nuclease upon amino acid starvation the implications of these results for the mechanism of rap p action are discussed
