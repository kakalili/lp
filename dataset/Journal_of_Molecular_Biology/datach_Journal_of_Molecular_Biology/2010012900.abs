comparing the functional roles of nonconserved sequence positions in homologous transcription repressors implications for sequence function analyses
the explosion of protein sequences deduced from genetic code has led to both a problem and a potential resource efficient data use requires interpreting the functional impact of sequence change without experimentally characterizing each protein variant several groups have hypothesized that interpretation could be aided by analyzing the sequences of naturally occurring homologues to that end myriad sequence function analyses have been developed to predict which conserved semi conserved and nonconserved positions are functionally important these positions must be discriminated from the nonconserved positions that are functionally silent however the assumptions that underlie sequence analyses are based on experimental results that are sparse and usually designed to address different questions here we use three homologues from a test family common to bioinformatics  the laci galr transcription repressors  to test a common assumption if a position is functionally important for one family member it has similar importance in all homologues we generated experimental sequence function information for each nonconserved position in the  amino acids that link the dna binding and regulatory domains of three laci galr homologues we find that the functional importance of each position is preserved among the three linkers albeit to different degrees we also find that every linker position contributes to function which has twofold implications   since the linker positions range from highly conserved to semi conserved to nonconserved and contribute to affinity selectivity and allosteric response we assert that sequence function analyses must identify positions in the laci galr linkers to be qualified as  successful   many analyses overlook this region since most of the residues do not directly contact ligand   no position in the laci galr linker is functionally silent this finding is inconsistent with another underlying principle of many analyses using sequence sets to discriminate important from non contributing positions obligates silent positions which denotes that most homologues tolerate a variety of amino acid substitutions at the position without functional change instead additional combinatorial mutants in the laci galr linkers show that particular substitutions can be silent in a context dependent manner thus specific permutations of sequence change rather than change at silent positions would facilitate neutral drift during evolution finally the combinatorial mutants also reveal functional synergy between semi and nonconserved positions such functional relationships would be missed by analyses that rely primarily upon co evolution
