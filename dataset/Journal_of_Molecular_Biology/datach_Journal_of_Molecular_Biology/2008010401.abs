the partly folded back solution structure arrangement of the  scr domains in human complement receptor type  cr  permits access to its c b and c b ligands
human complement receptor type  cr  cd  is a type i membrane bound glycoprotein that belongs to the regulators of complement activity rca family the extra cellular component of cr is comprised of  short complement regulator scr domains whereas complement receptor type  cr  has  scr domains and factor h fh has  scr domains the domain arrangement of a soluble form of cr  scr  was studied by x ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation the radius of gyration rg of scr of       nm is not much greater than those for cr and fh and its rg r anisotropy ratio is    compared to ratios of   for fh and   for cr  unlike cr  but similar to fh two cross sectional rg ranges were identified that gave rxs values of      nm and      nm respectively showing that the scr domains adopt a range of conformations including folded back ones the distance distribution function p r showed that the most commonly occurring distance in scr is at    nm its maximum length of   nm is less than double those for cr or fh even though scr has twice the number of scr domains compared to cr sedimentation equilibrium experiments gave a mean molecular weight of   kda for scr  this is consistent with the value of   kda calculated from its composition including  n linked oligosaccharide sites and confirmed that scr is a monomer in solution sedimentation velocity experiments gave a sedimentation coefficient of   s from this the frictional ratio f f  of scr was calculated to be    which is greater than those of   for cr and   for fh the constrained scattering modelling of the scr solution structure starting from homologous scr domain structures generated   trial conformationally randomised models   of which gave good scattering fits to show that scr has a partly folded back structure we conclude that the inter scr linkers show structural features in common with those in fh but differ from those in cr  and the scr arrangement in cr will permit c b or c b to access all three ligand sites
