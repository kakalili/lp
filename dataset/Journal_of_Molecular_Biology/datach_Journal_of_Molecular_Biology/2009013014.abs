mammalian os  is upregulated in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and facilitates ubiquitination of misfolded glycoproteins
proteins that fail to fold or assemble with partner subunits are selectively removed from the endoplasmic reticulum er via the er associated degradation erad pathway proteins selected for erad are polyubiquitinated and retrotranslocated into the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome although it is unclear how proteins are initially identified by the erad system in mammalian cells os  was recently proposed to play a key role in this process here we show that os  is upregulated in response to er stress and is associated both with components of the erad machinery and with erad substrates using rna interference we show that os  is required for efficient ubquitination of glycosylated erad substrates suggesting that it helps transfer misfolded proteins to the ubiquitination machinery we also find that os  binds to a misfolded nonglycosylated protein destined for erad but not to the properly folded wild type protein surprisingly however os  is not required for ubiquitination or degradation of this nonglycosylated erad substrate we propose a model in which os  recognises terminally misfolded proteins via polypeptide based rather than glycan based signals but is only required for transferring those bearing n glycans to the ubiquitination machinery
