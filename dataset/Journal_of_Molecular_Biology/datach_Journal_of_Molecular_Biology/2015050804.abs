translation initiation factor  regulates switching between different modes of ribosomal subunit joining
ribosomal subunit joining is a key checkpoint in the bacterial translation initiation pathway during which initiation factors ifs regulate association of the  s initiation complex ic with the  s subunit to control formation of a  s ic that can enter into the elongation stage of protein synthesis the gtp bound form of if accelerates subunit joining whereas if antagonizes subunit joining and plays a prominent role in maintaining translation initiation fidelity the molecular mechanisms through which if and if collaborate to regulate the efficiency of  s ic formation including how they affect the dynamics of subunit joining remain poorly defined here we use single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer to monitor the interactions between if and the gtpase associated center gac of the  s subunit during real time subunit joining reactions in the absence and presence of if  in the presence of if  if mediated subunit joining becomes reversible and subunit joining events cluster into two distinct classes corresponding to formation of shorter and longer lifetime  s ics inclusion of if within the  s ic was also found to alter the conformation of if relative to the gac suggesting that if s regulatory effects may stem in part from allosteric modulation of if  gac interactions the results are consistent with a model in which if can exert control over the efficiency of subunit joining by modulating the conformation of the  s ic which in turn influences the formation of stabilizing intersubunit contacts and thus the reaction s degree of reversibility
