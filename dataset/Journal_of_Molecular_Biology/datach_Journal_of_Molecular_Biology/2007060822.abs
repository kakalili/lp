structure and analysis of a complex between sumo and ubc illustrates features of a conserved e ubl interaction
the sumo e ubc serves as a lynchpin in the sumo conjugation pathway interacting with the sumo e during activation with thioester linked sumo after e transfer and with the substrate and sumo e ligases during conjugation here we describe the structure determination of a non covalent complex between human ubc and sumo  at     resolution non covalent interactions between ubc and sumo are conserved in human and yeast insomuch as human ubc interacts with each of the human sumo isoforms and yeast ubc interacts with smt  the yeast sumo ortholog structural comparisons reveal similarities to several other non covalent complexes in the ubiquitin pathway suggesting that the non covalent ubc  sumo interface may be important for poly sumo chain formation for e recruitment to sumo conjugated substrates or for mediating e interactions with either e or e ligases biochemical analysis suggests that this surface is less important for e activation or di sumo  formation but more important for e interactions and for poly sumo chain formation when the chain exceeds more than two sumo proteins
