uba domains mediate protein protein interactions between two dna damage inducible proteins edited by m yaniv
the saccharomyces cerevisiae genes rad  and ddi were identified in a screen for multicopy suppressors of the temperature sensitivity of a mutant allele of s cerevisiae pds  pds is a regulator of anaphase that needs to accumulate and then be degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway at the metaphase anaphase transition for cells to progress normally through mitosis both the rad  and ddi pds suppression phenotypes depend on a shared motif known as a uba domain found in a variety of proteins associated with ubiquitin metabolism uba domains were found to be essential for homodimerization of rad  and heterodimerization between rad  and ddi  but not for homodimerization of ddi  this observation coupled with the findings that rad  and ddi uba domains bind ubiquitin and that dimerization of rad  blocks ubiquitin binding suggests a possible mechanism for regulating rad  and ddi function
