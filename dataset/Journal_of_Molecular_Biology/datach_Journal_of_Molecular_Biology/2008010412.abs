improved segmental isotope labeling methods for the nmr study of multidomain or large proteins application to the rrms of npl p and hnrnp l
the study of multidomain or large proteins in solution by nmr spectroscopy has been made possible in recent years by the development of new spectroscopic methods however resonance overlap found in large proteins remains a limiting factor making resonance assignments and structure determination of large proteins very difficult in this study we present an expressed protein ligation protocol that can be used for the segmental isotopic labeling of virtually any multidomain or high molecular mass protein independent of both the folding state and the solubility of the protein fragments as well as independent of whether the fragments are interacting the protocol was applied successfully to two different multidomain proteins containing rna recognition motifs rrms  heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein l and npl p high yields of segmentally labeled proteins could be obtained allowing characterization of the interdomain interactions with nmr spectroscopy we found that the rrms of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein l interact whereas those of npl p are independent subsequently the structures of the two rrms of npl p were determined on the basis of samples in which each rrm was expressed individually the two npl p rrms adopt the expected       fold
