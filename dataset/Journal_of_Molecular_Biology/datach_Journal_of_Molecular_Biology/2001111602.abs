domain structure and subunit interactions in the type i dna methyltransferase m ecor  i edited by j karn
the type ic dna methyltransferase m ecor  i is a trimeric enzyme of   kda consisting of two modification subunits hsdm and a single specificity subunit hsds studies have been largely restricted to the hsdm subunit or to the intact methyltransferase since the hsds subunit is insoluble when over expressed independently of hsdm two soluble fragments of the hsds subunit have been cloned expressed and purified a  kda n terminal fragment s  comprising the n terminal target recognition domain together with the central conserved domain and a   kda fragment s  comprising the central conserved domain alone analytical ultracentrifugation shows that the s subunit exists principally as a dimer of  kda gel retardation and competition assays show that both s and s  are able to bind to hsdm each with a subunit stoichiometry of   the tetrameric complex s hsdm  is required for effective dna binding cooperative binding is observed and at low enzyme concentration the multisubunit complex dissociates leading to a loss of dna binding activity the s hsdm  complex is able to bind to both the ecor  i dna recognition sequence gaan rtcg and a symmetrical dna sequence gaan ttc but has a  fold higher affinity binding for the latter dna sequence exonuclease iii footprinting of the s hsdm  dna complex indicates that  nucleotides are protected on each strand corresponding to a region  bp on both the   and   sides of the recognition sequence bound by the s hsdm  complex
