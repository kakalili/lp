how thioredoxin can reduce a buried disulphide bond
we present a study of the interaction between thioredoxin and the model enzyme pi  arsenate reductase arsc from staphylococcus aureus arsc catalyses the reduction of arsenate to arsenite three redox active cysteine residues cys  cys  and cys  are involved after a single catalytic arsenate reduction event oxidized arsc exposes a disulphide bridge between cys  and cys  on a looped out redox helix thioredoxin converts oxidized arsc back towards its initial reduced state in the absence of a reducing environment the active site p loop of arsc is blocked by the formation of a second disulphide bridge cys   cys   while fully reduced arsc can be recovered by exposing this double oxidized arsc to thioredoxin the p loop disulphide bridge is itself inaccessible to thioredoxin to reduce this buried cys   cys  disulphide bridge in double oxidized arsc an intra molecular cys   cys  disulphide switch connects the thioredoxin mediated inter protein thiol  disulphide transfer to the buried disulphide in the initial step of the reduction mechanism thioredoxin appears to be selective for oxidized arsc that requires the redox helix to be looped out for its interaction the formation of a buried disulphide bridge in the active site might function as protection against irreversible oxidation of the nucleophilic cysteine a characteristic that has also been observed in the structurally similar low molecular weight tyrosine phosphatase
