hiv  nucleocapsid protein as a nucleic acid chaperone spectroscopic study of its helix destabilizing properties structural binding specificity and annealing activity
assembly of infectious retroviral particles involves recognition of specific sequences on the viral rna by the nucleocapsid nc domain of the gag polyprotein and subsequent stoichiometric binding of the processed nc protein along the entire length of the rna nc proteins also act as nucleic acid chaperones they accelerate nucleic acid hybridization and strand exchange which may be critical during the initial stages of reverse transcription in order to better understand these properties we have studied the nucleic acid helix destabilizing tm depressing and binding activities of hiv  ncp protein with a variety of substrates and the real time kinetics of nc induced strand exchange at low ionic strength   m na phosphate ph   and saturating levels of protein ncp displays moderate helix destabilizing activity on double stranded dna saturating levels of ncp lowered the tm of a synthetic  base pair        oligonucleotide duplex by about  deg c   to   c  the presence of single stranded calf thymus dna equimolar with duplex eliminated the tm depression whereas double stranded calf thymus dna only altered the tm of the  mer duplex by about deg c similar effects were seen with duplexes with single stranded overhangs or internal single stranded gaps binding experiments utilizing intrinsic tryptophan quenching indicated significant affinity kd about   m for both single stranded and double stranded forms of the  mer in   m sodium phosphate at   c although long chain calf thymus double stranded dna displayed a much lower affinity the effects of ncp on the kinetics of nucleic acid annealing strand exchange and strand displacement were determined by use of oligonucleotides with end labeled fluorophores serving as donor  acceptor pairs ncp accelerated all these reactions in the strand exchange reaction an imperfect duplex         was reacted with a perfect complement      the kinetics of        annealing in this reaction did not conform to a simple bimolecular model but could be well fit to the sum of two exponential decays addition of stoichiometric levels of ncp increased the rate constants of both components and significantly increased the fraction of exchange associated with the rapid process increasing levels of     also increased the rapid fraction as well as the rapid rate constant this concentration dependence indicates that although the kinetic decays appear biexponential at least one of the steps is bimolecular simple annealing reactions    with     could be fit to single exponential decays and their magnitudes in the presence of ncp were comparable to the rapid step of annealing observed for exchange reactions suggesting that this step is connected with annealing strand dissociation during exchange was monitored by placing the fluorescent acceptor on the     strand the results though complex suggest that the slow step of exchange is largely associated with the dissociation of the shorter oligonucleotide analogous experiments were performed with variants of these oligonucleotides and the results are in line with the            experiments on the basis of an analysis of the effect of increasing levels of     on the formation of the perfect  bp duplex from the imperfect duplex we propose that ncp forms a ternary complex intermediate with imperfect duplex and     and suggest several ways by which such an intermediate would facilitate strand exchange
