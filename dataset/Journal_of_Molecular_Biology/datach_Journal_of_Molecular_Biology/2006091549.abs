structure of t pyrimidine dimer glycosylase in a reduced imine covalent complex with abasic site containing dna
the base excision repair ber pathway for ultraviolet light uv induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers is initiated by dna glycosylases that also possess abasic ap site lyase activity the prototypical enzyme known to catalyze these reactions is the t pyrimidine dimer glycosylase t pdg  the fundamental chemical reactions and the critical amino acids that lead to both glycosyl and phosphodiester bond scission are known catalysis proceeds via a protonated imine covalent intermediate between the  amino group of the n terminal threonine residue and the c   of the deoxyribose sugar of the   pyrimidine at the dimer site this covalent complex can be trapped as an irreversible reduced cross linked dna  protein complex by incubation with a strong reducing agent this active site trapping reaction is equally efficient on dna substrates containing pyrimidine dimers or ap sites herein we report the co crystal structure of t pdg as a reduced covalent complex with an ap site containing duplex oligodeoxynucleotide this high resolution structure reveals essential precatalytic and catalytic features including flipping of the nucleotide opposite the ap site a sharp kink      in the dna at the dimer site and the covalent bond linking the enzyme to the dna superposition of this structure with a previously published co crystal structure of a catalytically incompetent mutant of t pdg with cyclobutane dimer containing dna reveals new insights into the structural requirements and the mechanisms involved in dna bending nucleotide flipping and catalytic reaction
