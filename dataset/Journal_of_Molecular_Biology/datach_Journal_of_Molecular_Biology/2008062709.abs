crystal structures of human  v and  m catechol o methyltransferase
catechol o methyltransferase comt plays important roles in the metabolism of catecholamine neurotransmitters and catechol estrogens the development of comt inhibitors for use in the treatment of parkinson s disease has been aided by crystallographic structures of the rat enzyme however the human and rat proteins have significantly different substrate specificities additionally human comt contains a common valine  methionine polymorphism at position   the methionine protein is less stable than the valine polymorph resulting in decreased enzyme activity and protein levels in vivo here we describe the crystal structures of the  v and  m variants of the soluble form of human comt bound with s adenosylmethionine sam and a substrate analog   dinitrocatechol the polymorphic residue   is located in the      loop buried in a hydrophobic pocket      from the sam binding site the  v and  m structures are very similar overall rmsd of c  atoms between two structures c  rmsd      and the active site residues are superposable in accord with the observation that sam stabilizes  m comt however the methionine side chain is packed more tightly within the polymorphic site and consequently interacts more closely with residues a     and r     than does valine these interactions of the larger methionine result in a    displacement in the backbone structure near residue   which propagates along   and   toward the sam binding site although the overall secondary structures of the human and rat proteins are very similar c  rmsd      several nonconserved residues are present in the sam i m i m c y and catechol  c  v r  m e  k binding sites the human protein also contains three additional solvent exposed cysteine residues c  c   c   that may contribute to intermolecular disulfide bond formation and protein aggregation
