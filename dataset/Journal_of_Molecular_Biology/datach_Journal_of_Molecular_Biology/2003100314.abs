the x ray structure of escherichia coli rraa meng  a protein inhibitor of rna processing
the escherichia coli protein regulator of rnase e activity a rraa has recently been shown to act as a trans acting modulator of rna turnover in bacteria it binds to the essential endonuclease rnase e and inhibits rna processing in vivo and in vitro here we report the    x ray structure of rraa the structure reveals a ring like trimer with a central cavity of approximately   in diameter based on earlier sequence analysis rraa had been identified as a putative s adenosylmethionine  demethylmenaquinone and was annotated as meng however an analysis of the rraa structure shows that the protein lacks the structural motifs usually required for methylases comparison of the observed fold with that of other proteins and domains suggests that the rraa fold is an ancient platform that has been adapted for a wide range of functions an analysis of the amino acid sequence shows that the e coli rraa exhibits an ancient relationship to a family of aldolases
