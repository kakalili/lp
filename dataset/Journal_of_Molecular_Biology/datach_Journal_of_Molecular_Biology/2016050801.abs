meiotic clade aaa atpases protein polymer disassembly machines
meiotic clade aaa atpases atpases associated with diverse cellular activities  which were initially grouped on the basis of phylogenetic classification of their aaa atpase cassette include four relatively well characterized family members vps  spastin katanin and fidgetin these enzymes all function to disassemble specific polymeric protein structures with vps disassembling the escrt iii polymers that are central to the many membrane remodeling activities of the escrt endosomal sorting complexes required for transport pathway and spastin katanin p  and fidgetin affecting multiple aspects of cellular dynamics by severing microtubules they share a common domain architecture that features an n terminal mit microtubule interacting and trafficking domain followed by a single aaa atpase cassette meiotic clade aaa atpases function as hexamers that can cycle between the active assembly and inactive monomers dimers in a regulated process and they appear to disassemble their polymeric substrates by translocating subunits through the central pore of their hexameric ring recent studies with vps have shown that nucleotide induced asymmetry is a requirement for substrate binding to the pore loops and that recruitment to the protein lattice via mit domains also relieves autoinhibition and primes the aaa atpase cassettes for substrate binding the most striking unifying feature of meiotic clade aaa atpases may be their mit domain which is a module that is found in a wide variety of proteins that localize to escrt iii polymers spastin also displays an adjacent microtubule binding sequence and the presence of both escrt iii and microtubule binding elements may underlie the recent findings that the escrt iii disassembly function of vps and the microtubule severing function of spastin as well as potentially katanin and fidgetin are highly coordinated
