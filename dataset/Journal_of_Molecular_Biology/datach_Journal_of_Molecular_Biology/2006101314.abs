multisite promiscuity in the processing of endogenous substrates by human carboxylesterase
human carboxylesterase  hce  is a drug and endobiotic processing serine hydrolase that exhibits relatively broad substrate specificity it has been implicated in a variety of endogenous cholesterol metabolism pathways including the following apparently disparate reactions cholesterol ester hydrolysis ceh  fatty acyl coenzyme a hydrolysis facoah  acyl coenzyme a cholesterol acyltransfer acat  and fatty acyl ethyl ester synthesis faees  the structural basis for the ability of hce to perform these catalytic actions involving large substrates and products has remained unclear here we present four crystal structures of the hce glycoprotein in complexes with the following endogenous substrates or substrate analogues coenzyme a the fatty acid palmitate and the bile acids cholate and taurocholate while the active site of hce was known to be promiscuous and capable of interacting with a variety of chemically distinct ligands these structures reveal that the enzyme contains two additional ligand binding sites and that each site also exhibits relatively non specific ligand binding properties using this multisite promiscuity hce appears structurally capable of assembling several catalytic events depending apparently on the physiological state of the cellular environment these results expand our understanding of enzyme promiscuity and indicate that in the case of hce  multiple non specific sites are employed to perform distinct catalytic actions
