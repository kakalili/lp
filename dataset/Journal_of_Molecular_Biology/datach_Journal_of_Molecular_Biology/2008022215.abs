coronin a stabilizes f actin by bridging adjacent actin protomers and stapling opposite strands of the actin filament
coronins are f actin binding proteins that are involved in concert with arp   aip  and adf cofilin in rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton an understanding of coronin function has been hampered by the absence of any structural data on its interaction with actin using electron microscopy and three dimensional reconstruction we show that coronin a binds to three protomers in f actin simultaneously it bridges subdomain  and subdomain  of two adjacent actin subunits along the same long pitch strand and it staples subdomain  and subdomain  of two actin protomers on different strands such a mode of binding explains how coronin can stabilize actin filaments in vitro in addition we show which residues of f actin may participate in the interaction with coronin a human nebulin and xin as well as salmonella invasion protein a use a similar mechanism to stabilize actin filaments we suggest that the stapling of subdomain  and subdomain  of two actin protomers on different strands is a common mechanism for f actin stabilization utilized by many actin binding proteins that have no homology
