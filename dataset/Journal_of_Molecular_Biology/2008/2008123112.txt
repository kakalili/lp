Long-range cis elements are critical regulators of transcription, particularly for clustered paralogous genes. Such are the five PADI genes in 1p35–36 encoding peptidylarginine deiminases, which catalyze deimination, a Ca2+-dependent post-translational modification. Deimination has been implicated in the pathophysiology of severe human diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The PADI genes present different expression patterns. PADI1–3 are expressed in the epidermis, with increased expression levels in the most differentiated keratinocytes. Previous studies on PADI proximal promoters failed to explain such specificity of expression. We identified a conserved intergenic sequence in the PADI locus (IG1), which may play a role in PADI transcriptional regulation. In this work, we identified two DNase I·hypersensitive sites located in IG1, PAD intergenic enhancer segment 1 (PIE-S1) and PIE-S2, which act in synergy as a bipartite enhancer of the PADI3 and probably PADI1 promoters in normal human epidermal keratinocytes differentiated by a high-calcium-containing medium (1.5 mM). PIE-S1 and PIE-S2 present all the hallmarks of transcriptional enhancers: orientation-independence, copy-number dependence and cell-type specificity. PIE-S1 and PIE-S2 comprise conserved putative binding sites for MIBP1/RFX1 and activator protein 1, respectively. Deletion mutant screening revealed that these sites are crucial for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays evidenced differential binding of JunD or c-Jun on the activator protein 1 site depending on the cell differentiation state. Our results reveal the molecular bases of the expression specificity of PADI1 and PADI3 during keratinocyte differentiation through a long-range enhancer and support a model of PADI gene regulation depending on c-Jun–JunD competition.
