crystal structure of trimestatin a disintegrin containing a cell adhesion recognition motif rgd
disintegrins are a family of small proteins containing an arg gly asp rgd sequence motif that binds specifically to integrin receptors since the integrin is known to serve as the final common pathway leading to aggregation via formation of platelet  platelet bridges disintegrins act as fibrinogen receptor antagonists here we report the first crystal structure of a disintegrin trimestatin found in snake venom the structure of trimestatin at    resolution reveals that a number of turns and loops form a rigid core stabilized by six disulfide bonds electron densities of the rgd sequence are visible clearly at the tip of a hairpin loop in such a manner that the arg and asp side chains point in opposite directions a docking model using the crystal structure of integrin  v  suggests that the arg binds to the propeller domain and asp to the  a domain this model indicates that the c terminal region is another potential binding site with integrin receptors in addition to the rgd sequence the structural evidence of a c terminal region arg  trp  and asn  important for disintegrin activity allows understanding of the high affinity and selectiveness of snake venom disintegrin for integrin receptors the crystal structure of trimestatin should provide a useful framework for designing and developing more effective drugs for controlling platelet aggregation and anti angiogenesis cancer
