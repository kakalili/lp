crystal structure of  chlorocatechol   dioxygenase key enzyme of a new modified ortho pathway from the gram positive rhodococcus opacus cp grown on  chlorophenol
the crystal structure of the  chlorocatechol   dioxygenase from the gram positive bacterium rhodococcus opacus erythropolis  cp a fe iii ion containing enzyme specialized in the aerobic biodegradation of  chloro and methyl substituted catechols has been solved by molecular replacement techniques using the coordinates of  chlorocatechol   dioxygenase from the same organism pdb code s a as a starting model and refined at     resolution rfree    r factor    the analysis of the structure and of the kinetic parameters for a series of different substrates and the comparison with the corresponding data for the  chlorocatechol   dioxygenase isolated from the same bacterial strain provides evidence of which active site residues are responsible for the observed differences in substrate specificity among the amino acid residues expected to interact with substrates only three are altered val  ala   tyr  phe  and ala  cys    chlorocatechol   dioxygenase  chlorocatechol   dioxygenase  clearly identifying the substitutions influencing substrate selectivity in these enzymes the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains eight subunits corresponding to four dimers that show heterogeneity in the conformation of a co crystallized molecule bound to the catalytic non heme iron iii ion resembling a benzohydroxamate moiety probably a result of the breakdown of recently discovered siderophores synthesized by gram positive bacteria several different modes of binding benzohydroxamate into the active site induce distinct conformations of the interacting protein ligands tyr  and arg   illustrating the plasticity of the active site origin of the more promiscuous substrate preferences of the present enzyme
