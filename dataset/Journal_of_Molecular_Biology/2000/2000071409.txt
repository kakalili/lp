The structure and backbone dynamics of rat holo cellular retinol-binding protein II (holo-CRBP II) in solution has been determined by multidimensional NMR. The final structure ensemble was based on 3980 distance and 30 dihedral angle restraints, and was calculated using metric matrix distance geometry with pairwise Gaussian metrization followed by simulated annealing. The average RMS deviation of the backbone atoms for the final 25 structures relative to their mean coordinates is 0.85(±0.09) Å. Comparison of the solution structure of holo-CRBP II with apo-CRBP II indicates that the protein undergoes conformational changes not previously observed in crystalline CRBP II, affecting residues 28-35 of the helix-turn-helix, residues 37-38 of the subsequent linker, as well as the β-hairpin C-D, E-F and G-H loops. The bound retinol is completely buried inside the binding cavity and oriented as in the crystal structure. The order parameters derived from the 15N T1, T2 and steady-state NOE parameters show that the backbone dynamics of holo-CRBP II is restricted throughout the polypeptide. The T2 derived apparent backbone exchange rate and amide 1H exchange rate both indicate that the microsecond to second timescale conformational exchange occurring in the portal region of the apo form has been suppressed in the holo form.
