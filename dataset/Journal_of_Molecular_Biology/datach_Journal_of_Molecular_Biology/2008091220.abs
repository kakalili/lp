the crystal structure of chir ab  a primordial avian classical fc receptor
chir ab is a newly identified avian immunoglobulin ig receptor that includes both activating and inhibitory motifs and was therefore classified as a potentially bifunctional receptor recently chir ab was shown to bind the fc region of chicken igy and to induce calcium mobilization via association with the common  chain a subunit that transmits signals upon ligation of many different immunoreceptors here we describe the    resolution crystal structure of the chir ab ectodomain the receptor ectodomain consists of a single c type ig domain resembling the ig like domains found in mammalian fc receptors such as fc rs and fc ri unlike these receptors and other monomeric ig superfamily members chir ab crystallized as a  fold symmetrical homodimer that bears no resemblance to variable or constant region dimers in an antibody analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrated that chir ab exists as a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution and equilibrium gel filtration revealed a   receptor ligand binding stoichiometry measurement of the   chir ab igy interaction affinity indicates a relatively low affinity complex but a   chir ab igy interaction allows an increase in apparent affinity due to avidity effects when the receptor is tethered to a surface taken together these results add to the structural understanding of fc receptors and their functional mechanisms
