the scfv fragment of the antibody hu d   evidence for early premature domain interaction in refolding edited by c r matthews
fluorescence spectroscopy and h h exchange techniques have been applied to characterize the folding of an scfv fragment derived from the humanized anti her antibody hu d   a stable intermediate consisting of a native vl domain and an unfolded vh domain is populated under equilibrium unfolding conditions a partially structured intermediate with h h exchange protection significantly less than that of the two isolated domains together is detectable upon refolding the equilibrium denatured scfv fragment this means that the domains in the heterodimer do not fold independently rather they associate prematurely before full h h exchange protection can be gained the formation of the native heterodimer from the non native intermediate is a slow cooperative process which is rate limited by proline cis trans isomerization unproductive domain association is also detectable after short term denaturation i e with the proline residues in native conformation only a fraction of the short term denatured protein folds into the native protein in a fast proline independent reaction because of spontaneous proline cis trans reisomerization in the early non native intermediate the comparison with the previously studied antibody mcpc  has now allowed us to delineate similarities in the refolding pathway of scfv fragments
