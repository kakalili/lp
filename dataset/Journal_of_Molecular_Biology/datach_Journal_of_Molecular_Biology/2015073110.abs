anti polyq antibodies recognize a short polyq stretch in both normal and mutant huntingtin exon
huntington s disease is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine polyq repeat in the huntingtin protein a structural basis for the apparent transition between normal and disease causing expanded polyq repeats of huntingtin is unknown the  linear lattice  model proposed random coil structures for both normal and expanded polyq in the preaggregation state consistent with this model the affinity and stoichiometry of the anti polyq antibody mw increased with the number of glutamines an opposing  structural toxic threshold  model proposed a conformational change above the pathogenic polyq threshold resulting in a specific toxic conformation for expanded polyq support for this model was provided by the anti polyq antibody b h  which was reported to specifically recognize a distinct pathologic conformation of soluble expanded polyq to distinguish between these models we directly compared binding of mw and b h  to normal and expanded polyq repeats within huntingtin exon  fusion proteins we found similar binding characteristics for both antibodies first both antibodies bound to normal as well as expanded polyq in huntingtin exon  fusion proteins second an expanded polyq tract contained multiple epitopes for fragments antigen binding fabs of both antibodies demonstrating that b h  does not recognize a single epitope specific to expanded polyq finally small angle x ray scattering and dynamic light scattering revealed similar binding modes for mw and b h  fab  huntingtin exon  complexes together these results support the linear lattice model for polyq binding proteins suggesting that the hypothesized pathologic conformation of soluble expanded polyq is not a valid target for drug design
