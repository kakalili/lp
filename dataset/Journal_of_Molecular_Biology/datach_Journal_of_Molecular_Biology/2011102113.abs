rgk family g domain gtp analog complex structures and nucleotide binding properties
the rgk family of small g proteins including rad gem rem  and rem  is inducibly expressed in various mammalian tissues and interacts with voltage dependent calcium channels and rho kinase many questions remain regarding their physiological roles and molecular mechanism previous crystallographic studies reported rgk g domain guanosine di phosphate structures to test whether rgk proteins undergo a nucleotide induced conformational change we determined the crystallographic structures of rad gppnhp and rem gppnhp to   and     resolutions respectively also we characterized the nucleotide binding properties and conformations for gem rad and several structure based mutants using fluorescence spectroscopy the results suggest that rgk g proteins may not behave as ras like canonical nucleotide induced molecular switches further the rgk proteins have differing structures and nucleotide binding properties which may have implications for their varied action on effectors
