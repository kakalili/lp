murine apobec is a powerful mutator of retroviral and cellular rna invitro and in vivo
mammalian apobec molecules comprise a large family of cytidine deaminases with specificity for rna and single stranded dna ssdna  apobec s are invariably highly specific and edit a single residue in a cellular mrna while the cellular targets for apobec s are not clearly established although they may curtail the transposition of some retrotransposons two of the seven member human apobec enzymes strongly restrict human immunodeficiency virus type  in vitro and in vivo we show here that ssdna hyperediting of an infectious exogenous gammaretrovirus the friend  murine leukemia virus by murine apobec and apobec deaminases occurs in vitro murine apobec was able to hyperdeaminate cytidine residues in murine leukemia virus genomic rna as well analysis of the edited sites shows that the deamination in vivo was due to mouse apobec rather than apobec  furthermore murine apobec is able to hyperedit its primary substrate in vivo the apolipoprotein b mrna and a variety of heterologous rnas in short murine apobec is a hypermutator of both rna and ssdna in vivo which could exert occasional side effects upon overexpression
