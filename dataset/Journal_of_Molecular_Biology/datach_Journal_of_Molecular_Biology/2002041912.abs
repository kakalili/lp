sub proteome differential display single gel comparison by d electrophoresis and mass spectrometry
two dimensional  d gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry ms have been used in comparative proteomics but inherent problems of the d electrophoresis technique lead to difficulties when comparing two samples we describe a method sub proteome differential display for comparing the proteins from two sources simultaneously proteins from one source are mixed with radiolabelled proteins from a second source in a ratio of    these combined proteomes are fractionated simultaneously using column chromatographic methods followed by analysis of the pre fractionated proteomes designated sub proteomes using d gel electrophoresis silver staining and  s autoradiography of a single gel allows precise discrimination between members of each sub proteome using commonly available computer software this is followed by ms identification of individual proteins we have demonstrated the utility of the technology by identifying the product of a transfected gene and several proteins expressed differentially between two renal carcinoma proteomes the procedure has the capacity to enrich proteins prior to d electrophoresis and provides a simple inexpensive approach to compare proteomes the single gel approach eliminates differences that might arise if separate proteome fractionations or d gels are employed
