investigations on the maturation and regulation of archaebacterial proteasomes   we dedicate this paper to the memory of eraldo antonini eminent biochemist prematurely deceased  years ago on  march
the  s proteasome core particle cp is a multifunctional protease complex and composed of four heptameric subunit rings arranged in a hollow barrel shaped structure here we report the crystal structure of the cp from archaeoglobus fulgidus at    resolution the analysis of the structure of early and late assembly intermediates of this cp gives new insights in the maturation of archaebacterial cps and indicates similarities to assembly intermediates observed in eukaryotes we also show a striking difference in mechanism and regulation of substrate access between eukaryotic and archaebacterial  s proteasomes while eukaryotic cps are auto inhibited by the n terminal tails of the outer  ring by imposing topological closure with a characteristic sequence motif ydr motif and show regulatory gating this segment is disordered in the cp and differently structured in the   sub complex of a fulgidus leaving a pore leading into the particle with a diameter of    mutagenesis and functional studies indicate the absence of regulatory gating in the archaeal  s proteasome
