changing the dna recognition specificity of the ecodam dna adenine n  methyltransferase by directed evolution
ecodam is an adenine n dna methyltransferase that methylates the gatc sites in the escherichia coli genome we have changed the target specificity of ecodam from gatc to gatt by directed evolution combining different random mutagenesis methods with restriction protection at gatt sites for selection and screening by co evolution of an enzyme library and a substrate library we identified gatt as the best non gatc site and discover a double mutation r  s p  s as the first step to increase enzyme activity at gatt sites after four generations of mutagenesis and selection we obtained enzyme variants with new specificity for gatt while the wild type ecodam shows no detectable activity at gatt sites in e coli cells some variants prefer methylation at gatt over gatc sites by about  fold in cells in vitro dna methylation kinetics carried out under single turnover conditions using a hemimethylated gatc and a gatt oligonucleotide substrate confirmed that the evolved proteins prefer methylation of gatt sites to a similar degree they show up to   fold change in specificity in vitro and methylate the new gatt target site with   of the rate of gatc methylation by the wild type enzyme indicating good activity we conclude that the new methyltransferases are fully functional in vivo and in vitro but show a new target site specificity
