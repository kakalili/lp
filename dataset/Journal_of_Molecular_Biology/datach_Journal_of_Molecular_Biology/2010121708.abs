reversal of a mutator activity by a nearby fidelity neutral substitution in the rb  dna polymerase binding pocket
phage rb  b family dna polymerase is responsible for the overall high fidelity of rb  dna synthesis fidelity is compromised when conserved tyr   one of the residues that form the nascent polymerase base pair binding pocket is replaced by alanine the y  a mutator mutant has an enlarged binding pocket and can incorporate and extend mispairs efficiently ser  is a nearby conserved residue that also contributes to the binding pocket but a s  g replacement has only a small impact on dna replication fidelity when y  a and s  g replacements were combined mutator activity was strongly decreased compared to that with y  a replacement alone analyses conducted both in vivo and in vitro revealed that compared to y  a replacement alone the double mutant mainly reduced base substitution mutations and to a lesser extent frameshift mutations the decrease in mutation rates was not due to increased exonuclease activity based on measurements of dna binding affinity mismatch insertion and mismatch extension we propose that the recovered fidelity of the double mutant may result in part from an increased dissociation of the enzyme from dna followed by the binding of the same or another polymerase molecule in either exonuclease mode or polymerase mode an additional antimutagenic factor may be a structural alteration in the polymerase binding pocket described in this article
