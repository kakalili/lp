associative and structural properties of the region of complement factor h encompassing the tyr  his disease related polymorphism and its interactions with heparin
factor h fh is a major complement control protein in serum the seventh short complement regulator scr  domain of the  in fh is associated with age related macular degeneration through a tyr  his polymorphism the recombinant scr   domains containing either his  or tyr  and their complexes with a heparin decasaccharide were studied by analytical ultracentrifugation and x ray scattering the sedimentation coefficient is concentration dependent giving a value of   s at zero concentration and a frictional ratio f fo of   for both allotypes the his  allotype showed a slightly greater self association than the tyr  allotype and small amounts of dimeric scr   were found for both allotypes in   mm    mm and   mm nacl buffers sedimentation equilibrium data were interpreted in terms of a monomer  dimer equilibrium with a dissociation constant of    m for the his  form the guinier radius of gyration rg of      nm and the rg ro ratio of      showed that scr   is relatively extended in solution the distance distribution function p r showed a maximum dimension of   nm which is less than the length expected for a linear domain arrangement the constrained scattering and sedimentation modelling of fh scr   showed that bent scr arrangements fit the data better than linear arrangements previously identified heparin binding residues were exposed on the outside curvature of this bent domain structure heparin caused the formation of a more linear structure possibly by binding to residues in the linker it was concluded that the his  allotype may self associate more readily than the tyr  allotype scr   is partly responsible for the folded back structure of intact fh and scr   changes conformation upon heparin binding
