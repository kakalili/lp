structural stability and solution structure of chaperonin groes heptamer studied by synchrotron small angle x ray scattering
the groes protein from escherichia coli is a well known member of the molecular chaperones groes consists of seven identical  kda subunits and forms a dome like oligomeric structure in order to obtain information on the structural stability and unfolding  refolding mechanism of groes protein especially at protein concentrations      mm groes monomer that would mimic heat stress conditions in vivo we have performed synchrotron small angle x ray scattering saxs experiments surprisingly in spite of the high protein concentration reversibility in the unfolding  refolding reaction was confirmed by saxs experiments structurally although the unfolding  refolding reaction showed an apparent single transition with a cm of   m guanidium hydrochloride a more detailed analysis of this transition demonstrated that the unfolding mechanism could be best explained by a sequential three state model which consists of native heptamer dissociated monomer and unfolded monomer together with our previous result that groes unfolded completely via a partially folded monomer according to a three state model at low protein concentration   m monomer  the unfolding  refolding mechanism of groes protein could be explained uniformly by the three state model from low to high protein concentrations furthermore to clarify an ambiguity of the native groes structure in solution especially mobile loop structures we have estimated a solution structure of groes using saxs profiles obtained from experiments and simulation analysis the result suggested that the native structure of groes in solution was very similar to that seen in groes  groel complex determined by crystallography
