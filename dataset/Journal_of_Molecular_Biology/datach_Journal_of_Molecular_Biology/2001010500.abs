the efficiency of strand invasion by escherichia coli reca is dependent upon the length and polarity of ssdna tails edited by a fersht
reca protein is essential for homologous recombination and the repair of dna double strand breaks in escherichia coli the protein binds dna to form nucleoprotein filaments that promote joint molecule formation and strand exchange in vitro reca polymerises on ssdna in the      direction and catalyses strand exchange and branch migration with a      polarity it has been reported previously using d loop assays in which ssdna containing a heterologous block at one end invades supercoiled duplex dna that   homologous ends are reactive whereas   ends are inactive this polarity bias was thought to be due to the polarity of reca filament formation which results in the   ends being coated in reca whereas   ends remain naked using a range of duplex substrates containing ssdna tails of various lengths and polarities we now demonstrate that when no heterologous block is imposed    ends are just as reactive as   ends moreover using short tailed substrates we find that   ends form more stable d loops than   ends this bias may be a consequence of the instability of short   joints with more physiological substrates containing long ssdna tails we find that reca shows no intrinsic preference for   or   ends and that both form d loop complexes with high efficiency
