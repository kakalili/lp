the sensitivity of lipid domains to small perturbations demonstrated by the effect of triton
the hypothesis of lipid rafts describes functional domains in biological membranes it is often assumed that rafts form by spontaneous de mixing of certain lipids and that they can be isolated as detergent resistant membrane particles drms using the detergent triton x   tx  here we present a model that describes the process of domain formation in membranes in the presence and in the absence of tx we measure the interactions between tx and an equimolar mixture of sphingomyelin sm  cholesterol cho  and  palmitoyl  oleoyl  sn glycero phosphatidylcholine popc     mol by means of isothermal titration calorimetry comparison with pure popc membranes reveals a very unfavorable interaction between tx and sm cho which causes a substantial tendency to segregate these molecules into separate drm like sm rich and fluid tx rich  domains if rafts are indeed formed by spontaneous de mixing of pc and sm cho they must be very sensitive and perturbations caused by techniques used to study rafts could lead to misleading results if however rafts are much more stable than pc  sm  cho domains there must be an unknown raft stabilizer subtle changes of such a promoter could serve to modulate raft function
