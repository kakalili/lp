yeast cytosine deaminase mutants with increased thermostability impart sensitivity to  fluorocytosine
prodrug gene therapy pgt is a treatment strategy in which tumor cells are transfected with a  suicide  gene that encodes a metabolic enzyme capable of converting a nontoxic prodrug into a potent cytotoxin one of the most promising pgt enzymes is cytosine deaminase cd  a microbial salvage enzyme that converts cytosine to uracil cd also converts  fluorocytosine  fc to  fluorouracil an inhibitor of dna synthesis and rna function over   studies of cd mediated pgt applications have been reported since    all using wild type enzymes however various forms of cd are limited by inefficient turnover of fc and or limited thermostability in a previous study we stabilized and extended the half life of yeast cd ycd by repacking of its hydrophobic core at several positions distant from the active site here we report that random mutagenesis of residues selected based on alignment with similar enzymes followed by selection for enhanced sensitization to fc also produces an enzyme variant ycd d e with elevated tm values and increased activity half life the new mutation is located at the enzyme s dimer interface indicating that independent mutational pathways can lead to an increase in stability as well as a more subtle effect on enzyme kinetics each independently derived set of mutations significantly improves the enzyme s performance in pgt assays both in cell culture and in animal models
