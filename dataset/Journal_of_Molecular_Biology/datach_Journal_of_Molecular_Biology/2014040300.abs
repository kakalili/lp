the n terminal amphipathic helices determine regulatory and effector functions of phage shock protein a pspa in escherichia coli
the phage shock protein psp systems found in bacteria archaea and higher plants respond to extracytoplasmic stresses that damage the cytoplasmic membrane and enable cells to repair their membranes the conserved membrane associated effector protein pspa has four  helical domains hd  hd  and helps to repair the membrane as a high order oligomer in enterobacteria under non stress conditions pspa as a low order assembly directly inhibits its cognate transcription activator pspf here we show that n terminal amphipathic helices aha and ahb in pspa hd are functional determinants involved in negative gene control and stress signal perception and its transduction via interactions with the pspbc membrane stress sensors and the inner membrane im  the amphipathic helices enable pspa to switch from a low order gene regulator into an im bound high order effector complex under membrane stress conserved residue proline  is involved in sequential use of the amphipathic helices and aha  im interaction single molecule imaging of egfp pspa and its amphipathic helices variants in live escherichia coli cells show distinct spatial and temporal organisations of pspa corresponding to its negative control and effector functions these findings inform studies on the role of the psp system in persister cell formation and cell envelope protection in bacterial pathogens and provide a basis for exploring the specialised roles of pspa homologues such as yjfj liah and vipp
