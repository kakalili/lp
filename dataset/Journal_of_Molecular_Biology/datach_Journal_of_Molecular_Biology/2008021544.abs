crystal structure of long chain alkane monooxygenase lada in complex with coenzyme fmn unveiling the long chain alkane hydroxylase
lada a long chain alkane monooxygenase utilizes a terminal oxidation pathway for the conversion of long chain alkanes up to at least c  to corresponding primary alcohols in thermophilic bacillus geobacillus thermodenitrificans ng   here we report the first structure of the long chain alkane hydroxylase lada and its complex with the flavin mononucleotide fmn coenzyme lada is characterized as a new member of the ssud subfamily of the bacterial luciferase family via a surprising structural relationship the lada fmn binary complex structure and a lada fmn alkane model reveal a hydrophobic cavity that has dual roles to provide a hydrogen bond donor his   for catalysis and to create a solvent free environment in which to stabilize the c a hydroperoxyflavin intermediate consequently lada should catalyze the conversion of long chain alkanes via the acknowledged flavoprotein monooxygenase mechanism this finding suggests that the ability of lada to catalyze the degradation of long chain alkanes is determined by the binding mode of the long chain alkane substrates the lada structure opens a rational perspective to explore and alter the substrate binding site of lada with potential biotechnological applications in areas such as petroleum exploration and treatment of environmental oil pollution
