cyclic di gmp activation of polynucleotide phosphorylase signal dependent rna processing
the second messenger cyclic diguanylic acid c di gmp is implicated in key lifestyle decisions of bacteria including biofilm formation and changes in motility and virulence some challenges in deciphering the physiological roles of c di gmp are the limited knowledge about the cellular targets of c di gmp the signals that control its levels and the proportion of free cellular c di gmp if any here we identify the target and the regulatory signal for a c di gmp responsive escherichia coli ribonucleoprotein complex we show that a direct c di gmp target in e coli is polynucleotide phosphorylase pnpase  an important enzyme in rna metabolism that serves as a   polyribonucleotide polymerase or a   to   exoribonuclease we further show that a complex of polynucleotide phosphorylase with the direct oxygen sensors dosc and dosp can perform oxygen dependent rna processing we conclude that c di gmp can mediate signal dependent rna processing and that macromolecular complexes can compartmentalize c di gmp signaling
