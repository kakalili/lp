the solution structure of d g t g   a bimolecular g quadruplex with a novel fold
the g rich  mer oligonucleotide d g t g  forms a bimolecular g quadruplex in the presence of sodium ions with a topology that is distinct from the folds of the closely related and well characterized sequences d g t g  and d g t g  the solution structure of d g t g  has been determined using a combination of nmr spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations d g t g  forms an asymmetric dimeric fold back structure consisting of three stacked g quartets the two t loops that span diagonally across the outer faces of the g quartets assume different conformations the glycosidic torsion angle conformations of the guanine bases are   syn  anti  syn  anti  t loop  anti  syn  anti in one strand and   syn  anti  syn  anti  t loop  syn  anti  syn in the other strand the guanine bases of the two outer g quartets exhibit a clockwise donor  acceptor hydrogen bonding directionality while those of the middle g quartet exhibit the anti clockwise directionality the topology of this g quadruplex like other bimolecular fold back structures with diagonal loops places each strand of the g quartet region next to a neighboring parallel and an anti parallel strand the two guanine residues not involved in g quartet formation g and g  i e the fourth guanine base of one strand and the first guanine base of the other strand  adopt distinct conformations g is stacked on top of an adjacent g quartet and this base stacking continues along with the bases of the loop residues t and t  g  is orientated away from the core of g quartets stacked on the t base and apparently involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with the phosphodiester group of this same residue the cation dependent folding of the d g t g  quadruplex structure is distinct from that observed for similar sequences while both d g t g  and d g t g  form bimolecular diagonally looped g quadruplex structures in the presence of na  k and nh  we have observed this folding to be favored for d g t g  in the presence of na  but not in the presence of k or nh  the structure of d g t g  exhibits a  slipped loop  element that is similar to what has been proposed for structural intermediates in the folding pathway of some g quadruplexes and therefore provides support for the feasibility of these proposed transient structures in g quadruplex formation
