understanding discrimination by the ribosome stability testing and groove measurement of codon  anticodon pairs
the ribosome must discriminate between correct and incorrect trnas with sufficient speed and accuracy to sustain an adequate rate of cell growth here we report the results of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations which address the mechanism of discrimination by the ribosome the universally conserved  s rrna base a   and the kink in mrna between a and p sites amplify differences in stability between cognate and near cognate codon  anticodon pairs destabilization by the mrna kink also provides a geometric explanation for the higher error rates observed for mismatches in the first codon position relative to mismatches in the second codon position for more stable near cognates the repositioning of the universally conserved bases a   and g  results in increased solvent exposure and an uncompensated loss of hydrogen bonds preventing correct codon  anticodon  ribosome interactions from forming
