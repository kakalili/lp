three dimensional structures of s  d chymotrypsin and d  s trypsin mutants the effect of polarity at site   on a protease specific stabilization of the substrate binding site
the crystal structure of s  d rat chymotrypsin have been determined resolution     and compared together with d  s rat trypsin to wild type structures to examine why these single mutations resulted in poorly active non specific enzymes instead of converting the specificities of trypsin and chymotrypsin into each other both mutants have stable structure but suffer from a surprisingly large number of serious deformations these are restricted to the activation domain mainly to the substrate binding region and are larger in s  d chymotrypsin a wild type substrate binding mode in the mutants is disfavored by substantial displacements of the cys  cys  disulfide and loop segments     loop c d  and     loop e f  at the specificity site as a consequence the substrate binding clefts become wider and more solvent accessible in the middle third and occluded in the lower third interestingly while the ser  residue in d  s trypsin adopts a chymotrypsin like conformation the asp  residue in s  d chymotrypsin is turned out toward the solvent the rearrangements in d  s trypsin are at the same sites where trypsin and trypsinogen differ and in s  d chymotrypsin the oxyanion hole as well as the salt bridge between asp  and the n terminal of ile  are missing as in chymotrypsinogen despite these similarities the mutants do not have zymogen conformation the ser  asp and asp  ser substitutions are structurally so disruptive probably because the stabilization of such a different specificity site polarities as those after the removal or introduction of a charged residue are beyond the capability of the wild type conformation of the substrate binding region
