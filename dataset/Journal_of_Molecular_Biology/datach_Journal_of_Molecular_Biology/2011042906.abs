electrostatic interactions mediate binding of obscurin to small ankyrin  biochemical and molecular modeling studies
small ankyrin  sank  also known as ank   is an integral protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum sr in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells where it is thought to bind to the c terminal region of obscurin a large modular protein that surrounds the contractile apparatus using fusion proteins in vitro in combination with site directed mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance measurements we previously showed that the binding site on sank for obscurin consists in part of six lysine and arginine residues here we show that four charged residues in the high affinity binding site on obscurin for sank  between residues   and    consisting of three glutamates and a lysine are necessary but not sufficient for this site on obscurin to bind to sank with high affinity we also identify specific complementary mutations in sank that can partially or completely compensate for the changes in binding caused by charge switching mutations in obscurin we used molecular modeling to develop structural models of residues       of obscurin bound to sank  the models based on a combination of brownian and molecular dynamics simulations predict that the binding site on sank for obscurin is organized as two ankyrin like repeats with the last  helical segment oriented at an angle to nearby helices allowing lysine   of obscurin to form an ionic interaction with aspartate   of sank  this prediction was validated by double mutant cycle experiments our results are consistent with a model in which electrostatic interactions between specific pairs of side chains on obscurin and sank promote binding and complex formation
