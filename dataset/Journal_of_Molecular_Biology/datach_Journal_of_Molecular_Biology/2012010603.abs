cross monomer substrate contacts reposition the hsp  n terminal domain and prime the chaperone activity
the ubiquitous molecular chaperone hsp  plays a critical role in substrate protein folding and maintenance but the functional mechanism has been difficult to elucidate in previous work a model hsp  substrate revealed an activation process in which substrate binding accelerates a large open closed conformational change required for atp hydrolysis by hsp  while this could serve as an elegant mechanism for conserving atp usage for productive interactions on the substrate the structural origin of substrate catalyzed hsp  conformational changes is unknown here we find that substrate binding affects an intrinsically unfavorable rotation of the hsp  n terminal domain ntd relative to the middle domain md that is required for closure we identify an md substrate binding region on the interior cleft of the hsp  dimer and show that a secondary set of substrate contacts drives an ntd orientation change on the opposite monomer these results suggest an hsp  activation mechanism in which cross monomer contacts mediated by a partially structured substrate prime the chaperone for its functional activity
