functional studies of the   tetraloop capping helix  of  s ribosomal rna
the   tetraloop positions      of escherichia coli  s rrna caps helix   which is involved in a conformational switch crucial for the decoding function of the ribosome this tetraloop forms a gnra motif involved in intramolecular rna  rna interactions with its receptor in helix  of  s rrna it is involved also in an intersubunit bridge via an interaction with helix  in domain iv of  s rrna using a specialized ribosome system and an instant evolution procedure the four nucleotides of this loop were randomized and  functional mutants were selected in vivo positions   and   responsible for most of the tetraloop receptor interactions were found to be the most critical for ribosome activity functional studies showed that mutations in the   tetraloop impair subunit association and decrease translational fidelity computer modeling of the mutations allows correlation of the effect of mutations with perturbations of the tetraloop receptor interactions
