structure and reactivity of bacillus subtilis mend catalyzing the first committed step in menaquinone biosynthesis
the first committed step in the classical biosynthetic route to menaquinone vitamin k  is a stetter like conjugate addition of  ketoglutarate with isochorismate this reaction is catalyzed by the thiamine diphosphate and metal ion dependent  succinyl  enolpyruvyl  hydroxy  cyclohexadiene  carboxylate synthase mend  the medium resolution      crystal structure of bacillus subtilis mend with cofactor and mn  has been determined based on structure  sequence comparisons and modeling a two stage mechanism that is primarily driven by the chemical properties of the cofactor is proposed hypotheses for the molecular determinants of substrate recognition were formulated five basic residues arg  arg   arg   arg   and lys   are postulated to interact with carboxylate and hydroxyl groups to align substrates for catalysis in combination with a cluster of non polar residues ile   phe   and leu   on one side of the active site the powerful combination of site directed mutagenesis where each of the eight residues is replaced by alanine and steady state kinetic measurements has been exploited to address these hypotheses arg  plays a significant role in binding both substrates while arg  contributes mainly to binding of  ketoglutarate arg  and in particular arg  are critical for recognition of isochorismate mutagenesis of phe  and ile  has the most profound influence on catalytic efficiency indicating that these two residues are important for binding of isochorismate and for stabilizing the cofactor position these data allow for a detailed description of the structure  reactivity relationship that governs mend function and refinement of the model for the catalytic intermediate that supports the stetter like conjugate addition
