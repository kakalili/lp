Human UDP-d-xylose:proteoglycan core protein β-d-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26, XT-I) initiates the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan chains in proteoglycans by transferring xylose from UDP-xylose to specific serine residues of the core protein. Based on the partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme from human JAR choriocarcinoma cell culture supernatant we isolated a cDNA encoding XT-I using the degenerate reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. This enzyme, which is involved in chondroitin sulfate, heparan sulfate, heparin and dermatan sulfate biosynthesis, belongs to a novel family of glycosyltransferases with no homology to proteins known so far. 5′ and 3′-RACE were performed to isolate a novel cDNA fragment of 3726bp with a single open reading frame encoding at least 827 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 91kDa. The human XT-I gene was located on chromosome 16p13.1 using radiation hybrid mapping, and extracts from CHO-K1 cells transfected with the XT-I cDNA in an expression vector exhibited marked XT activity. A new 3608bp cDNA fragment encoding a protein of 865 amino acid residues was also isolated by PCR using degenerate primers based on the amino acid sequence of human XT-I. The amino acid sequence of this XT-II isoform displayed 55% identity to the human XT-I. The XT-II gene was located on chromosome 17q21.3-17q22, and the exon/intron structure of the 15 kb gene was determined. RT-PCR analyses of XT-I and XT-II mRNA from various tissues confirmed that both XT-I and XT-II transcripts are ubiquitously expressed in the human tissues, although with different levels of transcription. Furthermore, the cDNAs encoding XT-I and XT-II from rat were cloned. The deduced amino acid sequences of rat xylosyltransferases displayed 94% identity to the corresponding human enzyme.
