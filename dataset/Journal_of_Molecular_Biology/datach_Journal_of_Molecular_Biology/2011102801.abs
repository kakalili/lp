conformational transformation and selection of synthetic prion strains
prion protein is capable of folding into multiple self replicating prion strains that produce phenotypically distinct neurological disorders although prion strains often breed true upon passage they can also transform or  mutate  despite being devoid of nucleic acids to dissect the mechanism of prion strain transformation we studied the physicochemical evolution of a mouse synthetic prion mosp strain mosp  after repeated passage in mice and cultured cells we show that mosp gradually adopted shorter incubation times and lower conformational stabilities these changes were accompanied by structural transformation as indicated by a shift in the molecular mass of the protease resistant core of mosp from approximately   kda mosp   to   kda mosp    we show that mosp   and mosp   can breed with fidelity when cloned in cells however when present as a mixture mosp   preferentially proliferated leading to the disappearance of mosp   in culture the rate of this transformation process can be influenced by the composition of the culture media and the presence of polyamidoamines our findings demonstrate that prions can exist as a conformationally diverse population of strains each capable of replicating with high fidelity rare conformational conversion followed by competitive selection among the resulting pool of conformers provides a mechanism for the adaptation of the prion population to its host environment
