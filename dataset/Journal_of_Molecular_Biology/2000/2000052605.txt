We have introduced targeted mutations in two areas that make up part of the RecA subunit interface. In the RecA crystal structure, cross-subunit interactions are observed between the Lys6 and Asp139 side-chains, and between the Arg28 and Asn113 side-chains. Unexpectedly, we find that mutations at Lys6 and Arg28 impose severe defects on the oligomeric stability of free RecA protein, whereas mutations at Asn113 or Asp139 do not. However, Lys6 and Arg28 mutant proteins showed an apparent normal formation of RecA-DNA complexes. These results suggest that cross-subunit contacts in this region of the protein are different for free RecA protein filaments versus RecA-DNA nucleoprotein filaments. Mutant proteins with substitutions at either Lys6 or Arg28 show partial inhibition of DNA strand exchange activity, yet the mechanistic reasons for this inhibition appear to be distinct. Although Lys6 and Arg28 appear to be more important to the stability of free RecA protein, as opposed to the stability of the catalytically active nucleoprotein filament, our results support the idea that the cross-subunit interactions made by each residue play an important role in optimizing the catalytic organization of the active RecA oligomer.
