A new gene (POLL) encoding a novel DNA polymerase (Pol λ) has been identified at mouse chromosome 19. Murine Pol λ, consisting of 573 amino acid residues, has a 32 % identity to Pol β, involved in nuclear DNA repair in eukaryotic cells. It is interesting that Pol λ contains all the critical residues involved in DNA binding, nucleotide binding and selection, and catalysis of DNA polymerization, that are conserved in Pol β and other DNA polymerases belonging to family X. Murine Pol λ, overproduced in Escherichia coli, displayed intrinsic DNA polymerase activity when assessed by in situ gel analysis. Pol λ also conserves the critical residues of Pol β required for its intrinsic deoxyribose phosphate lyase (dRPase) activity. The first 230 amino acid residues of Pol λ, that have no counterpart in Pol β, contain a BRCT domain, present in a variety of cell-cycle check-point control proteins responsive to DNA damage and proteins involved in DNA repair. Northern blotting, in situ hybridization analysis and immunostaining showed high levels of Pol λ specifically expressed in testis, being developmentally regulated and mainly associated to pachytene spermatocytes. These first evidences, although indirect, suggest a potential role of Pol λ in DNA repair synthesis associated with meiosis.
