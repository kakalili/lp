interaction of tyrosine  of reca protein with the first and second dna strands edited by m gottesman
we investigated the structure of the active reca dna complex by analyzing the environment of tyrosine residue   which is on the dna binding surface of the protein we prepared a modified reca protein in which the tyrosine residue was replaced by tryptophan a natural fluorescent reporter and measured the change in its fluorescence upon binding of dna and cofactor the fluorescence of the inserted tryptophan   trp  was centered at   nm indicating a partly exposed residue binding cofactor adenosine   o  thiotriphosphate atp s  alone at a low salt concentration did not change the fluorescence of trp  confirming that the residue is not close to the nucleotide in contrast the binding of single stranded dna quenched the fluorescence of trp  in both the presence and absence of atp s trp  fluorescence was also quenched upon binding a second dna strand the fluorescence change depended upon the presence and absence of atp s reflecting the difference in the dna binding these results indicate that residue  is close to both the first and second dna strands the degree of quenching depended upon the base composition of dna suggesting that the residue  interacts with the dna bases binding of dna with atp s as well as binding of atp s alone at high salt concentration shifted the fluorescence emission peak from   to   nm indicating a change from a polar to a non polar environment therefore the environment change around residue  would also be linked to a change in conformation and thus the activation of the protein
