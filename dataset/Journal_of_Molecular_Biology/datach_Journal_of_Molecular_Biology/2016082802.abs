dengue virus immunopathogenesis lessons applicable to the emergence of zika virus
dengue is the leading mosquito transmitted viral infection in the world there are more than   million new infections annually while the majority of infected individuals are asymptomatic or develop a self limited dengue fever up to  million clinical cases develop severe manifestations including dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome resulting in     deaths annually mainly in children gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to dengue infection and immunopathogenesis have hampered the development of vaccines and antiviral agents some of these limitations are highlighted by the explosive re emergence of another arthropod borne flavivirus  zika virus  spread by the same vector the aedes aegypti mosquito that also carries dengue yellow fever and chikungunya viruses this review will discuss the early virus  host interactions in dengue infection with emphasis on the interrelationship between oxidative stress and innate immune pathways and will provide insight as to how lessons learned from dengue research may expedite therapeutic strategies for zika virus
