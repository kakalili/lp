differential salt induced stabilization of structure in the initial folding intermediate ensemble of barstar
the effects of two salts kcl and mgcl  on the stability and folding kinetics of barstar have been studied at ph  equilibrium urea unfolding curves were used to show that the free energy of unfolding  gun of barstar increased from a value of  kcalmol   in the absence of salt to a value of  kcalmol   in the presence of m kcl or m mgcl  for both salts  gun increases linearly with an increase in concentration of salt from m to m suggesting that stabilization of the native state occurs primarily through a hofmeister effect refolding kinetics were studied in detail in the presence of m kcl as well as in the presence of m mgcl  and it is shown that the basic folding mechanism is not altered upon addition of salt the major effects on the refolding kinetics can be attributed to the stabilization of the initial burst phase ensemble ie by salt stabilization of structure in ie by kcl causes the fluorescence properties of ie to change so that there is an initial burst phase change in fluorescence at  nm during refolding the structure in ie is stabilized by mgcl  but no burst phase change in fluorescence at  nm is observed during refolding the fluorescence emission spectra of ie show that when refolding is initiated in m kcl the three tryptophan residues in ie are less solvent exposed than when folding is initiated in m mgcl  stabilization of ie leads to an acceleration in the rate of the fast observable phase of folding by both salts suggesting that structure of the transition state resembles that of ie the stabilization of ie by salts can be accounted for largely by the same mechanism that accounts for the stabilization of the native state of the protein namely through the hofmeister effect the salts do not affect the rates of the slower phases of folding indicating that the late intermediate ensemble il is not stabilized by salts stabilization of the native state results in deceleration of the fast unfolding rate which has virtually no dependence on the concentration of kcl or mgcl at high concentrations the observation that the salt induced stabilization of structure in ie is accompanied by an acceleration in the fast folding rate suggests that ie is likely to be a productive on pathway intermediate
