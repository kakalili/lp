structural basis of the adaptive molecular recognition by mmp
matrix metalloproteinase mmps are critical for the degradation of extracellular matrix components and therefore need to be regulated tightly almost all mmps share a homologous c terminal haemopexin like domain pex  besides its role in macromolecular substrate processing the pex domains appear to play a major role in regulating mmp activation localisation and inhibition one intriguing property of mmp is its competence to bind different proteins involved in these regulatory processes with high affinity at an overlapping recognition site on its pex domain with the crystal structure of the pex dimer we present the first example of how pex domains accomplish these diverse roles blade iv of pex mediates the non covalent and predominantly hydrophobic dimerisation contact large shifts of blade iii and in particular blade iv accompany the dimerisation resulting in a remarkably asymmetric homodimeric structure the asymmetry provides a novel mechanism of adaptive protein recognition where different proteins pex  pex  and timp  can bind with high affinity to pex at an overlapping site finally the structure illustrates how the dimerisation generates new properties on both a physico chemical and functional level
