identification of env determinants in v that influence the molecular anatomy of ccr utilization edited by i wilson
the v loop of the env glycoprotein exerts a dominant influence on the interaction of gp  with coreceptors primary env genes cloned from sequential isolates from two seroconverters revealed pro  ala conversion in the conserved gpg motif of the v crown in seven of  r env env containing the gpg motif in the v crown had fusogenic activity with chimeric receptors containing either the n terminus or loops of ccr  whereas those with the gag variant utilized only the former site directed mutagenesis of multiple primary and prototypic r env genes demonstrated that the gpg motif was necessary for dual utilization of the n terminus and body of ccr in both gain and loss of function experiments all env containing the gpg v crown showed ccr binding in the presence of soluble cd  whereas it was not detected with the gag variants molecular dynamic simulations of a v peptide predicts that the pro  ala substitution results in a conformational change with loss of the crown structure these studies demonstrate that sequences in the third hypervariable region determine the specificity of coreceptor utilization for fusion and that a conserved motif in the crown directly influences the molecular anatomy of the interaction between gp  and ccr
