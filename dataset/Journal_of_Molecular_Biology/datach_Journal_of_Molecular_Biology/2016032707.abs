hexadecameric structure of an invertebrate gap junction channel
innexins are invertebrate specific gap junction proteins with four transmembrane helices these proteins oligomerize to constitute intercellular channels that allow for the passage of small signaling molecules associated with neural and muscular electrical activity in contrast to the large number of structural and functional studies of connexin gap junction channels few structural studies of recombinant innexin channels are reported here we show the three dimensional structure of two dimensionally crystallized caenorhabditis elegans innexin  inx  gap junction channels the n terminal deleted inx  proteins are crystallized in lipid bilayers the three dimensional reconstruction determined by cryo electron crystallography reveals that a single inx  gap junction channel comprises  subunits a hexadecamer in contrast to chordate connexin channels which comprise  subunits the channel pore diameters at the cytoplasmic entrance and extracellular gap region are larger than those of connexin  two bulb densities are observed in each hemichannel one in the pore and the other at the cytoplasmic side of the hemichannel in the channel pore pathway these findings imply a structural diversity of gap junction channels among multicellular organisms
