characterization of the chitinolytic machinery of enterococcus faecalis v  and high resolution structure of its oxidative cbm  enzyme
little information exists for the ability of enterococci to utilize chitin as a carbon source we show that enterococcus faecalis v  can grow on chitin and we describe two proteins a family  chitinase ef   efchi a and a family  cbm carbohydrate binding module  ef   efcbm a that catalyze chitin conversion in vitro various types of enzyme activity assays showed that efchi a has functional properties characteristic of an endochitinase efcbm a belongs to a recently discovered family of enzymes that cleave glycosidic bonds via an oxidative mechanism and that act synergistically with classical hydrolytic enzymes i e  chitinases  the structure and function of this protein were probed in detail an ultra high resolution crystal structure of efcbm a revealed details of a conserved binding surface that is optimized to interact with chitin and contains the catalytic center chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses of product formation showed that efcbm a cleaves chitin via the oxidative mechanism previously described for cbp  from serratia marcescens metal depletion studies showed that efcbm a is a copper enzyme in the presence of an external electron donor efcbm a boosted the activity of efchi a and combining the two enzymes led to rapid and complete conversion of  chitin to chitobiose this study provides insight into the structure and function of the cbm  family of enzymes which together with their fungal counterpart called gh  currently receive considerable attention in the biomass processing field
