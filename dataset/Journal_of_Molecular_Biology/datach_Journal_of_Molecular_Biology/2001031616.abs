generalized dead end elimination algorithms make large scale protein side chain structure prediction tractable implications for protein design and structural genomics edited by f e cohen
the dead end elimination dee theorems are powerful tools for the combinatorial optimization of protein side chain placement in protein design and homology modeling in order to reach their full potential the theorems must be extended to handle very hard problems we present a suite of new algorithms within the dee paradigm that significantly extend its range of convergence and reduce run time as a demonstration we show that a total protein design problem of    combinations a hydrophobic core design problem of    combinations and a side chain placement problem of    combinations are solved in less than two weeks a day and a half and an hour of cpu time respectively this extends the range of the method by approximately     and   log units respectively using modest computational resources small to average sized protein domains can now be designed automatically and side chain placement calculations can be solved for nearly all sizes of proteins and protein complexes in the growing field of structural genomics
