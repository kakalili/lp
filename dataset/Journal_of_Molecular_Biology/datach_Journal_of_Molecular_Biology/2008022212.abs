sensitive genome wide screen for low secondary enzymatic activities the yjbq family shows thiamin phosphate synthase activity
contemporary enzymes are highly efficient and selective catalysts however due to the intrinsically very reactive nature of active sites gratuitous secondary reactions are practically unavoidable consequently even the smallest cell with its limited enzymatic repertoire has the potential to carry out numerous additional very likely inefficient secondary reactions if selectively advantageous secondary reactions could be the basis for the evolution of new fully functional enzymes here we investigated if escherichia coli has cryptic enzymatic activities related to thiamin biosynthesis we selected this pathway because this vitamin is essential but the cell s requirements are very small therefore enzymes with very low activity could complement the auxotrophy of strains deleted of some bona fide thiamin biosynthetic genes by overexpressing the e coli s protein repertoire we selected yjbq a gene that complemented a strain deleted of the thiamin phosphate synthase tps coding gene thie in vitro studies confirmed tps activity and by directed evolution experiments this activity was enhanced structurally oriented mutagenesis allowed us to identify the putative active site remote orthologs of yjbq from thermotoga sulfolobus and pyrococcus were cloned and also showed thiamin auxotrophy complementation indicating that the cryptic tps activity is a property of this protein family interestingly the thie and yjbq coded tpss are analog enzymes with no structural similarity reflecting distinct evolutionary origin these results support the hypothesis that the enzymatic repertoire of a cell such as e coli has the potential to perform vast amounts of alternative reactions which could be exploited to evolve novel or more efficient catalysts
