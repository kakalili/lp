order  disorder transitions in the cardiac troponin complex
the troponin complex is a molecular switch that ties shifting intracellular calcium concentration to association and dissociation of actin and myosin effectively allowing excitation  contraction coupling in striated muscle although there is a long history of muscle biophysics and structural biology many of the mechanistic details that enable troponin s function remain incompletely understood this review summarizes the current structural understanding of the troponin complex on the muscle thin filament focusing on conformational changes in flexible regions of the troponin i subunit in particular we focus on order  disorder transitions in the c terminal domain of troponin i which have important implications in cardiac disease and could also have potential as a model system for the study of coupled binding and folding
