a new crystal form of the nk splice variant of hgf sf demonstrates extensive hinge movement and suggests that the nk dimer originates by domain swapping
nk is a splice variant of the polypeptide growth factor hgf sf that consists of the n terminal n and first kringle k domains and retains receptor binding and signalling while nk behaves as a monomer in solution two independent crystallographic structures have previously shown an identical tightly packed dimer here we report a novel orthorhombic crystal form of nk at    resolution in which four nk protomers are packed in two distinct dimers in the asymmetric unit although the basic architecture of the new nk dimers is similar to the two described earlier the new crystal form demonstrates extensive hinge movement between the n and k domain that leads to re orientation of the receptor binding sites the hinge bending is evidence of the paucity of strong interactions between domains within the protomer in contrast to the extensive interactions between protomers in the dimer these observations are consistent with domain swapping in the dimer such that the interdomain interactions of the monomer are replaced by equivalent interprotomer interactions in the dimer and offer a route for protein engineering of nk variants which may act as receptor antagonists
