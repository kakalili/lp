The free energy landscape for the folding of large, multidomain RNAs is rugged, and kinetically trapped, misfolded intermediates are a hallmark of RNA folding reactions. Here, we examine the role of a native loop-receptor interaction in determining the ruggedness of the energy landscape for folding of the Tetrahymena ribozyme. We demonstrate a progressive smoothing of the energy landscape for ribozyme folding as the strength of the loop-receptor interaction is reduced. Remarkably, with the most severe mutation, global folding is more rapid than for the wild-type ribozyme and proceeds in a concerted fashion without the accumulation of long-lived kinetic intermediates. The results demonstrate that a complex interplay between native tertiary interactions, divalent ion concentration, and non-native secondary structure determines the ruggedness of the energy landscape. Furthermore, the results suggest that kinetic folding transitions involving large regions of highly structured RNAs can proceed in a concerted fashion, in the absence of significant stable, preorganized tertiary structure.
