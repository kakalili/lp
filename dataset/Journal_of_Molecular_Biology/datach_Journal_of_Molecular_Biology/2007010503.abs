structural and biochemical analysis of the rv   cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from mycobacterium tuberculosis
cyclic nucleotide monophosphate cnmp hydrolysis in bacteria and eukaryotes is brought about by distinct cnmp phosphodiesterases pdes  since these enzymes differ in amino acid sequence and properties they have evolved by convergent evolution cyclic nmp pdes cleave cnmps to nmps and the rv   gene product is to date the only identifiable cnmp pde in the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis we have shown that rv   is a camp cgmp dual specificity pde and is unrelated in amino acid sequence to the mammalian cnmp pdes rv   is a dimeric fe  mn  binuclear pde and mutational analysis demonstrated that the active site metals are co ordinated by conserved aspartate histidine and asparagine residues we report here the structure of the catalytic core of rv   which is distantly related to the calcineurin like phosphatases the crystal structure of the rv   dimer shows that the active site metals contribute to dimerization and thus play an additional structural role apart from their involvement in catalysis we also present the crystal structures of the asn ala mutant protein that lacks one of the mn  co ordinating residues as well as the asp ala mutant that has a compromised camp hydrolytic activity providing a structural basis for the catalytic properties of these mutant proteins a molecule of phosphate is bound in a bidentate manner at the active site of the rv   wild type protein and cacodylate occupies a similar position in the crystal structure of the asp ala mutant protein a unique substrate binding pocket in rv   was identified by computational docking studies and the role of the his  residue in interacting with camp was validated through mutational analysis this report on the first structure of a bacterial cnmp pde thus significantly extends our molecular understanding of camp hydrolysis in class iii pdes
