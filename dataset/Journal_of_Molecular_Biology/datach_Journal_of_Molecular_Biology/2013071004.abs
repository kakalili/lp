the disordered c terminal domain of human dna glycosylase neil contributes to its stability via intramolecular interactions
neil  nei endonuclease viii like protein   one of the five mammalian dna glycosylases that excise oxidized dna base lesions in the human genome to initiate base excision repair contains an intrinsically disordered c terminal domain ctd    residues  not conserved in its escherichia coli prototype nei although dispensable for neil s lesion excision and ap lyase activities this segment is required for efficient in vivo enzymatic activity and may provide an interaction interface for many of neil s interactions with other base excision repair proteins here we show that the ctd interacts with the folded domain in native neil containing   residues the ctd is poised for local folding in an ordered structure that is induced in the purified fragment by osmolytes furthermore deletion of the disordered tail lacking both tyr and trp residues causes a red shift in neil s intrinsic trp specific fluorescence indicating a more solvent exposed environment for the trp residues in the truncated protein which also exhibits reduced stability compared to the native enzyme these observations are consistent with stabilization of the native neil structure via intramolecular mostly electrostatic interactions that were disrupted by mutating a positively charged lys rich cluster of residues amino acids      near the c terminus small angle x ray scattering saxs analysis confirms the flexibility and dynamic nature of neil s ctd a feature that may be critical to providing specificity for neil s multiple functional interactions
