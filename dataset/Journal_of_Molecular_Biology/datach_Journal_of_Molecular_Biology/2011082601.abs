dimeric plant rhogaps are regulated by its crib effector motif to stimulate a sequential gtp hydrolysis
ropgaps are gtpase activating proteins gaps for plant rho proteins rops  the largest ropgap family is characterized by the plant specific combination of a classical rhogap domain and a cdc  rac interactive binding crib motif which in animal and fungi has never been found in gaps but in effectors for cdc  and rac  very little is known about the molecular mechanism of the ropgap activity including the regulatory role of the crib motif previously we have shown that they are dimeric and form a   complex with rops here we analyze the kinetics of the gap mediated gtp hydrolysis of rops using wild type and mutant ropgap from arabidopsis thaliana for an efficient gap activity ropgap requires both the catalytic arg  in its gap domain indicating a similar catalytic machinery as in animal rhogaps and the crib motif which mediates high affinity and specificity in binding the dimeric ropgap is unique in that it stimulates rop gtp hydrolysis in a sequential manner with a  fold difference between the hydrolysis rates of the two active sites using particular crib point and deletion mutants lead us to conclude that the sequential mechanism is likely due to steric hindrance induced by the arg fingers and or the crib motifs after binding of two rop molecules
