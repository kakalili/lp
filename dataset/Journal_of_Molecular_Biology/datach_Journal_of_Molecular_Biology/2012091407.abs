flexibility of groes mobile loop is required for efficient chaperonin function
chaperonin groel and its partner groes assist the folding of nascent and stress damaged proteins in an atp dependent manner free groes has a flexible  mobile loop  and binds to groel through the residues at the tip of the loop capping the central cavity of groel to provide the substrate polypeptide a cage for secure in cage folding here we show that restriction of the flexibility of the loop by a disulfide cross linking between cysteines within the loop results in the inefficient formation of a stable groel  polypeptide  groes ternary complex and inefficient folding then we generated substrate proteins with enhanced binding affinity to groel by fusion of one or two sbp strongly binding peptide for groel sequences and examined the effect of disulfide cross linking on the assisted folding the results indicate that the higher the binding affinity of the substrate polypeptide to groel the greater the contribution of the mobile loop flexibility to efficient in cage folding it is likely that the flexibility helps groes capture groel s binding sites that are already occupied by the substrate polypeptide with various binding modes
