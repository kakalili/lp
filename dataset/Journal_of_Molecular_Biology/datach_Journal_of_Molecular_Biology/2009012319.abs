regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis by cell surface expression of kinase dead ddr
the assembly of collagen fibers the major component of the extracellular matrix ecm  governs a variety of physiological processes collagen fibrillogenesis is a tightly controlled process in which several factors including collagen binding proteins have a crucial role discoidin domain receptors ddr and ddr  are receptor tyrosine kinases that bind to and are phosphorylated upon collagen binding the phosphorylation of ddrs is known to activate matrix metalloproteases which in turn cleave the ecm in our earlier studies we established a novel mechanism of collagen regulation by ddrs that is the extracellular domain ecd of ddr  when used as a purified soluble protein inhibits collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro to extend this novel observation the current study investigates how the ddr ecd when expressed as a membrane anchored cell surface protein affects collagen fibrillogenesis by cells we generated a mouse osteoblast cell line that stably expresses a kinase deficient form of ddr  termed ddr  kd on its cell surface transmission electron microscopy fluorescence microscopy and hydroxyproline assays demonstrated that the expression of ddr  kd reduced the rate and abundance of collagen deposition and induced significant morphological changes in the resulting fibers taken together our observations extend the functional roles that ddr and possibly other membrane anchored collagen binding proteins can play in the regulation of cell adhesion migration proliferation and in the remodeling of the extracellular matrix
