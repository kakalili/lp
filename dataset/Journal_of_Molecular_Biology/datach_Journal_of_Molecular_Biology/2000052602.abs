the atomic structure of pentameric lumazine synthase from saccharomyces cerevisiae at     resolution reveals the binding mode of a phosphonate intermediate analogue edited by r huber
lumazine synthase of saccharomyces cerevisiae is a homopentamer with a molecular weight of  kda crystals of the recombinant enzyme with a size of up to   mm were obtained the space group is p   with lattice dimensions                  x ray diffraction data collected under cryogenic conditions were complete to     resolution the structure of the enzyme in complex with the intermediate analogue    d ribitylamino   dihydroxypyrimidine  yl  pentyl phosphonic acid was solved via molecular replacement using the structure of the bacillus subtilis enzyme as search model and was refined to a final r factor of     rfree     the conformation of the active site ligand of the enzyme mimicks that of the schiff base intermediate of the enzyme catalyzed reaction the data enable the reconstruction of the reactant topology during the early steps of the catalytic reaction structural determinants which are likely to be responsible for the inability of the s cerevisiae enzyme to form icosahedral capsids will be discussed
