interaction of e coli hsp  with dnak involves the dnaj binding region of dnak
the  kda heat shock protein hsp  is a widely conserved and ubiquitous molecular chaperone that participates in atp dependent protein remodeling in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes it functions in conjunction with hsp  and the hsp  cochaperones an hsp  j protein and a nucleotide exchange factor in escherichia coli the functional collaboration between hsp ec and hsp  dnak requires that the two chaperones directly interact we used molecular docking to model the interaction of hsp ec and dnak the top ranked docked model predicted that a region in the nucleotide binding domain nbd of dnak interacted with a region in the middle domain of hsp ec we then made substitution mutants in dnak residues suggested by the model to interact with hsp ec of the  mutants tested   were defective or partially defective in their ability to interact with hsp ec in vivo in a bacterial two hybrid assay and in vitro in a bio layer interferometry assay these dnak mutants were also defective in their ability to function collaboratively in protein remodeling with hsp ec but retained the ability to act with dnak cochaperones taken together these results suggest that a specific region in the nbd of dnak is involved in the interaction with hsp ec and this interaction is functionally important moreover the region of dnak that we found to be necessary for hsp ec binding includes residues that are also involved in j protein binding suggesting a functional interplay among dnak dnak cochaperones and hsp ec
