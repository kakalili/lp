electrostatic interactions in leucine zippers thermodynamic analysis of the contributions of glu and his residues and the effect of mutating salt bridges
electrostatic interactions play a complex role in stabilizing proteins here we present a rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the contribution of individual glu and his residues to the relative ph dependent stability of the designed disulfide linked leucine zipper abss the contribution of an ionized side chain to the ph dependent stability is related to the shift of the pka induced by folding of the coiled coil structure pkaf values of ten glu and two his side chains in folded abss and the corresponding pkau values in unfolded peptides with partial sequences of abss were determined by h nmr spectroscopy of four glu residues not involved in ion pairing two are destabilizing     kj mol   and two are interacting with the positive  helix dipoles and are thus stabilizing    kj mol   in charged form the two his residues positioned in the c terminal moiety of abss interact with the negative  helix dipoles resulting in net stabilization of the coiled coil conformation carrying charged his     kj mol    of the six glu residues involved in inter helical salt bridges three are destabilizing and three are stabilizing in charged form the net contribution of salt bridged glu side chains being destabilizing     kj mol    the sum of the individual contributions of protonated glu and his to the higher stability of abss at acidic ph     kj mol   agrees with the difference in stability determined by thermal unfolding at ph  and ph      kj mol    to confirm salt bridge formation the positive charge of the basic partner residue of one stabilizing and one destabilizing glu was removed by isosteric mutations lys  norleucine arg  norvaline  both mutations destabilize the coiled coil conformation at neutral ph and increase the pka of the formerly ion paired glu side chain verifying the formation of a salt bridge even in the case where a charged side chain is destabilizing because removing charges by a double mutation cycle mainly discloses the immediate charge  charge effect mutational analysis tends to overestimate the overall energetic contribution of salt bridges to protein stability
