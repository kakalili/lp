a new versatile immobilization tag based on the ultra high affinity and reversibility of the calmodulin  calmodulin binding peptide interaction
reversible high affinity immobilization tags are critical tools for myriad biological applications however inherent issues are associated with a number of the current methods of immobilization particularly a critical element in phage display sorting is functional immobilization of target proteins to circumvent these problems we have used a mutant n a of calmodulin binding peptide cbp as an immobilization tag in phage display sorting the immobilization relies on the ultra high affinity of calmodulin to n a mutant cbp rwkknfiavsaanrfkkis in presence of calcium kd pm  which can be reversed by edta allowing controlled  capture and release  of the specific binders to evaluate the capabilities of this system we chose eight targets some of which were difficult to overexpress and purify with other tags and some had failed in sorting experiments in all cases specific binders were generated using a fab phage display library with cbp fused constructs kd values of the fabs were in subnanomolar to low nanomolar nm ranges and were successfully used to selectively recognize antigens in cell based experiments some of these targets were problematic even without any tag thus the fact that all led to successful selection endpoints means that borderline cases can be worked on with a high probability of a positive outcome taken together with examples of successful case specific high level applications like generation of conformation  epitope and domain specific fabs we feel that the cbp tag embodies all the attributes of covalent immobilization tags but does not suffer from some of their well documented drawbacks
