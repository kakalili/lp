alkylating agent and chromatin structure determine sequence context dependent formation of alkylpurines edited by i tinoco
we determined the adduct maps of sn and sn alkylating agents in cultured human cells in vivo and in vitro to probe dna protein interactions along sequences of the promoter and exon  of the fragile x mental retardation  fmr  gene using ligation mediated polymerase chain reaction lmpcr  we compared the piperidine sensitive alkylpurines sites generated by treating cultured cells in vivo and naked dna in vitro with sn  n methyl n nitrosourea n nitroso acetoxymethyl methylamine and  methyl  nitro  nitrosoguanidine and sn alkylating agents dimethyl sulfate dms  methane sulfonic acid methyl ester iodo methane diethyl sulfate methane sulfonic acid ethyl ester and iodo ethane  the fmr promoter has four sites where dna protein interactions are observed in these regions the sn methylating agent reactions produced only hypo reactive sites in contrast iodoalkane sn alkylating agents mei and eti reactions generated only hyper reactive sites although there are hyper reactive sites for the other sn reagents the hyper reactive site at   on the fmr map is more pronounced for the sulfate and sulfonate derived alkylating agents than for the iodoalkanes however dms modification in the presence of methyl sulfone a compound that does not alkylate dna eliminates the hyper reactive site observed at   this suggests that the electron rich oxygen atoms of the sulfate and sulfonate derived sn alkylating agent structure position the alkylating moiety to the neighboring n  guanine position to favor alkyl transfer to the guanine using kmno to probe for single strand dna an unpaired cytosine base was detected at the   side of the hyper reactive guanine base at position   consistent with the formation of a local dna single strand bulge in conclusion we show that the sequence context dependent formation of alkylpurines is determined by the chemical nature of the alkylating agent the dna sequence context chromatin structure and the presence of other non reactive molecules that can inhibit alkylation
