crystal structures of cusc review conformational changes accompanying folding and transmembrane channel formation
gram negative bacteria such as escherichia coli frequently utilize tripartite efflux complexes in the rnd resistance  nodulation  cell division family to expel diverse toxic compounds from the cell these complexes span both the inner and outer membranes of the bacterium via an  helical inner membrane transporter a periplasmic membrane fusion protein and a  barrel outer membrane channel one such efflux system cuscba is responsible for extruding biocidal cu i and ag i ions to remove these toxic ions the cusc outer membrane channel must form a  barrel structural domain which creates a pore and spans the entire outer membrane we here report the crystal structures of wild type cusc as well as two cusc mutants suggesting that the first n terminal cysteine residue plays an important role in protein  membrane interactions and is critical for the insertion of this channel protein into the outer membrane these structures provide insight into the mechanisms on cusc folding and transmembrane channel formation it is found that the interactions between cusc and membrane may be crucial for controlling the opening and closing of this  barrel outer membrane channel
