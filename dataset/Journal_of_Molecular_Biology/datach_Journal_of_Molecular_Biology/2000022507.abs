crystal structure of amylomaltase from thermus aquaticus a glycosyltransferase catalysing the production of large cyclic glucans edited by r huber
amylomaltase is involved in the metabolism of starch one of the most important polysaccharides in nature a unique feature of amylomaltase is its ability to catalyze the formation of cyclic amylose in contrast to the well studied cyclodextrin glucanotransferases cgtases  which synthesize cycloamylose with a ring size degree of polymerization or dp of   the amylomaltase from thermus aquaticus produces cycloamyloses with a dp of  and higher the crystal structure of amylomaltase from thermus aquaticus was determined to    resolution it is a member of the  amylase superfamily of enzymes whose core structure consists of a      barrel in amylomaltase the  fold symmetry of this barrel is disrupted by several insertions between the barrel strands the largest insertions are between the third and fifth barrel strands where two insertions form subdomain b  as well as between the second and third barrel strands forming the  helical subdomain b  whereas part of subdomain b is also present in other enzyme structures of the  amylase superfamily subdomain b is unique to amylomaltase remarkably the c terminal domain c which is present in all related enzymes of the  amylase family is missing in amylomaltase amylomaltase shows a similar arrangement of the catalytic side chains two asp residues and one glu residue as in previously characterized members of the  amylase superfamily indicating similar mechanisms of the glycosyl transfer reaction in amylomaltase a conserved loop of around eight amino acid residues is partially shielding the active center this loop which is well conserved among other amylomaltases may sterically hinder the formation of small cyclic products
