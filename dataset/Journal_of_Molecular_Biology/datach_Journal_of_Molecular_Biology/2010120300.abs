the three dimensional structure of akr b  a glycerol dehydrogenase from gluconobacter oxydans reveals a tryptophan residue as an accelerator of reaction turnover
the nadp dependent glycerol dehydrogenase ec      from gluconobacter oxydans is a member of family  of the aldo  keto reductase akr enzyme superfamily according to the systematic nomenclature within the akr superfamily the term akr b has been assigned to the enzyme akr b is a biotechnologically attractive enzyme because of its broad substrate spectrum combined with its distinctive regioselectivity and stereoselectivity these features can be partially rationalized based on a   crystal structure of apo akr b  which we describe and interpret here against the functional complex structures of other members of family  of the akr superfamily the structure of akr b shows the akr typical     tim barrel fold with three loops and the c terminal tail determining the particular enzymatic properties in comparison to akr b  its closest akr relative  akr b has a relatively broad binding cleft for the cosubstrate nadp nadph in the crystalline environment it is completely blocked by the c terminal segment of a neighboring protomer the structure reveals a conspicuous tryptophan residue trp  that has to adopt an unconventional and strained side chain conformation to permit cosubstrate binding we predict and confirm by site directed mutagenesis that trp  is an accelerator of co substrate turnover furthermore we show that simultaneously this tryptophan residue is a critical determinant for substrate binding by the enzyme while enantioselectivity is probably governed by a methionine residue within the c terminal tail we present structural reasons for these notions based on ternary complex models of akr b  nadp and either octanal d glyceraldehyde or l glyceraldehyde
