repurposing a bacterial quality control mechanism to enhance enzyme production in living cells
heterologous expression of many proteins in bacteria yeasts and plants is often limited by low titers of functional protein to address this problem we have created a two tiered directed evolution strategy in escherichia coli that enables optimization of protein production while maintaining high biological activity the first tier involves a genetic selection for intracellular protein stability that is based on the folding quality control mechanism inherent to the twin arginine translocation pathway while the second is a semi high throughput screen for protein function to demonstrate the utility of this strategy we isolated variants of the endoglucanase cel a from the plant pathogenic fungus fusarium graminearum whose production was increased by as much as  fold over the parental enzyme this gain in production was attributed to just two amino acid substitutions and it was isolated after two iterations through the two tiered approach there was no significant tradeoff in activity on soluble or insoluble cellulose substrates importantly by combining the folding filter afforded by the twin arginine translocation quality control mechanism with a function based screen we show enrichment for variants with increased protein abundance in a manner that does not compromise catalytic activity providing a highly soluble parent for engineering of improved or new function
