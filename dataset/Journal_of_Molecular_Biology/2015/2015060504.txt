Complex protein networks are involved in nearly all cellular processes. To uncover these vast networks of protein interactions, various high-throughput screening technologies have been developed. Over the last decade, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay has been widely used to detect proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) in living cells. This technique is based on the reconstitution of a fluorescent protein in vivo. Easy quantification of the BiFC signals allows effective cell-based high-throughput screenings for protein binding partners and drugs that modulate PPIs. Recently, with the development of large screening libraries, BiFC has been effectively applied for genome-wide PPI studies and has uncovered novel protein interactions, providing new insight into protein functions. In this review, we describe the development of reagents and methods used for BiFC-based screens in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells. We also discuss the advantages and drawbacks of these methods and highlight the application of BiFC in large-scale studies.
