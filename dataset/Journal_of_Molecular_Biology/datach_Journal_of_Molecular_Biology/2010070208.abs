asymmetric recruitment of ciaps by traf
cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein ciap  and ciap set the balance between transcription factor and apoptosis signaling downstream of tumor necrosis factor tnf receptor superfamily members by acting as ubiquitin e ligases for substrates that are part of the tnf receptor complex to fulfill this role ciaps must be recruited to the receptor complex by tnf receptor associated factor traf   in this study we reconstituted the complex between baculoviral iap repeat bir  of ciap and the coiled coil region of traf  solved the structure of bir from ciap  and mapped key binding residues on each molecule using mutagenesis biophysical analysis indicates that a single bir domain binds the trimeric traf coiled coil domain this suggests that only one iap molecule binds to each traf trimer and makes it likely that the dimeric ciaps crosslink two traf trimers
