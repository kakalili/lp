protection of xenopus laevis embryos against alcohol induced delayed gut maturation and growth retardation by peroxiredoxin  and catalase
accumulated evidence indicates that maternal alcohol consumption causes fetal enteric damage and growth retardation in this study we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms in a xenopus model of fetal alcohol exposure we established a condition of transient alcohol exposure that produces tadpoles with delayed gut maturation and decreased body length we then investigated the roles of reactive oxygen species ros and reactive nitrogen species rns by microinjecting plasmids expressing catalase and peroxiredoxin  prdx  into two cell stage embryos finally the effects of these enzymes on the expression of key gut developmental genes were determined by animal cap explant assay we showed that exposure of xenopus embryos to   alcohol from stage  to stage  produced tadpoles with delayed gut maturation reduced growth and down regulation in several gut developmental genes with vegt pax and sox  most vulnerable we further demonstrated that microinjection of catalase attenuated alcohol induced ros production and restored the expression of vegt and pax  but protected the embryos from delayed gut development and retarded growth only partially by contrast microinjection of prdx reduced both ros and rns production and prevented the gut and growth defects and restored vegt pax and sox  gene expression a positive correlation was found between delayed gut maturation and reduced body length these results indicate the crucial roles of both the ros pax and rns sox  signaling axes in alcohol induced fetal gut defects and growth retardation in addition they suggest strongly a cause and effect relationship between alcohol induced delayed gut maturation and growth retardation
