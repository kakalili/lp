resq an approach to unified estimation of b factor and residue specific error in protein structure prediction
computer based structure prediction becomes a major tool to provide large scale structure models for annotating biological function of proteins information of residue level accuracy and thermal mobility or b factor  which is critical to decide how biologists utilize the predicted models is however missed in most structure prediction pipelines we developed resq for unified residue level model quality and b factor estimations by combining local structure assembly variations with sequence based and structure based profiling resq was tested on   non redundant proteins with structure models generated by i tasser where the average difference between estimated and observed distance errors is    for the confidently modeled proteins resq was further tested on structure decoys from casp   experiments where the error of local structure quality prediction is consistently lower than or comparable to other state of the art predictors finally resq b factor profile was used to assist molecular replacement which resulted in successful solutions on several proteins that could not be solved from constant b factor settings
