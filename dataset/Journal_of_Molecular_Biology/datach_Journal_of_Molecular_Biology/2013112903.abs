multiple c terminal tails within a single e coli ssb homotetramer coordinate dna replication and repair
escherichia coli single stranded dna binding protein ssb plays essential roles in dna replication recombination and repair ssb functions as a homotetramer with each subunit possessing a dna binding domain ob fold and an intrinsically disordered c terminus of which the last nine amino acids provide the site for interaction with at least a dozen other proteins that function in dna metabolism to examine how many c termini are needed for ssb function we engineered covalently linked forms of ssb that possess only one or two c termini within a four ob fold  tetramer   whereas e coli expressing ssb with only two tails can survive expression of a single tailed ssb is dominant lethal e coli expressing only the two tailed ssb recovers faster from exposure to dna damaging agents but accumulates more mutations a single tailed ssb shows defects in coupled leading and lagging strand dna replication and does not support replication restart in vitro these deficiencies in vitro provide a plausible explanation for the lethality observed in vivo these results indicate that a single ssb tetramer must interact simultaneously with multiple protein partners during some essential roles in genome maintenance
