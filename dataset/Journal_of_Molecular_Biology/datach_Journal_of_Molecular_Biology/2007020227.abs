towards elucidation of the mechanism of uv c a deoxyribozyme with photolyase activity
among the unexpected chemistries that can be catalyzed by nucleic acid enzymes is photochemistry we have reported the in vitro selection of a small cofactor independent deoxyribozyme uv c capable of repairing thymine dimers in a dna substrate most optimally with light at a wavelength of gt   nm we hypothesized that a guanine quadruplex functioned both as a light antenna and an electron source for the repair of the substrate within the enzyme  substrate complex here we report structural and mechanistic investigations of that hypothesis contact crosslinking and guanosine to inosine mutational studies reveal that the thymine dimer and the guanine quadruplex are positioned close to each other in the deoxyribozyme  substrate complex and permit us to refine the structure and topology of the folded deoxyribozyme in exploring the substrate utilization capabilities of uv c we find it to be able to repair uracil dimers as well as thymine dimers as long as they are present in an overall deoxyribonucleotide milieu some surprising similarities with bacterial cpd photolyase enzymes are noted
