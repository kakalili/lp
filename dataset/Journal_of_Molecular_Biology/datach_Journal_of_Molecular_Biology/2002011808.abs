the high affinity interaction of human il  and the receptor  chain is constituted by two independent binding clusters edited by i wilson
il bp the extracellular binding domain of the il  receptor  chain contains a high affinity binding epitope for il  kd   pm  previous results on the crystal structure of the il  il bp complex and on the functional epitope of il  suggested that this contact comprises a mosaic of two binding clusters the present mutational analysis of il bp supports this view and demonstrates that the energetically most important group is the receptor carboxylate group of d  forming an ion pair with il  r  in cluster ii the second main receptor determinant is the hydroxyl group of y  forming a hydrogen bond with il  e in cluster i the latter is engaged in additional hydrogen bonds with y  and also in van der waals contacts with y   receptor residue d  as well as y  are each surrounded by a shell of hydrophobic groups from residues that upon mutation lead to smaller decreases in binding affinity analysis of il bp double mutants showed that receptor side chains within one cluster but not those of different clusters cooperate interaction analysis of il  and il bp single mutants also revealed additivity in binding of side chains between clusters and cooperativity within each cluster i or ii these results show that the high affinity il  il bp contact is constituted by two independent binding units each containing a central polar or charged side chain surrounded by hydrophobic groups avocado cluster
