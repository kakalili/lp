ligands differentially modulate the protein interactions of the human estrogen receptors  and
the interactions of human estrogen receptor subtypes er  and er  with dna and a   amino acid residue fragment of the coactivator protein src  bearing three nuclear receptor interaction motifs were investigated quantitatively using fluorescence anisotropy in the presence of agonist and antagonist ligands er  and er  were found to bind in a similar manner to dna and both salt and temperature affected the affinity and or stoichiometry of these interactions the agonist ligands estradiol estrone and estriol did not modify the binding of er  to the fluorescein labeled target estrogen response element however in the case of er  these ligands led to the formation of some higher order protein  dna complexes and a small decrease in affinity the partial agonist  hydroxytamoxifen had little effect on either er subtype whereas the pure antagonist ici     led to the cooperative formation of protein  dna complexes of higher order than dimer as further demonstrated by competition experiments and gel mobility shift assays in addition to dna binding the interaction of both er subtypes with the alexa  labeled src  coactivator fragment was investigated by fluorescence anisotropy the agonist ligands estrone estradiol estriol genistein and ethynyl estradiol exhibited distinct capacities for inducing the recruitment of src  that were not correlated with their affinity for the receptor moreover estrone and genistein exhibited subtype specificity in that they induced src  recruitment to er  with much higher efficiency than in the case of er  the differential coactivator recruitment capacities of the er agonists and their receptor subtype coactivator recruitment specificity may be linked to the molecular structure of the agonists with respect to their interactions with a specific histidine residue located at the back of the ligand binding pocket altogether these quantitative in vitro studies of er interactions reveal the complex energetic and stoichiometric consequences of changes in the chemical structures of these proteins and their ligands
