conformational flexibility of pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes a computational analysis by quantized elastic deformational model
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex pdc is one of the largest multienzyme complexes known and consists of a dodecahedral e core to which other components are attached we report the results of applying a new computational method quantized elastic deformational model to simulating the conformational fluctuations of the truncated e core using low resolution electron cryomicroscopy density maps the motional features are well reproduced especially the symmetric breathing mode revealed in simulation is nearly identical with what was observed experimentally structural details of the motions of the trimeric building blocks which are critical to facilitating the global expansion and contraction of the complex were revealed using the low resolution maps from electron cryomicroscopy reconstructions the simulations showed a picture of the motional mechanism of the pdc core which is an example without precedent of thermally activated global dynamics moreover the current results support an earlier suggestion that at low resolution and without the use of amino acid sequence and atomic coordinates it is possible for computer simulations to provide an accurate description of protein dynamics
