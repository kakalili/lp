isolation of an isoenzyme of human glutaminyl cyclase retention in the golgi complex suggests involvement in the protein maturation machinery
mammalian glutaminyl cyclase isoenzymes isoqcs were identified the analysis of the primary structure of human isoqc h isoqc revealed conservation of the zinc binding motif of the human qc hqc  in contrast to hqc h isoqc carries an n terminal signal anchor the cdnas of human and murine isoqcs were isolated and h isoqc lacking the n terminal signal anchor and the short cytosolic tail was expressed as a fusion protein in escherichia coli h isoqc exhibits  fold lower activity compared to hqc similar to hqc h isoqc was competitively inhibited by imidazoles and cysteamines inactivation by metal chelators suggests a conserved metal dependent catalytic mechanism of both isoenzymes a comparison of the expression pattern of m isoqc and murine qc revealed ubiquitous expression of both enzymes however murine qc transcript formation was higher in neuronal tissue whereas the amount of m isoqc transcripts did not vary significantly between different organs h isoqc was exclusively localized within the golgi complex obviously retained by the n terminus similar resident enzymes of the golgi complex are the glycosyltransferases golgi apparatus retention implies a  housekeeping  protein maturation machinery conducting glycosylation and pyroglutamyl formation for these enzymes apparently similar strategies evolved to retain the proteins in the golgi complex
