crystal structure of a prostate kallikrein isolated from stallion seminal plasma a homologue of human psa
prostate specific kallikrein a member of the gene family of serine proteases was initially discovered in semen and is the most useful serum marker for prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis we report the crystal structure at    resolution of horse prostate kallikrein hpk  this is the first structure of a serine protease purified from seminal plasma hpk shares extensive sequence homology with human prostate specific antigen psa  including a predicted chymotrypsin like specificity as suggested by the presence of a serine residue at position s of the specificity pocket in contrast to other kallikreins hpk shows a structurally distinct specificity pocket its entrance is blocked by the kallikrein loop suggesting a possible protective or substrate selective role for this loop the hpk structure seems to be in an inactivated state and further processing might be required to allow the binding of substrate molecules crystal soaking experiments revealed a binding site for zn  and hg  two known psa inhibitors
