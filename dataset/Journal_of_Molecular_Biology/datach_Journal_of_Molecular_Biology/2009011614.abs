unfolding thermodynamics of the  domain in the prohead i subunit of phage hk  determination by factor analysis of raman spectra
an early step in the morphogenesis of the double stranded dna dsdna bacteriophage hk  is the assembly of a precursor shell prohead i from   copies of a   residue subunit gp  although formation of prohead i requires direct participation of gp residues       domain  this domain is eliminated by viral protease prior to subsequent shell maturation and dna packaging the prohead i  domain is thought to resemble a phage scaffolding protein by virtue of its highly  helical secondary structure and a tertiary fold that projects inward from the interior surface of the shell here we employ factor analysis of temperature dependent raman spectra to characterize the thermostability of the  domain secondary structure and to quantify the thermodynamic parameters of  domain unfolding the results are compared for the  domain within the prohead i architecture in situ and for a recombinantly expressed   residue peptide in vitro  we find that the  helicity      median melting temperature tm    c  enthalpy  hm    kcal mol    entropy  sm     cal mol   k    and average cooperative melting unit   nc      of the in situ  domain are altered in vitro indicating specific interdomain interactions within prohead i thus the in vitro  domain despite an enhanced helical secondary structure      helix  exhibits diminished thermostability tm    c  hm    kcal mol    sm    cal mol   k   and noncooperative unfolding   nc     vis  vis the in situ  domain temperature dependent raman markers of subunit side chains particularly those of phe and trp residues also confirm different local interactions for the in situ and in vitro  domains the present results clarify the key role of the gp   domain in prohead i architecture by providing direct evidence of domain structure stabilization and interdomain interactions within the assembled shell
