The 2.3 Ã… resolution crystal structure of a [2Fe-2S] cluster containing ferredoxin from Aquifex aeolicusreveals a thioredoxin-like fold that is novel among iron-sulfur proteins. The [2Fe-2S] cluster is located near the surface of the protein, at a site corresponding to that of the active-site disulfide bridge in thioredoxin. The four cysteine ligands are located near the ends of two surface loops. Two of these ligands can be substituted by non-native cysteine residues introduced throughout a stretch of the polypeptide chain that forms a protruding loop extending away from the cluster. The presence of homologs of this ferredoxin as components of more complex anaerobic and aerobic electron transfer systems indicates that this is a versatile fold for biological redox processes.
