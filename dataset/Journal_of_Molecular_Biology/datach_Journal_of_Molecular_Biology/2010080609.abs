the unfolded state of the murine prion protein and properties of single point mutants related to human prion diseases
the prion protein can exist both in a normal cellular isoform and in a pathogenic conformational isoform the latter is responsible for the development of different neurodegenerative diseases for example creutzfeldt jakob disease or fatal familial insomnia to convert the native benign state of the protein into a highly ordered fibrillar aggregate large scale rearrangements of the tertiary structure are necessary during the conversion process and intermediates that are at least partially unfolded are present during fibril formation in addition to the sporadic conversion into the pathogenic isoform more than  familial diseases are known that are caused by single point mutations increasing the probability of aggregation and neurodegeneration here we demonstrate that the chemically denatured states of the mouse and human prion proteins have very similar structural and dynamic characteristics initial studies on the single point mutants e  k f  s v  i and r  h of the oxidized mouse construct which are related to human prion diseases reveal significant differences in the rate of aggregation aggregation for mutants v  i and r  h is slower than it is for the wild type and the constructs e  k and f  s show accelerated aggregation these differences in aggregation behaviour are not correlated with the thermal stability of the mutants indicating different mechanisms promoting the conformational conversion process
