three dimensional structure determined for a subunit of human trna splicing endonuclease sen  reveals a novel dimeric fold
splicing of eukaryal intron containing trnas requires the action of the heterotetrameric splicing endonuclease which is composed of two catalytic subunits sen  and sen  and two structural subunits sen  and sen  here we report the solution structure of the human trna splicing endonuclease subunit hssen  to facilitate the structure determination we removed the disordered  n terminal and  c terminal residues of the full length protein to produce hssen       the structure of hssen       the first for a subunit of a eukaryal splicing endonuclease revealed that the protein possesses a novel homodimeric fold each monomer consists of three  helices and a mixed antiparallel parallel  sheet arranged in a topology similar to that of the c terminal domain of methanocaldococcus jannaschii endonuclease the dimeric interface is dominated by a  barrel structure formed by face to face packing of two three stranded  sheets each of the  sheets results from reciprocal parallel pairing of one  strand from one subunit with two other  strands from the symmetric subunit the structural model provides insights into the functional assembly of the human trna splicing endonuclease
