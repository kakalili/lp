CENP-A is a centromere-specific histone H3 variant that is required for kinetochore assembly and accurate chromosome segregation. For it to function properly, CENP-A must be specifically localized to centromeres. In fission yeast, Scm3sp and the Mis18 complex, composed of Mis16, Eic1, and Mis18, function as a CENP-ACnp1-specific chaperone and a recruiting factor, respectively, and together ensure accurate delivery of CENP-ACnp1 to centromeres. Although how Scm3sp specifically recognizes CENP-ACnp1 has been revealed recently, the recruiting mechanism of CENP-ACnp1 via the Mis18 complex remains unknown. In this study, we have determined crystal structures of Schizosaccharomyces japonicus Mis16 alone and in complex with the helix 1 of histone H4 (H4α1). Crystal structures followed by mutant analysis and affinity pull-downs have revealed that Mis16 recognizes both H4α1 and Scm3sp independently within the CENP-ACnp1/H4:Scm3sp complex. This observation suggests that Mis16 gains CENP-ACnp1 specificity by recognizing both Scm3sp and histone H4. Our studies provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying specific recruitment of CENP-ACnp1/H4:Scm3sp into centromeres.
