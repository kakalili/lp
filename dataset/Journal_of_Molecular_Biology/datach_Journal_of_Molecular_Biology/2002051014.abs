sequence specific and non specific binding of the rci protein to the asymmetric recombination sites of the r  shufflon
specific cleavages within the shufflon specific recombination site of plasmid r  were detected by primer extension when a dna fragment carrying the recombination site was incubated with the shufflon specific rci recombinase rci dependent cleavages occurred in the form of a   protruding bp staggered cut suggesting that dna cleavage and rejoining in the shufflon system take place at these positions as a result shufflon crossover sites were designated as sfx sequences consisting of a central bp spacer sequence and left and right  bp arms r  sfx sequences are unique among various site specific recombination sites since only the spacer sequence and the right arm sequence are conserved among various r  sfxs whereas the left arm sequence is not conserved and is not related to the right arm sequence from nuclease protection analyses rci protein was shown to bind to entire r  and artificial sfx sequences suggesting that one rci molecule binds to the conserved sfx right arm in a sequence specific manner and the second to the sfx left arm in a non specific manner the sfx left arm sequences as well as the right arm sequences were shown to determine affinity to rci and subsequently inversion frequency asymmetry of the sfx sequence may be the reason why rci protein acts only on the inverted sfx sequences
