antibody inhibition of the transcriptase activity of the rotavirus dlp a structural view edited by m f moody
on entering the host cell the rotavirus virion loses its outer shell to become a double layered particle dlp  the dlp then transcribes the  segments of its dsrna genome using its own transcriptase complex and the mature mrna emerges along the  fold axis in order to better understand the transcription mechanism and the role of vp in transcription we have studied three monoclonal antibodies against vp  rv   which inhibits the transcriptase activity of the dlp and rv   and rv   which have no effect on transcription the structures obtained by cryo electron microscopy of the dlp fab complexes and by x ray crystallography of the vp trimer and the vp fab   complex have been combined to give pseudo atomic structures steric hindrance between the fabs results in limited fab occupancy in particular there are on average only three of a possible five fabs   which point towards the  fold axis thus fabs   are not in a position to block the exiting mrna nor is there any visible conformational change in vp on antibody binding at a resolution of    however the epitope of the inhibiting antibody involves two vp monomers whereas those of the non inhibiting antibodies have an epitope on only one vp  thus the inhibition of transcription may be a result of inhibition of a possible change in the vp conformation associated with the transcription of mrna
