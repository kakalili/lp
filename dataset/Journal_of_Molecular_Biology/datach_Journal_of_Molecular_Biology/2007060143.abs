afsr recruits rna polymerase to the afss promoter a model for transcriptional activation by sarps
afsr a protein belonging to the streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein sarp family is a global regulator of secondary metabolism in streptomyces coelicolor a   afsr consists of three major functional domains an n terminal sarp domain a central atpase domain and a c terminal tetratrico peptide repeat tpr domain two truncated afsr proteins afsr tpr containing the sarp and atpase domains and afsr c containing only the sarp domain exhibited the same dna binding specificity as that of full length afsr two monomers bound cooperatively to a direct repeat located eight nucleotides   to the    element of the afss promoter both truncated afsr proteins as well as full length afsr were able to form ternary complexes with the afss promoter and rna polymerase rnap  although rnap alone could not bind to the dna the dna afsr c  rnap complex was capable of initiating afss transcription in vitro indicating that the atpase and tpr domains are dispensable for the basic function of afsr as a transcriptional activator however the atpase domain was required to fully compensate for the defect in actinorhodin production in an afsr disrupted mutant suggesting that the atpase domain exerts a regulatory function on the basic sarp domain deletion or addition of even a single nucleotide between the afsr binding site and the    element of the afss promoter abolished afss transcription both in vitro and in vivo indicating that the recruitment of rnap by afsr to the correct location relative to the    element is critical for transcriptional activation since sarp binding sites with similar direct repeats are located at the same position relative to the    element of their target promoters as is the afss binding site the sarp family members presumably activate transcription of their targets by recruiting rnap to the promoter where a ternary dna  sarp  rnap complex competent for transcriptional initiation is formed
