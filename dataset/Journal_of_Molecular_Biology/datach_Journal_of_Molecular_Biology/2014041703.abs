the c terminal domain of sra p has a fold more similar to prp  than to an rrm and does not directly bind to the sra rna str region
steroid receptor activator rna protein sra p is the translation product of the bi functional long non coding rna steroid receptor activator rna  sra  that is part of the steroid receptor coactivator  acetyltransferase complex and is indicated to be an epigenetic regulatory component previously the sra p protein was suggested to contain an rna recognition motif rrm domain we have determined the solution structure of the c terminal domain of human sra p by nmr spectroscopy our structure along with sequence comparisons among sra p orthologs and against authentic rrm proteins indicates that it is not an rrm domain but rather an all helical protein with a fold more similar to the prp  splicing factor nmr spectroscopy on the full sra p protein suggests that this structure is relevant to the native full length context furthermore molecular modeling indicates that this fold is well conserved among vertebrates amino acid variations in this protein seen across sequenced human genomes including those in tumor cells indicate that mutations that disrupt the fold occur vary rarely and highlight that its function is well conserved sra p had previously been suggested to bind to the sra rna but nmr spectra of sra p in the presence of its  nt rna target suggest otherwise and indicate that this protein must be part of a multi protein complex in order to recognize its proposed rna recognition element
