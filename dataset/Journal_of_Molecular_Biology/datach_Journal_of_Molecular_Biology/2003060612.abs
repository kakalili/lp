the folding mechanism of a two domain protein folding kinetics and domain docking of the gene  protein of phage fd
the gene  protein g p of filamentous phages is essential for the infection of escherichia coli the carboxy terminal domain anchors this protein in the phage coat whereas the two amino terminal domains n and n protrude from the phage surface we analyzed the folding mechanism of the two domain fragment n n of g p g p   and the interplay between folding and domain assembly for this analysis a variant of g p  was used that contained four stabilizing mutations iihy g p   the observed refolding kinetics extend from  ms to several hours domain n refolds very rapidly with a time constant of   ms at   m guanidinium chloride    c both as a part of iihy g p  and as an isolated protein fragment the refolding of domain n is slower and involves two reactions with time constants of seven seconds and  seconds these folding reactions of the individual domains are followed by a very slow spectroscopically silent docking process which shows a time constant of   seconds this reaction was detected by a kinetic unfolding assay for native molecules before docking n and n unfold fast and independently after docking they unfold slowly in a correlated fashion a high energy barrier is thus created by domain docking which protects g p kinetically against unfolding the slow domain docking is possibly important for the infection of e coli by the phage upon binding to the f pilus the n domain separates from n and the binding site for tola on domain n is exposed since domain reassembly is so slow this binding site remains accessible until pilus retraction has brought n close to tola on the bacterial surface
