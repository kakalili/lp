escherichia coli pria helicase fork binding orients the helicase to unwind the lagging strand side of arrested replication forks edited by m gottesman
escherichia coli pria is a primosome assembly protein with   to   helicase activity whose apparent function is to promote resumption of dna synthesis following replication fork arrest here we describe how initiation of helicase activity on dna forks is influenced by both fork structure and by single strand dna binding protein pria could recognize and unwind forked substrates where one or both arms were primarily duplex and pria required a small two bases or larger single stranded gap at the fork in order to initiate unwinding the helicase was most active on substrates with a duplex lagging strand arm and a single stranded leading strand arm on this substrate pria was capable of translocating on either the leading or lagging strands to unwind the duplex ahead of the fork or the lagging strand duplex respectively fork specific binding apparently orients the helicase domain to unwind the lagging strand duplex binding of single strand binding protein to forked templates could inhibit unwinding of the duplex ahead of the fork but not unwinding of the lagging strand duplex or translocation on the lagging strand template while single strand binding protein could inhibit binding of pria to the minimal unforked dna substrates it could not inhibit pria binding to forked substrates in the cell single strand binding protein and fork structure may direct pria helicase to translocate along the lagging strand template of forked structures such that the primosome is specifically assembled on that dna strand
