the effects of ligand binding on the backbone dynamics of the kringle  domain of human plasminogen edited by p e wright
the internal motions of the backbone nitrogen atoms of the kringle  domain of human plasminogen k pg were examined in the absence and presence of the ligand   aminocaproic acid these dynamic properties were determined from  n nmr relaxation data in terms of the extended model free parameters the model of isotropic reorientation was found sufficient to account for overall molecular tumbling for both apo and eaca bound k pg the global rotational correlation time  m for apo k pg was       ns while the  m for ligand bound k pg was       ns suggesting that perhaps some small degree of aggregation occurred in the apo form of the kringle module complexation of k pg with ligand mainly reduced those internal motions that occurred on a   ps to  ns time scale the magnitude of the chemical exchange was also attenuated upon ligand binding these data are consistent with studies employing other approaches that suggest that the binding pocket is preformed in k pg
