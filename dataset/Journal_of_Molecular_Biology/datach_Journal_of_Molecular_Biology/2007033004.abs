structural rigidity of a large cavity containing protein revealed by high pressure crystallography
steric constraints charged interactions and many other forces important to protein structure and function can be explored by mutagenic experiments research of this kind has led to a wealth of knowledge about what stabilizes proteins in their folded states to gain a more complete picture requires that we perturb these structures in a continuous manner something mutagenesis cannot achieve with high pressure crystallographic methods it is now possible to explore the detailed properties of proteins while continuously varying thermodynamic parameters here we detail the structural response of the cavity containing mutant l a of t lysozyme as well as its pseudo wild type wt  counterpart to hydrostatic pressure surprisingly the cavity has almost no effect on the pressure response virtually the same changes are observed in wt as in l a under pressure the cavity is most rigid while other regions deform substantially this implies that while some residues may increase the thermodynamic stability of a protein they may also be structurally irrelevant as recently shown the cavity fills with water at pressures above   mpa while retaining its overall size the resultant picture of the protein is one in which conformationally fluctuating side groups provide a liquid like environment but which also contribute to the rigidity of the peptide backbone
