eif b and eif g jointly stimulate eif a atpase and unwinding activities by modulation of the eif a conformational cycle
eukaryotic translation initiation factor a eif a is a dead box protein that participates in translation initiation as an atp dependent rna helicase it is thought to resolve secondary structure elements from the   untranslated region of mrnas to enable ribosome scanning the rna stimulated atpase and atp dependent helicase activities of eif a are enhanced by auxiliary proteins but the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown here we have dissected the effect of eif b and eif g on eif a rna dependent atpase and rna helicase activities and on eif a conformation we show for the first time that yeast eif b like its mammalian counterpart can stimulate rna unwinding by eif a although it does not affect the eif a conformation the eif g middle domain enhances this stimulatory effect and promotes the formation of a closed eif a conformation in the presence of atp and rna the closed state of eif a has been inferred but has not been observed experimentally before eif b and eif g jointly stimulate atp hydrolysis and rna unwinding by eif a and favor the formation of the closed eif a conformer our results reveal distinct functions of eif b and eif g in synergistically stimulating the eif a helicase activity in the mrna scanning process
