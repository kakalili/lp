dynamics and stability in maturation of a t  virus
nudaurelia capensis  virus is a t  icosahedral virus with a bipartite positive sense rna genome expression of the coat protein gene in a baculovirus system was previously shown to result in the formation of procapsids when purified at ph    procapsids are round porous particles     diameter and have t  quasi symmetry reduction of ph from   to   resulted in virus like particles vlp   that are morphologically identical with authentic virions with an icosahedral shaped capsid and a maximum dimension of     vlp  undergoes a maturation cleavage between residues n  and f   creating the covalently independent  peptide residues      that remains associated with the particle this cleavage also occurs in authentic virions and in each case it renders the morphological change irreversible i e  capsids do not expand when the ph is raised back to    however a non cleavable mutant n  t undergoes the transition reversibly nt   nt   we used electron cryo microscopy and three dimensional image reconstruction to study the icosahedral structures of nt   nt   and vlp  at about    and    resolution respectively we employed the     x ray model of the mature virus determined at ph    xr   to establish   how and why procapsid and capsid structures differ   why lowering ph drives the transition and   why the non cleaving nt  is reversible we show that procapsid assembly minimizes the differences in quaternary interactions in the particle the two classes of  fold contacts in the t  surface lattice are virtually identical both mediated by similarly positioned but dynamic  peptides furthermore quasi and icosahedral  fold interactions are indistinguishable maturation results from neutralizing the repulsive negative charge at subunit interfaces with significant differentiation of quaternary interactions one  fold becomes flat mediated by a  peptide while the other is bent with the  peptide disordered and dramatic stabilization of the particle the  peptide at the flat contact remains dynamic when cleavage cannot occur nt   but becomes totally immobilized by noncovalent interactions after cleavage vlp
