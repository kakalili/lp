crosslinking of translation factor ef g to proteins of the bacterial ribosome before and after translocation
elongation factor g ef g promotes the translocation of trna and mrna in the central cavity of the ribosome following the addition of each amino acid residue to a growing polypeptide chain trna mrna translocation is coupled to gtp hydrolysis catalyzed by ef g and activated by the ribosome in this study we probed ef g interactions with ribosomal proteins r proteins of the bacterial ribosome by using a combination of chemical crosslinking immunoblotting and mass spectroscopy analyses we identified three bacterial r proteins l l  s  and l  crosslinked to specific residues of ef g in three of its domains g    and  respectively  ef g crosslinks to l l  and s  were indistinguishable when ef g was trapped on the ribosome before or after trna mrna translocation had occurred whereas a crosslink between ef g and l formed with greater efficiency before translocation had occurred ef g crosslinked to l l  was capable of catalyzing multiple rounds of gtp hydrolysis whereas ef g crosslinked to s  was inactive in gtp hydrolysis these results imply that during the gtp hydrolytic cycle ef g must detach from s  within the central cavity of the ribosome while ef g can remain associated with l l  located on one of the peripheral stalks of the ribosome this mechanism may ensure that a single gtp molecule is hydrolyzed for each trna mrna translocation event
