the role of the conserved switch ii glutamate in guanine nucleotide exchange factor mediated nucleotide exchange of gtp binding proteins
guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs regulate the activity of small g proteins by catalysing the intrinsically slow exchange of gdp for gtp the mechanism involves the formation of trimeric g protein nucleotide  gef complexes followed by the release of nucleotide to form stable binary g protein  gef complexes a number of structural studies of g protein  gef complexes have shown large structural changes induced in the nucleotide binding site together with a recent structure of a trimeric complex these studies have suggested not only some common principles but also large differences in detail in the gef mediated exchange reaction several structures suggested that a glutamic acid residue in switch ii which is part of the dxxgqe motif and highly conserved in ras like g proteins might have a decisive mechanistic role in gef mediated nucleotide exchange reactions here we show that mutation of the switch ii glutamate to ala severely impairs gef catalysed nucleotide exchange in most but not all ras family g proteins explaining its high sequence conservation the residue determines the initial approach of gef to the nucleotide loaded g protein and does not appreciably affect the formation of a binary nucleotide free complex its major effect thus appears to be the removal of the p loop lysine from its interaction with the nucleotide
