transfer rna gene targeted retrotransposition of dictyostelium tre a into a chromosomal ump synthase gene trap
the genome of the eukaryotic microorganism dictyostelium discoideum hosts a family of seven non long terminal repeat retrotransposons tres that show remarkable insertion preferences near trna genes we developed an in vivo assay to detect trna gene targeted retrotransposition of endogenous tres in a reporter strain of d discoideum a trna gene positioned within an artificial intron was placed into the d discoideum ump synthase gene this construct was inserted into the d discoideum genome and presented as a landmark for de novo tre insertions we show that the trna gene tagged ump synthase gene was frequently disrupted by de novo insertions of endogenous tre a copies thus rendering the resulting mutants resistant to  fluoroorotic acid selection approximately   of all isolated  foa resistant clones contained tre a insertions whereas the remaining  resulted from transposition independent mutations the inserted tre as showed complex structural variations and were found about  bp upstream of the reporter trna gene similar to previously analysed genomic copies of tre a no integration by other members of the tre family was observed we found that only   of the de novo insertions were derived from autonomous tre a  copies the remaining   of new insertions were due to tre a  elements which lack the proteins required for reverse transcription and integration but retain functional promoter sequences
