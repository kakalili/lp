blockade of nf  b using i b  dominant negative mice ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy in myotrophin overexpressed transgenic mice
nuclear factor  b nf  b is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates various kinds of genes including inflammatory molecules macrophage infiltration factors cell adhesion molecules and so forth in various disease processes including cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure previously we have demonstrated that activation of nf  b was required in myotrophin induced cardiac hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in dilated cardiomyopathy human hearts moreover our recent study using the myotrophin overexpressed transgenic mouse myo tg model showed that short hairpin rna mediated knockdown of nf  b significantly attenuated cardiac mass associated with improved cardiac function although it has been shown that nf  b is substantially involved in cardiovascular remodeling it is not clear whether the continuous blockade of nf  b is effective in cardiovascular remodeling to address this question we took a genetic approach using i b  triple mutant mice  m bred with myo tg mice a progressive hypertrophy heart failure model  the double transgenic mice myo m displayed an attenuated cardiac hypertrophy      versus      p lt    and improved cardiac function associated with significant inhibition of the nf  b signaling cascade hypertrophy marker gene expression and inflammatory and macrophage gene expression at   weeks of age compared to myo tg mice nf  b targeted gene array profiling displayed several important genes that were significantly downregulated in myo m mice compared to myo tg mice furthermore myo m did not show any changes of apoptotic gene expression indicating that significant inhibition of nf  b activation reduces further proinflammatory reactions without affecting susceptibility to apoptosis therefore development of therapeutic strategies targeting nf  b may provide an effective approach to prevent adverse cardiac pathophysiological consequences
