self association reaction of denatured staphylococcal nuclease fragments characterized by heteronuclear nmr edited by p e wright
the self association reaction of denatured staphylococcal nuclease fragments urea denatured g w   containing residues     and mutation g w and physiologically denatured   residue     have been characterized by nmr at close to neutral ph the two fragments differ in the extent and degree of association due to the different sequence and experimental conditions residues     which show significant exchange line broadening constitute the main association interface in both fragments a second weak association region was identified involving residues     only in the case of urea denatured g w   for residues involved in the association reaction significant suppression of the line broadening and small but systematic chemical shift variation of the amide protons were observed as the protein concentration decreased the direction of chemical shift change suggests that the associated state adopts mainly  sheet like conformation and the  hairpin formed by strands   and   is native like the apparent molecular size obtained by diffusion coefficient measurements shows a weak degree of association for     below   mm protein concentration and for g w  in  m urea in both cases the fragments are predominantly in the monomeric state however the weak association reaction can significantly influence the transverse relaxation of residues involved in the association reaction the degree of association abruptly increases for     above   mm concentration and it is estimated to form a  to  mer at  mm it is proposed that the main region involved in association forms the core structure with the remainder of residues largely disordered in the associated state despite the obvious influence of the association reaction on the slow motion of the backbone the restricted mobility on the nanosecond timescale around the region of strand   is essentially unaffected by the association reaction and degree of denaturation
