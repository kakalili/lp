increase in backbone mobility of the vts p sam domain on binding to sre  rna
the sterile alpha motif sam domain of vts p a posttranscriptional gene regulator belongs to a family of sam domains conserved from yeast to humans even though sam domains were originally classified as protein  protein interaction domains recently it was shown that the yeast vts p sam and the sam domain of its drosophila homolog smaug can specifically recognize rna hairpins termed smaug recognition element sre  structural studies of the sre  rna complex of vts p sam revealed that the sam domain primarily recognizes the shape of the rna fold induced by the watson  crick base pairing in the rna pentaloop only the central g nucleotide is specifically recognized the vts p sam domain recognizes sre  rnas with a cnggn pentaloop where n is any nucleotide the c  g base pair in the wild type can be replaced by any pair of nucleotides that can form base pairs even though the binding affinity is greatest with a pyrimidine in position  and a purine in position  the interaction thus combines elements of sequence specific and non sequence specific recognitions the lack of structural rearrangements in either partner following binding is rather intriguing suggesting that molecular dynamics may play an important role in imparting relaxed specificity with respect to the exact combination of nucleotides in the loop except for the central nucleotide in this work we extend our previous studies of sre  rna interaction with vts p by comparing the dynamics of the vts p sam domain both in its free form and when bound to sre  rna the  n relaxation studies of backbone dynamics suggest the presence of a dynamic interaction interface with residues associated with specific g recognition becoming more rigid on rna binding while other regions attain increased flexibility the results parallel the observations from our studies of dynamics changes in sre  rna upon binding to vts p sam and shows that molecular dynamics could play a crucial role in modulating binding affinity and possibly contribute to the free energy of the interaction through an entropy driven mechanism
