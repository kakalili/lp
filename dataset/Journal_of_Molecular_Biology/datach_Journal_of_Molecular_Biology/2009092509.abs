the genesis of ribosome structure how a protein generates rna structure in real time
ribosomal subunit assembly is initiated by the binding of several primary binding proteins results from chemical modification studies show that  s ribosomal rna undergoes striking structural rearrangements when protein s  is bound for the first time we are able to distinguish and order these structural rearrangements by using time dependent chemical probing initially protein s  binds to a portion of helix   inducing a kink turn in that helix that bends helix  toward the s   helix  complex in a hairpin like manner allowing helix  to bind to protein s  this structural change is rapidly stabilized by interactions at the distal and proximal ends of both rna helices identifying the dynamic nature of interactions between rna and proteins is not only essential in unraveling ribosome assembly but also has more general application to all protein  rna interactions
