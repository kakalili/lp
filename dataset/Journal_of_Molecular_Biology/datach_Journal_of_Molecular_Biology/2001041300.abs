crystal structure of the mj   gene product of the hyperthermophilic archaebacterium methanococcus jannaschii a novel member of the lactate malate family of dehydrogenases edited by r huber
the mj   gene one of the only two genes of methanococcus jannaschii showing sequence similarity to the lactate malate family of dehydrogenases was classified initially as coding for a putative l lactate dehydrogenase ldh  it has been re classified as a malate dehydrogenase mdh gene because it shows significant sequence similarity to mt   mdh ii from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum strain  h the three dimensional structure of its gene product has been determined in two crystal forms a  dimeric  structure in the orthorhombic crystal at    resolution and a  tetrameric  structure in the tetragonal crystal at     these structures share a similar subunit fold with other ldhs and mdhs the tetrameric structure resembles typical tetrameric ldhs the dimeric structure is equivalent to the p dimer of tetrameric ldhs unlike dimeric mdhs which correspond to the q dimer the structure reveals that the cofactor nadp h is bound at the active site despite the fact that it was not intentionally added during protein purification and crystallization the preference of nadp h over nad h has been supported by activity assays the cofactor preference is explained by the presence of a glycine residue in the cofactor binding pocket gly   which replaces a conserved aspartate or glutamate residue in other nad dependent ldhs or mdhs preference for nadp h is contributed by hydrogen bonds between the oxygen atoms of the monophosphate group and the ribose sugar of adenosine in nadp h and the side chains of ser  arg  his  and ser  the mdh activity of mj   is made possible by arg  which is conserved in mdhs but not in ldhs the enzymatic assay showed that the mj   protein possesses the fructose   bisphosphate activated ldh activity reduction  thus the mj   gene product appears to be a novel member of the lactate malate dehydrogenase family displaying an ldh scaffold and exhibiting a relaxed substrate and cofactor specificities in nadp h and nad h dependent malate and lactate dehydrogenase reactions
