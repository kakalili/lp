characterization of the catalytic domain of human apobec b and the critical structural role for a conserved methionine
human apobec b deaminates cytosines in dna and belongs to the aid apobec family of enzymes these proteins are involved in innate and adaptive immunity and may cause mutations in a variety of cancers to characterize its ability to convert cytosines into uracils we tested several derivatives of apobec b gene for their ability to cause mutations in escherichia coli through this analysis a methionine residue at the junction of the amino terminal domain ntd and the carboxy terminal domain ctd was found to be essential for high mutagenicity properties of mutants with substitutions at this position examination of existing molecular structures of apobec family members and molecular modeling suggest that this residue is essential for the structural stability of this family of proteins the apobec b ctd with the highest mutational activity was purified to homogeneity and its kinetic parameters were determined size exclusion chromatography of the ctd monomer showed that it is in equilibrium with its dimeric form and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight analysis of the protein suggested that the dimer may be quite stable the partially purified ntd did not show intrinsic deamination activity and did not enhance the activity of the ctd in biochemical assays finally apobec b was at least  fold less efficient at mutating  methylcytosine  mc to thymine than apobec a in a genetic assay and was at least  fold less efficient at deaminating mc compared to c in biochemical assays these results shed light on the structural organization of apobec b catalytic domain its substrate specificity and its possible role in causing genome wide mutations
