structural biophysics of the nusb nuse antitermination complex
in prokaryotic transcription regulation several host factors form a complex with rna polymerase and the nascent mrna as part of a process known as antitermination two of these host factors nusb and nuse bind to form a heterodimer which interacts with a specific boxa site on the rna the nusb nuse boxa rna ternary complex interacts with the rna polymerase transcription complex stabilizing it and allowing transcription past premature termination points the nusb protein also binds boxa rna individually and retains all specificity for boxa however nuse increases the affinity of rna to nusb in the ternary complex which contributes to efficient antitermination to understand the molecular mechanism of the process we have determined the structure of nusb from the thermophilic bacterium aquifex aeolicus and studied the interaction of nusb and nuse we characterize this binding interaction using nmr isothermal titration calorimetry gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation the binding site of nuse on nusb was determined using nmr chemical shift perturbation studies we have also determined the nuse binding site in the ternary escherichia coli nusb nuse boxa rna complex and show that it is very similar to that in the nusb nuse complex there is one loop of residues from   to   in nusb affected by nuse binding in the ternary complex but not in the binary complex this difference may be correlated to an increase in binding affinity of rna for the nusb nuse complex
