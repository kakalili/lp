a novel method of protein secondary structure prediction with high segment overlap measure support vector machine approach edited by b holland
we have introduced a new method of protein secondary structure prediction which is based on the theory of support vector machine svm  svm represents a new approach to supervised pattern classification which has been successfully applied to a wide range of pattern recognition problems including object recognition speaker identification gene function prediction with microarray expression profile etc in these cases the performance of svm either matches or is significantly better than that of traditional machine learning approaches including neural networks the first use of the svm approach to predict protein secondary structure is described here unlike the previous studies we first constructed several binary classifiers then assembled a tertiary classifier for three secondary structure states helix sheet and coil based on these binary classifiers the svm method achieved a good performance of segment overlap accuracy sov    through sevenfold cross validation on a database of   non homologous protein chains with multiple sequence alignments which out performs existing methods meanwhile three state overall per residue accuracy q achieved     which is at least comparable to existing single prediction methods furthermore a useful  reliability index  for the predictions was developed in addition svm has many attractive features including effective avoidance of overfitting the ability to handle large feature spaces information condensing of the given data set etc the svm method is conveniently applied to many other pattern classification tasks in biology
