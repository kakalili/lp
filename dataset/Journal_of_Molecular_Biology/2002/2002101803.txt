The effect of non-random conformational averaging in the urea-unfolded state on the folding pathway has been investigated in a variant of the FK506 binding protein with three additional residues at the amino terminus (FKBP∗). Three mutations (asparagine, aspartate, and threonine) were introduced into position Q53 to enhance formation of non-native helix observed in this part of the protein in the urea-unfolded state. NMR analysis showed minor structural changes in the native state of each mutant, but additional medium-range αN(i,i+2) of each mutant nuclear Overhauser enhancements were observed in the urea-unfolded state that were not in FKBP∗, indicating that the mutations had a more substantial effect on the unfolded state ensemble than on the native state ensemble. Isothermal equilibrium denaturation measurements showed that the Q53T and Q53D mutants were destabilized, whereas the Q53N mutant was stabilized relative to FKBP∗ with little change in the equilibrium m values. The unfolding rates of Q53N and Q53T were similar to that of FKBP∗, but Q53D unfolded twice as fast as FKBP∗. In contrast, the mutations had a more pronounced effect on the refolding kinetics. Q53N refolded slightly faster and exhibited a kinetic folding intermediate similar to that of FKBP∗. The Q53D and Q53T mutants also refolded faster than FKBP∗ but lacked the folding intermediate, indicating that these mutants experienced a different folding trajectory and transition state than FKBP∗ and Q53N. The refolding kinetic Φ values were 0.74, 1.4 and 7.9 for Q53N, Q53T, and Q53D, respectively. The data point to Q53 functioning as a gatekeeper residue in the folding of FKBP∗. This study shows that perturbing the unfolded state ensemble via mutagenesis can provide insights into residues that play important roles in the folding pathway, and represents an attractive strategy for mapping the high-energy portions of the folding energy landscape.
