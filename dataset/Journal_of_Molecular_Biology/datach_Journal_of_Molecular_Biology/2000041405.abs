pkc  associated ck participates in the turnover of free i b  edited by m yaniv
the atypical pkc isoenzymes   and   activate nf  b a mechanism thought to mediate the anti apoptotic and proliferative features of these kinases pkc  has been shown to be associated with an i b  kinase in resting cells in this study we have sought to identify the pkc  associated kinase and understand how pkc  mediates basal i b  turnover in vivo we demonstrate that the pkc  associated i b  kinase is ck  this kinase previously shown to phosphorylate the pest domain of i b molecules co precipitates with pkc  in resting cells in vitro pkc  interacts with ck   the in vivo pkc  associated ck preferentially phosphorylates s  of i b  as compared to non associated ck  the functional relevance of this observation is supported by the fact that the turnover of free i b  in resting cells is s  dependent moreover overexpressing pkc  results in lower steady state protein levels of free i b  which is dependent on s   lastly it is shown that pkc  wt but not kinase dead leads to the in vitro phosphorylation of both ck   and   these studies demonstrate that the association between ck and pkc  may play a major role in the control of the basal turnover of free i b  in the absence of extracellular stimuli
