the effects of mutations on motions of side chains in protein l studied by h nmr dynamics and scalar couplings
recently developed h spin relaxation experiments are applied to study the dynamics of methyl containing side chains in the b domain of protein l and in a pair of point mutants of the domain f l and a v x ray and nmr studies of the three variants of protein l studied here establish that their structures are very similar despite the fact that the f l mutant is  kcal mol less stable measurements of methyl h spin relaxation rates which probe dynamics on a picosecond  nanosecond time scale and three bond jc   co  jc   n and jc   c  scalar coupling constants which are sensitive to motion spanning a wide range of time scales reveal changes in the magnitude of side chain dynamics in response to mutation observed differences in the time scale of motions between the variants have been related to changes in energetic barriers of interest several of the residues with different motional properties across the variants are far from the site of mutation suggesting the presence of long range interactions within the protein that can be probed through studies of dynamics
