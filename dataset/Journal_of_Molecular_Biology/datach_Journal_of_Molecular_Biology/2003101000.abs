how structure correlates to function for membrane associated hiv  gp  constructs corresponding to the n terminal half of the ectodomain
to address the structure  function relationship of discrete regions within the gp  ectodomain   residue peptide constructs corresponding to the n terminal subdomain of the hiv  gp  ectodomain were examined in a membrane associated context these fragments encompass both fusion peptide fp and n terminal heptad repeat nhr regions and model the n terminal half of the pre hairpin intermediate phi  which is believed to be the target of the potent entry inhibitor dp   recently approved by the fda using mutants we attempted to map the structural organization of the n terminal subdomain our results suggest that the n terminal subdomain contains two discrete structural regions the fp adopts a  sheet conformation and the nhr is  helical this structural make up is essential for fusogenic function since loss of function mutants exhibit both a significant reduction in region specific secondary structure as well as significant impairment in lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles our results delineating membrane associated structure of the fp region differ from previous ones by inclusion of the autonomous oligomerization domain nhr  which likely contributes to stabilization of the fp structure correspondingly the  helical structure for the nhr in context of the fp correlates with structural predictions for this region in both the hairpin and phi conformations during fusion based on our results we postulate how oligomerization of regions in this sub domain is essential for fusion pore formation
