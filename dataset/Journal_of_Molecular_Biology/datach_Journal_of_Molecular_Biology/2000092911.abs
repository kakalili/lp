searching genomes for sequences with the potential to form intrastrand triple helices edited by i tinoco
the canonical double helix form of dna is thought to predominate both in dilute solution and in living cells sequence dependent fluctuations in local dna shape occur within the double helix besides these relatively modest variations in shape more extreme and remarkable structures have been detected in which some bases become unpaired examples include unusual three stranded structures such as h dna certain rna and dna strands can also fold onto themselves to form intrastrand triplexes although they have been extensively studied in vitro it remains unknown whether nucleic acid triplexes play natural roles in cells if natural nucleic acid triplexes were identified in cells much could be learned by examining the formation stabilization and function of such structures with these goals in mind we adapted a pattern recognition program to search genetic databases for a type of potential triplex structure whose presence in genomes has not been previously investigated we term these sequences potential intrastrand triplex pit elements the formation of an intrastrand triplex requires three consecutive sequence domains with appropriate symmetry along a single nucleic acid strand it is remarkable that we discovered multiple copies of sequence elements with the potential to form one particular class of intrastrand triplexes in the fully sequenced genomes of several bacteria we then focused on the characterization of the  copies of a particular    nt pit sequence detected in escherichia coli through biochemical studies we demonstrate that an isolated dna strand from this family of e coli pit elements forms a stable intrastrand triplex at physiological temperature and ph in the presence of physiological concentrations of mg
