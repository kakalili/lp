characterization of ph induced transitions of  lactoglobulin ultrasonic densimetric and spectroscopic studies edited by c r matthews
depending on solution conditions   lactoglobulin can exist in one of its six ph dependent structural states we have characterized the acid and basic induced conformational transitions between these structural states over the ph range of ph  to ph   to this end we have employed high precision ultrasonic and densimetric measurements coupled with fluorescence and cd spectroscopic data our combined spectroscopic and volumetric results have revealed five ph induced transitions of  lactoglobulin between ph  and ph   the first transition starts at ph  and is not completed even at ph  our lowest experimental ph this transition is followed by the dimer to monomer transition of  lactoglobulin between ph   and ph  the dimer to monomer transition is accompanied by decreases in volume v           cm g    and adiabatic compressibility k s              cm g   bar    we interpret the observed changes in volume and compressibility associated with the dimer to monomer transition of  lactoglobulin in conjunction with x ray crystallographic data as suggesting a   increase in protein hydration with the hydration changes being localized in the area of contact between the two monomeric subunits the so called n to q transition of  lactoglobulin occurs between ph   and ph  and is accompanied by increases in volume v          cm g    and compressibility k s             cm g   bar    the tanford transition of  lactoglobulin is centered at ph   and is accompanied by a decrease in volume v           cm g    and an increase in compressibility k s             cm g   bar    based on these volumetric results we propose that the tanford transition is accompanied by a  to   increase in the protein hydration and a loosening of the interior packing of  lactoglobulin as reflected in a   increase in its intrinsic compressibility finally above ph  the protein undergoes irreversible base induced unfolding which is accompanied by decreases in v           cm g   and k s              cm g   bar    combining these results with our cd spectroscopic data we propose that in the base induced unfolded state of  lactoglobulin only   of the surface area of the fully unfolded conformation is exposed to the solvent thus in so far as solvent exposure is concerned the base induced unfolded states of  lactoglobulin retains some order with   of its amino acid residues remaining solvent inaccessible
