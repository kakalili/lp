the trpc channel has a large internal chamber surrounded by signal sensing antennas
transient receptor potential trp channels are intrinsic sensors adapted for response to all manner of stimuli both from inside and from outside the cell within the trp superfamily the canonical trp  trpc  has been widely studied and is involved in various biological processes such as neuronal differentiation blood vessel constriction and immune cell maturation upon stimulation of surface membrane receptors linked to phospholipase c trpc mediates transmembrane ca  influx from outside the cell to control ca  signaling in concert with the ca  release from internal stores the structural basis of trp superfamily has however been poorly understood here we present a structure of the trpc at    resolution this first d depiction of trp superfamily was reconstructed from     particle images obtained with cryo electron microscopy the large intracellular domain represents a  nested box  structure a wireframe outer shell is functionable as sensors for activators and modulators and a globular inner chamber may modulate ion flow since it is aligned tandem along the central axis with the dense membrane spanning core the transmembrane domain demonstrates a pore forming property this structure implies that the trp superfamily has diversely evolved as sensors specialized for various signals rather than as simple ion conducting apparatuses
