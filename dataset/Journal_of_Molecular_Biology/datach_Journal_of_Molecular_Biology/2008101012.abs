znf  is a novel pml body and sumo associated transcriptional coregulator
covalent modification by small ubiquitin related modifiers sumos is an important means to regulate dynamic residency of transcription factors within nuclear compartments here we identify a multi c h type zinc finger protein znf  znf   as a novel nuclear protein that can be associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies in keeping with its interaction with sumo e conjugase ubc and sumos znf  is covalently modified by sumos sumoylated at several albeit nonconsensus sites interestingly noncovalent sumo binding activity of znf   sumo interacting motif is also important for its sumoylation sumo modifications regulate the nuclear compartmentalization of znf   since coexpression of znf  with sumo specific proteases senp or senp  both capable of desumoylating the protein redistributes znf  from nuclear domains to speckles and nucleoplasm interaction of znf  with pias  protein inhibitor of activated stat  is not manifested as pias s e sumo ligase activity towards znf  but results in disintegration of znf  nuclear domains and recruitment of znf  to androgen receptor ar speckles znf  interacts weakly but in a sumo  enhanced fashion with ar znf  does not harbor an intrinsic transcription activation function but interestingly ablation of endogenous znf  in prostate cancer cells significantly decreases expression of several ar target genes thus we suggest that znf  exerts its effects via sumo modification machinery and trafficking of transcription regulators between promyelocytic leukemia bodies and nucleoplasm
