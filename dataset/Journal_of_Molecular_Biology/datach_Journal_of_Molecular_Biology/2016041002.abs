partial dedifferentiation of murine radial glia type neural stem cells by brn and c myc yields early neuroepithelial progenitors
direct cell conversion developed into an important paradigm for generating cells with enhanced differentiation capability we combined a transcription factor based cell fate conversion strategy with the use of pharmacological compounds to derive early neuroepithelial progenitor cells from developmentally more restricted radial glia type neural stem cells by combining the small molecules chir    tranylcypromine sb    and valproic acid with viral transduction of the transcription factor c myc and the pou domain transcription factor brn  we dedifferentiated radial glia type neural stem cells into an early neuroepithelial progenitor cell state within days reverse transcription pcr analyses showed a rapid down regulation of the radial glia markers olig and vimentin during conversion whereas the neuroepithelial markers dach and sox were fastly up regulated furthermore a switch from n cadherin to e cadherin indicates a mesenchymal to epithelial transition the differentiation of cells converted by brn c myc yielded smooth muscle actin and peripherin positive cells in addition to the neuronal marker tuj and cells that are positive for the glial marker gfap this differentiation potential suggests that the applied reprogramming strategy induced an early neuroepithelial cell population which might resemble cells of the neural border or even more primitive neuroepithelial cells
