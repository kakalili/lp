structural characterization of the interactions between palladin and  actinin
the interaction between  actinin and palladin two actin cross linking proteins is essential for proper bidirectional targeting of these proteins as a first step toward understanding the role of this complex in organizing cytoskeletal actin we have characterized binding interactions between the ef hand domain of  actinin act ef  and peptides derived from palladin and generated an nmr derived structural model for the act ef  palladin peptide complex the critical binding site residues are similar to an  actinin binding motif previously suggested for the complex between act ef  and titin z repeats the structure based model of the act ef  palladin peptide complex expands our understanding of binding specificity between the scaffold protein  actinin and various ligands which appears to require an  helical motif containing four hydrophobic residues common to many  actinin ligands we also provide evidence that the family x mutation in palladin associated with a highly penetrant form of pancreatic cancer does not interfere with  actinin binding
