the third and fourth tropomyosin isoforms of caenorhabditis elegans are expressed in the pharynx and intestines and are essential for development and morphology edited by j karn
the tropomyosin gene tmy  lev  of caenorhabditis elegans spans   kb and encodes three isoforms by alternative splicing to identify characterize and compare the genome and tissue expression of a fourth isoform the technique of rapid amplification of cdna ends and microinjection with lacz and gfp fusion plasmids were employed we elucidated cetmiv a fourth isoform of tmy  which encoded a   residue polypeptide cetmiv isoform had a similar promoter region to cetmiii isoform but was alternatively spliced to generate a cdna that differed in two exons the tmy   lacz and tmy   gfp fusion genes with   kb promoter sequence and   kb of cetmiv isoform specific exons were expressed in the pharyngeal and intestinal cells further unidirectional deletion of the sequence located the primary promoter region   bp upstream from the initial codon we show within the upstream region the presence of b and c subelement like sequences of myo  which may be used to stimulate pharyngeal expression despite the presence of a ges  like sequence we were unable to locate the two gata sites required for intestinal expression reassessing tissue expression for cetmiii isoform with newly constructed fusion plasmids we showed further expression in germ line tissue and intestinal cells in addition to pharyngeal expression finally to demonstrate that tropomyosin is essential for development we inactivated the body wall and pharynx specific isoforms by rna mediated interference in addition to      embryonic lethality in both cases the worms that survived body wall interference had abnormal body morphology and uncoordinated movements and those that survived pharynx interference had deformed pharynges and gut regions these results show the function of tropomyosin in normal muscle filament assembly and embryonic development and illustrate the different expression patterns characteristic of tropomyosin isoforms in c elegans
