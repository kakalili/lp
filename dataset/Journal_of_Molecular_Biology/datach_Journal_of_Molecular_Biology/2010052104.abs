determinants of bh binding specificity for mcl  versus bcl xl
interactions among bcl  family proteins are important for regulating apoptosis prosurvival members of the family interact with proapoptotic bh  bcl  homology  only members inhibiting execution of cell death through the mitochondrial pathway structurally this interaction is mediated by binding of the  helical bh region of the proapoptotic proteins to a conserved hydrophobic groove on the prosurvival proteins native bh only proteins exhibit selectivity in binding prosurvival members as do small molecules that block these interactions understanding the sequence and structural basis of interaction specificity in this family is important as it may allow the prediction of new bcl  family associations and or the design of new classes of selective inhibitors to serve as reagents or therapeutics in this work we used two complementary techniques  yeast surface display screening from combinatorial peptide libraries and spot peptide array analysis  to elucidate specificity determinants for binding to bcl xl versus mcl  two prominent prosurvival proteins we screened a randomized library and identified bh peptides that bound to either mcl  or bcl xl selectively or to both with high affinity the peptides competed with native ligands for binding into the conserved hydrophobic groove as illustrated in detail by a crystal structure of a specific peptide bound to mcl  mcl  selective peptides from the screen were highly specific for binding mcl  in preference to bcl xl bcl  bcl w and bfl  whereas bcl xl selective peptides showed some cross interaction with related proteins bcl  and bcl w mutational analyses using spot arrays revealed the effects of   point mutations made in the background of a peptide derived from the bh region of bim and a simple predictive model constructed using these data explained much of the specificity observed in our mcl  versus bcl xl binders
