two rung model of a left handed  helix for prions explains species barrier and strain variation in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
in this study a new  helical model is proposed that explains the species barrier and strain variation in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies the left handed  helix serves as a structural model that can explain the seeded growth characteristics of  sheet structure in prpsc fibrils molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the left handed  helix is structurally more stable than the right handed  helix with a higher  sheet content during the simulation and a better distributed network of inter strand backbone backbone hydrogen bonds between parallel  strands of different rungs multiple sequence alignments and homology modelling of prion sequences with different rungs of left handed  helices illustrate that the prp region with the highest  helical propensity residues      can fold in just two rungs of a left handed  helix even if no other flanking sequence participates in the  helix the two rungs of a  helix can give the growing fibril enough elevation to accommodate the rest of the prp protein in a tight packing at the periphery of a trimeric  helix the folding of  helices is driven by backbone  backbone hydrogen bonding and stacking of side chains in adjacent rungs the sequence and structure of the last rung at the fibril end with unprotected  sheet edges selects the sequence of a complementary rung and dictates the folding of the new rung with optimal backbone hydrogen bonding and side chain stacking an important side chain stack that facilitates the  helical folding is between methionine residues   and   which explains their importance in the species barrier of prions because the prp sequence is not evolutionarily optimised to fold in a  helix and because the  helical fold shows very little sequence preference alternative alignments are possible that result in a different rung able to select for an alternative complementary rung a different top rung results in a new strain with different growth characteristics hence in the present model sequence variation and alternative alignments clarify the basis of the species barrier and strain specificity in prp based diseases
