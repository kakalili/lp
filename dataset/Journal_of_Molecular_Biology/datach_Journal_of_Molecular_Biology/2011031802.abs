the functional half life of an mrna depends on the ribosome spacing in an early coding region
bacterial mrnas are translated by closely spaced ribosomes and degraded from the   end with half lives of around  min at    c in most cases ribosome free or  naked  mrna is known to be readily degraded but the initial event that inactivates the mrna functionally has not been fully described here we characterize a determinant of the functional stability of an mrna which is located in the early coding region using literature values for the mrna half lives of variant lacz mrnas in escherichia coli we modeled how the ribosome spacing is affected by the translation rate of the individual codons when comparing the ribosome spacing at various segments of the mrna to its functional half life we found a clear correlation between the functional mrna half life and the ribosome spacing in the mrna region approximately between codon  and codon   from this finding we predicted that inserts of slowly translated codons before codon  or after codon  should shorten or prolong respectively the functional mrna half life by altering the ribosome density in the important region these predictions were tested on eight new lacz variants and their experimentally determined mrna half lives all supported the model we thus suggest that translation rate mediated differences in the spacing between ribosomes in this early coding region is a parameter that determines the mrnas functional half life we present a model that is in accordance with many earlier observations and that allows a prediction of the functional half life of a given mrna sequence
