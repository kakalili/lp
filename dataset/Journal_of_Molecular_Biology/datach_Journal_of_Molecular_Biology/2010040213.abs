backbone model of an aquareovirus virion by cryo electron microscopy and bioinformatics
grass carp reovirus gcrv is a member of the aquareovirus genus in the reoviridae family and has a capsid with two shells  a transcription competent core surrounded by a coat we report a near atomic resolution reconstruction of the gcrv virion by cryo electron microscopy and single particle reconstruction a backbone model of the gcrv virion including seven conformers of the five capsid proteins making up the   molecules in both the core and the coat was derived using cryo electron microscopy density map constrained homology modeling and refinement our structure clearly showed that the amino terminal segment of core protein vp b forms an      long  helix rich extension bridging across the icosahedral  fold symmetry related molecular interface the presence of this unique structure across this interface and the lack of an external cementing molecule at this location in gcrv suggest a stabilizing role of this extended amino terminal density moreover part of this amino terminal extension becomes invisible in the reconstruction of transcription competent core particles suggesting its involvement in endogenous viral rna transcription our structure of the vp turret represents its open state and comparison with its related structures at the closed state suggests hinge like domain movements associated with the mrna capping machinery overall this first backbone model of an aquareovirus virion provides a wealth of structural information for understanding the structural basis of gcrv assembly and transcription
