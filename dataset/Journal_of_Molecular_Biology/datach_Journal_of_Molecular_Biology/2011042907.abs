sliding of p  along dna can be modulated by its oligomeric state and by cross talks between its constituent domains
the p  protein is a homotetrameric transcription factor whose monomers comprise several domains although its organization with and without dna was elucidated recently characterizing the p   dna complex at the atomic level remains challenging because of its many disordered regions here we use computational models to predict the wiring of the four chains composing p  and study its sliding dynamics along dna in different oligomeric states we find that helical sliding along the major groove is the most feasible dna search mechanism for a large range of salt concentrations tighter packing of the tetrameric core domain is associated with a greater nonspecific affinity for dna and the slowest linear diffusion dynamics along dna c tails facilitate linear diffusion but restrict the association of two primary dimers into a tetramer this restriction can disappear at higher salt concentrations which decrease the affinity of c tails for dna or upon interaction of the c tail with other dna segments our results support evidence for the positive regulation of p  function by the c tails and suggest that posttranslational charge modifications may alter the affinity of the tails for dna conversely the n termini have little effect on sliding characteristics changes in the electrostatic potentials of the core domain via missense mutations corresponding to cancer development can also affect sliding by p  our study provides molecular insight into the role of various p  domains during dna search and indicates that the complex interdomain and protein  dna cross talks in which p  engages may be related to its repertoire of cellular functions
