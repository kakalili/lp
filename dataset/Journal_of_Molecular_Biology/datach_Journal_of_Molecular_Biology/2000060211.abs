changes in the  bp spacer in the pr promoter of bacteriophage  affect steps in open complex formation that precede dna strand separation edited by r ebright
tau plots and temperature shift experiments were used to determine which step in the formation of transcriptionally competent open complexes is affected by changing the length of the  bp spacer separating the    and    consensus regions of the pr promoter of bacteriophage   abortive initiation assays at   c indicate that the primary effect of insertion of a base pair thereby increasing spacer length to  bp is a decrease in kf the rate constant for conversion from closed rpc to open rpo complexes by approximately a factor of  the mutation did not significantly affect kb the equilibrium constant for formation of closed complexes and decreased kbkf by a factor of  deletion of a bp to create a  bp spacer had a much greater effect decreasing the measured value of kf by a factor of about  to   and kbkf by a factor of  to  when the values of the parameters for the deletion mutant were corrected for incomplete occupancy of rpo at equilibrium the effects of the deletion were even greater in particular the corrected value of kbkf was about  times lower than the corresponding value for two promoters with wild type spacing based on temperature shift experiments the changes in spacer length did not affect the equilibrium at   c between rpi a stable intermediate in which dna strands are not separated and rpo although differential sensitivity of single stranded bases to kmno indicated that in about   of the open complexes at   c the dna strands are not fully separated rpo  the distribution between these complexes and rpo  dna strands fully separated was also not affected significantly by changes in spacer length thus changes in spacer length primarily affect k  the rate constant for conversion of rpc to rpi which corresponds to a nucleation of dna strand separation application of published data and or algorithms for determining effects of nucleotide sequence on twist angle or rise at individual bp steps does not provide a simple explanation of the difference in promoter strength between pr derivatives with  bp spacing and those with  bp spacing
