solution structure of the cytotoxic rnase  from oocytes of bullfrog rana catesbeiana
cytotoxic ribonucleases with antitumor activity are mainly found in the oocytes and early embryos of frogs native rc rnase  rnase   consisting of   residues linked with four disulfide bridges is a cytotoxic ribonuclease isolated from oocytes of bullfrog rana catesbeiana rnase  belongs to the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease rnase a superfamily recombinant rc rnase  rrnase   which contains an additional met residue and glutamine instead of pyroglutamate at the n terminus was found to possess less catalytic and cytotoxic activities than rnase  equilibrium thermal and guanidine hcl denaturation cd measurements revealed that rnase  is more thermally and chemically stable than rrnase  however cd and nmr data showed that there is no gross conformational change between native and recombinant rnase  the nmr solution structure of rrnase  was determined to comprise three  helices and two sets of antiparallel  sheets superimposition of each structure with the mean structure yielded an average root mean square deviation rmsd of        for the backbone atoms and        for the heavy atoms in residues     a comparison of the d structure of rrnase  with the structurally and functionally related cytotoxic ribonuclease onconase onc  showed that the two h bonds in the n terminal pyroglutamate of onc were not present at the corresponding glutamine residue of rrnase  we suggest that the loss of these two h bonds is one of the key factors responsible for the reductions of the conformational stability catalytic and cytotoxic activities in rrnase  furthermore the differences of side chain conformations of subsite residues among rnase a onc and rrnase  are related to their distinct catalytic activities and base preferences
