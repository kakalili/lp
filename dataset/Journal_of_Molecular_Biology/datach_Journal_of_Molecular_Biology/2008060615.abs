trna integrity is a prerequisite for rapid cca addition implication for quality control
cca addition to the   end is an essential step in trna maturation high resolution crystal structures of the cca enzymes reveal primary enzyme contact with the trna minihelix domain consisting of the acceptor stem and t stem  loop rna and dna minihelices are efficient substrates for cca addition in steady state kinetics however in contrast to structural models and steady state experiments we show here by single turnover kinetics that minihelices are insufficient substrates for the escherichia coli cca enzyme and that only the full length trna is kinetically competent even a nick in the full length trna backbone in the t loop or as far away from the minihelix domain as in the anticodon loop prevents efficient cca addition these results suggest a kinetic quality control provided by the cca enzyme to inspect the integrity of the trna molecule and to discriminate against nicked or damaged species from further maturation
