The COP9 signalosome is involved in signal transduction, whereas the 26 S proteasome lid is a regulatory subcomplex of the 26 S proteasome responsible for degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. COP9 signalosome and lid possess significant sequence homologies among their eight core subunits and are likely derived from a common ancestor. Surprisingly, from our two-dimensional electron microscopy data, a common architectural plan for the two complexes could not be deduced. None-the-less, the two particles have structural features in common. Both COP9 signalosome and lid lack any symmetry in subunit arrangement and exhibit a central groove, possibly qualified for scaffolding functions.Filter-binding assays with recombinant COP9 signalosome components revealed a multitude of subunit-subunit interactions, supporting the asymmetrical appearance of the complex in electron microscopy. On the basis of two-dimensional images and subunit interaction studies, a first architectural model of COP9 signalosome was created.The fact that four distinct classes of particle views were identified and that only 50 % of the selected particles could be classified indicates a high degree of heterogeneity in electron microscopic images. Different orientations with respect to the viewing axis and conformational variety, presumably due to different grades of phosphorylation, are possible reasons for the heterogeneous appearance of the complex. Our biochemical data show that recombinant COP9 signalosome subunits 2 and 7 are phosphorylated by the associated kinase activity. The modification of COP9 signalosome subunit 2 might be essential for c-Jun phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation does not inactivate the associated kinase activity. Although substrate phosphorylation by COP9 signalosome is significantly decreased by lambda protein phosphatase treatment, “autophosphorylation” is increased.
