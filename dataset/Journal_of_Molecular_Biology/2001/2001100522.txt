The prophage of coliphage N15 is not integrated into the bacterial chromosome but exists as a linear plasmid molecule with covalently closed ends. Upon infection of an Escherichia coli cell, the phage DNA circularises via cohesive ends. A phage-encoded enzyme, protelomerase, then cuts at another site, telRL, and forms hairpin ends (telomeres). We demonstrate that this enzyme acts in vivo on specific substrates, and show that it is necessary for replication of the linear prophage. We show that protelomerase is an end-resolving enzyme responsible for processing of replicative intermediates. Removal of protelomerase activity resulted in accumulation of replicative intermediates that were found to be circular head-to-head dimers. N15 protelomerase and its target site constitute a functional unit acting on other replicons independently of other phage genes; a mini-F or mini-P1 plasmid carrying this unit replicates as a linear plasmid with covalently closed ends. Our results suggest the following model of N15 prophage DNA replication. Replication is initiated at an internal ori site located close to the left end of plasmid DNA and proceeds bidirectionally. After replication of the left telomere, protelomerase cuts this sequence and forms two hairpin loops telL. After duplication of the right telomere (telR) the same enzyme resolves this sequence producing two linear plasmids. Alternatively, full replication of the linear prophage to form a circular head-to-head dimer may precede protelomerase-mediated formation of hairpin ends.
