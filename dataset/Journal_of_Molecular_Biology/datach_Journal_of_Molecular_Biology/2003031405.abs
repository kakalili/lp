crystal structure of the plant ppc decarboxylase athal a complexed with an ene thiol reaction intermediate
the arabidopsis thaliana protein athal a decarboxylates   phosphopantothenoylcysteine to   phosphopantetheine a step in coenzyme a biosynthesis surprisingly this decarboxylation reaction is carried out as an fmn dependent redox reaction in the first half reaction the side chain of the cysteine residue of   phosphopantothenoylcysteine is oxidised and the thioaldehyde intermediate decarboxylates spontaneously to the   phosphopantothenoyl aminoethenethiol intermediate in the second half reaction this compound is reduced to   phosphopantetheine and the fmnh cofactor is re oxidised the active site mutant c  s is unable to perform this reductive half reaction here we present the crystal structure of the athal a mutant c  s in complex with the reaction intermediate pantothenoyl aminoethenethiol and fmnh  the geometry of binding suggests that reduction of the c   c  double bond of the intermediate can be performed by direct hydride transfer from n of fmnh to c  of the aminoethenethiol moiety supported by a protonation of c  by cys   the binding mode of the substrate is very similar to that previously observed for a pentapeptide to the homologous enzyme epid that introduces the aminoethenethiol moiety as final reaction product at the c terminus of peptidyl cysteine residues this finding further supports our view that these homologous enzymes form a protein family of homo oligomeric flavin containing cysteine decarboxylases which we have termed hfcd family
