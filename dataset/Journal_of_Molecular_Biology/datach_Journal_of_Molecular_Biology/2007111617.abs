critical role of mac  sialyl lewis x moieties in regulating neutrophil degranulation and transmigration
leukocyte cell surface sialyl lewis x slex and related epitopes play an important role in cell rolling and adhesion during diapedesis via interaction with e selectin here we present evidence that mac  cd b cd  cr  is a major neutrophil glycoprotein decorated with slex and ligation of these carbohydrate moieties by anti slex antibody significantly impairs neutrophil functions first western blot analysis shows that both cd b and cd  subunit of purified mac  are decorated with slex moieties a significant co localization of cd b and slex moieties is observed at neutrophil secondary granules with stimulation of formyl met leu phe fmlp  neutrophil surface labeling with anti slex antibody follows an identical up regulation pattern of mac  second protein binding assays indicate that slex moieties on mac  are critical for binding interaction of mac  to e selectin removal of slex moieties completely abolishes mac   e selectin binding finally ligation of mac  slex by anti slex antibody induces a significant degranulation of neutrophil secondary granules at the absence of chemoattractant stimulation this  dysregulated  degranulation induced by anti slex antibody strongly inhibits neutrophil transmigration in response to fmlp in summary mac  slex moieties play a critical role in regulating   integrin functions during neutrophil transmigration and degranulation
