minimum energy path for a u rna conformational change involving protonation base pair rearrangement and base flipping
the u rna internal stem  loop u isl is a highly conserved domain of the spliceosome that is important for pre mrna splicing the u isl contains an internal loop that is in equilibrium between two conformations controlled by the protonation state of an adenine pka    lower ph favors formation of a protonated c  a wobble pair and base flipping of the adjacent uracil higher ph favors stacking of the uracil and allows an essential metal ion to bind at this position here we define the minimal energy path for this conformational transition to do this we solved the u isl structure at higher ph    in order to eliminate interference from the low ph conformer this structure reveals disruption of the protonated c  a pair and formation of a new c  u pair which explains the preference for a stacked uracil at higher ph next we used nudged elastic band molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the minimum energy path between the two conformations our results indicate that the c  u pair is dynamic which allows formation of the more stable c  a pair upon adenine protonation after formation of the c  a pair the unpaired uracil follows a minor groove base flipping pathway molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the extrahelical uracil is stabilized by contacts with the adjacent helix
