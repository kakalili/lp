cross linking constraints on f actin structure edited by m f moody
the dnase i binding loop residues     the hydrophobic plug residues      and the c terminus region are among the structural elements of monomeric g  actin proposed to form the intermonomer interface in f actin to test the proximity and interactions of these elements and to provide constraints on models of f actin structure cysteine residues were introduced into yeast actin either at residue  or   these mutations allowed for specific cross linking of f actin between c  and c   c  and c   and c  and c  using dibromobimane and disulfide bond formation the cross linked products were visualized on sds page and by electron microscopy model calculations carried out for the cross linked f actins revealed that considerable flexibility or displacement of actin residues is required in the disulfide cross linked segments to fit these filaments into model f actin structures the calculated cross linked structures showed a better fit to the holmes rather than the refined lorenz model of f actin it is predicted on the basis of such calculations that image reconstruction of electron micrographs of disulfide cross linked c  c  f actin should provide a conclusive test of these two similar models of f actin structure
