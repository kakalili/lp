The hydrolysis of 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate to 2-formylglutarate is a central step in the catabolism of nicotinate in several Clostridia and Proteobacteria. This reaction is catalyzed by the novel enzyme enamidase, a new member of the amidohydrolase superfamily as indicated by its unique reaction, sequence relationship, and the stoichiometric binding of iron and zinc. A hallmark of enamidase is its capability to catalyze a two-step reaction: the initial decyclization of 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate leading to 2-(enamine)glutarate followed by an additional hydrolysis step yielding (S)-2-formylglutarate. Here, we present the crystal structure of enamidase from Eubacterium barkeri at 1.9 Å resolution, providing a structural basis for catalysis and suggesting a mechanism for its exceptional activity and enantioselectivity. The enzyme forms a 222-symmetric tetramer built up by a dimer of dimers. Each enamidase monomer consists of a composite β-sandwich domain and an (α/β)8-TIM-barrel domain harboring the active site. With its catalytic binuclear metal center comprising both zinc and iron ions, enamidase represents a special case of subtype II amidohydrolases.
