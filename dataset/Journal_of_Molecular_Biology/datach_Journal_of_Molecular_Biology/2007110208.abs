characterization of human cardiac calsequestrin and its deleterious mutants
mutations of conserved residues of human cardiac calsequestrin hcsq  a high capacity low affinity ca  binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum have been associated with catecholamine induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia cpvt  in order to understand the molecular mechanism and pathophysiological link between these cpvt related missense mutations of hcsq and the resulting arrhythmias we generated three cpvt causing mutants of hcsq  r q l  h and d  h and two non pathological mutants t a and v m and investigated the effect of these mutations in addition we determined the crystal structure of the corresponding wild type hcsq to gain insight into the structural effects of those mutations our data show clearly that all three cpvt related mutations lead to significant reduction in ca  binding capacity in spite of the similarity of their secondary structures to that of the wild type hcsq  light scattering experiments indicate that the ca  dependent monomer polymer transitions of the mutants are quite different confirming that the linear polymerization behavior of csq is linked directly to its high capacity ca  binding r q and d  h mutations result in a monomer that appears to be unable to form a properly oriented dimer on the other hand the l  h mutant has a disrupted hydrophobic core in domain ii resulting in high molecular aggregates which cannot respond to ca  although one of the non pathological mutants t a shares characteristics with the wild type the other null mutant v m shows significantly altered ca  binding and polymerization behaviors calling for careful reconsideration of its status
