protein aggregation and amyloid fibril formation by an sh domain probed by limited proteolysis
the sh domains are small protein modules of     amino acid residues that are found in many proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction the sh domain of the p   subunit of bovine phosphatidylinositol   kinase pi sh  under acidic solution adopts a compact denatured state from which amyloid fibrils are readily formed this aggregation process has been found to be modulated substantially by solution conditions here we have analyzed the conformational features of the native and acid denatured states of pi sh by limited proteolysis experiments using proteinase k and pepsin respectively moreover we have analyzed the propensity of pi sh to be hydrolyzed by pepsin at different stages in the process of aggregation and amyloid formation at ph   and   and compared the sites of proteolysis under these conditions with the conformational features of both native and aggregated pi sh  the results demonstrate that the denatured state of pi sh formed at low ph is relatively resistant to proteolysis indicating that it is partially folded the long loop connecting  strands b and c in the native protein is the region in this structure most susceptible to proteolysis remarkably aggregates of pi sh that are formed initially from this denatured state in acid solution display enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis of the long loop suggesting that the protein becomes more unfolded in the early stages of aggregation by contrast the more defined amyloid fibrils that are formed over longer periods of time are completely resistant to proteolysis we suggest that the protein aggregates formed initially are relatively dynamic species that are able readily to reorganize their interactions to enable formation of very well ordered fibrillar structures in addition the disordered and non native character of the polypeptide chains in the early aggregates could be important in determining the high cytotoxicity that has been revealed in previous studies of these species
