structural insights into the allosteric effects of ebp on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif e
the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif e plays key roles in cap dependent translation and mrna export these functions rely on binding the  methyl guanosine moiety   cap on the   end of all mrnas eif e is regulated by proteins such as eif g and eif e binding proteins  ebps that bind the dorsal surface of eif e distal to the cap binding site and modulate cap binding activity both proteins increase the affinity of eif e for   cap our understanding of the allosteric effects and structural underpinnings of ebp or eif g binding can be advanced by obtaining structural data on cap free eif e bound to one of these proteins here we report the crystal structure of apo eif e and cap free eif e in complex with a ebp peptide we also monitored ebp binding to cap free eif e in solution using nmr together these studies suggest that ebp transforms eif e into a cap receptive state nmr methods were also used to compare the allosteric routes activated by ebp  eif g and the arenavirus z protein a negative regulator of cap binding we observed chemical shift perturbation at the dorsal binding site leading to alterations in the core of the protein which were ultimately communicated to the unoccupied cap binding site of eif e there were notable similarities between the routes taken by ebp and eif g and differences from the negative regulator z thus binding of ebp or eif g allosterically drives alterations throughout the protein that increase the affinity of eif e for the   cap
