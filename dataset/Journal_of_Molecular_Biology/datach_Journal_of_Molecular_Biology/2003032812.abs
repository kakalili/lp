specific inhibition of the translocation of a subset of escherichia coli tat substrates by the tora signal peptide
the sufi protein and the trimethylamine n oxide reductase tora are the two best characterized prototype proteins exported by the escherichia coli tat system whereas sufi does not contain cofactors tora is a molybdo enzyme and the acquisition of the molybdo cofactor is a prerequisite for its translocation the overproduction of each protein leads to the saturation of its translocation but it was unknown if the overproduction of one substrate could saturate the tat apparatus and block thus the translocation of other tat substrates here we showed that the overproduction of sufi saturated only its own translocation but had no effect of the translocation of tora and other tat substrate analyzed to dissect the saturation mechanism of tora translocation we shortened by about one third of the tora protein and removed nine consensus molybdo cofactor binding ligands like sufi the truncated tora tora   did not contain cofactor and would not compete with the full length tora for molybdo cofactor acquisition the overproduction of tora  completely inhibited the export of the full length tora and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso reductase but had no effect on the translocation of sufi nitrate induced formate dehydrogenase and hydrogenase  importantly deletion of the twin arginine signal peptide of tora  abolished the inhibitory effect moreover the overproduction of the tora signal peptide fused to the green fluorescence protein gfp was sufficient to block the tora translocation these results demonstrated that the twin arginine signal peptide of the tora protein specifically inhibits the translocation of a subset of tat substrates probably at the step of their targeting to the tat apparatus
