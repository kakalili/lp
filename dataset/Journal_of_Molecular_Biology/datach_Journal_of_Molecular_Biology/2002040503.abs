rna simulations probing hairpin unfolding and the dynamics of a gnra tetraloop edited by j dovdna
simulations of an rna hairpin containing a gnra tetraloop were conducted to allow the characterization of its secondary structure formation and dynamics ten  ns trajectories of the folded hairpin   gggc gcaa gccu   were generated using stochastic dynamics and the gb sa implicit solvent model at   k overall we find the stem to be a very stable subunit of this molecule whereas multiple loop conformations and transitions between them were observed these trajectories strongly suggest that extension of the c base away from the loop occurs cooperatively with an n type  s type sugar pucker conversion in that residue and that similar pucker transitions are necessary to stabilize other looped out bases in addition a short lived conformer with an extended fourth loop residue a  lacking this stabilizing   endo pucker mode was observed results of thermal perturbation at   k support this model of loop dynamics unfolding trajectories were produced using this same methodology at temperatures of   to   k the observed unfolding events display three state behavior kinetically including native globular and unfolded populations and based on these observations we propose a folding mechanism that consists of three distinct events  i collapse of the random unfolded structure and sampling of the globular state  ii passage into the folded region of configurational space as stem base pairs form and gain helicity and iii attainment of proper loop geometry and organization of loop pairing and stacking interactions these results are considered in the context of current experimental knowledge of this and similar nucleic acid hairpins
