the  s atpase s a s   tbp  regulates the transcription initiation of class ii transactivator
class ii transactivator ciita is the master regulator of the major histocompatibility class ii transcription complex mhc ii and is critical for initiation of adaptive immune responses we have previously demonstrated that the  s proteasome atpase sug plays a significant role in regulating ciita activity and mhc ii expression we now show that an additional component of the  s complex the  s atpase s a s   tat binding protein   is crucial for regulating cytokine inducible transcription of ciita lack of s a negatively impacts ciita activity and ciita expression decreased expression of s a significantly diminishes the recruitment of transcription factors to the ciita interferon  inducible promoter ciita promoter iv piv  and significantly decreases ciitapiv histone h and histone h acetylation with a preferential loss of acetylation at h lysine  and h lysine  in addition we provide evidence for the involvement of the  s aaa atpases associated with diverse cellular activity atpase hexamer as the  s atpase s b binds ciitapiv in an s a dependent fashion and has effects similar to s a on ciitapiv histone acetylation these analyses demonstrate the importance of  s atpases in the assembly of ciitapiv transcription machinery and provide additional insight into the regulatory mechanisms of the  s proteasome in mammalian transcription
