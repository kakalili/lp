the folding transition state of protein l is extensive with nonnative interactions and not small and polarized
progress in understanding protein folding relies heavily upon an interplay between experiment and theory in particular readily interpretable experimental data that can be meaningfully compared to simulations are required according to standard mutational  analysis the transition state for protein l contains only a single hairpin however we demonstrate here using  analysis with engineered metal ion binding sites that the transition state is extensive containing the entire four stranded  sheet underreporting of the structural content of the transition state by  analysis also occurs for acyl phosphatase pandit a d  jha a  freed k f  amp sosnick t r      small proteins fold through transition states with native like topologies j mol biol          ubiquitin sosnick t r  dothager r s  amp krantz b a      differences in the folding transition state of ubiquitin indicated by  and  analyses proc natl acad sci usa           and bdpa baxa m  freed k f  amp sosnick t r      quantifying the structural requirements of the folding transition state of protein a and other systems j mol biol           the carboxy terminal hairpin in the transition state of protein l is found to be nonnative a significant result that agrees with our protein data bank based backbone sampling and all atom simulations the nonnative character partially explains the failure of accepted experimental and native centric computational approaches to adequately describe the transition state hence caution is required even when an apparent agreement exists between experiment and theory thus highlighting the importance of having alternative methods for characterizing transition states
