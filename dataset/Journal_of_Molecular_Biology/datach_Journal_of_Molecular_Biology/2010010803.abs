mechanistic role of structurally dynamic regions in dicistroviridae igr iress
dicistroviridae intergenic region igr internal ribosome entry site s  ires rnas drive a cap independent pathway of translation initiation recruiting both small and large ribosomal subunits to viral rna without the use of any canonical translation initiation factors this ability is conferred by the folded three dimensional structure of the ires rna which has been solved by x ray crystallography here we report the chemical probing of plautia stali intestine virus igr ires in the unbound form in the  s subunit bound form and in the  s ribosome bound form the results when combined with an analysis of crystal structures suggest that parts of the ires rna change structure as the preinitiation complex forms using mutagenesis coupled with native gel electrophoresis preinitiation complex assembly assays and translation initiation assays we show that these potentially structurally dynamic elements of the ires are involved in different steps in the pathway of ribosome recruitment and translation initiation like trnas it appears that the igr ires undergoes local structural changes that are coordinated with structural changes in the ribosome and these are critical for the ires mechanism of action
