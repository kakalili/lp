DNA mismatch repair (MMR) models have proposed that MSH (MutS homolog) proteins identify DNA polymerase errors while interacting with the DNA replication fork. MLH (MutL homolog) proteins (primarily Mlh1–Pms1 in baker's yeast) then survey the genome for lesion-bound MSH proteins. The resulting MSH–MLH complex formed at a DNA lesion initiates downstream steps in repair. MLH proteins act as dimers and contain long (20–30nm) unstructured arms that connect two terminal globular domains. These arms can vary between 100 and 300 amino acids in length, are highly divergent between organisms, and are resistant to amino acid substitutions. To test the roles of the linker arms in MMR, we engineered a protease cleavage site into the Mlh1 linker arm domain of baker's yeast Mlh1–Pms1. Cleavage of the Mlh1 linker arm in vitro resulted in a defect in Mlh1–Pms1 DNA binding activity, and in vivo proteolytic cleavage resulted in a complete defect in MMR. We then generated a series of truncation mutants bearing Mlh1 and Pms1 linker arms of varying lengths. This work revealed that MMR is greatly compromised when portions of the Mlh1 linker are removed, whereas repair is less sensitive to truncation of the Pms1 linker arm. Purified complexes containing truncations in Mlh1 and Pms1 linker arms were analyzed and found to have differential defects in DNA binding that also correlated with the ability to form a ternary complex with Msh2–Msh6 and mismatch DNA. These observations are consistent with the unstructured linker domains of MLH proteins providing distinct interactions with DNA during MMR.
