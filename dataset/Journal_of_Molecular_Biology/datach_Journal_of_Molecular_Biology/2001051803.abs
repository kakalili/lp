the structure of a zeta class glutathione s transferase from arabidopsis thaliana characterisation of a gst with novel active site architecture and a putative role in tyrosine catabolism edited by i a wilson
the cis trans isomerisation of maleylacetoacetate to fumarylacetoacetate is the penultimate step in the tyrosine phenylalanine catabolic pathway and has recently been shown to be catalysed by glutathione s transferase enzymes belonging to the zeta class given this primary metabolic role it is unsurprising that zeta class glutathione s transferases are well conserved over a considerable period of evolution being found in vertebrates plants insects and fungi the structure of this glutathione s transferase cloned from arabidopsis thaliana has been solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering and refined to a final crystallographic r factor of    using data from     to     the zeta class enzyme adopts the canonical glutathione s transferase fold and forms a homodimer with each subunit consisting of   residues in agreement with structures of glutathione s transferases from the theta and phi classes a serine residue ser  is present in the active site at a position that would allow it to stabilise the thiolate anion of glutathione site directed mutagenesis of this residue confirms its importance in catalysis in addition the role of a highly conserved cysteine residue cys  present in the active site of the zeta class glutathione s transferase enzymes is discussed
