the crystal structure of the hinge domain of the escherichia coli structural maintenance of chromosomes protein mukb
mukb a divergent structural maintenance of chromosomes smc protein is important for chromosomal segregation and condensation in  proteobacteria mukb and canonical smc proteins share a characteristic five domain structure globular n and c terminal domains interact to form an atp binding cassette like atpase or  head  domain which is connected to a smaller dimerization or  hinge  domain by a long antiparallel coiled coil in addition to mediating dimerization this hinge region has been implicated in both conformational flexibility and dynamic protein  dna interactions we report here the first crystallographic model of the mukb hinge domain this model also contains approximately   of the coiled coil domain including an unusual coiled coil deviation these results will facilitate studies to clarify the roles of both the hinge and the coiled coil domains in mukb function
