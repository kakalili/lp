The crystal structure of human hemoglobin crosslinked between the Lysβ82 residues has been determined at 2.30 Å resolution. The crosslinking reaction was performed under oxy conditions using bis(3,5-dibromosalicyl) fumarate; the modified hemoglobin has increased oxygen affinity and lacks cooperativity. Since the crystallization occurred under deoxy conditions, the resulting structure displays conformational characteristics of both the (oxy) R and the (deoxy) T-states. β82XLHbA does not fully reach its T-state conformation due to the presence of the crosslink. The R-state-like characteristics of deoxy β82XLHbA include the position of the distal Hisβ63 (E7) residue, indicating a possible reason for the high oxygen affinity of this derivative. Other areas of the molecule, particularly those thought to be important in the allosteric transition, such as Tyrβ145 (HC2) and the switch region involving Proα144 (CD2), Thrα141 (C6) and Hisβ297 (FG4), are in intermediate positions between the R and T-states. Thus, the structure may represent a stabilized intermediate in the allosteric transition of hemoglobin.
