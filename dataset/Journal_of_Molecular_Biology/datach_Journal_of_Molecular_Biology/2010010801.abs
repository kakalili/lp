evolution of stability in a cold active enzyme elicits specificity relaxation and highlights substrate related effects on temperature adaptation
molecular aspects of thermal adaptation of proteins were studied by following the co evolution of temperature dependence conformational stability and substrate specificity in a cold active lipase modified via directed evolution we found that the evolution of kinetic stability was accompanied by a relaxation in substrate specificity moreover temperature dependence and selectivity turned out to be mutually dependent while the wild type protein was strictly specific for short chain triglycerides c  in the temperature range      c and displayed highest activity in the cold its stabilized variant was able to accept c and c  molecules and its selectivity was temperature dependent we could not detect any improvement in the overall structural robustness of the mutant when the structure was challenged by temperature or chemical denaturants there is however strong evidence for local stabilization effects in the active site region provided by two independent approaches differential scanning fluorimetry revealed that the exposure of hydrophobic patches as the active site is precedes denaturation and molecular dynamics simulations confirmed that stability was obtained by restriction of the mobility of the lid a flexible structure that regulates the access to the enzyme active site and influences its stability this reduction of lid movements is suggested to be accompanied by a concomitant increase in the mobility of other protein regions thus accounting for the observed broadening of substrate specificity
