trna leucine identity and recognition sets edited by d e draper
transfer rnas trnas are grouped into two classes based on the structure of their variable loop in escherichia coli trnas from three isoaccepting groups are classified as type ii leucine trnas comprise one such group we used both in vivo and in vitro approaches to determine the nucleotides that are required for trnaleu function in addition to investigate the role of the trna fold we compared the in vivo and in vitro characteristics of type i trnaleu variants with their type ii counterparts a minimum of six conserved trnaleu nucleotides were required to change the amino acid identity and recognition of a type ii trnaser amber suppressor from a serine to a leucine residue five of these nucleotides affect trna tertiary structure the g  c  tertiary  levitt base pair  in trnaser was changed to a  u  the number of nucleotides in the  and  regions of the d loop was changed to achieve the positioning of g  and g  that is found in all trnaleu a base was inserted at position  n between the base paired extra stem and the t stem in addition the g   discriminator  base of trnaser was changed to a  this minimally altered trnaser exclusively inserted leucine residues and was an excellent in vitro substrate for leurs in a parallel experiment nucleotide substitutions were made in a glutamine inserting type i trna rnaser  an amber suppressor in which the trnaser type ii extra stem loop is replaced by a consensus type i loop  this  type i  swap experiment was successful both in vivo and in vitro but required more nucleotide substitutions than did the type ii swap the type i and ii swaps revealed differences in the contributions of the trnaleu acceptor stem base pairs to trnaleu function in the type i but not the type ii fold leucine specificity was contingent on the presence of the trnaleu acceptor stem sequence the type i and ii trnas used in this study differed only in the sequence and structure of the variable loop by altering this loop and thereby possibly introducing subtle changes into the overall trna fold it became possible to detect otherwise cryptic contributions of the acceptor stem sequence to recognition by leurs possible reasons for this effect are discussed
