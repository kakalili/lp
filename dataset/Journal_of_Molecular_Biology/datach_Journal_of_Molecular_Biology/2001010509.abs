structural rearrangements and insertions of dispersed elements in pericentromeric alpha satellites occur preferably at kinkable dna sites edited by j karn
centromeric region of human chromosome  comprises two long alphoid dna arrays the well homogenized and cenp b box rich   i and the   ii containing a set of less homogenized and cenp b box poor subfamilies located closer to the short arm of the chromosome continuous alphoid fragment of   monomers bordering the non satellite sequences in human chromosome  was mapped to the pericentromeric short arm region by fluorescence in situ hybridization    ii locus  the alphoid sequence contained several rearrangements including five large deletions within monomers and insertions of three truncated l elements no binding sites for centromeric protein cenp b were found we analyzed sequences with alphoid non alphoid junctions selectively screened from current databases and revealed various rearrangements disrupting the regular tandem alphoid structure namely deletions duplications inversions expansions of short oligonucleotide motifs and insertions of different dispersed elements the detailed analysis of more than   alphoid monomers from junction regions showed that the vast majority of structural alterations and joinings with non alphoid dnas occur in alpha satellite families lacking cenp b boxes most analyzed events were found in sequences located toward the edges of the centromeric alphoid arrays different dispersed elements were inserted into alphoid dna at kinkable dinucleotides tg ca or ta situated between pyrimidine purine tracks dna rearrangements resulting from different processes such as recombination and replication occur at kinkable dna sites alike insertions but irrespectively of the occurrence of pyrimidine purine tracks it seems that kinkable dinucleotides tg ca and ta are part of recognition signals for many proteins involved in recombination replication and insertional events alphoid dna is a good model for studying these processes
