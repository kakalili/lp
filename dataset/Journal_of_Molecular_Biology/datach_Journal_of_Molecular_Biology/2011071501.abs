copper ii induced secondary structure changes and reduced folding stability of the prion protein
the cellular isoform of the prion protein prpc is a cu  binding cell surface glycoprotein that when misfolded is responsible for a range of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies as changes in prpc conformation are intimately linked with disease pathogenesis the effect of cu  ions on the structure and stability of the protein has been investigated urea unfolding studies indicate that cu  ions destabilise the native fold of prpc the midpoint of the unfolding transition is reduced by       m urea in the presence of  mol equiv of cu  this equates to an appreciable difference in free energy of unfolding       kj mol   at the midpoint of unfolding  we relate cu  induced changes in secondary structure for full length prp      to smaller cu  binding fragments in particular cu  induced structural changes can directly be attributed to cu  binding to the octarepeat region of prpc furthermore a  sheet like transition that is observed when cu ions are bound to the amyloidogenic fragment of prp residues      is due only to local cu  coordination to the individual binding sites centred at his  and his   cu  binding does not directly generate a  sheet conformation within prpc however cu  ions do destabilise the native fold of prpc and may make the transition to a misfolded state more favourable
