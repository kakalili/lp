identification and structure of the anti sigma factor binding domain of the disulphide stress regulated sigma factor  r from streptomyces coelicolor
the extracytoplasmic function ecf sigma factor  r is a global regulator of redox homeostasis in the antibiotic producing bacterium streptomyces coelicolor with a similar role in other actinomycetes such as mycobacterium tuberculosis normally maintained in an inactive state by its bound anti sigma factor rsra  r dissociates in response to intracellular disulphide stress to direct core rna polymerase to transcribe genes such as trxba and trxc that encode the enzymes of the thioredoxin disulphide reductase pathway that re establish redox homeostasis little is known about where rsra binds on  r or how it suppresses  r dependent transcriptional activity using a combination of proteolysis surface enhanced laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry and pull down assays we identify an n terminal    kda domain  rn that encompasses region  of  r that represents the major rsra binding site we show that  rn inhibits transcription by an unrelated sigma factor and that this inhibition is relieved by rsra binding reaffirming that region  is involved in binding to core rna polymerase but also demonstrating that the likely mechanism by which rsra inhibits  r activity is by blocking this association we also report the    resolution crystal structure of  rn that reveals extensive structural conservation with the equivalent region of   from escherichia coli as well as with the cyclin box a domain fold found in the eukaryotic proteins tfiib and cyclin a  rn has a propensity to aggregate due to steric complementarity of oppositely charged surfaces on the domain but this is inhibited by rsra an observation that suggests a possible mode of action for rsra which we compare to other well studied sigma factor anti sigma factor systems
