crystal structure of the ligand binding domain of netrin g
netrin g proteins represent a small family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules related to netrins and to the polymerization domains of laminins two netrin g proteins are encoded in vertebrate genomes netrins g and g  which are known to bind the leucine rich repeat proteins netrin g ligand ngl  and ngl  respectively netrin g proteins share a common multi domain architecture comprising a laminin n terminal ln domain followed by three laminin epidermal growth factor like le domains and a c  region containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor here we use deletion analysis to show that the ln domain region of netrin gs contains the binding site for ngls to which they bind with   stoichiometry and sub micromolar affinity netrin gs are alternatively spliced in their le domain regions but the binding region the ln domain is identical in all splice forms we determined the crystal structure for a fragment comprising the ln domain and domain le of netrin g by sulfur single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing and refined it to     resolution the structure reveals an overall architecture similar to that of laminin  chain ln domains but includes significant differences including a ca  binding site in the ln domain these results reveal the minimal binding unit for interaction of netrin gs with ngls define structural features specific to netrin gs and suggest that netrin g alternative splicing is not involved in ngl recognition
