nmr characterization of the energy landscape of sumo  in the native state ensemble
characterizing the low energy excited states in the energy landscape of a protein is one of the exciting and demanding problems in structural biology at the present time these describe the adaptability of the protein structure to external perturbations in this context we used here non linear dependence of amide proton chemical shifts on temperature to identify residues accessing alternative conformations in sumo  in the native state as well as in the near native states created by sub denaturing concentrations of urea the number of residues accessing alternative conformations increases and the profiles of curved temperature dependence also change with increasing urea concentration in every case these alternative conformations lie within  kcal mol from the ground state and are separated from it by low energy barriers the residues that access alternative conformations span the length of the protein chain but are located at particular regions on the protein structure these include many of the loops   and   strands and some edges of the helices we observed that some of the regions of the protein structure that exhibit such fluctuations coincide with the protein s binding surfaces with different substrate like gtpase effector domain ged of dynamin sumo binding motifs sbm  e  activating enzyme sae sae  and e  conjugating enzyme ubc  enzymes of sumoylation machinery reported earlier we speculate that this would have significant implications for the binding of diversity of targets by sumo  for the variety of functions it is involved in
