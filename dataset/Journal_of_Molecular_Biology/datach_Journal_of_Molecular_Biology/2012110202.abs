structural interactions between lipids water and s  s voltage sensing domains
membrane proteins serve crucial signaling and transport functions yet relatively little is known about their structures in membrane environments or how lipids interact with these proteins for voltage activated ion channels x ray structures suggest that the mobile voltage sensing s helix would be exposed to the membrane and functional studies reveal that lipid modification can profoundly alter channel activity here we use solid state nmr to investigate structural interactions of lipids and water with s  s voltage sensing domains and to explore whether lipids influence the structure of the protein our results demonstrate that s  s domains exhibit extensive interactions with lipids and that these domains are heavily hydrated when embedded in a membrane we also find evidence for preferential interactions of anionic lipids with s  s domains and that these interactions have lifetimes on the timescale of     s arg residues within s  s domains are well hydrated and are positioned in close proximity to lipids exhibiting local interactions with both lipid headgroups and acyl chains comparative studies with a positively charged lipid lacking a phosphodiester group reveal that this lipid modification has only modest effects on the structure and hydration of s  s domains taken together our results demonstrate that arg residues in s  s voltage sensing domains reside in close proximity to the hydrophobic interior of the membrane yet are well hydrated a requirement for carrying charge and driving protein motions in response to changes in membrane voltage
