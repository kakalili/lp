repression of transcription initiation at   pr by   repressor effects on transition of a closed to an open promoter complex
the lambdoid bacteriophage repressors function both as transcription activators and repressors regulation of transcription at the adjacent but divergent promoters prm and pr determines the phage s choice between the lytic and lysogenic development pathways here we demonstrate that   repressor bound at   or alone is not sufficient to repress transcription from   pr but that   repressor bound at   or alone is necessary and sufficient to repress pr transcription this is different from what occurs in the related bacteriophage   in which binding of  repressor to either  or or  or represses transcription from  pr the combined results of gel mobility shift and kmno footprinting assays show that while   repressor binding to   or does not preclude rna polymerase binding at the pr promoter it does prevent it from forming open complexes at this promoter the rna polymerase pr complexes that form in the presence of repressor are heparin resistant and the dna is not melted this observation indicates that   repressor bound at   or inhibits transcription initiation at the pr promoter by  locking  the rna polymerase pr complex into an inactive state instead of  blocking  the access of rna polymerase to promoter dna
