designing repeat proteins modular leucine rich repeat protein libraries based on the mammalian ribonuclease inhibitor family
we present a novel approach to design repeat proteins of the leucine rich repeat lrr family for the generation of libraries of intracellular binding molecules from an analysis of naturally occurring lrr proteins we derived the concept to assemble repeat proteins with randomized surface positions from libraries of consensus repeat modules as a guiding principle we used the mammalian ribonuclease inhibitor ri family which comprises cytosolic lrr proteins known for their extraordinary affinities to many rnases by aligning the amino acid sequences of the internal repeats of human pig rat and mouse ri we derived a first consensus sequence for the characteristic alternating  and  amino acid residue a type and b type repeats structural considerations were used to replace all conserved cysteine residues to define less conserved positions and to decide where to introduce randomized amino acid residues the so devised consensus ri repeat library was generated at the dna level and assembled by stepwise ligation to give libraries of    repeats terminal capping repeats known to shield the continuous hydrophobic core of the lrr domain from the surrounding solvent were adapted from human ri in this way designed lrr protein libraries of    lrrs equivalent to      amino acid residues were obtained the biophysical analysis of randomly chosen library members showed high levels of soluble expression in the escherichia coli cytosol monomeric behavior as characterized by gel filtration and  helical cd spectra confirming the success of our design approach
