nmr structure and backbone dynamics of a concatemer of epidermal growth factor homology modules of the human low density lipoprotein receptor edited by p e wright
the ligand binding region of the low density lipoprotein ldl receptor is formed by seven n terminal imperfect cysteine rich lb modules this segment is followed by an epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain with two n terminal tandem egf like modules that are thought to participate in ldl binding and recycling of the endocytosed receptor to the cell surface egf a and the concatemer egf ab of these modules were expressed in escherichia coli correct protein folding of egf a and the concatemer egf ab was achieved in the presence or absence of calcium ions in contrast to the lb modules which require them for correct folding homonuclear and heteronuclear h  n nmr spectroscopy at   t was used to determine the three dimensional structure of the concatemer both modules are formed by two pairs of short anti parallel  strands in the concatemer these modules have a fixed relative orientation stabilized by calcium ion binding and hydrophobic interactions at the interface  n longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates and  h  n heteronuclear noes were used to derive a model free description of the backbone dynamics of the molecule the concatemer appears relatively rigid particularly near the calcium ion binding site at the module interface with an average generalized order parameter of       some mutations causing familial hypercholesterolemia may now be rationalized mutations of d  d  and e  in the egf b calcium ion binding region may affect the stability of the linker and thus the orientation of the tandem modules the diminutive core also provides little structural stabilization necessitating the presence of disulfide bonds the structure and dynamics of egf ab contrast with the n terminal lb modules which require calcium ions both for folding to form the correct disulfide connectivities and for maintenance of the folded structure and are connected by highly mobile linking peptides
