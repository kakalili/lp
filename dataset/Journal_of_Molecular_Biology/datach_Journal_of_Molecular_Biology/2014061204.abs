a mutation in the catalytic loop of hsp  specifically impairs atpase stimulation by aha p but not hch p
heat shock protein   hsp  is a molecular chaperone that plays a central role in maintaining cellular homeostasis by facilitating activation of a large number of client proteins atp dependent client activation by hsp  is tightly regulated by a host of co chaperone proteins that control progression through the activation cycle atpase stimulation of hsp  by aha p requires a conserved rkxk motif that interacts with the catalytic loop of hsp  in this study we explore the role of this rkxk motif in the biological and biochemical properties of hch p we found that this motif is required for hch p mediated atpase stimulation in vitro but mutations that block stimulation do not impair the action of hch p in vivo this suggests that the biological function of hch p is not directly linked to atpase stimulation moreover a mutation in the catalytic loop of hsp  specifically impairs atpase stimulation by aha p but not by hch p our work here suggests that both hch p and aha p regulate hsp  function through interaction with the catalytic loop but do so in different ways
