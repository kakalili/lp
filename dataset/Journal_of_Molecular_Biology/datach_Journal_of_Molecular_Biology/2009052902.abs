isolation characterisation and molecular imaging of a high molecular weight insect biliprotein a member of the hexameric arylphorin protein family
the abundant blue hemolymph protein of the last instar larvae of the moth cerura vinula was purified and characterized by protein analytical spectroscopic and electron microscopic methods amino acid sequences obtained from a large number of cleavage peptides revealed a high level of similarity of the blue protein with arylphorins from a number of other moth species in particular there is a high abundance of the aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine amounting to about   of total amino acids and a low content of methionine    in the cerura protein the mass of the native protein complex was studied by size exclusion chromatography analytical ultracentrifugation dynamic light scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopy and found to be around   kda denaturating gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry suggested the presence of two proteins with masses of about   kda the native cerura protein is therefore a hexameric complex of two different subunits of similar size as is known for arylphorins the protein was further characterized as a weakly acidic pi    glycoprotein containing mannose glucose and n acetylglucosamine in an approximate ratio of     the structure proposed for the most abundant oligosaccharide of the cerura arylphorin was the same as already identified in arylphorins from other moths the intense blue colour of the cerura protein is due to non covalent association with a bilin of novel structure at an estimated protein subunit to ligand ratio of   transmission electron microscopy of the biliprotein showed single particles of cylindrical shape measuring about   nm in diameter and  nm in height a small fraction of particles of the same diameter but half the height was likely a trimeric arylphorin dissociation intermediate preliminary three dimensional reconstruction based on averaged transmission electron microscopy projections of the individual particles revealed a double trimeric structure for the hexameric cerura biliprotein complex suggesting it to be a dimer of trimers
