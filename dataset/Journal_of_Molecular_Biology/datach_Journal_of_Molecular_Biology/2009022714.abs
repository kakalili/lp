crystal structure of the irre protein a central regulator of dna damage repair in deinococcaceae
deinococcaceae are famous for their extreme radioresistance transcriptome analysis in deinococcus radiodurans revealed a group of genes up regulated in response to desiccation and ionizing radiation irre a novel protein initially found in d radiodurans was shown to be a positive regulator of some of these genes deinococcus deserti irre is able to restore radioresistance in a d radiodurans  irre mutant the d deserti irre crystal structure reveals a unique combination of three domains one zinc peptidase like domain one helix turn helix motif and one gaf like domain mutant analysis indicates that the first and third domains are critical regions for radiotolerance in particular mutants affected in the putative zinc binding site are as sensitive to gamma and uv irradiation as the  irre bacteria and radioresistance is strongly decreased with the h  l mutation present in the c terminal domain in addition modeling of irre  dna interaction suggests that the observed irre structure may not bind double stranded dna through its central helix turn helix motif and that irre is not a classic transcriptional factor that activates gene expression by its direct binding to dna we propose that the putative protease activity of irre could be a key element of transcription enhancement and that a more classic transcription factor possibly an irre substrate would link irre to transcription of genes specifically involved in radioresistance
