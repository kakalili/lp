analysis of a kinase anchoring protein akap interaction with protein kinase a pka regulatory subunits pka isoform specificity in akap binding edited by j a wells
compartmentalization of camp dependent protein kinase pka is in part mediated by specialized protein motifs in the dimerization domain of the regulatory r subunits of pka that participate in protein protein interactions with an amphipathic helix region in a kinase anchoring proteins akaps  in order to develop a molecular understanding of the subcellular distribution and specific functions of pka isozymes mediated by association with akaps it is of importance to determine the apparent binding constants of the r subunit akap interactions here we present a novel approach using surface plasmon resonance spr to examine directly the association and dissociation of akaps with all four r subunit isoforms immobilized on a modified camp surface with a high level of accuracy we show that both akap  and s akap  d akap bind rii  very well apparent kd values of   and  nm respectively  both proteins also bind rii  quite well but with three to fourfold lower affinities than those observed versus rii  however only s akap  d akap interacts with ri  at a nanomolar affinity apparent kd of   nm  in comparison akap  binds rii  apparent kd of   nm with a tenfold higher affinity than rii  and has no detectable binding to ri  surface competition assays with increasing concentrations of a competitor peptide covering amino acid residues   to   of the thyroid anchoring protein ht  demonstrated that ht  but not a proline substituted peptide ht  p competed binding of rii  and rii  to all the akaps examined ec  values from  to   nm  furthermore ri  interaction with s akap  d akap was competed ec    nm with the same peptide here we report for the first time an approach to determine apparent rate and equilibria binding constants for the interaction of all pka isoforms with any akap as well as a novel approach for characterizing peptide competitors that disrupt pka akap anchoring
