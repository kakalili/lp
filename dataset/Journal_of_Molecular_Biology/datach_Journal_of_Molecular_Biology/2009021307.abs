the universal stress protein uspc scaffolds the kdpd kdpe signaling cascade of escherichia coli under salt stress
the sensor kinase kdpd and the response regulator kdpe control induction of the kdpfabc operon encoding the high affinity k transport system kdpfabc in response to k limitation or salt stress under k limiting conditions the kdp system restores the intracellular k concentration while in response to salt stress k is accumulated far above the normal content the kinase activity of kdpd is inhibited at high concentrations of k  so it has been puzzling how the sensor can be activated in response to salt stress here we demonstrate that the universal stress protein uspc acts as a scaffolding protein of the kdpd kdpe signaling cascade by interacting with a usp domain in kdpd of the uspa subfamily under salt stress escherichia coli encodes three single domain proteins of this subfamily uspa uspc and uspd whose expression is up regulated under various stress conditions among these proteins only uspc stimulated the in vitro reconstructed signaling cascade kdpd  kdpe  dna resulting in phosphorylation of kdpe at a k concentration that would otherwise almost prevent phosphorylation in agreement in a  uspc mutant kdpfabc production was down regulated significantly when cells were exposed to salt stress but unchanged under k limitation biochemical studies revealed that uspc interacts specifically with the usp domain in the stimulus perceiving n terminal domain of kdpd furthermore uspc stabilized the kdpd kdpe  p dna complex and is therefore believed to act as a scaffolding protein this study describes the stimulation of a bacterial two component system under distinct stress conditions by a scaffolding protein and highlights a new role of the universal stress proteins
