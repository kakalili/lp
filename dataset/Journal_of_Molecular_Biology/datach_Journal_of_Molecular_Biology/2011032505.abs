pkn  a homologue of mammalian pkn is involved in the regulation of muscle contraction and force transmission in c elegans
to examine the in vivo functions of protein kinase n pkn  one of the effectors of rho small guanosine triphosphatases gtpases  we used the nematode caenorhabditis elegans as a genetic model system we identified a c elegans homologue pkn  of mammalian pkn and confirmed direct binding to c elegans rho small gtpases using a green fluorescent protein reporter we showed that pkn  is mainly expressed in various muscles and is localized at dense bodies and m lines overexpression of the pkn  kinase domain and loss of function mutations by genomic deletion of pkn  resulted in a loopy unc phenotype which has been reported in many mutants of neuronal genes the results of mosaic analysis and body wall muscle specific expression of the pkn  kinase domain suggests that this loopy phenotype is due to the expression of pkn  in body wall muscle the genomic deletion of pkn  also showed a defect in force transmission these results suggest that pkn  functions as a regulator of muscle contraction  relaxation and as a component of the force transmission mechanism
