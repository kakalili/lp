n terminal domain of bombyx mori fibroin mediates the assembly of silk in response to ph decrease
fibroins serve as the major building blocks of silk fiber as the major component of fibroin the fibroin heavy chain is a considerably large protein comprising n terminal and c terminal hydrophilic domains and  highly repetitive gly ala rich regions flanked by internal hydrophilic blocks here we show the crystal structure of the fibroin n terminal domain fibnt at ph    revealing a remarkable double layered anti parallel  sheet with each layer comprising two fibnt molecules entangled together we also show that fibnt undergoes a ph responsive conformational transition from random coil to  sheets at around ph    dynamic light scattering demonstrates that fibnt tends to oligomerize as ph decreases to   and electron microscopy reveals micelle like oligomers our results are consistent with the micelle assembly model of silk fibroin and more importantly show that the n terminal domain in itself has the capacity to form micelle like structures in response to ph decrease structural and mutagenesis analyses further reveal the important role of conserved acidic residues clustered in fibnt such as glu  and asp   in preventing premature  sheet formation at neutral ph collectively we suggest that fibnt functions as a ph responsive self assembly module that could prevent premature  sheet formation at neutral ph yet could initiate fibroin assembly as ph decreases along the lumen of the posterior silk gland to the anterior silk gland
