structural evidence for co evolution of the regulation of contraction and energy production in skeletal muscle
skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase phk is a ca  dependent enzyme complex        with the  subunit being tightly bound endogenous calmodulin cam  the ca  dependent activation of glycogen phosphorylase by phk couples muscle contraction with glycogen breakdown in the  excitation  contraction  energy production triad   although the ca  dependent protein  protein interactions among the relevant contractile components of muscle are well characterized such interactions have not been previously examined in the intact phk complex here we show that zero length cross linking of the phk complex produces a covalent dimer of its catalytic  and cam subunits utilizing mass spectrometry we determined the residues cross linked to be in an ef hand of cam and in a region of the  subunit sharing high sequence similarity with the ca  sensitive molecular switch of troponin i that is known to bind actin and troponin c a homolog of cam our findings represent an unusual binding of cam to a target protein and supply an explanation for the low ca  stoichiometry of phk that has been reported they also provide direct structural evidence supporting co evolution of the coordinate regulation by ca  of contraction and energy production in muscle through the sharing of a common structural motif in troponin i and the catalytic subunit of phk for their respective interactions with the homologous ca  binding proteins troponin c and cam
