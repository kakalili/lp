the  kda carboxy terminal domain of poly adp ribose polymerase  forms catalytically competent homo and heterodimers in the absence of dna
the  kda carboxy terminal catalytic domain cd of avian poly adp ribose polymerase parp  was cloned expressed in a baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography the purified polypeptide synthesized covalent cd poly adp ribose conjugates in the absence of dna electrophoretic analysis of the adp ribose chain length distribution generated indicated that recombinant cd was able to catalyze the initiation elongation and branching reactions of poly adp ribose synthesis although at a   fold lower efficiency than wild type parp  kinetic evaluation of poly adp ribose synthesis showed that the enzymatic activities of cd increased for up to  minutes in a time dependent manner moreover the rates of cd auto poly adp ribosyl ation increased with second order kinetics as a function of the protein concentration with either  nad or   deoxynad as a substrate furthermore the formation of catalytically competent cd parp  heterodimers was also observed in specific ultrafiltration experiments thus we conclude that the  kda carboxy terminus of parp  forms a competent catalytic dimer in the absence of dna and that its automodification reaction is intermolecular
