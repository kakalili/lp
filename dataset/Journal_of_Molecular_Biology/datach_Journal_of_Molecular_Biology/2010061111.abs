structural and functional characterization of reston ebola virus vp  interferon inhibitory domain
ebolaviruses are causative agents of lethal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates among the filoviruses characterized thus far reston ebola virus rebov is the only ebola virus that is nonpathogenic to humans despite the fact that rebov can cause lethal disease in nonhuman primates previous studies also suggest that rebov is less effective at inhibiting host innate immune responses than zaire ebola virus zebov or marburg virus virally encoded vp  protein is critical for immune suppression but an understanding of the relative contributions of vp  proteins from rebov and other filoviruses is currently lacking in order to address this question we characterized the rebov vp  interferon inhibitory domain iid using structural biochemical and virological studies these studies reveal differences in double stranded rna binding and interferon inhibition between the two species these observed differences are likely due to increased stability and loss of flexibility in rebov vp  iid as demonstrated by thermal shift stability assays consistent with this finding the     crystal structure of rebov vp  iid reveals that it is highly similar to that of zebov vp  iid with an overall backbone r m s d of      but contains an additional helical element at the linker between the two subdomains of vp  iid mutations near the linker including swapping sequences between rebov and zebov reveal that the linker sequence has limited tolerance for variability together with the previously solved ligand free and double stranded rna bound forms of zebov vp  iid structures our current studies on rebov vp  iid reinforce the importance of vp  in immune suppression functional differences observed between rebov and zebov vp  proteins may contribute to observed differences in pathogenicity but these are unlikely to be the major determinant however the high level of similarity in structure and the low tolerance for sequence variability coupled with the multiple critical roles played by ebola virus vp  proteins highlight the viability of vp  as a potential target for therapeutic development
