a folding zone in the ribosomal exit tunnel for kv  helix formation
although it is now clear that protein secondary structure can be acquired early while the nascent peptide resides within the ribosomal exit tunnel the principles governing folding of native polytopic proteins have not yet been elucidated we now report an extensive investigation of native kv   a voltage gated k channel including transmembrane and linker segments synthesized in sequence these native segments form helices vectorially n to c terminus only in a permissive vestibule located in the last    of the tunnel native linker sequences similarly fold in this vestibule finally secondary structure acquired in the ribosome is retained in the translocon these findings emerge from accessibility studies of a diversity of native transmembrane and linker sequences and may therefore be applicable to protein biogenesis in general
