sulfate acts as phosphate analog on the monomeric catalytic fragment of the cpx atpase copb from sulfolobus solfataricus
the crystal structure of the catalytic fragment of a sulfolobus solfataricus p type atpase copb b was determined with a     resolution copb b is the major soluble fragment of the archaeal cpx atpase copb and is comprized of a nucleotide and a phosphorylation domain in the crystalline state two molecules of copb b are in close contact to each other although the presence of dimers in free solution could be ruled out by analytical ultracentrifugation the overall architecture of copb b is similar to that of other p type atpases such as ca atpase short peptide segments are linking the nucleotide binding to the phosphorylation domain copb b exhibits   sequence identity of   aligned residues with the respective fragment of the archaeoglobus fulgidus atpase copa the copb b nucleotide binding domain has the most primitive fold yet identified for this enzyme class it is   identical to the nucleotide binding domain of the disease related wilson atpase atp b   structurally aligned residues  structural superposition with ca atpase suggests a putative nucleotide binding site in copb b the phosphorylation domain of copb b is structurally related to the corresponding part of ca atpase in the anion bound e state in copb b crystals a bound sulfate anion was identified at the phosphate binding location in solution state the potential binding of copb b to phosphate was probed with  pi bound phosphate could be readily displaced by orthovanadate at submillimolar concentration as well as by sulfate at millimolar concentration it is possible therefore to assign the structure of the sulfate bound phosphorylation domain of copb b to a state related to the e  pi intermediate state of the catalytic cycle
