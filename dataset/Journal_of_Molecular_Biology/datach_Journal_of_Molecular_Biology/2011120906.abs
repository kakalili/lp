the crystal structure analysis of group b streptococcus sortase c  a model for the  lid  movement upon substrate binding
a unique feature of the class c type sortases enzymes essential for gram positive pilus biogenesis is the presence of a flexible  lid  anchored in the active site however the mechanistic details of the  lid  displacement suggested to be a critical prelude for enzyme catalysis are not yet known this is partly due to the absence of enzyme  substrate and enzyme  inhibitor complex crystal structures we have recently described the crystal structures of the streptococcus agalactiae sag   v r sortase srtc in two space groups type ii and type iii and that of its  lid  mutant and proposed a role of the  lid  as a protector of the active site hydrophobic environment here we report the crystal structures of sag   v r sortase c in a different space group type i and that of its complex with a small molecule cysteine protease inhibitor we observe that the catalytic cys residue is covalently linked to the small molecule inhibitor without lid displacement however the type i structure provides a view of the sortase srtc lid displacement while having structural elements similar to a substrate sorting motif suitably positioned in the active site we propose that these major conformational changes seen in the presence of a substrate mimic in the active site may represent universal features of class c sortase substrate recognition and enzyme activation
