transposition of mboumar  identification of a new naturally active mariner family transposon
although mariner transposons are widespread in animal genomes the vast majority harbor multiple inactivating mutations and only two naturally occurring elements are known to be active previously we discovered a mariner family transposon mboumar in the satellite dna of the ant messor bouvieri several copies of the transposon contain a full length open reading frame including mboumar  which has   nucleotide identity to mos of drosophila mauritiana to determine whether mboumar is currently active we expressed and purified the mboumar  transposase and demonstrate that it is able to catalyze the movement of a transposon from one plasmid to another in a genetic in vitro hop assay the efficiency is comparable to that of the well characterized mariner transposon mos  transposon insertions were precise and were flanked by ta duplications a hallmark of mariner transposition mboumar has been proposed to have a role in the evolution and maintenance of satellite dna in m bouvieri and its activity provides a means to examine the involvement of the transposon in the genome dynamics of this organism
