how well is enzyme function conserved as a function of pairwise sequence identity
enzyme function conservation has been used to derive the threshold of sequence identity necessary to transfer function from a protein of known function to an unknown protein using pairwise sequence comparison several studies suggested that when the sequence identity is above   enzyme function is well conserved in contrast rost argued that because of database bias the results from such simple pairwise comparisons might be misleading thus by grouping enzyme sequences into families based on sequence similarity and selecting representative sequences for comparison he showed that enzyme function starts to diverge quickly when the sequence identity is below   here we employ a strategy similar to rost s to reduce the database bias however we classify enzyme families based not only on sequence similarity but also on functional similarity i e sequences in each family must have the same four digits or the same first three digits of the enzyme commission ec number furthermore instead of selecting representative sequences for comparison we calculate the function conservation of each enzyme family and then average the degree of enzyme function conservation across all enzyme families our analysis suggests that for functional transferability   sequence identity can still be used as a confident threshold to transfer the first three digits of an ec number however to transfer all four digits of an ec number above   sequence identity is needed to have at least   accuracy moreover when psi blast is used the magnitude of the e value is found to be weakly correlated with the extent of enzyme function conservation in the third iteration of psi blast as a result functional annotation based on the e values from psi blast should be used with caution we also show that by employing an enzyme family specific sequence identity threshold above which   functional conservation is required functional inference of unknown sequences can be accurately accomplished however this comes at a cost those true positive sequences below this threshold cannot be uniquely identified
