complete nucleotide sequence and likely recombinatorial origin of bacteriophage t
we report the complete genome sequence    bp of bacteriophage t and provide a bioinformatic comparative analysis with other completely sequenced members of the t group of phages this comparison suggests that t has evolved from a recombinant between a t like coliphage and a yersiniophage to assess this recombination between t and the yersinia enterocolitica serotype o  phage  yeo   was accomplished in vivo coliphage progeny from this cross were selected that had many biological properties of t  this represents the first experimentally observed recombination between lytic phages whose normal hosts are different bacterial genera
