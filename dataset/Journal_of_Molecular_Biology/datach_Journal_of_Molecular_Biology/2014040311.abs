structural and functional analysis of fucose processing enzymes from streptococcus pneumoniae
fucose metabolism pathways are present in many bacterial species and typically contain the central fucose processing enzymes fucose isomerase fcsi  fuculose kinase fcsk  and fuculose  phosphate aldolase fcsa  fucose initially undergoes isomerization by fcsi producing fuculose which is then phosphorylated by fcsk fcsa cleaves the fuculose  phosphate product into lactaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate which can be incorporated into central metabolism allowing the bacterium to use fucose as an energy source streptococcus pneumoniae has fucose processing operons containing homologs of fcsi fcsk and fcsa however this bacterium appears unable to utilize fucose as an energy source to investigate this contradiction we performed biochemical and structural studies of the s pneumoniae fucose processing enzymes spfcsi spfcsk and spfcsa these enzymes are demonstrated to act in a sequential manner to ultimately produce dihydroxyacetone phosphate and have structural features entirely consistent with their observed biochemical activities analogous to the regulation of the escherichia coli fucose utilization operon fuculose  phosphate appears to act as an inducing molecule for activation of the s pneumoniae fucose operon despite our evidence that s pneumoniae appears to have the appropriate regulatory and biochemical machinery for fucose metabolism we confirmed the inability of the s pneumoniae tigr strain to grow on fucose or on the h disaccharide which is the probable substrate of the transporter for the pathway on the basis of these observations we postulate that the s pneumoniae fucose processing pathway has a non metabolic role in the interaction of this bacterium with its human host
