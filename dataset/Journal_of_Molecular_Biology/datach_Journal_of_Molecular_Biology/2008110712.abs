tyrosine phosphorylation in the sh domain disrupts negative regulatory interactions within the c abl kinase core
recent studies have shown that trans phosphorylation of the abl sh domain at tyr  by src family kinases is required for the full transforming activity of bcr abl tyr  localizes to a binding surface of the sh domain that engages the sh kinase linker in the crystal structure of the c abl core displacement of sh from the linker is likely to influence efficient downregulation of c abl hydrogen deuterium exchange hx and mass spectrometry ms were used to investigate whether tyr  phosphorylation affects the ability of the sh domain to interact intramolecularly with the sh kinase linker in cis as well as other peptide ligands in trans hx ms analysis of sh binding showed that when various abl constructs were phosphorylated at tyr  by the src family kinase hck sh was unable to engage a high affinity ligand in trans and that interaction with the linker in cis was reduced dramatically in a construct containing the sh and sh domains plus the linker phosphorylation of the abl sh domain on tyr  also interfered with binding to the negative regulatory protein abi  in trans site directed mutagenesis of tyr  and tyr   another tyrosine phosphorylation site located in the linker that may also influence sh binding implicated tyr  as the key residue necessary for disrupting regulation after phosphorylation these results imply that phosphorylation at tyr  by src family kinases prevents engagement of the abl sh domain with its intramolecular binding partner leading to enhanced abl kinase activity and cellular signaling
