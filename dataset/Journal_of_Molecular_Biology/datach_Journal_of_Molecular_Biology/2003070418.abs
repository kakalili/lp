in silico prediction of the peroxisomal proteome in fungi plants and animals
in an attempt to improve our abilities to predict peroxisomal proteins we have combined machine learning techniques for analyzing peroxisomal targeting signals pts  with domain based cross species comparisons between eight eukaryotic genomes our results indicate that this combined approach has a significantly higher specificity than earlier attempts to predict peroxisomal localization without a loss in sensitivity this allowed us to predict   peroxisomal proteins that almost completely lack a localization annotation these proteins can be grouped into  families covering most of the known steps in all known peroxisomal pathways in general plants have the highest number of predicted peroxisomal proteins and fungi the smallest number
