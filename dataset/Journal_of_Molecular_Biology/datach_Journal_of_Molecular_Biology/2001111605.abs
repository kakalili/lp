on the nature of conformational openings native and unfolded state hydrogen and thiol disulfide exchange studies of ferric aquomyoglobin  edited by p e wright
native state amide hydrogen exchange hx of proteins in the presence of denaturant has provided valuable details on the structures of equilibrium folding intermediates here we extend hx theory to model thiol group exchange sx in single cysteine containing variants of sperm whale ferric aquomyoglobin sx is complementary to hx in that it monitors conformational opening events that expose side chains rather than the main chain to solvent a simple two process model consisting of ex limited local structural fluctuations and ex limited global unfolding adequately accounts for all hx data sx is described by the same model except at very low denaturant concentrations and when the bulky labeling reagent    dithiobis  nitrobenzoic acid  dtnb is used under these conditions sx can occur by a novel denaturant dependent process this anomalous behavior is not observed when the smaller labeling reagent methyl methanethiosulfonate is employed suggesting that it reflects a denaturant induced increase in the amplitudes of local structural fluctuations it also is not seen in heme free apomyoglobin which may indicate that local openings are sufficiently large in the absence of denaturant to allow dtnb unhindered access differences in sx kinetics obtained using the two labeling reagents provide estimates of the sizes of local opening reactions at different sites in the protein at all sequence positions examined except for position   the same opening event appears to facilitate exchange of both backbone amide and side chain thiol groups the c  thiol group is exposed by a low energy fluctuation that does not expose its amide group to exchange
