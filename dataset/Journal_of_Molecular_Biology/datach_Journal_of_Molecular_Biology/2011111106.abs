novel structural insights into rotavirus recognition of ganglioside glycan receptors
rotaviruses ubiquitously infect children under the age of  being responsible for more than half a million diarrhoeal deaths each year worldwide host cell oligosaccharides containing sialic acid s are critical for attachment by rotaviruses however to date no detailed three dimensional atomic model showing the exact rotavirus interactions with these glycoconjugate receptors has been reported here we present the first crystallographic structures of the rotavirus carbohydrate recognizing protein vp   in complex with ganglioside gm glycans in combination with assessment of the inhibition of rotavirus infectivity by n acetyl and n glycolyl forms of this ganglioside our results reveal key details of rotavirus  ganglioside gm glycan recognition in addition they show a direct correlation between the carbohydrate specificities exhibited by vp   from porcine and by monkey rotaviruses and the respective infectious virus particles these novel results also indicate the potential binding interactions of rotavirus vp   with other sialic acid containing gangliosides
