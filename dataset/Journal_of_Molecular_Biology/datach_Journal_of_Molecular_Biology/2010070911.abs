binding of the mll phd finger to histone h k me is required for mll dependent gene transcription
the mll mixed lineage leukemia proto oncogene encodes a histone methyltransferase that creates the methylated histone h k epigenetic marks commonly associated with actively transcribed genes in addition to its canonical histone methyltransferase set domain the mll protein contains three plant homeodomain phd fingers that are well conserved between species but whose potential roles and requirements for mll function are unknown here we demonstrate that the third phd domain of mll phd  binds histone h trimethylated at lysine  h k me  with high affinity and specificity and h k me with  fold lower affinity biochemical and structural analyses using nmr and fluorescence spectroscopy identified key amino acids essential for the interaction with h k me  site directed mutations of the residues involved in recognition of h k me compromised in vitro h k me binding but not in vivo localization of full length mll to chromatin sites in target promoters of meis and hoxa genes whereas intact phd finger was necessary for mll occupancy at these promoters h k me binding was critical for mll transcriptional activity these results demonstrate that mll occupancy and target gene activation can be functionally separated furthermore these findings reveal that mll not only  writes  the h k me mark but also binds the mark and this binding is required for the transcriptional maintenance functions of mll
