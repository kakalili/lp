interspecies hybrid hbs complete neutralization of val   dependent polymerization of human  chain by pig  chains edited by k nagai
interspecies hybrid hbs   p  s  has been assembled in vitro from pig  globin and human  s chain the  p  s retains normal tetrameric structure     of human hb and an o affinity comparable to that of hbs in  mm hepes buffer but its o affinity is slightly higher than that of hbs in the presence of allosteric effectors chloride dpg and phosphate  the h nmr spectroscopy detected distinct differences between the heme environments and    interfaces of pig hb and hbs while their    interfaces appear very similar the interspecies hybrid  h  p resembles pig hb the pig  chain dictated the conformation of the heme environment of the human  subunit and to the    interfaces of the hybrid in the  p  s hybrid  s chain dictated the conformation of human heme environment to the pig  chain in the hybrid but the conformation of    interface of this hybrid is close to but not identical to that of hbs on the other hand the    interface conformation is identical to that of hbs more important the  p  s does not polymerize when deoxygenated pig  chain completely neutralizes the  s chain dependent polymerization the polymerization inhibitory propensity of pig  chain is higher when it is present in the cis  p s dimer relative to that in a trans  p a dimer the semisynthetically generated chimeric pig human and human pig  chains by exchanging the     segments of human and pig  chains have established that the sequence differences of pig      segment can also completely neutralize the polymerization comparison of the electrostatic potential energy landscape of the  chain surfaces of hbs and  p  s suggests that the differences in electrostatic potential energy surfaces on the  chain of  p  s relative to that in hbs particularly the ones involving cd region e helix and ef corner of pig  chain are responsible for the polymerization neutralization activity the pig and human pig chimeric  chains can serve as blueprints for the design of a new generation of variants of  chain s suitable for the gene therapy of sickle cell disease
