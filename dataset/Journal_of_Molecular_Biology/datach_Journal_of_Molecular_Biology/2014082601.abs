a conserved noncoding sequence can function as a spermatocyte specific enhancer and a bidirectional promoter for a ubiquitously expressed gene and a testis specific long noncoding rna
tissue specific gene expression is tightly regulated by various elements such as promoters enhancers and long noncoding rnas lncrnas  in the present study we identified a conserved noncoding sequence cns  as a novel enhancer for the spermatocyte specific mouse testicular cell adhesion molecule  tcam  gene cns was located  kb upstream of the tcam gene and associated with histone h k mono methylation in testicular germ cells by the in vitro reporter gene assay cns could enhance tcam promoter activity only in gc spd ts cells which were derived from mouse spermatocytes when we integrated the   kb   flanking sequence of tcam with or without a deletion of cns linked to the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene into the chromatin of gc spd ts cells cns significantly enhanced tcam promoter activity these results indicate that cns could function as a spermatocyte specific enhancer interestingly cns also showed high bidirectional promoter activity in the reporter assay and consistent with this the smarcd gene and lncrna designated lncrna tcam  were transcribed from adjacent regions of cns  while smarcd was ubiquitously expressed lncrna tcam expression was restricted to testicular germ cells although this lncrna did not participate in tcam activation ubiquitous smarcd expression was correlated to cpg hypo methylation of cns and partially controlled by sp  however for lncrna tcam transcription the strong association with histone acetylation and histone h k tri methylation also appeared to be required the present data suggest that cns is a spermatocyte specific enhancer for the tcam gene and a bidirectional promoter of smarcd and lncrna tcam
