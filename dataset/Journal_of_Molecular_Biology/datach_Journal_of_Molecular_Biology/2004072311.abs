a hoxa  estrogen response element ere is differentially regulated by  beta estradiol and diethylstilbestrol des
the molecular mechanisms by which estrogens regulate developmental gene expression are poorly understood while  beta estradiol is normally present at high concentrations in pregnancy exposure to the estrogen diethylstilbestrol des in utero induces developmental anomalies of the female reproductive tract hox gene expression is altered by des leading to abnormal m llerian duct differentiation the mechanism of ligand specific regulation of hox gene expression by estrogens has not been characterized to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying ligand specific estrogen regulation of hoxa  expression we characterized regulatory regions of the human hoxa  gene we identified an estrogen response element ere in the human hoxa  gene that mediated differential ligand specific estrogen responsive transcriptional activation deletional analysis and reporter expression assays identified two eres ere and ere  each of which drove estrogen responsive reporter expression in the ishikawa human uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line ere drove reporter expression maximally this ere bound er  and er  and formed a complex that included src  but not cbp n cor or smrt hoxa  ere drove luciferase reporter activity to eightfold the level driven by the consensus ere in response to estradiol in ishikawa cells while most eres demonstrate similar transcriptional activity in response to des or estradiol here estradiol induced four to sevenfold greater reporter activity than did des from hoxa  ere  des did not alter er or src  binding to hoxa  ere  hoxa  ere therefore demonstrated ligand specificity distinct from the consensus ere and unrelated to changes in er or coactivator corepressor binding the ligand specificity of the hoxa  ere may explain the molecular mechanism by which des leads to reproductive anomalies differential ligand specific activation of hox genes may be a molecular mechanism by which des signaling leads to inappropriate hox expression and to developmental patterning distinct from that induced by estradiol
