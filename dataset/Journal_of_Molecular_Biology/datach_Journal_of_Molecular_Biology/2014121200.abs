mia  combines thiol oxidase and disulfide isomerase activity to efficiently catalyze oxidative folding in mitochondria
mia  a mitochondrial import and assembly protein catalyzes disulfide bond formation in proteins in the mitochondrial intermembrane space by using cox  a mitochondrial copper binding protein as a natural substrate we discovered that in the presence of mia  the formation of native disulfides is strongly favored the catalytic mechanism of mia  involves a functional interplay between the chaperone site and the catalytic disulfide mia  forms a specific native disulfide in cox  much more rapidly than other disulfides in particular non native ones which originates from the recently described high affinity for hydrophobic regions near target cysteines and the long lifetime of the mixed disulfide in addition to its thiol oxidase function mia  is active also as a disulfide reductase and isomerase we found that species with inadvertently formed incorrect disulfides are rebound by mia  and reshuffled revealing a proofreading mechanism that is steered by the conformational folding of the substrate protein
