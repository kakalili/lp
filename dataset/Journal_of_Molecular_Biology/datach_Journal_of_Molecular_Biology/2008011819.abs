actin hydrophobic loop      and filament nucleation and elongation
the importance of actin hydrophobic loop      dynamics to actin polymerization and filament stability has been shown recently with the use of the yeast mutant actin l  c l  c c  a in which the hydrophobic loop could be locked in a  parked  conformation by a disulfide bond between c  and c   such a cross linked globular actin monomer does not form filaments suggesting nucleation and or elongation inhibition to determine the role of loop dynamics in filament nucleation and or elongation we studied the polymerization of the cross linked actin in the presence of cofilin to assist with actin nucleation and with phalloidin to stabilize the elongating filament segments we demonstrate here that together but not individually phalloidin and cofilin co rescue the polymerization of cross linked actin the polymerization was also rescued by filament seeds added together with phalloidin but not with cofilin thus loop immobilization via cross linking inhibits both filament nucleation and elongation nevertheless the conformational changes needed to catalyze atp hydrolysis by actin occur in the cross linked actin when actin filaments are fully decorated by cofilin the helical twist of filamentous actin f actin changes by    per subunit electron microscopic analysis of filaments rescued by cofilin and phalloidin revealed a dense contact between opposite strands in f actin and a change of twist by    per subunit indicating either partial or disordered attachment of cofilin to f actin and or competition between cofilin and phalloidin to alter f actin symmetry our findings show an importance of the hydrophobic loop conformational dynamics in both actin nucleation and elongation and reveal that the inhibition of these two steps in the cross linked actin can be relieved by appropriate factors
