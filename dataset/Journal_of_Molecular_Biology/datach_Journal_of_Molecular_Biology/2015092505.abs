binding of the   triphosphate end of mrna to the  subunit of translation initiation factor  of the crenarchaeon sulfolobus solfataricus
the heterotrimeric archaeal if orthologue of eukaryotic translation initiation factor  consists of the  subunit   subunit and  subunit previous studies showed that the  subunit of aif  besides its central role in met trnai binding has an additional function it binds to the   triphosphorylated end of mrna and protects its   part from degradation competition studies with nucleotides and mrna as well as structural and kinetic analyses of aif  mutants strongly implicate the canonical gtp gdp binding pocket in binding to the   triphosphate end of mrnas the biological implication of these findings is being discussed
