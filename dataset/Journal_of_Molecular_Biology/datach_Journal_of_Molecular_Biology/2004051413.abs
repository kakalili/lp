crystallographic structure and biochemical analysis of the thermus thermophilus osmotically inducible protein c
the x ray crystallographic structure of osmotically inducible protein c from the thermophilic bacterium thermus thermophilus hb  was solved to    using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion method and a selenomethionine incorporated protein se mad  the crystal space group was p with cell dimensions of a     b     c                and      the two tightly interacting monomers in the asymmetric unit are related by a non crystallographic  fold the dimer structure is defined primarily by two very long anti parallel over lapping  helices at the core with a further six stranded anti parallel  sheet on the outside of the structure with respect to the  sheets both a and b monomers contribute three strands each resulting in an intertwining of the structure the active site consists of two cysteine residues from one monomer and an arginine and glutamic acid from the other enzymatic assays have revealed that t thermophilus osmc has a hydroperoxide peroxidase activity
