myristoylation regulated direct interaction between calcium bound calmodulin and n terminal region of pp v src
pp v src tyrosine protein kinase was suggested to interact with ca  bound calmodulin ca  cam through the n terminal region based on its structural similarities to cap  nap   a myristoylated neuron specific protein whose myristoyl group is essential for interaction with ca  cam   the n terminus of pp v src is myristoylated like cap  nap     both lysine residues are required for the myristoylation dependent interaction and serine residues that are thought to regulate the interaction through the phosphorylations located in the n terminal region of pp v src to verify this possibility we investigated the direct interaction between pp v src and ca  cam using a myristoylated peptide corresponding to the n terminal region of pp v src the binding assay indicated that only the myristoylated peptide binds to ca  cam and the non myristoylated peptide is not able to bind to ca  cam analyses of the binding kinetics revealed two independent reactions with the dissociation constants kd of       m kd  and       m kd  respectively two serine residues near the myristoyl moiety of the peptide ser  ser  were phosphorylated by protein kinase c in vitro and the phosphorylation drastically reduced the interaction nmr experiments indicated that two molecules of the myristoylated peptide were bound around the hydrophobic clefts of a ca  cam molecule the small angle x ray scattering analyses showed that the size of the peptide  ca  cam complex is     smaller than that of the known ca  cam  target molecule complexes these results demonstrate clearly the direct interaction between pp v src and ca  cam in a novel manner different from that of known ca  cam the target molecules interactions
