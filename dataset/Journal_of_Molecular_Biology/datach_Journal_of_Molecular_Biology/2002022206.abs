functional analysis of a carboxyl terminal phosphorylation mutant of the bovine papillomavirus e protein edited by k yamamoto
the papillomavirus e protein is essential for viral dna replication and phosphorylation of e appears to regulate protein function and dna replication serine   of bovine papillomavirus e is in a conserved motif resembling a ck consensus site and is phosphorylated by ck in vitro mutation of serine   to alanine eliminates replication of the viral genome in transient replication assays wild type and mutant e proteins were expressed from recombinant baculoviruses and used to assess biochemical functions of the amino acid   substitution helicase enzyme activity e binding to the viral e protein and to cellular dna polymerase alpha primase were all unaffected in the mutant protein binding of e to viral replication origin dna sequences was reduced in the mutant but not eliminated the carboxyl terminal region of the protein appears to play a role in regulating e function and adds to a complex picture emerging for papillomavirus dna replication control
