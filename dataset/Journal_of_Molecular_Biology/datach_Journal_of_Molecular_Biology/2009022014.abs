the desmoglein specific cytoplasmic region is intrinsically disordered in solution and interacts with multiple desmosomal protein partners
the desmoglein specific cytoplasmic region dscr is a conserved region of unknown structure and function that uniquely defines the desmoglein family of cell adhesion molecules it is the site of caspase cleavage during apoptosis and its mutation is linked to cardiomyopathy here we reveal that a   residue dscr construct of human desmoglein  is intrinsically disordered and forms an interaction hub for desmosomal proteins in solution it contains   helical and     strand structure based on circular dichroism spectroscopy a single monomeric state with a predominantly unfolded structure is found by size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation thermal stability assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal a nonglobular structure under a range of solution conditions however the introduction of detergent micelles increases structure to   helical and    strand character suggesting an inducible structure the dscr exhibits weak but specific interactions with plakoglobin the plakin domain of desmoplakin plakophilin  and the cytoplasmic domain of desmocollin  the desmoglein  membrane proximal region also interacts with all four dscr ligands strongly with plakoglobin and plakophilin and more weakly with desmoplakin and desmocollin  thus the dscr is an intrinsically disordered functional domain with an inducible structure that along with the membrane proximal region forms a flexible scaffold for cytoplasmic assembly at the desmosome
