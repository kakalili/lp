properties of an ezrin mutant defective in f actin binding
ezrin radixin and moesin are a family of proteins that provide a link between the plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton the regulated targeting of ezrin to the plasma membrane and its association with cortical f actin are more than likely functions necessary for a number of cellular processes such as cell adhesion motility morphogenesis and cell signalling the interaction with f actin was originally mapped to the last  residues of ezrin which correspond to the last three helices  b  c and  d of the c terminal tail we set out to identify and mutate the ezrin f actin binding site in order to pinpoint the role of f actin interaction in morphological processes as well as signal transduction we report here the generation of an ezrin mutant defective in f actin binding we identified four actin binding residues t   k   r  and i   that form a contiguous patch on the surface of the last helix  d interestingly mutagenesis of r  also eliminated the interaction of band four point one ezrin radixin moesin homology domains ferm and the c terminal tail domain identifying a hotspot of the ferm tail interaction in vivo expression of the ezrin mutant defective in f actin binding and ferm tail interaction r  a altered the normal cell surface structure dramatically and inhibited cell migration further we showed that ezrin f actin binding is required for the receptor tyrosine kinase signal transfer to the ras map kinase signalling pathway taken together these observations highlight the importance of ezrin f actin function in the development of dynamic membrane actin structures critical for cell shape and motility as well as signal transduction
