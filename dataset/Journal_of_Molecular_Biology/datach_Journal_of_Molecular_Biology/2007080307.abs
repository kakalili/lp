an improved system for the generation and analysis of mutant proteins containing unnatural amino acids in saccharomyces cerevisiae
we have previously described methodology that makes it possible to genetically encode a wide array of unnatural amino acids in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms here we report the systematic optimization of a saccharomyces cerevisiae expression system for the production of mutant proteins containing unnatural amino acids modifications include significant increases in both the expression levels of the orthogonal escherichia coli amber suppressor trnacua and cognate aminoacyl trna synthetase aars pair and expression of the target protein gene using a strong transcriptional promoter optimized codons and elevated plasmid copy numbers with this new system a number of unnatural amino acids including the photocrosslinkers p benzoylphenylalanine and p azidophenylalanine and the chemically reactive amino acids p acetylphenylalanine and p propargyloxyphenylalanine were incorporated into human superoxide dismutase hsod in yeast in good yields maximally      mg l of culture in most cases  mass spectrometric analysis of the hsod mutants was performed with high dynamic range using multiple reaction monitoring that provided new insights into the factors that control the fidelity of unnatural amino acid incorporation
