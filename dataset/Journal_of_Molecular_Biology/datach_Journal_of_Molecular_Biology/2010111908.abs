coevolution predicts direct interactions between mtdna encoded and ndna encoded subunits of oxidative phosphorylation complex i
despite years of research the structure of the largest mammalian oxidative phosphorylation oxphos complex nadh  ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex i  and the interactions among its  subunits are not fully understood since complex i harbors subunits encoded by mitochondrial dna mtdna and nuclear dna ndna genomes with the former evolving    times faster than the latter tight cytonuclear coevolution is expected and observed recently we identified three ndna encoded complex i subunits that underwent accelerated amino acid replacement suggesting their adjustment to the elevated mtdna rate of change hence they constitute excellent candidates for binding mtdna encoded subunits here we further disentangle the network of physical cytonuclear interactions within complex i by analyzing subunits coevolution firstly relying on the bioinformatic analysis of  protein complexes possessing solved structures we show that signals of coevolution identified physically interacting subunits with nearly   accuracy thus lending support to our approach when applying this approach to cytonuclear interaction within complex i we predict that the  rate accelerated  ndna encoded subunits of complex i ndufc and ndufa  likely interact with the mtdna encoded subunits nd nd and nd nd nd  respectively furthermore we predicted interactions among mtdna encoded complex i subunits using the yeast two hybrid system we experimentally confirmed the predicted interactions of human ndufc with nd  the interactions of human ndufa with nd and nd  and the lack of interaction of ndufc with nd and ndufa  thus providing a proof of concept for our approach our study shows for the first time evidence for direct interactions between ndna encoded and mtdna encoded subunits of human oxphos complex i and paves the path towards deciphering subunit interactions within complexes lacking three dimensional structures our subunit interactions predicting method complexcorr is available at http  webclu bio wzw tum de complexcorr
