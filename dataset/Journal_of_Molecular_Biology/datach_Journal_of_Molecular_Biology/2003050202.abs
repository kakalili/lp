motif refinement of the peroxisomal targeting signal  and evaluation of taxon specific differences
eukaryote peroxisomes plant glyoxysomes and trypanosomal glycosomes belong to the microbody family of organelles that compartmentalise a variety of biochemical processes the interaction between the pts signal and its cognate receptor pex initiates the major import mechanism for proteins into the matrix of these organelles relying on the analysis of amino acid sequence variability of known pts targeted proteins and pts containing peptides that interact with pex in the yeast two hybrid assay on binding site studies of the pex  ligand complex crystal structure  d models and sequences of pex proteins from various taxa we derived the requirements for a c terminal amino acid sequence to interact productively with pex  we found evidence that at least the  c terminal residues of a given substrate protein are implicated in pts signal recognition this motif can be structurally and functionally divided into three regions  i the c terminal tripeptide  ii a region interacting with the surface of pex  about four residues further upstream  and iii a polar solvent accessible and unstructured region with linker function the remaining five residues  specificity differences are confined to taxonomic subgroups metazoa and fungi and are connected with amino acid type preferences in region  and deviating hydrophobicity patterns in region
