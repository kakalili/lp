thermodynamics of trimer of hairpins formation by the siv gp  envelope protein edited by i b holland
the gp  envelope protein mediates the entry of primate immunodeficiency viruses into target cells by promoting the fusion of viral and cellular membranes the structure of the gp  ectodomain core represents a trimer of identical helical hairpins in which a central trimeric coiled coil made up of three amino terminal helices is wrapped in an outer layer of three antiparallel carboxyl terminal helices triggering formation of this fusion active gp  conformation appears to cause close membrane apposition and thus overcome the activation energy barrier for lipid bilayer fusion we present a detailed description of the folding thermodynamics of the simian immunodeficiency virus siv gp  core by using a recombinant trimeric n  l c  model differential scanning calorimetry and spectroscopic experiments on denaturant induced and thermal unfolding indicate that the free energy of association of three  residue n  l c  peptides to a trimer of hairpins is  kj mol   at ph   and   c in physiological buffer the associated enthalpy change  hunf is   kj mol   while the entropy of unfolding  sunf is   kj k   mol   the temperature of maximal stability is close to   c the unfolding heat capacity increment is   kj k   mol      j k   mol residue    which is lower than expected for unfolding of the trimer to an extended and fully hydrated polypeptide chain replacement by isoleucine of the polar residues thr  or thr  buried in the n terminal trimeric coiled coil interface leads to very strong stabilization of the trimer of hairpins     kj mol   single point mutations in the central coiled coil thus strongly stabilize the gp  core structure these thermodynamic characteristics may be important for the refolding of the gp  envelope protein into its fusion active conformation during membrane fusion
