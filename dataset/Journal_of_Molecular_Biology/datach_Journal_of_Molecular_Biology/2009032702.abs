domain based and family specific sequence identity thresholds increase the levels of reliable protein function transfer
divergence in function of homologous proteins is based on both sequence and structural changes overall enzyme function has been reported to diverge earlier   sequence identity than overall structure    we herein study the functional conservation of enzymes and non enzyme sequences using the protein domain families in cath gene d despite the rapid increase in sequence data since the last comprehensive study by tian and skolnick our findings suggest that generic thresholds of   and   aligned sequence identity are still sufficient to safely inherit third level and full enzyme commission numbers respectively this increases to   and   on the domain level unless the multi domain architecture matches assignments from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes and the munich information center for protein sequences functional catalogue seem to be less conserved with sequence probably due to a more pathway centric view   domain sequence identity is required for safe function transfer comparing domains more pairwise relationships and the use of family specific thresholds varying evolutionary speeds yields the highest coverage rates when transferring functions to model proteomes an average twofold increase in enzyme annotations is seen for   proteomes in gene d as simple  rules of thumb   sequence identity thresholds do not require a bioinformatics background we will provide and update this information with future releases of cath gene d
