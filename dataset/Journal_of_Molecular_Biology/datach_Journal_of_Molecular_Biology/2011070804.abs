studies on the reaction of nitric oxide with the hypoxia inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase domain  egln
the hypoxic response in animals is mediated via the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor hif  an oxygen sensing component of the hif system is provided by fe ii and  oxoglutarate dependent oxygenases that catalyse the posttranslational hydroxylation of the hif  subunit it is proposed that the activity of the hif hydroxylases can be regulated by their reaction with nitric oxide we describe biochemical and biophysical studies on the reaction of prolyl hydroxylase domain containing enzyme phd isoform  egln  with nitric oxide and a nitric oxide transfer reagent the combined results reveal the potential for the catalytic domain of phd to react with nitric oxide both at its fe ii and at cysteine residues although the biological significance is unclear the results suggest that the reaction of phd with nitric oxide has the potential to be complex and are consistent with proposals based on cellular studies that nitric oxide may regulate the hypoxic response by direct reaction with the hif hydroxylases
