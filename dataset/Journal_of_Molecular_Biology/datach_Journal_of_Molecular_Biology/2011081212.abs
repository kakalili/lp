fad binding site and nadp reactivity in human renalase a new enzyme involved in blood pressure regulation
renalase is a recently discovered flavoprotein that regulates blood pressure regulates sodium and phosphate excretion and displays cardioprotectant action through a mechanism that is barely understood to date it has been proposed to act as a catecholamine degrading enzyme via either o dependent or nadh dependent mechanisms here we report the renalase crystal structure at     resolution together with new data on its interaction with nicotinamide dinucleotides renalase adopts the p hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase fold topology comprising a rossmann fold based flavin adenine dinucleotide fad binding domain and a putative substrate binding domain the latter of which contains a five stranded anti parallel  sheet a large cavity       facing the flavin ring presumably represents the active site compared to monoamine oxidase or polyamine oxidase the renalase active site is fully solvent exposed and lacks an  aromatic cage  for binding the substrate amino group renalase has an extremely low diaphorase activity displaying lower kcat but higher kcat km for nadh compared to nadph moreover its fad prosthetic group becomes slowly reduced when it is incubated with nadph under anaerobiosis and binds nad or nadp with kd values of ca  mm the absence of a recognizable nadp binding site in the protein structure and its poor affinity for and poor reactivity towards nadh and nadph suggest that these are not physiological ligands of renalase although our study does not answer the question on the catalytic activity of renalase it provides a firm framework for testing hypotheses on the molecular mechanism of its action
