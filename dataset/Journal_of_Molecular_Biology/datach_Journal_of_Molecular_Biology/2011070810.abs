the monomeric tetrameric and fibrillar organization of fib the dynamic building block of the bacterial linear motor of spiroplasma melliferum bc
spiroplasmas belong to the class mollicutes representing the minimal free living and self replicating forms of life spiroplasmas are helical wall less bacteria and the only ones known to swim by means of a linear motor rather than the near universal rotary bacterial motor  the linear motor follows the shortest path along the cell s helical membranal tube the motor is composed of a flat monolayered ribbon of seven parallel fibrils and is believed to function in controlling cell helicity and motility through dynamic coordinated differential length changes in the fibrils the latter cause local perturbations of helical symmetry which are essential for net directional displacement in environments with a low reynolds number the underlying fibrils core building block is a circular tetramer of the  kda protein fib the fibrils differential length changes are believed to be driven by molecular switching of fib leading consequently to axial ratio and length changes in tetrameric rings using cryo electron microscopy diffractometry single particle analysis of isolated ribbons and sequence analyses of fib we determined the overall molecular organization of the fib monomer tetramer fibril and linear motor of spiroplasma melliferum bc that underlies cell geometry and motility fib appears to be a bidomained molecule of which the n terminal half is apparently a globular phosphorylase by a combination of reversible rotation and diagonal shift of fib monomers the tetramer adopts either a cross like nonhanded conformation or a ring like handed conformation the sense of fib rotation may determine the handedness of the linear motor and eventually of the cell a further change in the axial ratio of the ring like tetramers controls fibril lengths and the consequent helical geometry analysis of tetramer quadrants from adjacent fibrils clearly demonstrates local differential fibril lengths
