the structure of an archaeal pilus
bacterial pili are involved in a host of activities including motility adhesion transformation and immune escape structural studies of these pili have shown that several distinctly different classes exist with no common origin remarkably it is now known that the archaeal flagellar filament appears to have a common origin with the bacterial type iv pilus and assembly in both systems involves hydrophobic n terminal  helices that form three stranded coils in the center of these filaments recent work has identified further genes in archaea as being similar to bacterial type iv pilins but the function or structures formed by such gene products was unknown using electron cryo microscopy we show that an archaeal pilus from methanococcus maripaludis has a structure entirely different from that of any of the known bacterial pili two subunit packing arrangements were identified one has rings of four subunits spaced by      and the other has a one start helical symmetry with    subunits per turn of a      pitch helix remarkably these schemes appear to coexist within the same filaments for the segments composed of rings the twist between adjacent rings is quite variable while for the segments having a one start helix there is a large variability in both the axial rise and the twist per subunit since this pilus appears to be assembled from a type iv pilin like protein with a hydrophobic n terminal helix it provides yet another example of how different quaternary structures can be formed from similar building blocks this result has many implications for understanding the evolutionary divergence of bacteria and archaea
