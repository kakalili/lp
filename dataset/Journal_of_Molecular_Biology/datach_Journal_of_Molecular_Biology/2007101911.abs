a nucleosome interaction module is required for normal function of arabidopsis thaliana brahma
the brahma brm gene encodes the snf type atpase of the putative arabidopsis thaliana swi snf chromatin remodelling complex this family of atpases is characterized by the presence of a conserved catalytic domain and an arrangement of auxiliary domains whose functions in the remodelling activity remains unclear here we characterize at the molecular and functional level the carboxy terminal part of arabidopsis brm we have found three dna binding regions that bind various free dna and nucleosomal probes with different specificity one of these regions contains an at hook motif the carboxy terminus also contains a bromodomain able to bind histones h and h  we propose that this array of domains constitute a nucleosome interaction module that helps brm to interact with its substrate we also characterize an arabidopsis mutant that expresses a brm protein lacking the last   amino acid residues brm  c  encompassing the bromodomain and two of the three dna binding activities identified this mutant displays an intermediate phenotype between those of the wild type and a null allele mutant suggesting that the nucleosome interaction module is required for the normal function of brm but it is not essential for the remodelling activity of brm containing swi snf complexes
