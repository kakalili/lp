modularity and homology modelling of the titin type i modules and their interfaces edited by r huber
titin is a giant muscle protein with a highly modular architecture consisting of multiple repeats of two sequence motifs named type i and type ii type i motifs are homologous to members of the fibronectin type  fn  superfamily one of the motifs most widespread in modular proteins fn domains are thought to mediate protein protein interactions and to act as spacers in titin fn modules are present in two different super repeated patterns likely to be involved in sarcomere assembly through interactions with a band proteins here we discuss results from homology modelling the whole family of fn domains in titin homology modelling is a powerful tool that will play an increasingly important role in the post genomic era it is particularly useful for extending experimental structure determinations of parts of multidomain proteins that contain multiple copies of the same motif the d structures of a representative titin type i domain and of other extracellular fn modules were used as a template to model the structures of the   copies in titin the resulting models suggest residues that contribute to the fold stability and allow us to distinguish these from residues likely to have functional importance in particular analysis of the models and mapping of the consensus sequence onto the d structure suggest putative surfaces of interaction with other proteins from the structures of isolated modules and the pattern of conservation in the multiple alignment of the whole titin ig and fn families it is possible to address the question of how tandem modules are assembled our predictions can be validated experimentally
