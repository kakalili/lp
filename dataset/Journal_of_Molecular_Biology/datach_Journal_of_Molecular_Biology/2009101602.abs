altered contractility of skeletal muscle in mice deficient in titin  s m band region
we investigated the contractile phenotype of skeletal muscle deficient in exons mex and mex  ko of the titin m band by using the cre lox recombination system and a multidisciplinary physiological approach to study skeletal muscle contractile performance at a maximal tetanic stimulation frequency intact ko extensor digitorum longus muscle was able to produce wild type levels of force however at submaximal stimulation frequency force was reduced in ko mice giving rise to a rightward shift of the force  frequency curve this rightward shift of the force  frequency curve could not be explained by altered sarcoplasmic reticulum ca  handling as indicated by analysis of ca  transients in intact myofibers and expression of ca  handling proteins but can be explained by the reduced myofilament ca  sensitivity of force generation that we found western blotting experiments suggested that the excision of titin exons mex and mex did not result in major changes in expression of titin m band binding proteins or phosphorylation level of the thin filament regulatory proteins but rather in a shift toward expression of slow isoforms of the thick filament associated protein myosin binding protein c extraction of myosin binding protein c from skinned muscle normalized myofilament ca  sensitivity of the ko extensor digitorum longus muscle thus our data suggest that the m band region of titin affects the expression of genes involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle contraction
