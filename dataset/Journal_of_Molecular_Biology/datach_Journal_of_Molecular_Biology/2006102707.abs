blm  is an allele of ubp  a ubiquitin protease that appears to act during transcription of damaged dna
yeast blm  and mammalian pa  proteins share significant sequence similarity and both cap the ends of  s proteasomes and enhance degradation of some peptide substrates blm  was identified as a suppressor of the yeast blm  mutation and initially was thought to be the blm protein both the blm  and blm   mutations were reported to cause sensitivity to bleomycin and other forms of dna damage suggesting a role for blm  pa   proteasome complexes in dna repair we have been unable to observe significant dna damage sensitivity in blm   mutants in several genetic backgrounds and we have therefore further investigated the relationship between blm  and blm   we find that blm  is a nonsense mutation in the ubiquitin protease gene ubp  deleting ubp causes phenotypes similar to those caused by blm   but neither causes a general defect in dna repair ubp has several known functions and genetic interaction data presented here suggest an additional role in transcriptional elongation the phenotypes caused by blm  and ubp   mutations are not suppressed by over expression of blm  nor are they affected by deletion of blm  these results remove key components of the previously reported connection between blm  pa   proteasome complexes and dna repair and they suggest a novel way to interpret sensitivity to bleomycin as resulting from defects in transcription elongation
