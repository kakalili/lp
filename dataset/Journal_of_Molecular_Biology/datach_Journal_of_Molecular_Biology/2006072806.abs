heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase structure of a diflavin metalloenzyme at     resolution
the crystal structure of heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase tsox from pseudomonas maltophilia has been determined at     resolution tsox contains three coenzymes fad fmn and nad  four different subunits      kda     kda     kda     kda and catalyzes the oxidation of sarcosine n methylglycine to yield hydrogen peroxide glycine and formaldehyde in the presence of tetrahydrofolate the oxidation of sarcosine is coupled to the formation of   methylenetetrahydrofolate the nad and putative folate binding sites are located in the  subunit the fad binding site is in the  subunit fmn is bound at the interface of the  and  subunits the fad and fmn rings are separated by a short segment of the  subunit with the closest atoms located     apart sulfite an inhibitor of oxygen reduction is bound at the fmn site  furoate a competitive inhibitor with respect to sarcosine is bound at the fad site the sarcosine dehydrogenase and   methylenetetrahydrofolate synthase sites are    apart but connected by a large internal cavity          an unexpected zinc ion coordinated by three cysteine and one histidine side chains is bound to the  subunit the n terminal half of the  subunit of tsox  a is closely similar to the fad binding domain of glutathione reductase but with nad replacing fad the c terminal half of the  subunit of tsox  b is similar to the c terminal half of dimethylglycine oxidase and the t protein of the glycine cleavage system proteins that bind tetrahydrofolate the  subunit of tsox is very similar to monomeric sarcosine oxidase the  subunit is similar to the c terminal sub domain of  tsox the  subunit shows little similarity with any pdb entry the  a domain  subunit sub structure of tsox closely resembles the   dimer of l proline dehydrogenase a heteroctameric protein     that shows highest overall similarity to tsox
