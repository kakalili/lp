nucleotide and activator dependent structural and dynamic changes of arp  complex monitored by hydrogen deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry
arp  complex plays a central role in the de novo nucleation of filamentous actin as branches on existing filaments the complex must bind atp protein activators e g  wiskott  aldrich syndrome protein wasp  and the side of an actin filament to form a new actin filament amide hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry was used to examine the structural and dynamic properties of the mammalian arp  complex in the presence of both atp and the activating peptide segment from wasp changes in the rate of hydrogen exchange indicate that atp binding causes conformational rearrangements of arp and arp that are transmitted allosterically to the arp complex arpc  arpc  arpc  and arpc subunits these data are consistent with the closure of nucleotide binding cleft of arp upon atp binding resulting in structural rearrangements that propagate throughout the complex binding of the vca domain of wasp to atp arp  further modulates the rates of hydrogen exchange in these subunits indicating that a global conformational reorganization is occurring these effects may include the direct binding of activators to arp  arp  and arpc  alterations in the relative orientations of arp and arp  and the long range transmission of activator dependent signals to segments proposed to be involved in binding the f actin mother filament
