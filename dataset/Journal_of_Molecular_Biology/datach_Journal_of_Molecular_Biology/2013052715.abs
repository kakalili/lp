all repeats are not equal a module based approach to guide repeat protein design
repeat proteins composed of tandem arrays of a short structural motif often mediate protein  protein interactions past efforts to design repeat protein based molecular recognition tools have focused on the creation of templates from the consensus of individual repeats regardless of their natural context such an approach assumes that all repeats are essentially equivalent in this study we present the results of a  module based  approach in which modules composed of tandem repeats are aligned to identify repeat specific features using this approach to analyze tetratricopeptide repeat modules that contain three tandem repeats  tprs  we identify two classes of tpr modules with distinct structural signatures that are correlated with different sets of functional residues our analyses also reveal a high degree of correlation between positions across the entire ligand binding surface indicative of a coordinated coevolving binding surface extension of our analyses to different repeat protein modules reveals more examples of repeat specific features especially in armadillo repeat modules in summary the module based analyses that we present effectively capture key repeat specific features that will be important to include in future repeat protein design templates
