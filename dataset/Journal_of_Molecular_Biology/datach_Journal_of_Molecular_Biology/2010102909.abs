the    structure of the hp   protein from helicobacter pylori reveals a kinked anti parallel coiled coil hairpin domain and a highly conserved zn ribbon domain
we have determined the    structure of the hp   protein from the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori hp   is essential for flagellum formation and motility it functions as a chaperone for rpon    and also controls the stability and translation of mrna for the major flagellin subunit flaa the protein is composed of a highly elongated and kinked coiled coil hairpin domain residues      followed by a c zn ribbon domain residues       the zn ribbon domain is rich in aromatic and positively charged amino acid residues electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified residues in a positively charged region of the zn ribbon domain of hp   whose mutation alters the mobility of an hp    flaa mrna complex mutation of surface residues in the coiled coil domain did not result in an observable change in the mobility of the hp    flaa transcript complex the data thus suggest the arrangement of hp   into distinct structural and functional domains
