crystal structures of hiv  reverse transcriptases mutated at codons     and   and mechanisms of resistance to non nucleoside inhibitors
leu  ile val  ala and val  ile are mutations in hiv  reverse transcriptase rt that are observed in the clinic and give rise to resistance to certain non nucleoside inhibitors nnrtis including the first generation drug nevirapine in order to investigate structural mechanisms of resistance for different nnrti classes we have determined six crystal structures of mutant rt  inhibitor complexes val  does not have direct contact with nevirapine in wild type rt and in the rt val  ile complex the biggest change observed is at the distally positioned tyr  which is gt   from the mutation site thus in contrast to most nnrti resistance mutations rt val  ile appears to act via an indirect mechanism which in this case is through alterations of the ring stacking interactions of the drug particularly with tyr   shifts in side chain and inhibitor positions compared to wild type rt are observed in complexes of nevirapine and the second generation nnrti uc   with rt leu  ile and rt val  ala  leading to perturbations in inhibitor contacts with tyr  and tyr   such perturbations are likely to be a factor contributing to the greater loss of binding for nevirapine compared to uc   as in the former case a larger proportion of binding energy is derived from aromatic ring stacking of the inhibitor with the tyrosine side chains the differing resistance profiles of first and second generation nnrtis for other drug resistance mutations in rt may also be in part due to this indirect mechanism
