enzymatic properties of recombinant dnmt a dna methyltransferase from mouse the enzyme modifies dna in a non processive manner and also methylates non cpa sites edited by j karn
we present the first in vitro study investigating the catalytic properties of a mammalian de novo dna methyltransferase dnmt a from mouse was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli it was shown to be catalytically active in e coli cells in vivo the methylation activity of the purified protein was highest at ph   and  mm kcl our data show that recombinant dnmt a protein is indeed a de novo methyltransferase as it catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to unmethylated substrates with similar efficiency as to hemimethylated substrates with oligonucleotide substrates the catalytic activity of dnmt a is similar to that of dnmt  the km values for the unmethylated and hemimethylated oligonucleotide substrates are    m and the kcat values are   h   and   h   respectively the enzyme catalyzes the methylation of dna in a distributive manner suggesting that dnmt a and dnmt may cooperate during de novo methylation of dna further we investigated the methylation activity of dnmt a at non canonical sites even though the enzyme shows maximum activity at cpg sites with oligonucleotide substrates a high methylation activity was also found at cpa sites which are modified only twofold slower than cpg sites therefore the specificity of dnmt a is completely different from that of the maintenance methyltransferase dnmt  which shows a  to  fold preference for hemimethylated over unmethylated cpg sites and has almost no methylation activity at non cpg sites
