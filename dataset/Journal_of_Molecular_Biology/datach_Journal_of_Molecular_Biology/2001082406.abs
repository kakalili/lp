localization of l  protein on the ribosome and elucidation of its involvement in ef g dependent translocation edited by w baumeister
l  protein is located at the base of the l l  stalk of the  s subunit of the escherichia coli ribosome because of the flexible nature of the region recent x ray crystallographic studies of the  s subunit failed to locate the n terminal domain of the protein we have determined the position of the complete l  protein by comparing a three dimensional cryo em reconstruction of the  s ribosome isolated from a mutant lacking ribosomal protein l  with the three dimensional map of the wild type ribosome fitting of the x ray coordinates of l   s rna complex and ef g into the cryo em maps combined with molecular modeling reveals that following ef g dependent gtp hydrolysis domain v of ef g intrudes into the cleft between the  s ribosomal rna and the n terminal domain of l  where the antibiotic thiostrepton binds  causing the n terminal domain to move and thereby inducing the formation of the arc like connection with the g  domain of ef g the results provide a new insight into the mechanism of ef g dependent translocation
