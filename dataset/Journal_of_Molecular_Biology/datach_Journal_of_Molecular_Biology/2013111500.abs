plasticity in the contribution of t cell receptor variable region residues to binding of peptide  hla a complexes
one hypothesis accounting for major histocompatibility complex mhc restriction by t cell receptors tcrs holds that there are several evolutionary conserved residues in tcr variable regions that contact mhc while this  germline codon  hypothesis is supported by various lines of evidence it has been difficult to test the difficulty stems in part from the fact that tcrs exhibit low affinities for pep mhc thus limiting the range of binding energies that can be assigned to these key interactions using mutational analyses to measure the magnitude of binding energies involved here we used high affinity tcrs engineered by mutagenesis of cdr  the tcrs included a high affinity mart  hla a specific single chain tcr and two other high affinity tcrs that all contain the same v  region and recognize the same mhc allele hla a  with different peptides and v  regions mutational analysis of residues in cdr and cdr of the three v  regions showed the importance of the key germline codon residue y  however two other proposed key residues showed significant differences among the tcrs in their relative contributions to binding with the use of single position yeast display libraries in two of the key residues mart  hla a selections also revealed strong preferences for wild type germline codon residues but several alternative residues could also accommodate binding and hence mhc restriction thus although a single residue y  could account for a proportion of the energy associated with positive selection i e  mhc restriction  there is significant plasticity in requirements for particular side chains in cdr and cdr and in their relative binding contributions among different tcrs
