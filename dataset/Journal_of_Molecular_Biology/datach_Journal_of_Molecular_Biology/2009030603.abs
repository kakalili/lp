u  of sk rna forms a specific photo cross link with hexim in the context of both a minimal rna binding site and a fully reconstituted sk hexim p tefb ribonucleoprotein complex
eukaryotic transcription by rna polymerase ii is a highly regulated process and divided into three major steps initiation elongation and termination each step of transcription is controlled by a number of cellular factors positive transcription factor b p tefb is composed of cyclin dependent kinase  and a regulatory cyclin t t  p tefb promotes transcriptional elongation of rna polymerase ii by using the catalytic function of cdk to phosphorylate various substrates during transcription p tefb is inactivated by sequestration in a complex with the hexim protein and sk rna the structure of this inactive p tefb complex and the mechanisms controlling its equilibrium with the active complex are poorly understood here we used a photoactive nucleotide  thiou to study the interactions between sk rna and hexim  we identified a specific cross link between nucleotide u  of sk rna and amino acids      of hexim  in the context of both a minimal rna binding site and a fully reconstituted sk hexim p tefb ribonucleoprotein complex we show also that a minimal sk rna hairpin comprising nucleotides     can bind specifically to hexim in vivo our results demonstrate directly that the hexim binding site is located in the     region of sk rna and that the protein residues outside the basic domain of hexim are involved in specific rna interactions
