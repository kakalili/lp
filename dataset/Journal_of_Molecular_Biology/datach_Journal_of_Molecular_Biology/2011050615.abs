chlorite dismutases dyps and efeb  microbial heme enzyme families comprise the cde structural superfamily
heme proteins are extremely diverse widespread and versatile biocatalysts sensors and molecular transporters the chlorite dismutase family of hemoproteins received its name due to the ability of the first isolated members to detoxify anthropogenic clo   a function believed to have evolved only in the last few decades family members have since been found in  bacterial and archaeal genera suggesting ancient roots a structure and sequence based examination of the family is presented in which key sequence and structural motifs are identified and possible functions for family proteins are proposed newly identified structural homologies moreover demonstrate clear connections to two other large ancient and functionally mysterious protein families we propose calling them collectively the cde superfamily of heme proteins
