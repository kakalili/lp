the s layer protein of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc    identification and characterisation of domains responsible for s protein assembly and cell wall binding
lactobacillus acidophilus like many other bacteria harbors a surface layer consisting of a protein sa protein of  kda sa protein could be readily extracted and crystallized in vitro into large crystalline patches on lipid monolayers with a net negative charge but not on lipids with a net neutral charge reconstruction of the s layer from crystals grown on dioleoylphosphatidylserine indicated an oblique lattice with unit cell dimensions a    b    and      resembling those determined for the s layer of lactobacillus helveticus atcc    sequence comparison of sa protein with s proteins from l helveticus lactobacillus crispatus and the s proteins encoded by the silent s protein genes from l acidophilus and l crispatus suggested the presence of two domains one comprising the n terminal two thirds san  and another made up of the c terminal one third sac of sa protein the sequence of the n terminal domains is variable while that of the c terminal domain is highly conserved in the s proteins of these organisms and contains a tandem repeat proteolytic digestion of sa protein showed that san was protease resistant suggesting a compact structure sac was rapidly degraded by proteases and therefore probably has a more accessible structure dna sequences encoding san or green fluorescent protein fused to sac gfp sac were efficiently expressed in escherichia coli purified san could crystallize into mono and multi layered crystals with the same lattice parameters as those found for authentic sa protein a calculated sa protein minus san density difference map revealed the probable location in projection of the sac domain which is missing from the truncated san peptide the gfp sac fusion product was shown to bind to the surface of l acidophilus l helveticus and l crispatus cells from which the s layer had been removed but not to non stripped cells or to lactobacillus casei
