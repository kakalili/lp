natural selection for kinetic stability is a likely origin of correlations between mutational effects on protein energetics and frequencies of amino acid occurrences in sequence alignments
it appears plausible that natural selection constrains to some extent at least the stability in many natural proteins if during protein evolution stability fluctuates within a comparatively narrow range then mutations are expected to be fixed with frequencies that reflect mutational effects on stability indeed we recently reported a robust correlation between the effect of  conservative mutations on the thermodynamic stability unfolding free energy of escherichia coli thioredoxin and the frequencies of residues occurrences in sequence alignments we show here that this correlation likely implies a lower limit to thermodynamic stability of only a few kj mol below the unfolding free energy of the wild type wt protein we suggest therefore that the correlation does not reflect natural selection of thermodynamic stability by itself but of some other factor which is linked to thermodynamic stability for the mutations under study we propose that this other factor is the kinetic stability of thioredoxin in vivo since i kinetic stability relates to irreversible denaturation  ii the rate of irreversible denaturation in a crowded cellular environment or in a harsh extracellular environment is probably determined by the rate of unfolding and iii the half life for unfolding changes in an exponential manner with activation free energy and consequently comparatively small free energy effects can have deleterious consequences for kinetic stability this proposal is supported by the results of a kinetic study of the wt form and the  single mutant variants of e coli thioredoxin based on the global analyses of chevron plots and equilibrium unfolding profiles determined from double jump unfolding assays this kinetic study suggests furthermore one of the factors that may contribute to the high activation free energy for unfolding in thioredoxin required for kinetic stability  namely the energetic optimization of native state residue environments in regions which become disrupted in the transition state for unfolding
