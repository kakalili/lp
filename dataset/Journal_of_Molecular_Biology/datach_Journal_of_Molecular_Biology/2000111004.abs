a snapshot of a transition state analogue of a novel thermophilic esterase belonging to the subfamily of mammalian hormone sensitive lipase edited by d rees
est is a novel thermophilic carboxylesterase isolated and cloned from alicyclobacillus formerly bacillus acidocaldarius which optimally hydrolyses esters with acyl chain lengths of six to eight carbon atoms at   c on the basis of the amino acid sequence homology it has been classified as a member of the mammalian hormone sensitive lipase hsl subfamily the crystal structure of est  complexed with a sulphonyl derivative has been determined at    resolution by a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction experiment on a seleno methionine derivative est presents a canonical    hydrolase core shielded at the c terminal side by a cap region built up of five helices it contains the lipase like catalytic triad ser   his  and asp   whereby the nucleophile is covalently modified this allows an unambiguous view of the putative active site of est  detecting the oxyanion hole in whose formation the amino acid sequence motif his  gly  gly  gly  is involved and the hydrophobic binding pocket for the acyl chain the structural model here reported provides the first example of a transition state analogue of an esterase lipase belonging to the hsl group thus affording useful information for the design of medical inhibitors moreover as the first x ray structure of a thermophilic carboxylesterase the comparison with its mesophilic homologue the brefeldin a esterase bfae from bacillus subtilis allows the identification of putative determinants of thermal stability
