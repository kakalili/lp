h bonding and positive charge at the n  o  locus are critical for covalent flavin attachment in trametes pyranose  oxidase
flavoenzymes perform a wide range of redox reactions in nature and a subclass of flavoenzymes carry covalently bound cofactor the enzyme  flavin bond helps to increase the flavin s redox potential to facilitate substrate oxidation in several oxidases the formation of the enzyme  flavin covalent bond  the flavinylation reaction  has been studied for the past   years for the most advocated mechanism of autocatalytic flavinylation the quinone methide mechanism appropriate stabilization of developing negative charges at the flavin n  and n  loci is crucial whereas the structural basis for stabilization at n  is relatively well studied the structural requisites for charge stabilization at n  remain less clear here we show that flavinylation of histidine   of pyranose  oxidase from trametes multicolor requires hydrogen bonding at the flavin n  o  locus which is offered by the side chain of thr  when the enzyme is in its closed but not open state moreover our data show that additional stabilization at n  by histidine   is required to ensure high occupancy of the histidyl  flavin bond the combination of structural and spectral data on pyranose  oxidase mutants supports the quinone methide mechanism our results demonstrate an elaborate structural fine tuning of the active site to complete its own formation that couples efficient holoenzyme synthesis to conformational substates of the substrate recognition loop and concerted movements of side chains near the flavinylation ligand
