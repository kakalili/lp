structure and dynamics of lc complexes with kxtqt motif peptides swallow and dynein intermediate chain compete for a common site
the dynein light chain lc is an integral subunit of the cytoplasmic dynein motor complex that binds directly to and promotes assembly of the dynein intermediate chain ic  lc interacts also with a variety of putative dynein cargo molecules such as bim a proapoptotic bcl family protein which have the kxtqt recognition sequence and neuronal nitric oxide synthase nnos  which has the giqvd fingerprint but shares the same binding grooves at the lc dimer interface the work reported here investigates the interaction of lc with ic and a putative cargo swallow which share the kxtqt recognition sequence and addresses the apparent paradox of how lc  as part of dynein mediates binding to cargo the structures of drosophila lc bound to peptides from ic and swallow solved by x ray diffraction show that the ic and swallow peptides bind in the same grooves at the dimer interface differences in flexibility between bound and free lc were evaluated from hydrogen isotope exchange experiments using heteronuclear nmr spectroscopy peptide binding causes an increase in protection from exchange primarily in residues that interact directly with the peptide such as the  strand intertwined at the interface and the n terminal end of helix   there is considerably more protection upon swallow binding consistent with tighter binding relative to ic comparison with the lc nnos complex shows how both the giqvd and kxtqt fingerprints are recognized in the same groove the similar structures of lc ic and lc swa and the tighter binding of swallow call into question the role for lc as a cargo adaptor protein and suggest that binding of lc to swallow serves another function possibly that of a dimerization engine which is independent of its role in dynein
