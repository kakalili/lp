different circular permutations produced different folding nuclei in proteins a computational study edited by a r fersht
there have been many studies about the effect of circular permutation on the transition state folding nucleus of proteins with sometimes conflicting conclusions from different proteins and permutations to clarify this important issue we have studied two circular permutations of a lattice protein model with side chains both permuted sequences have essentially the same native state as the original wild type sequence circular permutant  cuts at the folding nucleus of the wild type sequence as a result the permutant has a drastically different nucleus and folds more slowly than wild type in contrast circular permutant  involves an incision at a site unstructured in the wild type transition state and the wild type nucleus is largely retained in the permutant in addition permutant  displays both two state and multi state folding with a native like intermediate state occasionally populated neither the wild type nor permutant  has a similar intermediate and both fold in an apparently two state manner surprisingly permutant  folds at a rate identical with that of the wild type the intermediate in permutant  is stabilised by native and non native interactions and cannot be classified simply as on or off pathway so we advise caution in attributing experimental data to on or off pathway intermediates finally our work illuminates the results on  spectrin sh  chymotrypsin inhibitor  and  lactoglobulin and supports a key assumption in the experimental efforts to locate potential nucleation sites of real proteins via circular permutations
