thermodynamic and structural basis for transition state stabilization in antibody catalyzed hydrolysis
catalytic antibodies d and c  which were induced by immunization with a haptenic transition state analog tsa  catalyze the hydrolysis of a nonbioactive chloramphenicol monoester derivative to generate a bioactive chloramphenicol these antibodies stabilize the transition state to catalyze the hydrolysis reaction strictly according to the theoretical relationship for d  kcat kuncat   and ks ktsa   and for c  kcat kuncat  and ks ktsa   to elucidate the molecular basis of the antibody catalyzed reaction the crystal structure of d was determined and the binding thermodynamics of d and c  with both the substrate and the tsa were analyzed using isothermal titration calorimetry the crystal structure of the unliganded d fab was determined at     resolution and compared with that of the tsa liganded d fab reported previously showing that the tsa is bound into the hydrophobic pocket of the antigen combining site in an  induced fit  manner especially at the l and h cdr loops thermodynamic analyses showed that d binds the substrate of the tsa with a positive  s differing from general thermodynamic characteristics of antigen  antibody interactions this positive  s could be due to the hydrophobic interactions between d and the substrate or the tsa mediated by trp h  i the difference in  g between substrate and tsa binding to d was larger than that to c  which is in good correlation with the larger kcat value of d  interestingly the   g was mainly because of the   h the correlation between kcat and   h is suggestive of  enthalpic strain  leading to destabilization of antibody  substrate complexes together with x ray structural analyses the thermodynamic analyses suggest that upon binding the substrate the antibody alters the conformation of the ester moiety in the substrate from the planar z form to a thermodynamically unstable twisted conformation followed by conversion into the transition state enthalpic strain also contributes to the transition state stabilization by destabilizing the ground state and its degree is much larger for the more efficient catalytic antibody  d
