single stranded dna binding proteins have in common their crucial roles in dna metabolism although they exhibit significant differences in their single stranded dna binding properties to evaluate the correlation between the structure of different nucleoprotein complexes and their function we have carried out a comparative study of the complexes that the single stranded dna binding proteins of three related bacteriophages    nf and ga  form with single stranded dna under the experimental conditions used    and nf single stranded dna binding proteins are stable monomers in solution while ga  single stranded dna binding protein presents a hexameric state as determined in glycerol gradients the thermodynamic parameters derived from quenching measurements of the intrinsic protein fluorescence upon single stranded dna binding revealed i that ga  single stranded dna binding protein occludes a larger binding site n  nt oligomer than   and nf ssbs n   and   nt monomer respectively  and ii that it shows a higher global affinity for single stranded dna ga  ssb keff       m      ssb keff      m   nf ssb keff      m    altogether these parameters justify the differences displayed by the ga  single stranded dna binding protein and single stranded dna complex under the electron microscope and the requirement of higher amounts of   and nf single stranded dna binding proteins than of ga  ssb in gel mobility shift assays to produce a similar effect the structural differences of the nucleoprotein complexes formed by the three single stranded dna binding proteins with single stranded dna correlate with their different functional stimulatory effects in   dna amplification
