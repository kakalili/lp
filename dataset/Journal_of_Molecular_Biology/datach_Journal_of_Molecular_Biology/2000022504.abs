a fragment of recombinant gabaa receptor   subunit forming rosette like homo oligomers edited by i a wilson
the type a gamma aminobutyric acid gabaa receptor plays a major role in inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system a fragment consisting of residues cys  to leu  of the   subunit of the gabaa receptor was overexpressed in escherichia coli and was found to have stable  rich structures here results from laser scattering gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy demonstrated that this recombinant protein formed rosette like homo oligomers mainly pentamers in solution therefore the fragment apparently provides a valuable model system for studying the pentameric holoreceptor assembly non reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fragment showed that disulfide bonds formed between monomers contributed to the oligomerization of the fragment the fact that this fragment alone could form pentamers in vitro strongly suggests that amino acid residues located within the cys  leu  region of the   subunit may contribute to the oligomerization of gabaa receptor in vivo
