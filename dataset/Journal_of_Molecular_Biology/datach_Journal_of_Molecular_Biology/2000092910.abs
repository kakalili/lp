analysis of protein dimerization and ligand binding of orphan receptor hnf   edited by m yaniv
hepatocyte nuclear factor   hnf   nr a  an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily binds dna exclusively as a homodimer even though it is very similar in amino acid sequence to retinoid x receptor   rxr   which heterodimerizes readily with other receptors here experimental analysis of residues involved in protein dimerization and studies on a reported ligand for hnf  are combined with a structural model of the hnf  ligand binding domain lbd  residues   to    when k   in helix  and e   in helix   of hnf   were converted to the analogous residues in rxr  e  and k   respectively the resulting construct did not heterodimerize with the wild type hnf   although it was still able to form homodimers and bind dna furthermore the double mutant did not heterodimerize with rxr or rar but was still able to dimerize in solution with an hnf  construct truncated at amino acid residue   this suggests that the charge compatibility between helices  and  is necessary but not sufficient to determine dimerization partners and that additional residues in the hnf  lbd are also important in dimerization the structural model of the hnf  lbd and an amino acid sequence alignment of helices  and  in various hnf and other receptor genes indicates that a k x  e motif can be used to identify hnf genes from other organisms and that a e d x    k r motif can be used to predict heterodimerization of many but not all receptors with rxr in vitro analysis of another hnf  mutant construct indicates that helix  also plays a structural role in the conformational integrity of hnf   the structural model and experimental analysis indicate that fatty acyl coa thioesters the proposed hnf  ligands are not good candidates for a traditional ligand for hnf   finally these results provide insight into the mechanism of action of naturally occurring mutations in the human hnf  gene found in patients with maturity onset diabetes of the young  mody
