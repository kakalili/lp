nmr spectroscopy of the ligand binding core of ionotropic glutamate receptor  bound to  substituted willardiine partial agonists
glutamate receptors mediate neuronal intercommunication in the central nervous system by coupling extracellular neurotransmitter  receptor interactions to ion channel conductivity to gain insight into structural and dynamical factors that underlie this coupling solution nmr experiments were performed on the bilobed ligand binding core of glutamate receptor  in complexes with a set of willardiine partial agonists these agonists are valuable for studying structure  function relationships because their  position substituent size is correlated with ligand efficacy and extent of receptor desensitization whereas the substituent electronegativity is correlated with ligand potency nmr results show that the protein backbone amide chemical shift deviations correlate mainly with efficacy and extent of desensitization pronounced deviations occur at specific residues in the ligand binding site and in the two helical segments that join the lobes by a disulfide bond experiments detecting conformational exchange show that micro to millisecond timescale motions also occur near the disulfide bond and vary largely with efficacy and extent of desensitization these results thus identify regions displaying structural and dynamical dissimilarity arising from differences in ligand  protein interactions and lobe closure that may play a critical role in receptor response furthermore measures of line broadening and conformational exchange for a portion of the ligand binding site correlate with ligand ec  data these results do not have any correlate in the currently available crystal structures and thus provide a novel view of ligand binding events that may be associated with agonist potency differences
