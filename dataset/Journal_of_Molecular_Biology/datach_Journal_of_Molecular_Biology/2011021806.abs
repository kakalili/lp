construction of a genetic multiplexer to toggle between chemosensory pathways in escherichia coli
many applications require cells to switch between discrete phenotypic states here we harness the fimbe inversion switch to flip a promoter allowing expression to be toggled between two genes oriented in opposite directions the response characteristics of the switch are characterized using two color cytometry this switch is used to toggle between orthogonal chemosensory pathways by controlling the expression of chew and chew  which interact with the tar aspartate and tsr  serine chemoreceptors respectively chew and tsr each contain a mutation at their protein  protein interface such that they interact with each other the complete genetic program containing an arabinose inducible fime controlling chew chew  and constitutively expressed tar tsr  is transformed into an escherichia coli strain lacking all native chemoreceptors this program enables bacteria to swim toward serine or aspartate in the absence or in the presence of arabinose respectively thus the program functions as a multiplexer with arabinose as the selector this demonstrates the ability of synthetic genetic circuits to connect to a natural signaling network to switch between phenotypes
