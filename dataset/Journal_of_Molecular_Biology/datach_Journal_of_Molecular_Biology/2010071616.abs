the macroscopic rate of nucleic acid translocation by hepatitis c virus helicase ns h is dependent on both sugar and base moieties
the nonstructural protein  helicase ns h of hepatitis c virus is a   to   superfamily  rna and dna helicase that is essential for the replication of hepatitis c virus we have examined the kinetic mechanism of the translocation of ns h along single stranded nucleic acid with bases uridylate ru  deoxyuridylate du  and deoxythymidylate dt  and have found that the macroscopic rate of translocation is dependent on both the base moiety and the sugar moiety of the nucleic acid with approximate macroscopic translocation rates of  nt s   oligo dt    nt s   oligo du  and   nt s   oligo ru  respectively we found a strong correlation between the macroscopic translocation rates and the binding affinity of the translocating ns h protein for the respective substrates such that weaker affinity corresponded to faster translocation the values of k  for ns h translocation at a saturating atp concentration are as follows       m nucleotide poly dt       m nucleotide poly du  and     m nucleotide poly ru  furthermore results of the isothermal titration of ns h with these oligonucleotides suggest that differences in t s are the principal source of differences in the affinity of ns h binding to these substrates interestingly despite the differences in macroscopic translocation rates and binding affinities the atp coupling stoichiometries for ns h translocation were identical for all three substrates     atp molecule consumed per nucleotide translocated  this similar periodicity of atp consumption implies a similar mechanism for ns h translocation along rna and dna substrates
