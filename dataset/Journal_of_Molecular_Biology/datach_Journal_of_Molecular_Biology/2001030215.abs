folding energetics of ligand binding proteins i theoretical model edited by r huber
heat capacity curves as obtained from differential scanning calorimetry are an outstanding source for molecular information on protein folding and ligand binding energetics however deconvolution of cp data of proteins in the presence of ligands can be compromised by indeterminacies concerning the correct choice of the statistical thermodynamic ensemble by convent the assumption of constant free ligand concentration has been used to derive formulae for the enthalpy unless the ligand occurs at large excess this assumption is incorrect still the relevant ensemble is the grand canonical ensemble we derive formulae for both constraints constancy of total or free ligand concentration and illustrate the equations by application to the typical equilibrium nx n x d x it is demonstrated that as long as the thermodynamic properties of the ligand can be completely corrected for by performing a reference measurement the grand canonical approach provides the proper and mathematically significantly simpler choice we demonstrate on the two cases of sequential or independent ligand binding the fact that similar binding mechanisms result in different and distinguishable heat capacity equations finally we propose adequate strategies for dsc experiments as well as for obtaining first estimates of the characteristic thermodynamic parameters which can be used as starting values in a global fit of dsc data
