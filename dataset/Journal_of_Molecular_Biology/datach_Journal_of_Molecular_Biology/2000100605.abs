the three dimensional structure of the nudix enzyme diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase from lupinus angustifolius l edited by m f summers
the solution structure of diadenosine      p  p tetraphosphate hydrolase from lupinus angustifolius l  an enzyme of the nudix family has been determined by heteronuclear nmr using a torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol based on approximately  interresidue noes per residue the structure represents the first ap a hydrolase to be determined and sequence homology suggests that other members will have the same fold the family of structures shows a well defined fold comprised of a central four stranded mixed  sheet a two stranded antiparallel  sheet and three helices  i  iii  iv  the root mean squared deviation for the backbone c   o n c  of the rigid parts residues  to    to     to   of the protein is     several regions however show lower definition particularly an isolated helix  ii that connects two strands of the central sheet this poor definition is mainly due to a lack of long range noes between  ii and other parts of the protein mapping conserved residues outside of the nudix signature and those sensitive to an ap a analogue suggests that the adenosine ribose moiety of the substrate binds into a large cleft above the four stranded  sheet four conserved glutamate residues glu  glu  glu  and glu   form a cluster that most likely ligates an essential magnesium ion however gly  also an expected magnesium ligand is distant from this cluster
