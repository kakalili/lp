hypermutation of apob mrna by rat apobec  overexpression mimics apobec  hypermutation
apobec  proteins induce c to u hypermutations in the viral genome of various viruses and have broad antiviral activity generally only a small proportion of viral genomes  lt     are hypermutated by apobec s but often many cytidines up to   are converted into uridine the mechanism of this unique selective hypermutation remains unknown we found that rat apobec  overexpression had a hypermutation pattern similar to that of apobec s on its substrate apolipoprotein b apob mrna transient plasmid transfection of rat apobec  resulted in   and   hypermutations with apob mrna in hepg and mca   cells respectively the low frequency of hypermutated apob mrna targets was enriched by differential dna denaturation pcr at      c with hypermutation levels increasing up to   up to    of cytidines in hepg and up to    of cytidines in mca   cells were converted into uridines in the hypermutated apob mrna when rat apobec  was overexpressed by adenovirus the hypermutation frequency of apob mrna increased from   to    and was readily detected by regular pcr however this higher expression efficiency only increased the frequency of hypermutation not the number of affected cytidines in hypermutated targets rat apobec  hypermutation was modulated by cofactors and eliminated by an e  q mutation indicating the role of cofactors in hypermutation the finding of an apobec  hypermutation pattern with rat apobec  suggests that cofactors could also be involved in apobec  hypermutation using hepatitis b virus hypermutation we found that ksrp increased apobec c and apobec b hypermutation these data show that like rat apobec  hypermutation cellular factors may play a regulatory role in apobec  hypermutation
