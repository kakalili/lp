structure of the mammalian ribosome  channel complex at   resolution
the co translational translocation of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum er lumen and the biogenesis of membrane proteins require ribosome binding to a membrane channel formed by the sec p complex we now report the   structure of a mammalian ribosome  channel complex derived from er membranes atomic models of the ribosomal subunits were aligned to the programmed ribosome from thermus thermophilus to provide a common reference frame the t thermophilus ribosome and by extension all known high resolution subunit models were then docked within our map of the ribosome  channel complex the structure shows that the ribosome contains a putative trna in the exit site and a comparison with a non programmed yeast ribosome suggests that the l stalk may function as a gate in the trna exit path we have localized six major expansion segments in the large subunit of the vertebrate ribosome including es  and suggest a function for es  the large ribosomal subunit is linked to the channel by four connections we identified regions in the large subunit rrna and four proteins that may help form the connections these regions of the ribosome probably serve as a template to guide the assembly of the asymmetric translocation channel three of the connections form a picket fence that separates the putative translocation pore from the attachment site of an additional membrane component the ribosome  channel connections also create an open junction that would allow egress of a nascent chain into the cytosol at a threshold that is appropriate for the entire complex the channel is rather solid and the lumenal half of the putative translocation pore is closed these data suggest that the flow of small molecules across the membrane may be impeded by the channel itself rather than the ribosome  channel junction
