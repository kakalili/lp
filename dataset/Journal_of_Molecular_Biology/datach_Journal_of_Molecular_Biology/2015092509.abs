the signature of the five stranded vrrm fold defined by functional structural and computational analysis of the hnrnp l protein
the rna recognition motif rrm is the far most abundant rna binding domain in addition to the typical          fold various sub structural elements have been described and reportedly contribute to the high functional versatility of rrms the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein l hnrnp l is a highly abundant protein of  kda comprising four rrm domains involved in many aspects of rna metabolism hnrnp l specifically binds to rnas containing ca repeats or ca rich clusters however a comprehensive structural description of hnrnp l including its sub structural elements is missing here we present the structural characterization of the rrm domains of hnrnp l and demonstrate their function in repressing exon  of slc a  by comparison of the sub structural elements between the two highly similar paralog families of hnrnp l and ptb we defined signatures underlying interacting c terminal coils iccs  the rrm  domain interaction and rrms with a c terminal fifth  strand a variation we denoted vrrms furthermore computational analysis revealed new putative icc containing rrm families and allowed us to propose an evolutionary scenario explaining the origins of the icc and fifth  strand sub structural extensions our studies provide insights of domain requirements in alternative splicing mediated by hnrnp l and molecular descriptions for the sub structural elements in addition the analysis presented may help to classify other abundant rrm extensions and to predict structure  function relationships
