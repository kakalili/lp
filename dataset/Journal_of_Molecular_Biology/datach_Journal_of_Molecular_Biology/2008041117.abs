crystal structure of yihs in complex with d mannose structural annotation of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica yihs encoded proteins to an aldose  ketose isomerase
the three dimensional structure of a salmonella enterica hypothetical protein yihs is significantly similar to that of n acyl d glucosamine  epimerase age with respect to a common scaffold an     barrel although the function of yihs remains to be clarified to identify the function of yihs escherichia coli and s enterica yihs proteins were overexpressed in e coli purified and characterized both proteins were found to show no age activity but showed cofactor independent aldose  ketose isomerase activity involved in the interconversion of monosaccharides mannose fructose and glucose or lyxose and xylulose in order to clarify the structure function relationship of yihs we determined the crystal structure of s enterica yihs mutant h  a in complex with a substrate d mannose at     resolution this enzyme  substrate complex structure is the first demonstration in the age structural family and it enables us to identify active site residues and postulate a reaction mechanism for yihs the substrate   d mannose fits well in the active site and is specifically recognized by the enzyme the substrate binding site of yihs for the mannose c and o atoms is architecturally similar to those of mutarotases suggesting that yihs adopts the pyranose ring opening process by his  and acidifies the c position forming an aldehyde at the c position in the isomerization step his  functions as a base catalyst responsible for transferring the proton from the c to c positions through a cis enediol intermediate on the other hand in age his  is thought to abstract and re adduct the proton at the c position of the substrate these findings provide not only molecular insights into the yihs reaction mechanism but also useful information for the molecular design of novel carbohydrate active enzymes with the common scaffold     barrel
