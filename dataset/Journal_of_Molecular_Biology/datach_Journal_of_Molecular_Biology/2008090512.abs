similarities and differences between frozen hydrated rigor acto  s complexes of insect flight and chicken skeletal muscles
the structure and function of myosin crossbridges in asynchronous insect flight muscle ifm have been elucidated in situ using multiple approaches these include generating  atomic  models of myosin in multiple contractile states by rebuilding the crystal structure of chicken subfragment  s  to fit ifm crossbridges in lower resolution electron microscopy tomograms and by  mapping  the functional effects of genetically substituted isoform specific domains including the converter domain in chimeric ifm myosin to sequences in the crystal structure of chicken s we prepared helical reconstructions      resolution to compare the structural characteristics of nucleotide free myosin s bound to actin acto  s  isolated from chicken skeletal muscle csk and the flight muscles of lethocerus leth wild type drosophila wt dros and a drosophila chimera ifi ec wherein the converter domain of the indirect flight muscle myosin isoform has been replaced by the embryonic skeletal myosin converter domain superimposition of the maps of the frozen hydrated acto  s complexes shows that differences between csk and ifm s are limited to the azimuthal curvature of the lever arm the regulatory light chain rlc region of chicken skeletal s bends clockwise as seen from the pointed end of actin while those of ifm s project in a straight radial direction all the ifm s s are essentially identical other than some variation in the azimuthal spread of density in the rlc region this spread is most pronounced in the ifi ec s  consistent with proposals that the embryonic converter domain increases the compliance of the ifm lever arm affecting the function of the myosin motor these are the first unconstrained models of ifm s bound to actin and the first direct comparison of the vertebrate and invertebrate skeletal myosin ii classes the latter for which data on the structure of discrete acto s complexes are not readily available
