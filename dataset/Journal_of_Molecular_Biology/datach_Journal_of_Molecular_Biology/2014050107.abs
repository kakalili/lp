crystal structure of the carbapenem intrinsic resistance protein carg
in the gram negative enterobacterium erwinia pectobacterium and serratia sp atcc    intrinsic resistance to the carbapenem antibiotic  carbapen  em  carboxylic acid is mediated by the carf and carg proteins by an unknown mechanism here we report a high resolution crystal structure for the serratia sp atcc    carbapenem resistance protein carg this structure of carg is the first in the carbapenem intrinsic resistance cir family of resistance proteins from carbapenem producing bacteria the crystal structure shows the protein to form a homodimer in agreement with results from analytical gel filtration the structure of carg does not show homology with any known antibiotic resistance proteins nor does it belong to any well characterised protein structural family however it is a close structural homologue of the bacterial inhibitor of invertebrate lysozyme plii ah with some interesting structural variations including the absence of the catalytic site responsible for lysozyme inhibition both proteins show a unique  sandwich fold with short terminal  helices the core of the protein is formed by stacked anti parallel sheets that are individually very similar in the two proteins but differ in their packing interface causing the splaying of the two sheets in carg furthermore a conserved cation binding site identified in carg is absent from the homologue
