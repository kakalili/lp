antiparallel  sheet structure within the c terminal region of  residue alzheimer s amyloid  peptides when they form   kda oligomers
understanding the molecular structures of amyloid   a  oligomers and underlying assembly pathways will advance our understanding of alzheimer s disease ad at the molecular level this understanding could contribute to disease prevention diagnosis and treatment strategies as oligomers play a central role in ad pathology we have recently presented a procedure for production of   kda oligomeric samples of a     the  residue variant of the a  peptide that are compatible with solid state nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analysis and we have shown that these oligomers and amyloid fibrils differ in intermolecular arrangement of  strands here we report new solid state nmr constraints that indicate antiparallel intermolecular alignment of  strands within the oligomers specifically   kda a     oligomers with uniform  c and  n isotopic labels at i  m  g  and v  exhibit  strand secondary chemical shifts in  dimensional  d finite pulse radiofrequency driven recoupling nmr spectra spatial proximities between i  and v  as well as between m  and g  in d dipolar assisted rotational resonance spectra and close proximity between m  h  and g  h  in d chhc spectra furthermore  d dipolar assisted rotational resonance analysis of an oligomer sample prepared with   labeled peptide indicates that the i  v  and m  g  contacts are between residues on different molecules we employ molecular modeling to compare the newly derived experimental constraints with previously proposed geometries for arrangement of a  molecules into oligomers
