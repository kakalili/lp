dissimilatory nitrite reductase catalyses the reduction of nitrite no   to nitric oxide no  copper containing nitrite reductases contain both type  and type  cu sites electron transfer from redox partners is presumed to be mediated via the type  cu site and used at the catalytic type  cu centre along with the substrate nitrite at the type  cu site asp  has been identified as a key residue in substrate utilisation since it hydrogen bonds to the water molecule at the nitrite binding site we have also suggested that protons enter the catalytic site via asp  through a water network that is mediated by his   the role of these residues has been investigated in the blue copper nitrite reductase from alcaligenes xylosoxidans ncimb    by a combination of point mutation enzymatic activity measurement and structure determination in addition it has been suggested that the enzyme operates via an ordered mechanism where an electron is transferred to the type  cu site largely when the second substrate nitrite is bound and that this is controlled via the lowering of the redox potential of the type  site when it is loaded with nitrite thus a small perturbation of the type  cu site should result in a significant effect on the activity of the enzyme for this reason a mutation of met   which is the weakest ligand of the type  cu is investigated the structures of h  f d n and m  a have been determined to         and    resolution respectively the d n and h  f mutants have negligible or no activity while the m  a mutant has     activity of the native enzyme structural and spectroscopic data show that the loss of activity in h  f is due to the catalytic site being occupied by zn while the loss reduction of activity in d n m  a are due to structural reasons the d n mutation results in the loss of the asp  hydrogen bond to the cu ligated water therefore the ligand is no longer able to perform proton abstraction even though the loss of activity in h  f is due to lack of catalytic cu the mutation does cause the disruption of the water network confirming its key role in proton channel the structure of the h  f mutant is the first case where full occupancy zn at the type  cu site is observed but despite the previously noted similarity of this site to the carbonic anhydrase catalytic site no carbonic anhydrase activity is observed the h  f and d n mutant structures provide for the first time observation of surface zn sites which may act as a zn sink and prevent binding of zn at the catalytic cu site in the native enzyme
