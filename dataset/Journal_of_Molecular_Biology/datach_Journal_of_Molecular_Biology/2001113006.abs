an ftir and cd study of the structural effects of g tract length and sequence context on dna conformation in solution edited by i tinoco
fourier transform infrared ftir and cd spectroscopy have been used to investigate the structural effects of g tract length and flanking sequence on the conformation of dna g tracts in aqueous solution particularly a possible predisposition for a form features has been probed since this may be important for protein dna interactions five different g tract containing dna duplexes have been studied d catggccatg  d catgggcccatg  d catggggccccatg  d aggggcccct  and d tggggcccca  in addition a dna duplex lacking a g tract center was probed d catatgcatatg   the cd and ftir results show that the g tract containing sequences are all in a dominating b dna conformation in solution however certain spectral variations reflect structural effects of sequence context and g tract length cd spectra and ftir results in the       cm   region show that the base stacking pattern is greatly affected by the sequence context the ftir backbone       cm   region shows the antisymmetric non bridging phosphate vibration around   cm   in all sequences demonstrating the overall b conformation of the backbone the ftir sugar      cm   region shows variable contributions of two bands around   cm   and   cm   reflecting the n and s type of sugar pucker the relative intensities of the   cm   and   cm   bands have been proposed in the literature to quantitatively yield the contribution of n and s type of sugar pucker respectively this correlation is supported by the present study furthermore the contributions of n type sugar in the dna sequences studied indicate structural propensities that agree with trends in reported crystal structures of the same sequences   d catggccatg  for which ftir shows the lowest contribution of n type sugar puckering in solution crystallizes in a b like conformation   d aggggcccct  with the highest degree of n type sugar puckering of all the sequences studied crystallizes in an a like conformation   d catgggcccatg  with an n type contribution intermediate between that of d catggccatg  and d aggggcccct  crystallizes in an a b intermediate conformation
