novel mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins as substrates of the mia import pathway
mitochondria consist of four compartments the outer membrane intermembrane space ims  inner membrane and the matrix most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as precursors in the cytosol and have to be imported into these compartments while the protein import machineries of the outer membrane inner membrane and matrix have been investigated in detail a specific mitochondrial machinery for import and assembly of ims proteins termed mia was identified only recently to date only a very small number of substrate proteins of the mia pathway have been identified the substrates contain characteristic cysteine motifs either a twin cx c or a twin cx c motif the largest mia substrates known possess a molecular mass of   kda implying that this new import pathway has a very small size limit here we have compiled a list of saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins with a twin cx c motif and identified three ims proteins that were previously localized to incorrect cellular compartments by tagging approaches mdm  mic  ydr  w and mic  ymr  w require the two essential subunits mia  and erv  of the mia machinery for their localization in the mitochondrial ims with a molecular mass of   kda and   kda respectively mic  and mic  are larger than the known mia substrates remarkably the precursor of erv itself is imported via the mia pathway as erv has a molecular mass of   kda and a twin cx c motif this study demonstrates that the mia pathway can transport substrates that are twice as large as the substrates known to date and is not limited to proteins with twin cx c or cx c motifs however tagging of mia substrates can interfere with their subcellular localization indicating that the proper localization of mitochondrial ims proteins requires the characterization of the authentic untagged proteins
