downhill versus barrier limited folding of bbl  energetic and structural perturbation effects upon protonation of a histidine of unusually low pka
a dispersion of melting temperatures at ph  for individual residues of the bbl protein domain has been adduced as evidence for barrier free downhill folding other members of the peripheral subunit domain family fold cooperatively at ph  to search for possible causes of anomalies in bbl s denaturation behavior we measured the ph titration of individual residues by heteronuclear nmr at   k the pka of his  was close to that of free histidine at       while that of the more buried his  was highly perturbed at       protonation of his  is thus energetically unfavorable and destabilizes the protein by     kcal mol changes in c  secondary shifts at ph  showed a decrease in helicity of the c terminus of helix  where his  is located which was accompanied by a measured decrease of      kcal mol in stability from ph to   protonation of his  perturbs therefore the structure of bbl only    of the structurally perturbed state will be present at the biologically relevant ph   experiments at ph  report on a near equal mixture of the two different native states further at this ph small changes of ph and pka induced by changes in temperature will have near maximal effects on ph dependent conformational equilibria and on propagation of experimental error accordingly conventional barrier limited folding predicts some dispersion of measured thermal unfolding curves of individual residues at ph
