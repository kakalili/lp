the x ray structure of aspergillus aculeatus polygalacturonase and a modeled structure of the polygalacturonase octagalacturonate complex edited by j thornton
polygalacturonases hydrolyze the     glycosidic bonds of de esterified pectate in the smooth region of the plant cell wall crystal structures of polygalacturonase from aspergillus aculeatus were determined at ph   and   both to    resolution a aculeatus polygalacturonase is a glycoprotein with one n and ten o glycosylation sites and folds into a right handed parallel  helix the structures of the three independent molecules are essentially the same showing no dependency on ph or crystal packing and are very similar to that of aspergillus niger polygalacturonase however the structures of the long t loop containing a catalytic tyrosine residue are significantly different in the two proteins a three dimensional model showing the substrate binding mode for a family  hydrolase was obtained by a combined approach of flexible docking molecular dynamics simulations and energy minimization the octagalacturonate substrate was modeled as an unbent irregular helix with the   ring in a half chair  h  form that approaches the transition state conformation a comparative modeling of the three polygalacturonases with known structure shows that six subsites ranging from   to  are clearly defined but subsites   and  may or may not be shaped depending on the nearby amino acid residues both distal subsites are mostly exposed to the solvent region and have weak binding affinity even if they exist the complex model provides a clear explanation for the functions either in catalysis or in substrate binding of all conserved amino acid residues in the polygalacturonase family of proteins modeling suggests that the role of the conserved asn  and tyr   which had previously been unidentified may be in transition state stabilization in a niger polygalacturonase the long t loop may have to undergo conformational change upon binding of the substrate to bring the tyrosine residue close to subsite
