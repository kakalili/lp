secondary structure preferences of the anthrax toxin protective antigen translocase
in order for many proteins to move across hydrophobic membrane bilayers they must be unfolded and translocated by a membrane embedded channel these translocase channels interact with the substrate proteins they translocate via hydrophobic pore loops and cleft structures called clamps the molecular basis for how clamps facilitate unfolding and translocation is poorly understood anthrax toxin is composed of three proteins a translocase channel forming subunit called protective antigen pa  and two substrate proteins called lethal factor lf and edema factor oligomeric pa forms a large channel that contains three types of polypeptide clamp sites an  clamp a phenylalanine clamp and a charge clamp currently it is thought that these clamp sites operate allosterically and promote translocation via an allosteric helix compression mechanism here we report on the substrate secondary structure dependence of the pa channel peptides derived from regions of lf with high  helical content bound cooperatively but those derived from  sheet regions in lf did not suggesting that an allosteric site preferentially recognizes  helical structure over  sheet structure peptides derived from helical sites in lf showed increasingly longer single channel blockades as a function of peptide concentration a result that was consistent with stronger clamping behavior and reduced backsliding moreover peptides derived from helical regions of lf translocated more efficiently than peptides derived from  sheet regions of lf overall in support of the allosteric helix compression model we find that the channel prefers  helical sequences over  sheet sequences
