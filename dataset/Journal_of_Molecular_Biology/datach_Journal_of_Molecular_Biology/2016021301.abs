molecular basis of polyspecificity of the small multidrug resistance efflux pump abes from acinetobacter baumannii
secondary multidrug efflux transporters play a key role in the bacterial resistance phenotype one of the major questions concerns the polyspecific recognition of substrates by these efflux pumps to understand the molecular basis of this promiscuous recognition we compared the substrate specificity of the well studied escherichia coli small multidrug resistance protein emre with that of the poorly studied acinetobacter baumannii homologue abes the latter drug h antiporter is a   amino acid membrane protein with predicted four transmembrane helices it effectively confers resistance toward ethidium acriflavine and benzalkonium in an e coli  emre mdfa background purified abes and the substrate specific hyperactive variant a g bind tetraphenylphosphonium with nanomolar affinity and exhibit electrogenic transport of  methyl  phenylpyridinium after reconstitution into liposomes a g hyperactivity was apparent toward acriflavine and ethidium resulting in  to  fold higher normalized ic  values respectively but not toward substrates  methyl  phenylpyridinium and benzalkonium substitution of y and a  with ala or ser respectively also displayed a substrate dependent phenotype as these variants were strongly affected in their properties to confer resistance against acriflavine and ethidium but not against benzalkonium the size and planarity of the conjugated aromatic moieties appear to be a critical and subtle criterion for substrate recognition by these transporters rather moderate changes in the property of side chains postulated to be part of the substrate binding site result in a large phenotypical difference these observations provide indications for the molecular basis of specificity within the binding pocket of polyspecific transporters
