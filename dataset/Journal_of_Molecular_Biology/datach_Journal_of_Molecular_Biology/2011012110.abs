asymmetric configurations and n terminal rearrangements in connexin  gap junction channels
gap junction channels are unique in that they possess multiple mechanisms for channel closure several of which involve the n terminus as a key component in gating and possibly assembly here we present electron crystallographic structures of a mutant human connexin  cx m a and an n terminal deletion of this mutant cx m adel   at   and    resolutions respectively the three dimensional map of cx m a was improved by data from   tilt images and revealed a breakdown of the hexagonal symmetry in a connexin hemichannel particularly in the cytoplasmic domain regions at the ends of the transmembrane helices the cx m a structure contained an asymmetric density in the channel vestibule  plug  that was decreased in the cx m adel  structure indicating that the n terminus significantly contributes to form this plug feature functional analysis of the cx m a channels revealed that these channels are predominantly closed with the residual electrical conductance showing normal voltage gating n terminal deletion mutants with and without the m a mutation showed no electrical activity in paired xenopus oocytes and significantly decreased dye permeability in hela cells comparing this closed structure with the recently published x ray structure of wild type cx  which is proposed to be in an open state revealed a radial outward shift in the transmembrane helices in the closed state presumably to accommodate the n terminal plug occluding the pore because both cx del  and cx m adel  channels are closed the n terminus appears to have a prominent role in stabilizing the open configuration
