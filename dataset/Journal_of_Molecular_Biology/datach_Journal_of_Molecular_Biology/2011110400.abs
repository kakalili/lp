systematic chromosomal deletion of bacterial ribosomal protein genes
detailed studies of ribosomal proteins rps  essential components of the protein biosynthetic machinery have been hampered by the lack of readily accessible chromosomal deletions of the corresponding genes here we report the systematic genomic deletion of  individual rp genes in escherichia coli which are not included in the keio collection chromosomal copies of these genes were replaced by an antibiotic resistance gene in the presence of an inducible easy to exchange plasmid born allele using this knockout collection we found nine rps l  l  l  l  l  l  l  s  and s  nonessential for survival under induction conditions at various temperatures taken together with previous results this analysis revealed that  of the  e coli rp genes can be individually deleted from the genome these strains also allow expression of truncated protein variants to probe the importance of rna  protein interactions in functional sites of the ribosome this set of strains should enhance in vivo studies of ribosome assembly function and may ultimately allow systematic substitution of rps with rna
