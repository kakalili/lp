positional effects of aan motifs in rpos regulation by srnas and hfq
the escherichia coli stationary phase transcription factor rpos is translated in response to small noncoding rnas srnas  which base pair with the rpos mrna leader the bacterial sm like protein hfq anneals srnas with their mrna targets by simultaneously binding the mrna and srna intriguingly hfq is recruited to the rpos leader via aan motifs far upstream of the srna shape selective   hydroxyl acylation and primer extension chemical footprinting showed that the rpos leader is divided into a far upstream domain an hfq binding domain and a downstream inhibitory stem  loop containing the srna and ribosome binding sites to investigate how hfq promotes srna  mrna base pairing from a distance we deleted the natural aan hfq binding site and we inserted artificial aan binding sites at various positions in the rpos leader all the relocated aan motifs restored tight hfq binding in vitro but only insertion at the natural position restored hfq dependent srna annealing in vitro and srna regulation of rpos translation in vivo furthermore u rich motifs in the downstream inhibitory domain stabilized the rpos mrna  hfq complex and contributed to regulation of rpos expression we propose that the natural hfq binding domain is optimal for positive regulation because it recruits hfq to the mrna and allows it to act on incoming srnas without opening the inhibitory stem  loop when srna is absent
