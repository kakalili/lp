clasp has two distinct tog domains that contribute differently to microtubule dynamics
clip associated proteins clasps are mammalian microtubule mt plus end tracking proteins  tips that promote mt rescue in vivo their plus end localization is dependent on other tips eb and clip   but in the leading edge of the cell clasps display lattice binding activity mt association of clasps is suggested to be regulated by multiple tog tumor overexpressed gene domains and by the serine arginine sr rich region which contains binding sites for eb  here we report the crystal structures of the two tog domains of clasp  both domains consist of six heat repeats which are similar to the canonical paddle like tubulin binding tog domains but have arched conformations the degrees and directions of curvature are different between the two tog domains implying that they have distinct roles in mt binding using biochemical molecular modeling and cell biological analyses we have investigated the interactions between the tog domains and   tubulin and found that each domain associates differently with   tubulin our findings suggest that by varying the degrees of domain curvature the tog domains may distinguish the structural conformation of the tubulin dimer discriminate between different states of mt dynamic instability and thereby function differentially as stabilizers of mts
