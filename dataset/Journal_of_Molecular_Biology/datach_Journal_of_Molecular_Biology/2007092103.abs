folding time predictions from all atom replica exchange simulations
we present an approach to predicting the folding time distribution from all atom replica exchange simulations this is accomplished by approximating the multidimensional folding process as stochastic reaction coordinate dynamics for which effective drift velocities and diffusion coefficients are determined from the short time replica exchange simulations our approach is applied to the folding of the second  hairpin of the b domain of protein g the folding time prediction agrees quite well with experimental measurements therefore we have in hand a fast numerical tool for calculating the folding kinetic properties from all atom  first principles  models
