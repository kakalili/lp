unraveling the molecular mechanism of ph induced misfolding and oligomerization of the prion protein
the misfolding of the prion protein prp to aggregated forms is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases misfolded oligomeric forms of prp are associated with neurotoxicity and or infectivity but the molecular mechanism by which they form is still poorly understood a reduction in ph is known to be a key factor that triggers misfolded oligomer formation by prp but the residues whose protonation is linked with misfolding remain unidentified the structural consequences of the protonation of these residues also remain to be determined in the current study amino acid residues whose protonation is critical for prp misfolding and oligomerization have been identified using site directed mutagenesis and misfolding oligomerization assays it is shown that the protonation of either h  or d   which mimics the effects of pathogenic mutations h  r and d  n at both residue sites is critically linked to the stability misfolding and oligomerization of prp hydrogen  deuterium exchange studies coupled with mass spectrometry show that the protonation of either h  or d  leads to the same common structural change increased structural dynamics in helix  and that in the loop between helix  and  strand  it is shown that the protonation of either of these residues is sufficient for accelerating misfolded oligomer formation most likely because the protonation of either residue causes the same structural perturbation hence the increased structural dynamics in helix  and that in the loop between helix  and  strand  appear to play an early critical role in acid induced misfolding of prp
