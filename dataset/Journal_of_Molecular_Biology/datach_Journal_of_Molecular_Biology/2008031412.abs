transcriptional activation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling  socs  gene via stat is increased in f rex  zfp   knockout teratocarcinoma stem cells relative to wild type cells
rex  zfp   first identified as a gene that is transcriptionally repressed by retinoic acid ra  encodes a zinc finger transcription factor expressed at high levels in f teratocarcinoma stem cells embryonic stem cells and other stem cells loss of both alleles of rex by homologous recombination alters the ra induced differentiation of f cells a model of pluripotent embryonic stem cells we identified suppressor of cytokine signaling  socs  as a gene that exhibits greatly increased transcriptional activation in ra camp and theophylline ract treated f rex     cells    fold as compared to wild type wt cells     fold  by promoter deletion mutation and transient transfection analyses we have shown that this transcriptional increase is mediated by the stat dna binding elements located between    to    in the socs  promoter overexpression of stat dominant negative mutants greatly diminishes this socs  transcriptional increase in f rex     cells this increase in socs  transcription is associated with a four to fivefold higher level of tyrosine phosphorylated stat in the ract treated f rex     cells as compared to wt dominant negative src tyrosine kinase jak  and protein kinase a partially reduce the transcriptional activation of the socs  gene in ract treated f rex null cells in contrast parathyroid hormone peptide enhances the effect of ra in f rex     cells but not in f wt thus rex  which is highly expressed in stem cells inhibits signaling via the janus kinase jak signal transducer and activator of transcription stat pathway thereby modulating the differentiation of f cells
