multiple conformations of gal protein drive the galactose induced allosteric activation of the gal genetic switch of saccharomyces cerevisiae
gal p is an allosteric monomeric protein that activates the gal genetic switch of saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to galactose expression of constitutive mutant of gal p or overexpression of wild type gal p activates the gal switch in the absence of galactose these data suggest that gal p exists as an ensemble of active and inactive conformations structural data have indicated that gal p exists in open inactive and closed active conformations however a mutant of gal p that predominantly exists in inactive conformation and is yet capable of responding to galactose has not been isolated to understand the mechanism of allosteric transition we have isolated a triple mutant of gal p with v  i t  a and n  d substitutions which upon overexpression fails to activate the gal switch on its own but activates the switch in response to galactose overexpression of gal p mutants with single or double mutations in any of the three combinations failed to exhibit the behavior of the triple mutant molecular dynamics analysis of the wild type and the triple mutant along with two previously reported constitutive mutants suggests that the wild type gal p may also exist in super open conformation furthermore our results suggest that the dynamics of residue f  situated in the hydrophobic pocket located in the hinge region drives the transition between different conformations based on this study we suggest that conformational selection mechanism is the driving force in the allosteric transition of gal p which may have implications in other signaling pathways involving monomeric proteins
