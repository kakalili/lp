a transmembrane polar interaction is involved in the functional regulation of integrin  l
integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane tm receptors formed by noncovalent associations of  and  subunits each subunit contains a single  helical tm domain inside out activation of an integrin involves the separation of its cytoplasmic tails leading to disruption of   tm packing the leukocyte integrin  l  is required for leukocyte adhesion migration proliferation cytotoxic function and antigen presentation in this study we show by mutagenesis experiments that the packing of  l  tms is consistent with that of the integrin  iib  tms however molecular dynamics simulations of  l  tms in lipids predicted a polar interaction involving the side chains of  l ser   and   thr  in the outer membrane association clasp omc  this is supported by carbonyl vibrational shifts observed in isotope labeled  l  tm peptides that were incorporated into lipid bilayers molecular dynamics studies simulating the separation of  l  tails showed the presence of polar interaction during the initial perturbation of the inner membrane association clasp when the tms underwent further separation the polar interaction was disrupted omc polar interaction is important in regulating the functions of   integrins because mutations that disrupt the omc polar interaction generated constitutively activated  l    m   and  x  in  t transfectants we also show that the expression of mutant   thr  gly in   deficient t cells rescued cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule  but the cells showed overt elongated morphologies in response to chemokine stromal cell derived factor   treatment as compared to wild type   expressing cells these two tm polar residues are totally conserved in other members of the   integrins in humans and across different species our results provide an example of the stabilizing effect of polar interactions within the low dielectric environment of the membrane interior and demonstrate its importance in the regulation of  l  function
