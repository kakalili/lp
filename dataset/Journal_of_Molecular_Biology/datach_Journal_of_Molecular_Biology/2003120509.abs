the sir c terminal coiled coil is required for telomeric and mating type silencing in saccharomyces cerevisiae
saccharomyces cerevisiae sir p plays important roles in silent chromatin at telomeric and silent mating type loci the c terminus of sir p sir ct is critical for its functions in vivo because over expression or deletion of sir ct fragments disrupts normal telomeric structure and abolishes the telomere position effect the    resolution x ray crystal structure of an sir ct fragment sir p       reveals a  residue homodimeric parallel coiled coil burying an extensive     of surface area the crystal structure is consistent with results of protein cross linking and analytical ultracentrifugation results demonstrating that sir ct exists as a dimer in solution disruption of the coiled coil in vivo by point mutagenesis results in total derepression of telomeric and hml silent mating marker genes suggesting that coiled coil dimerization is essential for sir p mediated silencing in addition to the coiled coil dimerization interface sir cc interface  a crystallographic interface between pairs of coiled coils is significantly hydrophobic and buries     of surface area interface ii  remarkably interface ii mutants are deficient in telomeric silencing but not in mating type silencing in vivo however point mutants of interface ii do not affect the oligomerization state of sir ct in solution these results are consistent with the hypothesis that interface ii mimics a protein interface between sir p and one of its protein partners that is essential for telomeric silencing but not mating type silencing
