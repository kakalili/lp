analyzing the  degree of humanness  of antibody sequences
genetically engineered mouse antibodies are now commonly in clinical use however their development is limited because the human immune system tends to regard them as foreign and this triggers an immune response the solution is to make engineered antibodies appear more human here we propose a method to assess the  degree of humanness  of antibody sequences providing a tool that may contribute to predictions of antigenicity we analyzed sequences of antibodies belonging to various chains classes in human and mouse our analysis of metrics based on percentage sequence identity between antibody sequences shows distinct differences between human and mouse sequences based on mean sequence identity and standard deviation we calculated z scores for data sets of antibody sequences extracted from the kabat database we applied the analysis to a set of humanized and chimeric antibodies and to human germline sequences we conclude that this approach may aid in the selection of more suitable mouse variable domains for antibody engineering to render them more human but in general we find that typicality of a sequence compared with the expressed human repertoire is not well correlated with antigenicity we have provided a web server allowing humanness to be assigned for a sequence   http  www bioinf org uk abs shab
