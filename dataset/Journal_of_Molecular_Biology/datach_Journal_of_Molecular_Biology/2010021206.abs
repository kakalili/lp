residue specific analysis of frustration in the folding landscape of repeat    protein apoflavodoxin
flavodoxin adopts the common repeat    topology and folds in a complex kinetic reaction with intermediates to better understand this reaction we analyzed a set of desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin variants with point mutations in most secondary structure elements by in vitro and in silico methods by equilibrium unfolding experiments we first revealed how different secondary structure elements contribute to overall protein resistance to heat and urea next using stopped flow mixing coupled with far uv circular dichroism we probed how individual residues affect the amount of structure formed in the experimentally detected burst phase intermediate together with in silico folding route analysis of the same point mutated variants and computation of growth in nucleation size during early folding computer simulations suggested the presence of two competing folding nuclei at opposite sides of the central  strand  i e  at  strands  and   which cause early topological frustration i e  misfolding in the folding landscape particularly the extent of heterogeneity in folding nuclei growth correlates with the in vitro burst phase circular dichroism amplitude in addition   value analysis in vitro and in silico of the overall folding barrier to apoflavodoxin s native state revealed that native like interactions in most of the  strands must form in transition state our study reveals that an imbalanced competition between the two sides of apoflavodoxin s central  sheet directs initial misfolding while proper alignment on both sides of  strand  is necessary for productive folding
