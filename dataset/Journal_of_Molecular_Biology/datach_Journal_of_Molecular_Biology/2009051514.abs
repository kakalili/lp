amyloid       folding multiplicity and single molecule binding behavior studied with stm
the fine folding and assembling characteristics of amyloid   a  peptides are important to pharmaceutical studies of drug molecules and to the pathological analysis of neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer s disease at the molecular level here we present observations of the multiple folding characteristics of amyloid peptide a   lamellae using scanning tunneling microscopy molecularly resolved core regions of a   hairpins and unfolded peptide assembly structures are identified the parallel assembling characteristics of a   hairpins can be confirmed in the study in addition single molecule binding characteristics of congo red and thioflavin t have been shown to bind at the groove regions of peptide assemblies this study demonstrates a complementary venue for studying molecular heterogeneity of peptide assemblies as well as the binding characteristics of molecular modulators
