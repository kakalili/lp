the neuralized homology repeat  domain of drosophila neuralized mediates nuclear envelope association and delta dependent inhibition of nuclear import
signaling by the notch n pathway is critical for many developmental processes and requires complex trafficking of both the n receptor and its transmembrane ligands delta dl and serrate neuralized encodes an e ubiquitin ligase required for n ligand internalization neuralized neur is conserved from worms to humans and comprises two neur homology repeat nhr domains nhr and nhr  and a carboxyl terminal ring domain we have previously shown that the ring domain is required for ubiquitin ligase activity and that nhr mediates binding to dl a ubiquitination target in drosophila neur associates with the plasma membrane and hepatocyte responsive serum phosphoprotein positive endosomes here we demonstrate that neur also exhibits nuclear envelope localization we have determined that neur subcellular localization is regulated by nuclear trafficking and that inhibition of chromosome region maintenance  a nuclear export receptor interferes with neur nuclear export trapping neur in the nucleus moreover we demonstrate that nuclear envelope localization is mediated by the neur nhr domain interestingly dl expression in schneider cells is sufficient to inhibit neur nuclear import and inhibition occurs in an nhr dependent manner suggesting that neur nuclear localization occurs in contexts where dl expression is either low or absent consistent with this we found that neur exhibits nuclear trafficking and associates with the nuclear envelope in the secretory cells of the larval salivary gland and that overexpression of dl can reduce neur localization to the nucleus altogether our data demonstrate that neur localizes to the nuclear envelope and that this localization can be negatively regulated by dl suggesting a possible nuclear function for neur in drosophila
