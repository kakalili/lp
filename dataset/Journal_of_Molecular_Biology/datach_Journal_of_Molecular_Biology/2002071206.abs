esterolytic antibodies as mechanistic and structural models of hydrolases  a quantitative analysis
understanding enzymes quantitatively and mimicking their remarkable catalytic efficiency is a paramount challenge here we applied esterolytic antibodies the d abs to dissect and quantify individual elements of enzymatic catalysis such as transition state ts stabilization nucleophilic reactivity and conformational changes kinetic and mutagenic analysis of the d abs were combined with existing structural evidence to show that catalysis by the d abs is driven primarily by stabilization of the tetrahedral oxyanionic intermediate of ester hydrolysis formed by the nucleophilic attack of an exogenous solution hydroxide anion the side chain of tyrh  d is shown to be the main h bond donor of the d abs oxyanion hole the ph rate and ph binding profiles indicate that the strength of this h bond increases dramatically as the neutral substrate develops into the oxyanionic ts resulting in ts stabilization of   kcal mol which is comparable to oxyanionic ts stabilization in serine hydrolases we show that the rate of the exogenous intermolecular nucleophilic attack can be enhanced by   fold by replacing the hydroxide nucleophile with peroxide an  nucleophile that is much more reactive than hydroxide in the presence of peroxide the rate saturates kcatmax at s   this rate ceiling appears to be dictated by the rate of the induced fit conformational rearrangement leading to the active antibody  ts complex the selective usage of negatively charged exogenous nucleophiles by the d abs led to the identification of a positively charged channel imprinted by the negatively charged ts analogue against which these antibodies were elicited this channel presumably directs the nucleophile to the antibody bound substrate our findings are discussed in comparison with serine esterases and in particular with cocaine esterase coce  which possesses a tyrosine based oxyanion hole
