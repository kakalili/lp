the replication domain model regulating replicon firing in the context of large scale chromosome architecture
the  replicon theory  of jacob brenner and cuzin has reliably served as the paradigm for regulating the sites where individual replicons initiate replication concurrent with the replicon model was taylor s demonstration that plant and animal chromosomes replicate segmentally in a defined temporal sequence via cytologically defined units too large to be accounted for by a single replicon instead there seemed to be a program to choreograph when chromosome units replicate during s phase executed by inititation at clusters of individual replicons within each segment here we summarize recent molecular evidence for the existence of such units now known as  replication domains   and discuss how the organization of large chromosomes into structural units has added additional layers of regulation to the original replicon model
