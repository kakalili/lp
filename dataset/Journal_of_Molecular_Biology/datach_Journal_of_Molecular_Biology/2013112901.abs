specification of dna replication origins and genomic base composition in fission yeasts
in the  replicon theory   jacob brenner and cuzin proposed the existence of replicators and initiators as the two major actors in dna replication over the years many protein components of initiators have been shown to be conserved in different organisms during evolution by contrast replicator dna sequences often referred to as replication origins have diverged beyond possible comparison between eukaryotic genomes replication origins in the fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe are made up of a t rich sequences that do not share any consensus elements the information encoded in these replicators is interpreted by the orc subunit of the orc origin recognition complex  which is unique among eukaryotes in that it contains a large domain harboring nine at hook subdomains that target orc to a great variety of a t rich sequences along the chromosomes recently the genomes of other schizosaccharomyces species have been sequenced and the regions encompassing their replication origins have been identified dna sequence analysis and comparison of the organization of their orc proteins have revealed species specific differences that contribute to our understanding of how the specification of replication origins has evolved during the phylogenetic divergence of fission yeasts
