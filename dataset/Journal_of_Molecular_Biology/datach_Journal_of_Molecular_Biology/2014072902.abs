systematic exploration of ubiquitin sequence e activation efficiency and experimental fitness in yeast
the complexity of biological interaction networks poses a challenge to understanding the function of individual connections in the overall network to address this challenge we developed a high throughput reverse engineering strategy to analyze how thousands of specific perturbations encompassing all point mutations in a central gene impact both a specific edge interaction to a directly connected node and an overall network function we analyzed the effects of ubiquitin mutations on activation by the e enzyme and compared these to effects on yeast growth rate using this approach we delineated ubiquitin mutations that selectively impacted the ubiquitin e edge we find that the elasticity function relating the efficiency of ubiquitin e interaction to growth rate is non linear and that a greater than  fold decrease in e activation efficiency is required to reduce growth rate by  fold despite the robustness of fitness to decreases in e activation efficiency the effects of most ubiquitin mutations on e activation paralleled the effects on growth rate our observations indicate that most ubiquitin mutations that disrupt e activation also disrupt other functions the structurally characterized ubiquitin e interface encompasses the interfaces of ubiquitin with most other known binding partners and we propose that this enables e in wild type cells to selectively activate ubiquitin protein molecules capable of binding to other partners from the cytoplasmic pool of ubiquitin protein that will include molecules with chemical damage and or errors from transcription and translation
