structural polymorphism of chromodomains in chd
chromodomain from heterochromatin protein  and polycomb protein is known to be a lysine methylated histone h tail binding module chromo helicase atpase dna binding protein  chd  is an atp dependent chromatin remodeling factor containing two tandem chromodomains in human chd  both chromodomains are essential for specific binding to a k methylated histone h  h mek  peptide and are found to bind cooperatively in the crystal structure for the budding yeast homologue chd  the second but not the first chromodomain was once reported to bind to an h mek peptide here we reveal that neither the second chromodomain nor a region containing tandem chromodomains from yeast chd bind to any lysine methylated or arginine methylated histone peptides that we examined in addition we examined the structures of the chromodomains from chd by nmr although the tertiary structure of the region containing tandem chromodomains could not be obtained the secondary structure deduced from nmr is well conserved in the tertiary structures of the corresponding first and second chromodomains determined individually by nmr both chromodomains of chd demonstrate a structure similar to that of the corresponding part of chd  consisting of a three stranded  sheet followed by a c terminal  helix however an additional helix between the first and second  strands which is found in both of the first chromodomains of chd and chd  is positioned in an entirely different manner in chd and chd  in human chd this helix forms the peptide binding site the amino acid sequences of the chromodomains could be well aligned on the basis of these structures the alignment showed that yeast chd lacks several key functional residues which are responsible for specific binding to a methylated lysine residue in other chromodomains chd is likely to have no binding affinity for any h mek peptide as found in other chromodomain proteins
