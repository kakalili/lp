solution structure of the human parvulin like peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase hpar  edited by p e wright
the hpar  protein is a peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerase and is a human parvulin homologue the hpar  protein shows about   sequence identity with the other human parvulin homologue hpin  here the solution structure of hpar  was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the n terminal  residues preceding the peptidyl prolyl isomerase domain of hpar  are unstructured whereas hpin possesses the ww domain at its n terminus the fold of residues     of hpar  which comprises a four stranded  sheet and three  helices is superimposable onto that of the peptidyl prolyl isomerase domain of hpin  to investigate the interaction of hpar  with a substrate the backbone chemical shift changes of hpar  were monitored during titration with a tetra peptide met  val  and phe  around the n terminus of   showed large chemical shift changes these residues form a hydrophobic patch on the molecular surface of hpar  two of these residues are conserved and have been shown to interact with the proline residue of the substrate in hpin  on the other hand hpar  lacks the hpin positively charged residues lys  arg  and arg   which determine the substrate specificity of hpin by interacting with phosphorylated ser or thr preceding the substrate pro and exhibits a different structure in the corresponding region therefore the mechanism determining the substrate specificity seems to be different between hpar  and hpin
