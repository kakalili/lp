the     crystal structure of the autoinhibited human c fms kinase domain
c fms a member of the platelet derived growth factor pdgf receptor family of receptor tyrosine kinases rtks  is the receptor for macrophage colony stimulating factor csf  that regulates proliferation differentiation and survival of cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage abnormal expression of c fms proto oncogene is associated with a significant number of human pathologies including a variety of cancers and rheumatoid arthritis accordingly c fms represents an attractive therapeutic target to further understand the regulation of c fms we determined the     resolution crystal structure of the cytosolic domain of c fms that comprised the kinase domain and the juxtamembrane domain the structure reveals the crucial inhibitory role of the juxtamembrane domain jm that binds to a hydrophobic site immediately adjacent to the atp binding pocket this interaction prevents the activation loop from adopting an active conformation thereby locking the c fms kinase into an autoinhibited state as observed for other members of the pdgf receptor family namely c kit and flt  three jm derived tyrosine residues primarily drive the mechanism for autoinhibition in c fms therefore defining a common autoinhibitory mechanism within this family moreover the structure provides an understanding of c fms inhibition by gleevec as well as providing a platform for the development of more selective inhibitors that target the inactive conformation of c fms kinase
