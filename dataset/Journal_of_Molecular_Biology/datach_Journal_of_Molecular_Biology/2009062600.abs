prion protein nmr structure from tammar wallaby macropus eugenii shows that the      loop is modulated by long range sequence effects
nmr structures are presented for the recombinant construct of residues      from the tammar wallaby macropus eugenii prion protein prp twprp      and for the variant mouse prps mprp y  a y  a       and mprp v  a       at    c and ph    all three proteins exhibit the same global architecture as seen in other recombinant prpcs cellular isoforms of prp and shown to prevail in natural bovine prpc special interest was focused on a loop that connects the   strand with helix   in the prpc fold since there are indications from in vivo experiments that this local structural feature affects the susceptibility of transgenic mice to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies this      loop and helix   form a solvent accessible contiguous epitope which has been proposed to be the recognition area for a hypothetical chaperone the  protein x   this hypothetical chaperone would affect the conversion of prpc into the disease related scrapie form prpsc by moderating intermolecular interactions related to the transmission barrier of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies between different species in contrast to mprp      and most other mammalian prpcs the      loop is well defined at    c in tammar wallaby prp and in the two aforementioned variants of mprp showing that long range interactions with helix   can have an overriding influence on the structural definition of the      loop further nmr studies with two variant mprps mprp y  a       and mprp y  a       showed that these interactions are dominantly mediated by close contacts between residues   and   the results of the present study then lead to the intriguing indication that well defined long range intramolecular interactions could act as regulators of the functional specificity of prpc
