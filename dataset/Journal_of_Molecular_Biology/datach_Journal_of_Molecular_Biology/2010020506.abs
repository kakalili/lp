adapter directed display a modular design for shuttling display on phage surfaces
a novel adapter directed phage display system was developed with modular features in this system the target protein is expressed as a fusion protein consisting of adapter gr from the phagemid vector while the recombinant phage coat protein is expressed as a fusion protein consisting of adapter gr in the helper phage vector surface display of the target protein is accomplished through specific heterodimerization of gr and gr adapters followed by incorporation of the heterodimers into phage particles a series of engineered helper phages were constructed to facilitate both display valency and formats based on various phage coat proteins as the target protein is independent of a specific phage coat protein this modular system allows the target protein to be displayed on any given phage coat protein and allows various display formats from the same vector without the need for reengineering here we demonstrate the shuttling display of a single chain fv antibody on phage surfaces between multivalent and monovalent formats as well as the shuttling display of an antigen binding fragment molecule on phage coat proteins piii pvii and pviii using the same phagemid vectors combined with different helper phage vectors this adapter directed display concept has been applied to eukaryotic yeast surface display and to a novel cross species display that can shuttle between prokaryotic phage and eukaryotic yeast systems
