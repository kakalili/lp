over expression analysis of all eight subunits of the molecular chaperone cct in mammalian cells reveals a novel function for cctdelta
chaperonin containing tailless complex polypeptide  cct forms a classical chaperonin barrel structure where two rings of subunits surround a central cavity each ring consists of eight distinct subunits creating a complex binding interface that makes cct unique among the chaperonins in addition to acting as a multimeric chaperonin there is increasing evidence indicating that the cct subunits when monomeric possess additional functions here we assess the role of the cct subunits individually using a gfp green fluorescent protein tagging approach to express each of the subunits in their monomeric form in cultured mammalian cells over expression of cctdelta but not the other seven cct subunits results in the appearance of numerous protrusions at the cell surface two point mutations one in the apical domain and one in the atp binding pocket of cctdelta that abolish protrusion formation have been identified consistent with the apical domain containing a novel interaction site that is influenced by the atpase activity in the equatorial domain structured illumination microscopy together with sub cellular fractionation reveals that only the wild type cctdelta is associated with the plasma membrane thus connecting spatial organization with surface protrusion formation expression of the equivalent subunit in yeast gfp cct  rescues growth of the temperature sensitive strain cct  at the non permissive temperature indicative of conserved subunit specific activities for cctdelta
