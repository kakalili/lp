engineered myosin vi motors reveal minimal structural determinants of directionality and processivity
myosins have diverse mechanical properties reflecting a range of cellular roles a major challenge is to understand the structural basis for generating novel functions from a common motor core myosin vi m  is specialized for processive motion toward the    end of actin filaments we have used engineered m motors to test and refine the  redirected power stroke  model for    end directionality and to explore poorly understood structural requirements for processive stepping guided by crystal structures and molecular modeling we fused artificial lever arms to the catalytic head of m at several positions retaining varying amounts of native structure we found that an  residue  helical insert is sufficient to reverse the directionality of the motor with no requirement for any calmodulin light chains further we observed robust processive stepping of motors with artificial lever arms demonstrating that processivity can arise without optimizing lever arm composition or mechanics
