sry directed dna bending and human sex reversal reassessment of a clinical mutation uncovers a global coupling between the hmg box and its tail
sex reversal mutations in human sry cluster within its high mobility group box a conserved motif of dna bending a classical substitution at the crux of this angular domain m i has been reported to impair dna bending but not dna binding implying that sharp bending is required for transcriptional activation and testis determination surprisingly we report that this defect was an inadvertent consequence of protein truncation in the intact protein sharp dna bending is restored by the basic tail of the high mobility group box structural coupling between box and tail is tuned to the native dna bend angle damping conformational fluctuations and enabling bidirectional induced fit within the bent complex m i associated sex reversal is instead caused by the impaired function of a flanking non classical nuclear localization signal nls  similar impairment is caused by m a suggesting that mislocalization is due to loss of an m  specific function and not gain of a non native i  specific function transcriptional activity attenuated by mislocalization is rescued by fusion of a heterologous nls in a male embryonic gonadal cell line m i and m a sry nls fusion proteins exhibit native transcriptional activation of sox  a key step in testicular differentiation our results suggest that male development is robust to subtle alterations in sry dna architecture but depends critically on nuclear localization the previously unsuspected role of m  within a non classical nls may contribute to its invariance among sox related and lef  related transcription factors
