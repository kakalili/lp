mechanism of homotropic control to coordinate hydrolysis in a hexameric aaa ring atpase
aaa proteins are ubiquitous mechanochemical atpases that use energy from atp hydrolysis to remodel their versatile substrates the aaa characteristic hexameric ring assemblies raise important questions about if and how six often identical subunits coordinate hydrolysis and associated motions the pspf aaa domain pspf     remodels the bacterial    rna polymerase to activate transcription analysis of atp substrate inhibition kinetics on atp hydrolysis in hexameric pspf    indicates negative homotropic effects between subunits functional determinants required for allosteric control identify  i an important link between the atp bound ribose moiety and the sensorii motif that would allow nucleotide dependent  helical    subdomain dynamics and ii establishes a novel regulatory role for the sensorii helix in pspf which may apply to other aaa proteins consistent with functional data homotropic control appears to depend on nucleotide state dependent subdomain angles imposing dynamic symmetry constraints in the aaa ring homotropic coordination is functionally important to remodel the   promoter we propose a structural symmetry based model for homotropic control in the aaa characteristic ring architecture
