structural insights into transcriptional repression by noncoding rnas that bind to human pol ii
gene transcription is regulated in response to environmental changes and developmental cues in mammalian cells subjected to stress conditions such as heat shock transcription of most protein coding genes decreases while the transcription of heat shock protein genes increases repression involves direct binding to rna polymerase ii pol ii of certain noncoding rnas ncrnas that are upregulated upon heat shock another class of ncrnas is also upregulated and binds to pol ii but does not inhibit transcription incorporation of repressive ncrnas into pre initiation complexes prevents transcription initiation while non repressive ncrnas are displaced from pol ii by tfiif here we present cryo electron microscopy reconstructions of human pol ii in complex with six different ncrnas from mouse and human our structures show that both repressive and non repressive ncrnas bind to a conserved binding site within the cleft of pol ii the site which is also shared with a previously characterized yeast aptamer is close to the active center and thus in an ideal position to regulate transcription importantly additional rna elements extend flexibly beyond the docking site we propose that the differences concerning the repressive activity of the ncrnas analyzed must be due to the distinct character of these more unstructured flexible segments of the rna that emanate from the cleft
