crystal structure of zebrafish hatching enzyme  from the zebrafish danio rerio
fish hatching enzymes are zinc metalloproteases that digest the egg envelope chorion at the time of hatching the crystal structure of zebrafish hatching enzyme  zhe  has been solved at     resolution zhe is monomeric is mitten shaped and has a cleft at the center of the molecule zhe consists of three   helices three  helices and two  sheets the central cleft represents the active site of the enzyme that is crucial for substrate recognition and catalysis alanine scanning mutagenesis of the two substrate peptides has shown that aspp   contributes the most and that the residues at p  p   also contribute to the recognition of the major substrate peptide by zhe  whereas glup   and the hydrophobic residues at p  p  p   and p   contribute significantly to the recognition of the minor substrate peptide by zhe  molecular models of these two substrate peptides bound to zhe have been built based on the crystal structure of a transition state analog inhibitor bound to astacin in substrate recognition models the aspp   in the major substrate peptide forms a salt bridge with arg  of zhe  while the glup   in the minor substrate peptide instead forms a salt bridge with arg   thus these two substrate peptides would be differently recognized by zhe  the shapes and electrostatic potentials of the substrate binding clefts of zhe and the structurally similar proteins astacin and bone morphogenetic protein  are significantly dissimilar due to different side chains which would confer their distinctive substrate preferences
