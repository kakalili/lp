x ray structure of a maquette scaffold
maquettes are de novo designed mimicries of nature used to test the construction and engineering criteria of oxidoreductases one type of scaffold used in maquette construction is a four  helical bundle the sequence of the four  helix bundle maquettes follows a heptad repeat pattern typical of left handed coiled coils initial designs were molten globular due partly to the minimalist approach taken by the designers subsequent iterative redesign generated several structured scaffolds with similar heme binding properties variant i f   a structured scaffold was partially resolved with nmr spectroscopy and found to have a set of mobile inter helical packing interfaces here the x ray structure of a similar peptide  i f m   i e  cggg eiwkl heeflkk feellkl heerlkkm   which we call l m  has been solved using mad phasing and refined to    resolution the structure shows that the maquette scaffold is an anti parallel four helix bundle with  up  up  down  down  topology no pre formed heme binding pocket exists in the protein scaffold we report unexpected inter helical crossing angles residue positions and translations between the helices the crossing angles between the parallel helices are    rather than the expected    for typical left handed coiled coils deviation of the scaffold from the design is likely due to the distribution and size of hydrophobic residues the structure of l m points out that four identical helices may interact differently in a bundle and heptad repeats with an alternating hpphhpp  hpphhph  h hydrophobic p polar pattern are not a sufficient design criterion to generate left hand coiled coils
