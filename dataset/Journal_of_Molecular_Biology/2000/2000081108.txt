FixL of Rhizobium meliloti (RmFixL) is a sensor histidine kinase of the two-component system, which regulates the expression of the genes related to nitrogen fixation in the root nodule in response to the O2 levels. The crystal structure of the sensor domain of FixL (RmFixLH), which contains a heme (Fe-porphyrin) as a sensing site, was determined at 1.4 Å resolution. Based on the structural and spectroscopic analyses, we propose the O2 sensing mechanism that differs from the case proposed in BjFixLH as follows; conformational changes in the F/G loop, which are induced by steric repulsion between the bent-bound O2 and the Ile209 side-chain, would be transmitted to the histidine kinase domain. Interaction between the iron-bound O2 and Ile209 was also observed in the resonance Raman spectra of RmFixLH as evidenced by the fact that the Fe-O2 and Fe-CN stretching frequencies were shifted from 575 to 570 cm−1 (Fe-O2), and 504 to 499 cm−1, respectively, as the result of the replacement of Ile209 with an Ala residue. In the I209A mutant of RmFixL, the O2 sensing activity was destroyed, thus confirming our proposed mechanism.
