ligand induced stabilization of ppar  monitored by nmr spectroscopy implications for nuclear receptor activation edited by p e wright
nuclear receptors are ligand dependent transcription factors that are mediators of the action of lipophilic hormones and other endogenous ligands and are the targets of drugs useful in a variety of therapeutic areas peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ppar  is a nuclear receptor that acting as a heterodimer with rxr mediates a variety of cellular effects including adipocyte differentiation due to its role in modulating insulin sensitivity it is the target of therapeutically active anti diabetic agents such as rosiglitazone we have assigned the chemical shifts of the backbone atoms of the  kda ligand binding domain of ppar  in the presence of bound rosiglitazone three dimensional hnco spectra of the apo ligand binding domain lbd have less than half the expected number of cross peaks the missing cross peaks are restored upon binding strong agonists such as rosiglitazone the nmr results indicate that the apo lbd of ppar  is in a conformationally mobile state and that agonist binding is associated with a marked stabilization of the conformation mapping the missing peaks to the d x ray crystallographic structure indicates the region of mobility is extensive and includes the ligand binding region and the cofactor binding site this leads to the conclusion that activation of this nuclear receptor is a result of a population shift of a dynamic ensemble of conformations rather than a two state switch from an inactive to an active conformation our results have important implications for the mechanisms by which antagonists partial agonists and agonists of nuclear receptor function operate
