structural analysis of a ternary complex of allantoate amidohydrolase from escherichia coli reveals its mechanics
purine metabolism plays a major role in regulating the availability of purine nucleotides destined for nucleic acid synthesis allantoate amidohydrolase catalyzes the conversion of allantoate to s ureidoglycolate one of the crucial alternate steps in purine metabolism the crystal structure of a ternary complex of allantoate amidohydrolase with its substrate allantoate and an allosteric effector a sulfate ion from escherichia coli was determined to understand better the catalytic mechanism and substrate specificity the     resolution x ray structure reveals an    scaffold akin to zinc exopeptidases of the peptidase m  family and lacks the     barrel fold characteristic of the amidohydrolases arrangement of the substrate and the two co catalytic zinc ions at the active site governs catalytic specificity for hydrolysis of n carbamyl versus the peptide bond in exopeptidases in its crystalline form allantoate amidohydrolase adopts a relatively open conformation however structural analysis reveals the possibility of a significant movement of domains via rotation about two hinge regions upon allosteric effector and substrate binding resulting in a closed catalytically competent conformation by bringing the substrate allantoate closer to co catalytic zinc ions two cis prolyl peptide bonds found on either side of the dimerization domain in close proximity to the substrate and ligand binding sites may be involved in protein folding and in preserving the integrity of the catalytic site
