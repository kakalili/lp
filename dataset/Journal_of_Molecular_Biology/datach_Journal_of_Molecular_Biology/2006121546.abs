biological units and their effect upon the properties and prediction of protein  protein interactions
structural data as collated in the protein data bank pdb have been widely applied in the study and prediction of protein  protein interactions however since the basic pdb entries contain only the contents of the asymmetric unit rather than the biological unit some key interactions may be missed by analysing only the pdb entry a total of    scop structural classification of proteins domains were examined systematically to identify the number of additional novel interacting domain pairs and interfaces found by considering the biological unit as stored in the pqs protein quaternary structure database the pqs data adds    interacting domain pairs to those seen in the pdb entries to give a total of    redundant interacting domain pairs redundancy filtering at the level of the scop family shows pqs to increase the number of novel interacting domain family pairs by       from    but only        of the interacting domain pairs have the two domains in different scop families this suggests the biological units add little to the elucidation of novel biological interaction networks however when the orientation of the domain pairs is considered the pqs data increases the number of novel domain  domain interfaces observed by       to give   non redundant domain  domain interfaces in all      novel domain  domain interfaces are between domains from different families an increase of   over the pdb entries overall the pqs biological units provide a rich source of novel domain  domain interfaces that are not seen in the studied pdb entries and so pqs domain  domain interaction data should be exploited wherever possible in the analysis and prediction of protein  protein interactions
