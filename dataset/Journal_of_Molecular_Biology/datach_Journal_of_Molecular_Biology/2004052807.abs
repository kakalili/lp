crystal structure of ksga a universally conserved rrna adenine dimethyltransferase in escherichia coli
the bacterial enzyme ksga catalyzes the transfer of a total of four methyl groups from s adenosyl l methionine s adomet to two adjacent adenosine bases in  s rrna this enzyme and the resulting modified adenosine bases appear to be conserved in all species of eubacteria eukaryotes and archaebacteria and in eukaryotic organelles bacterial resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic kasugamycin involves inactivation of ksga and resulting loss of the dimethylations with modest consequences to the overall fitness of the organism in contrast the yeast ortholog dim  is essential in yeast and presumably in other eukaryotes the enzyme performs a vital role in pre rrna processing in addition to its methylating activity another ortholog has been discovered recently h mttfb in human mitochondria which has a second function this enzyme is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial transcription factor the ksga enzymes are homologous to another family of rna methyltransferases the erm enzymes which methylate a single adenosine base in  s rrna and confer resistance to the mls b group of antibiotics despite their sequence similarity the two enzyme families have strikingly different levels of regulation that remain to be elucidated we have crystallized ksga from escherichia coli and solved its structure to a resolution of    the structure bears a strong similarity to the crystal structure of ermc  from bacillus stearothermophilus and a lesser similarity to sc mttfb the saccharomyces cerevisiae version of h mttfb comparison of the three crystal structures and further study of the ksga protein will provide insight into this interesting group of enzymes
