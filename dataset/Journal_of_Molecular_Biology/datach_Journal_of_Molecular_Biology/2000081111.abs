structure of  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase from escherichia coli comparison of the mn    phosphoglycolate and the pb    phosphoenolpyruvate complexes and implications for catalysis edited by d rees
the crystal structure of the phenylalanine regulated  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase dahps from escherichia coli in complex with mn  and the substrate analog  phosphoglycolate pgl  was determined by molecular replacement using x ray diffraction data to    resolution dahps  mn  pgl crystallizes in space group c  a      b     c            with its four     barrel subunits related by non crystallographic   symmetry the refinement was carried out without non crystallographic symmetry restraints and yielded agreement factors of r    and rfree     mn  the most efficient metal activator is coordinated by the same four side chains cys  his   glu  and asp   as is the poorly activating pb  a fifth ligand is a well defined water molecule which is within hydrogen bonding distance to an essential lysine residue lys   the distorted octahedral coordination sphere of the metal is completed by pgl which replaces the substrate  phosphoenolpyruvate pep  in the active site however unlike pep in the pb  pep complex pgl binds the mn via one of its carboxylate oxygen atoms a model of the active site is discussed in which pep binds in the same orientation as does pgl in the dahps  mn  pgl structure and the phosphate of e p is tethered at the site of a bound sulfate anion the re face of e p can be positioned to interact with the si face of pep with only small movement of the protein
