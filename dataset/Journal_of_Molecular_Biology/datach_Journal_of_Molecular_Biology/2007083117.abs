the box h aca rnp assembly factor naf p contains a domain homologous to gar p mediating its interaction with cbf p
naf is an essential protein involved in the maturation of box h aca ribonucleoproteins a group of particles required for ribosome biogenesis modification of spliceosomal small nuclear rnas and telomere synthesis naf participates in the assembly of the rnp at transcription sites and in the nuclear trafficking of the complex the crystal structure of a domain of yeast naf p naf  p reveals a striking structural homology with the core domain of archaeal gar  an essential protein component of the mature rnp it suggests that naf p and gar p have a common binding site on the enzymatic protein component of the particle cbf p we propose that naf p is a competitive binder for cbf p which is replaced by gar p during maturation of the h aca particle the exchange of naf p by gar p might be prompted by external factors that alter the oligomerisation state of naf p and gar p the structural homology with gar suggests that the function of naf involves preventing non cognate rnas from being loaded during transport of the particle by inducing a non productive conformation of cbf
