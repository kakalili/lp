catalysing new reactions during evolution economy of residues and mechanism
the diversity of function in some enzyme superfamilies shows that during evolution enzymes have evolved to catalyse different reactions on the same structure scaffold in this analysis we examine in detail how enzymes can modify their chemistry through a comparison of the catalytic residues and mechanisms in  pairs of homologous enzymes of totally different functions we find that evolution is very economical enzymes retain structurally conserved residues to aid catalysis including residues that bind catalytic metal ions and modulate cofactor chemistry we examine the conservation of residue type and residue function in these structurally conserved residue pairs additionally enzymes often retain common mechanistic steps catalyzed by structurally conserved residues we have examined these steps in the context of their overall reactions
