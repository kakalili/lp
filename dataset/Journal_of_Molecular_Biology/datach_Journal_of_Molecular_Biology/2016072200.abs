canonical dna repair pathways influence r loop driven genome instability
dna repair defects create cancer predisposition in humans by fostering a higher rate of mutations while dna repair is quite well characterized recent studies have identified previously unrecognized relationships between dna repair and r loop mediated genome instability r loops are three stranded nucleic acid structures in which rna binds to genomic dna to displace a loop of single stranded dna mutations in homologous recombination nucleotide excision repair crosslink repair and dna damage checkpoints have all now been linked to formation and function of transcription coupled r loops this perspective will summarize recent literature linking dna repair to r loop mediated genomic instability and discuss how r loops may contribute to mutagenesis in dna repair deficient cancers
