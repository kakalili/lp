induction of short interspersed nuclear repeat containing transcripts in epithelial cells upon infection with a chicken adenovirus
chicken embryo lethal orphan adenovirus celo is used as a vector for expression of exogenous genes in mammalian cells here we analyzed transcriptional alterations in mouse epithelial host cells following infection with celo using cdna microarray analysis sequence data characterization revealed that a major portion of celo induced genes contained short interspersed nuclear elements of the b subclass b sines  in fact we could identify sines and other repetitive sequences as contributing significantly to the cdnas used for microarray construction moreover we found that the celo protein gam was able to mediate transcriptional activation of these b sine containing rnas we hypothesize that upregulation of b sine containing rnas could be a novel contribution of gam to celo host cell infection
