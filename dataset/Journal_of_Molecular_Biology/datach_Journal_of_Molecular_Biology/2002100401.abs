activation of striated muscle nearest neighbor regulatory unit and cross bridge influence on myofilament kinetics
we have formulated a three compartment model of muscle activation that includes both strong cross bridge xb and ca  activated regulatory unit ru mediated nearest neighbor cooperative influences the model is based on the tight coupling premise  that xb retain activating ca  on the thin filament using global non linear least squares the model produced excellent fits to experimental steady state force pca and atpase pca data from skinned rat soleus fibers in terms of the model nearest neighbor influences over the range of ca  required for activation cause the ca  dissociation rate from regulatory units koff to decrease and the cross bridge association rate f to increase each more than ten fold moreover the rate variations occur in separate ca  regimes the energy of activation governing f is strongly influenced by both neighboring ru and xb in contrast the energy of activation governing koff is less affected by neighboring xb than by neighboring ru nearest neighbor cooperative influences provide both an overall sensitization to ca  and the well known steep response of force to free ca  the apparent sensitivity for ca  activation of force and atpase is a function of cross bridge kinetic rates the model and derived parameter set produce simulated behavior in qualitative agreement with steady state experiments reported in the literature for partial tnc replacement increased pi  increased adp  and malnet s addition the model is an initial attempt to construct a general theory of striated muscle activation  one that can be consistently used to interpret data from various types of muscle manipulation experiments
