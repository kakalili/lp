structural analysis of the interactions between hsp  chaperones and the yeast dna replication protein orc p
hsp  chaperones besides their role in assisting protein folding are key modulators of protein disaggregation being consistently found as components of most macromolecular assemblies isolated in proteome wide affinity purifications a wealth of structural information has been recently acquired on hsp s complexed with hsp  and nef co factors and with small hydrophobic target peptides however knowledge of how hsp s recognize large protein substrates is still limited earlier we reported that homologue hsp  chaperones dnak in escherichia coli and ssa  p ssb  p in saccharomyces cerevisiae bind strongly both in vitro and in vivo to the aaa domain in the orc p subunit of yeast origin recognition complex orc  scorc is the paradigm for eukaryotic dna replication initiators and consists of six distinct protein subunits scorc p  scorc p  here we report that a hydrophobic sequence il  in the initiator specific motif ism in orc p is the main target for dnak hsp  the three dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of a stable orc p  dnak complex suggests that the c terminal substrate binding domain in the chaperone clamps the aaa il motif in one orc p molecule with the substrate binding domain lid subdomain wedging apart the other orc p subunit pairwise co expression in e coli shows that orc p interacts with orc   p mutation of il selectively disrupts orc p interaction with orc p allelic substitution of orc by mutants in each residue of il results in lethal i  a or thermosensitive l  a and l  a initiation defective phenotypes in vivo the interplay between hsp  chaperones and the orc p il motif might have an adaptor role in the sequential stoichiometric assembly of scorc subunits
