an unusual sugar conformation in the structure of an rna dna decamer of the polypurine tract may affect recognition by rnase h
retroviral conversion of single stranded rna into double stranded dna requires priming for each strand while host cellular t rna serves as primer for the first strand the viral polypurine tract ppt is primer for the second therefore polypurine tracts of retroviruses are essential for viral replication by reverse transcriptase rt  these purine tracts are resistant to cleavage during first strand synthesis in obtaining the primer for second strand synthesis the rnase h function of rt must cleave the ppt exactly for in vivo transcription to proceed efficiently and proper integration to occur at the rnase h active site the protein makes contacts primarily along the backbone with hydrogen bonds to the sugar  phosphate oxygen atoms a high resolution structure     of the first ten base pairs of the rna dna hybrid ppt r c a a a g a a a a g d c t t t t c t t t g  contains the highly deformable r a g a steps found in retroviral polypurine tracts this r a g a motif is utilized in the  unzipping  or unpairing of bases that occurs when rt binds a malleable ppt another unusual feature found in our high resolution ppt structure is the sugar switch at rna adenine  all the rna sugars are the expected c   endo except sugar  which is c   endo characteristic of b form sugars this local a to b conversion adversely affects the pattern of hydrogen bonds from protein to sugar  phosphate backbone disrupting the catalytic site disruption could cause the enzyme to pause at the   end of the ppt leaving it intact pyrimidine  purine yr steps are most deformable and the t a step especially can undergo a to b transitions readily
