nucleosome dynamics vi histone tail regulation of tetrasome chiral transition a relaxation study of tetrasomes on dna minicircles edited by m yaniv
we have recently described the relaxation of mononucleosomes on an homologous series of     bp dna minicircles as a tool to study nucleosome structure and dynamics in vitro nucleosomes were found to have a tail regulated access to three distinct dna conformations depending on the crossing between the entering and exiting dnas and its polarity this approach was now used to explore tetrasome chiral transition and the influence of the histone tails the data confirmed the existence of two states with linking number differences  lkt         and        as expected the particle free energy is higher in the right handed state  gt     i kt  but it decreased to      kt upon histone acetylation and the addition of phosphate a potent tail destabilizer removal of the tails with trypsin further decreased  gt to   kt  and also induced a loss of supercoiling in both states to  lkt         and        the loop end conditions and hence the parameters of the dna superhelix were then calculated for both states using the explicit solutions to the equations of the mechanical equilibrium in the theory of elastic rod model for dna whereas the pitch of the dna superhelix may be approximately equal and opposite in the two conformations its radius r was   larger in the right handed conformation confirming previous observations by electron microscopy of a tetrasome lateral opening in that conformation the above supercoiling losses were found to reflect a further   increase in r to    upon removal of the tails in the right handed conformation and a   increase in the left handed conformation the use of composite tetramers with one histone tail intact and the other removed showed these effects to be essentially due to the h tails altogether these results show that the h tails oppose the tetrasome opening which is expected to be required to relieve the clash between the entering and exiting dnas in the course of the transition but which also appears to be intrinsic to the protein reorientation mechanism we propose that the block against opening results from the h tails intercalating into the small groove of the double helix at   bp from the dyad and acting as wedges against local dna straightening the tails especially h  may therefore regulate tetrasome chiral transition in vivo
