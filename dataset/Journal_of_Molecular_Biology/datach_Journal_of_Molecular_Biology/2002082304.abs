domain organization of d akap revealed by enhanced deuterium exchange mass spectrometry dxms
dual specific a kinase anchoring protein  d akap  is a scaffold protein that coordinates camp mediated signaling complexes by binding to type i and type ii protein kinase a pka  while information is unfolding regarding specific binding motifs very little is known about the overall structure and dynamics of these scaffold proteins we have used deuterium exchange mass spectrometry dxms and limited proteolysis to probe the folded regions of d akap  providing for the first time insight into the intra domain dynamics of a scaffold protein deuterium on exchange revealed two regions of low deuterium exchange that were surrounded by regions of high exchange suggestive of two distinctly folded regions flanked by disordered or solvent accessible regions similar folded regions were detected by limited proteolysis the first folded region contained a putative regulator of g protein signaling rgs domain a structural model of the rgs domain revealed that the more deuterated regions mapped onto loops and turns whereas less deuterated regions mapped onto  helices consistent with this region folding into an rgs domain the second folded region contained a highly protected pka binding site and a more solvent accessible pdz binding motif which may serve as a potential targeting domain for d akap  dxms has verified the multi domain architecture of d akap implied by sequence homology and has provided unique insight into the accessibility of the pka binding site
