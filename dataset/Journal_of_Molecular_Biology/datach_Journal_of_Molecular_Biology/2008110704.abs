analysis of the isolated seca dead motor suggests a mechanism for chemical  mechanical coupling
the preprotein cross linking domain and c terminal domains of escherichia coli seca were removed to create a minimal dead motor seca dm seca dm hydrolyzes atp and has the same affinity for adp as full length seca the crystal structure of seca dm in complex with adp was solved and shows the dead motor in a closed conformation comparison with the structure of the e coli dead motor in an open conformation protein data bank id fsi indicates main chain conformational changes in two critical sequences corresponding to motif iii and motif v of the dead helicase family the structures that the motif iii and motif v sequences adopt in the dead motor open conformation are incompatible with the closed conformation therefore when the dead motor makes the transition from open to closed motif iii and motif v are forced to change their conformations which likely functions to regulate passage through the transition state for atp hydrolysis the transition state for atp hydrolysis for the seca dead motor was modeled based on the conformation of the vasa helicase in complex with adenylyl imidodiphosphate and rna protein data bank id db  a mechanism for chemical  mechanical coupling emerges where passage through the transition state for atp hydrolysis is hindered by the conformational changes required in motif iii and motif v and may be promoted by binding interactions with the preprotein substrate and or other translocase domains and subunits
