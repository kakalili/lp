structure and thermodynamics of rna protein binding using molecular dynamics and free energy analyses to calculate the free energies of binding and conformational change edited by b honig
an adaptive binding mechanism requiring large conformational rearrangements occurs commonly with many rna protein associations to explore this process of reorganization we have investigated the conformational change upon spliceosomal u a rna binding with molecular dynamics md simulations and free energy analyses we computed the energetic cost of conformational change in u a hairpin and u a internal loop binding using a hybrid of molecular mechanics and continuum solvent methods encouragingly in all four free energy comparisons two slightly different proteins two different rnas  the free macromolecule was more stable than the bound form by the physically reasonable value of    kcal mol we calculated the absolute binding free energies for both complexes to be in the same range as that found experimentally
