combining single molecule imaging and single channel electrophysiology
combining simultaneous single molecule fluorescence measurements of ion channel conformational change with single channel electrophysiology would enable a direct link between structure and function such methods would help us to create a truly molecular  movie  of how these important biomolecules work here we review past and recent progress toward this goal
