molecular basis of the functional divergence of fatty acyl amp ligase biosynthetic enzymes of mycobacterium tuberculosis
activation of fatty acids as acyl adenylates by fatty acyl amp ligases faals in mycobacterium tuberculosis is a variant of a classical theme that involves formation of acyl coa coenzyme a by fatty acyl coa ligases facls  here we show that faals and facls possess similar structural fold and substrate specificity determinants and the key difference is the absence of a unique insertion sequence in facl  structure a systematic analysis shows a conserved hydrophobic anchorage of the insertion motif across several faals strikingly mutagenesis of two phenylalanine residues which are part of the anchorage to alanine converts faal  to facl  this insertion based in silico analysis suggests the presence of faal homologues in several other non mycobacterial genomes including eukaryotes the work presented here establishes an elegant mechanism wherein an insertion sequence drives the functional divergence of faals from canonical facls
