order  disorder  order transitions mediate the activation of cholera toxin
cholera toxin ct holotoxin must be activated to intoxicate host cells this process requires the intracellular dissociation of the enzymatic cta domain from the holotoxin components cta and b  followed by subsequent interaction with the host factor adp ribosylation factor  arf  gtp we report the first nmr based solution structural data for the ct enzymatic domain cta  we show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the c terminus and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and the end of this activation process deviations from random coil chemical shifts   coil indicate helix formation in the activation loop which is essential to open the toxin s active site and occurs prior to its association with human protein arf  we performed nmr titrations of both free cta and an active cta arf gtp complex with nad  which revealed that the formation of the complex does not significantly enhance nad binding partial unfolding of cta is further illustrated by using    bis  anilinonaphthalene  sulfonate fluorescence as an indicator of the exposed hydrophobic character of the free enzyme which is substantially reduced when bound to arf gtp we propose that the primary role of arf s allostery is to induce refolding of the c terminus of cta  thus as a folded globular toxin complex cta escapes the chaperone and proteasomal components of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway in the cytosol and then proceeds to adp ribosylate its target gs  triggering the downstream events associated with the pathophysiology of cholera
