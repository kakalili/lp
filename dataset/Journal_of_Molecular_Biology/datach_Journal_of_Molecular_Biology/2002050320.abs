interactions between bacterial flagellar axial proteins in their monomeric state in solution
the axial structure of the bacterial flagellum is composed of many different proteins such as hook protein and flagellin and each protein forms a short or long axial segment one after another in a well defined order along the axis under physiological conditions most of these proteins are stable in the monomeric state in solution and spontaneous polymerization appears to be suppressed as demonstrated clearly for flagellin probably to avoid undesirable self assembly in the cytoplasmic space however no systematic studies of the possible associations between monomeric axial proteins in solution have been carried out we therefore studied self and cross association between hook protein flagellin and three hook associated proteins hap  hap and hap  in all possible pairs by gel filtration and analytical centrifugation and found interactions in the following two cases only flagellin facilitated hap aggregation into  amyloid like filaments but without stable binding between the two addition of hap to hap resulted in disassembly of preformed hap decamers and formation of stable hap  hap heterodimers hap missing either of its disordered terminal regions did not form the heterodimer whereas hap missing either of its disordered terminal regions showed stable heterodimer formation this polarity in the heterodimer interactions suggests that the interactions between hap and hap in solution are basically the same as those in the flagellar axial structure we discuss these results in relation to the assembly mechanism of the flagellum
