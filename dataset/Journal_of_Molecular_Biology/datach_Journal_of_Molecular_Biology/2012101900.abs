neck linker length dependence of processive kinesin  motility
processive motility of individual molecules is essential for the function of many kinesin motors processivity for kinesins relies on communication between the two heads of a dimeric molecule such that binding strictly alternates the main communicating elements are believed to be the two neck linkers connecting the motors stalks and heads a proposed mechanism for coordination is the transmission of stress through the neck linkers it is believed that the efficiency of gating depends on the length of the neck linker recent studies have presented support for a simple model in which the length of the neck linker directly controls the degree of processivity based on a previously published kinesin  kinesin  chimera eg kin we have analyzed the motility of  motor constructs we have varied the length of the neck linker in the range between  and  amino acids using the corresponding native kinesin  sequence xenopus laevis eg  we found surprisingly that neither velocity nor force generation depended on neck linker length we also found that constructs with short neck linkers down to  amino acids were still highly processive while processivity was lost at a length of  amino acids run lengths were maximal with neck linkers close to the native kinesin  length and decreased beyond that length this finding generally confirms the coordinating role of the neck linker for kinesin motility but challenges the simplest model postulating a motor type  independent optimal length instead our results suggest that different kinesins might be optimized for different neck linker lengths
