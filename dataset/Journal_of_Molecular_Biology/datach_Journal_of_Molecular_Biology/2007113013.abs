histone modifications influence the action of snf family remodelling enzymes by different mechanisms
alteration of chromatin structure by chromatin modifying and remodelling activities is a key stage in the regulation of many nuclear processes these activities are frequently interlinked and many chromatin remodelling enzymes contain motifs that recognise modified histones here we adopt a peptide ligation strategy to generate specifically modified chromatin templates and used these to study the interaction of the chd  isw and rsc remodelling complexes with differentially acetylated nucleosomes specific patterns of histone acetylation are found to alter the rate of chromatin remodelling in different ways for example histone h lysine  acetylation acts to increase recruitment of the rsc complex to nucleosomes however histone h tetra acetylation alters the spectrum of remodelled products generated by increasing octamer transfer in trans in contrast histone h tetra acetylation was also found to reduce the activity of the chd and isw remodelling enzymes by reducing catalytic turnover without affecting recruitment these observations illustrate a range of different means by which modifications to histones can influence the action of remodelling enzymes
