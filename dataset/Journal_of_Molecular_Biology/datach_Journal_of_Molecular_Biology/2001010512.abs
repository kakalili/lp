recognition of the lipoyl domain is the ultimate determinant of substrate channelling in the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex edited by p e wright
reductive acetylation of the lipoyl domain e plip of the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of escherichia coli is catalysed specifically by its partner pyruvate decarboxylase e p  and no productive interaction occurs with the analogous  oxoglutarate decarboxylase e o of the  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex residues in the lipoyl lysine  turn region of the unlipoylated e plip domain e plipapo undergo significant changes in both chemical shift and transverse relaxation time t  in the presence of e p but not e o residue gly  in a prominent surface loop between  strands  and  in the e plip domain was also observed to undergo a significant change in chemical shift addition of pyruvate to the mixture of e plipapo and e p caused larger changes in chemical shift and the appearance of multiple cross peaks for certain residues suggesting that the domain was experiencing more than one type of interaction residues in both  strands  and  together with those in the prominent surface loop and the following  strand  appeared to be interacting with e p as did a small patch of residues centred around glu  the values of t across the polypeptide chain backbone were also lower than in the presence of e p alone suggesting that e plipapo binds more tightly after the addition of pyruvate the lipoylated domain e plipholo also exhibited significant changes in chemical shift and decreases in the overall t relaxation times in the presence of e p the residues principally affected being restricted to the half of the domain that contains the lipoyl lysine lys  residue in addition small chemical shift changes and a general drop in t times in the presence of e o were observed indicating that e plipholo can interact weakly but non productively with e o it is evident that recognition of the protein domain is the ultimate determinant of whether reductive acetylation of the lipoyl group occurs and that this is ensured by a mosaic of interactions with the elp
