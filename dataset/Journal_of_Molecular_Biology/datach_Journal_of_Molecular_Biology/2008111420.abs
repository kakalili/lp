structural analysis of the human rad  protein  dna complex filament by tryptophan fluorescence scanning analysis transmission of allosteric effects between atp binding and dna binding
human rad  hsrad  catalyzes the strand exchange reaction a crucial step in homologous recombination by forming a filamentous complex with dna the structure of this filament is modified by atp which is required and hydrolyzed for the reaction we analyzed the structure and the atp promoted conformational change of this filament we systematically replaced aromatic residues in the protein one at a time with tryptophan a fluorescent probe and examined its effect on the activities dna binding atpase atp promoted conformational change and strand exchange reaction and the fluorescence changes upon binding of atp and dna some residues were also replaced with alanine we thus obtained structural information about various positions of the protein in solution all the proteins conserved at least partially their activities however the replacement of histidine at position   h   and phenylalanine at   f   affected the atp induced conformational change of the dna  hsrad  filament although it did not prevent dna binding f  is considered to be close to the atp binding site and to h  of a neighboring subunit atp probably modifies the structure around f  and affects the subunit subunit contact around h  and the structure of the dna binding site the replacement also reduced the dna dependent atpase activity suggesting that these residues are also involved in the transmission of the allosteric effect of dna to the atp binding site which is required for the stimulation of atpase activity by dna the fluorescence analyses supported the structural change of the dna binding site by atp and that of the atp binding site by dna this information will be useful to build a molecular model of the rad   dna complex and to understand the mechanism of activation of rad  by atp and that of the rad  promoted strand exchange reaction
