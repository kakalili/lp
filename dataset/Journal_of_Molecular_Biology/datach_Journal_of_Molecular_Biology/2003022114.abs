the oligomeric states of haloarcula marismortui malate dehydrogenase are modulated by solvent components as shown by crystallographic and biochemical studies
the three dimensional crystal structure of the r  s r  s mutant of malate dehydrogenase from haloarcula marismortui was solved at    resolution in order to determine the role of salt bridges and solvent ions in halophilic adaptation and quaternary structure stability the mutations located at the dimer  dimer interface disrupt two inter dimeric salt bridge clusters that are essential for wild type tetramer stabilisation previous experiments in solution performed on the double mutant had shown a tetrameric structure in m nacl which dissociated into active dimers in m nacl in order to establish if the active dimeric form is a product of the mutation or if it also exists in the wild type protein complementary studies were performed on the wild type enzyme by analytical centrifugation and small angle neutron scattering experiments they showed the existence of active dimers in naf kf na so  even in the absence of nadh and in the presence of nadh at concentrations of nacl below  m the crystal structure shows a tetramer that in the absence of the salt bridge clusters appears to be stabilized by a network of ordered water molecules and by cl  binding at the dimer  dimer interface the double mutant and wild type dimer folds are essentially identical the r m s deviation between equivalent c  positions is     chloride ions are also observed at the monomer  monomer interfaces of the mutant contributing to the stability of each dimer against low salt dissociation our results support the hypothesis that extensive binding of water and salt is an important feature of adaptation to a halophilic environment
