structural complementation of the catalytic domain of pseudomonas exotoxin a
the catalytic moiety of pseudomonas exotoxin a domain iii or pe  inhibits protein synthesis by adp ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor  pe is widely used as a cytocidal payload in receptor targeted protein toxin conjugates we have designed and characterized catalytically inactive fragments of pe that are capable of structural complementation we dissected pe at an extended loop and fused each fragment to one subunit of a heterospecific coiled coil in vitro adp ribosylation and protein translation assays demonstrate that the resulting fusions  supplied exogenously as genetic elements or purified protein fragments  had no significant catalytic activity or effect on protein synthesis individually but in combination catalyzed the adp ribosylation of eukaryotic elongation factor  and inhibited protein synthesis although complementing pe fragments are catalytically less efficient than intact pe in cell free systems co expression in live cells transfected with transgenes encoding the toxin fusions inhibits protein synthesis and causes cell death comparably as intact pe  complementation of split pe offers a direct extension of the immunotoxin approach to generate bispecific agents that may be useful to target complex phenotypes
