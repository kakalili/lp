evolution under drug pressure remodels the folding free energy landscape of mature hiv  protease
using high pressure nmr spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry we investigate the folding landscape of the mature hiv  protease homodimer the cooperativity of unfolding was measured in the absence or presence of a symmetric active site inhibitor for the optimized wild type protease pr  its inactive variant prd n and an extremely multidrug resistant mutant pr  the individual fit of the pressure denaturation profiles gives rise to first order   gnmr and second order   vnmr the derivative of  gnmr with pressure  apparent thermodynamic parameters for each amide proton considered heterogeneity in the apparent  vnmr values reflects departure from an ideal cooperative unfolding transition the narrow to broad distribution of  vnmr spanning the extremes from inhibitor free pr d n to pr  dmp  complex and distinctively for prd n  dmp  complex indicated large variations in folding cooperativity consistent with this data the shape of thermal unfolding transitions varies from asymmetric for pr to nearly symmetric for pr  as dimer  inhibitor ternary complexes lack of structural cooperativity was observed between regions located close to the active site including the hinge and tip of the glycine rich flaps and the rest of the protein these results strongly suggest that inhibitor binding drastically decreases the cooperativity of unfolding by trapping the closed flap conformation in a deep energy minimum to evade this conformational trap pr  evolves exhibiting a smoother folding landscape with nearly an ideal two state cooperative unfolding transition this study highlights the malleability of retroviral protease folding pathways by illustrating how the selection of mutations under drug pressure remodels the free energy landscape as a primary mechanism
