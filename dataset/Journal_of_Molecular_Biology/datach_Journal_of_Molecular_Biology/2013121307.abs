samhd host restriction factor a link with innate immune sensing of retrovirus infection
samhd  sterile alpha motif and histidine aspartic domain hd containing protein  is the most recent addition to a unique group of host restriction factors that limit retroviral replication at distinct stages of the viral life cycle samhd is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase that degrades the intracellular pool of deoxynucleoside triphosphates available during early reverse transcription samhd activity is blocked by the vpx accessory function present in human immunodeficiency virus type  and sivsm mutations in samhd are associated with the autoimmune disorder aicardi  gouti res syndrome thus emphasizing its role in regulation of the immune response samhd antiretroviral activity is modulated by post translational modifications cell cycle dependent functions and cytokine mediated changes innate receptors that sense retroviral dna intermediates are the focus of intense study and recent studies have established a link among samhd restriction innate sensing of dna and protective immune responses cell cycle dependent regulation of samhd by phosphorylation and the increasingly broad range of viruses inhibited by samhd further emphasize the importance of these mechanisms of host restriction this review highlights current knowledge regarding samhd regulation and its impact on innate immune signaling and retroviral restriction
