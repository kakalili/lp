mutagenesis of cysteine   of the reverse transcriptase of human immunodeficiency virus type  the effects on the ribonuclease h activity
retroviral reverse transcriptases rts have both dna polymerase and ribonuclease h rnase h activities the rt of human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  is composed of two subunits the p  which is the smaller subunit shares with the larger p  subunit the same amino terminal part which encompasses the dna polymerase domain and lacks the carboxyl terminal segment of the p  which is the rnase h domain  the structure of the polymerase domain of hiv  rt resembles a right hand with fingers palm and thumb subdomains linked to the rnase h domain chemical modifications by thiol specific reagents of cysteine   located in  helix i in the thumb subdomain of the polymerase domain affect substantially only the rnase h activity also the substitution of a serine for c  did not alter any of the rt activities here we have systematically modified the c  residue to either of the following residues w p h l m y q e or r only the first two mutations lead to a marked reduction in the rnase h activity whereas none of the mutations affected the polymerase function to a significant extent as expected due to their impaired rnase h the c  w and c  p mutants also had a very low dna strand transfer activity it is also apparent from subunit directed mutagenesis that each of the rt subunits contributes to the level of rnase h activity yet the contribution of the p  subunit to this activity is somewhat higher than that of the p  steady state kinetic analyses have indicated that the rnase h activity was reduced mainly due to the sharp increase in the km rather than changes in the kcat values this suggests that the modifications of c  lead to an impaired affinity of hiv  rt towards the rna  dna substrate
