assessment by molecular dynamics simulations of the structural determinants of dna binding specificity for transcription factor sp
the dna binding domain dbd of the ubiquituous transcription factor sp consists of three consecutive zinc fingers that recognize a number of nucleotide sequences different from but related to and sometimes overlapping those recognized by the structurally better characterized early growth response protein  egr  also known as zif   krox   and ngfi a  the accepted consensus binding sequence for sp is usually defined by the asymmetric hexanucleotide core gggcgg but this sequence does not include among others the gag  ctc repeat that constitutes a high affinity site for sp binding to the wt promoter since no d structure of the whole dbd of sp is available either alone or in complex with dna a homology based model was built and its interaction with two dna  mers was studied using nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of explicit water molecules these oligonucleotides represent sp target sites that are present in the promoters of the mdr and wt genes for comparative purposes and validation of the protocol the complex between the dbd of egr and its dna target site within the proximal mdr promoter was simulated under the same conditions some water molecules were seen to play an important role in recognition and stabilization of the protein  dna complexes our results which are supported by the available experimental evidence suggest that the accuracy in the prediction of putative sp binding sites can be improved by interpreting a set of rules which are a blend of both stringency and tolerance for the juxtaposed triplet subsites to which each zinc finger binds our approach can be extrapolated to wt and other related natural or artificial zinc finger containing dna binding proteins and may aid in the assignment of particular dna stretches as allowed or disallowed binding sites
