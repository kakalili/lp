the hmgb c terminal tail regulates dna bending
high mobility group box protein  hmgb  is an architectural protein that facilitates the formation of protein  dna assemblies involved in transcription recombination dna repair and chromatin remodeling important to its function is the ability of hmgb to bend dna non sequence specifically hmgb contains two hmg boxes that bind and bend dna the a box and the b box and a c terminal acidic tail we investigated how these domains contribute to dna bending by hmgb using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret  which enabled us to resolve heterogeneous populations of bent and unbent dna we found that full length fl hmgb bent dna more than the individual a and b boxes removing the c terminal tail resulted in a protein that bent dna to a greater extent than the fl protein these data suggest that the a and b boxes simultaneously bind dna in the absence of the c terminal tail but the tail modulates dna binding and bending by one of the hmg boxes in the fl protein indeed a construct composed of the b box and the c terminal tail only bent dna at higher protein concentrations moreover in the context of the fl protein mutating the a box such that it could not bend dna resulted in a protein that bent dna similar to a single hmg box and only at higher protein concentrations we propose a model in which the hmgb c terminal tail serves as an intramolecular damper that modulates the interaction of the b box with dna
