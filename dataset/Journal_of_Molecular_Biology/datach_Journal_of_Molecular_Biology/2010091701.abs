the unique binding mode of cellulosomal cbm from clostridium thermocellum cellobiohydrolase a
the crystal structure of the carbohydrate binding module cbm  ig fused domain from the cellulosomal cellulase cellobiohydrolase a cbha of clostridium thermocellum was solved in complex with cellobiose at     resolution this is the first cellulosomal cbm crystal structure reported to date it is similar to the previously solved noncellulosomal soluble oligosaccharide binding cbm structures however this new structure possesses a significant feature  a binding site peptide loop with a tryptophan trp   residing midway in the loop based on sequence alignment this structural feature might be common to all cellulosomal clostridial cbm modules our results indicate that c thermocellum cbha cbm also has an extended binding pocket that can optimally bind to cellodextrins containing five or more sugar units molecular dynamics simulations and experimental binding studies with the trp  ala mutant suggest that trp  contributes to the binding and possibly the orientation of the module to soluble cellodextrins furthermore the binding cleft aromatic residues trp  and tyr  play a crucial role in binding to bacterial microcrystalline cellulose bmcc  amorphous cellulose and soluble oligodextrins binding to bmcc is in disagreement with the structural features of the binding pocket which does not support binding to the flat surface of crystalline cellulose suggesting that cbm binds the amorphous part or the cellulose  whiskers  of bmcc we propose that clostridial cbm s have possibly evolved to bind the free chain ends of crystalline cellulose in addition to their ability to bind soluble cellodextrins
