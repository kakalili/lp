the peptidyl  prolyl isomerase and chaperone par  of bordetella pertussis as the prototype for a new group of parvulins
proteins that pass through the periplasm in an unfolded state are highly sensitive to proteolysis and aggregation and therefore often require protection by chaperone like proteins the periplasm of gram negative bacteria is well equipped with atp independent chaperones and folding catalysts including peptidyl  prolyl isomerases ppiases  the filamentous hemagglutinin of bordetella pertussis which is secreted by the two partner secretion pathway crosses the periplasm in an unfolded conformation by affinity chromatography we identified a new periplasmic ppiase of the parvulin family par  which binds to an unfolded filamentous hemagglutinin fragment par  differs from previously characterized bacterial and eukaryotic parvulins its central parvulin like domain is flanked by atypical n and c terminal extensions that are found in a number of putative ppiases present mostly in  proteobacteria par  displays both ppiase and chaperone activities in vitro in vivo par  might function as a general periplasmic chaperone in b pertussis
