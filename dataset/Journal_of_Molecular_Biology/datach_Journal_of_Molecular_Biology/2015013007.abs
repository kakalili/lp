the activity and stability of the intrinsically disordered cip kip protein family areregulated by non receptor tyrosinekinases
the cip kip family of cyclin dependent kinase cdk inhibitors includes p cip  p kip and p kip  their kinase inhibitory activities are mediated by a homologous n terminal kinaseinhibitory domain the cdk inhibitory activity and stability of p  have been shown to be regulated by a two step phosphorylation mechanism involving a tyrosine residue within the kinase inhibitory domain and a threonine residue within the flexible c terminus we show that these residues are conserved in p  and p  suggesting that a similar phosphorylation cascade regulates these cdk inhibitors however the presence of a cyclin binding motif within its c terminus alters the regulatory interplay between p  and cdk cyclin a as well as its responses to tyrosine phosphorylation and altered p  cdk cyclin a stoichiometry we also show that the cip kip proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro by representatives of many non receptor tyrosine kinase nrtk sub families suggesting that nrtks may generally regulate the activity and stability of these cdk inhibitors our results further suggest that the cip kip proteins integrate signals from various nrtk pathways and cell cycle regulation
