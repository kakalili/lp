innate immune response to arenaviral infection a focus on the highly pathogenic new world hemorrhagic arenaviruses
arenaviruses are enveloped negative stranded rna viruses that belong to the family arenaviridae this diverse family can be further classified into ow old world and nw new world arenaviruses based on their antigenicity phylogeny and geographical distribution many of the nw arenaviruses are highly pathogenic viruses that cause systemic human infections characterized by hemorrhagic fever and or neurological manifestations constituting public health problems in their endemic regions nw arenavirus infection induces a variety of host innate immune responses which could contribute to the viral pathogenesis and or influence the final outcome of virus infection in vitro and in vivo on the other hand nw arenaviruses have also developed several strategies to counteract the host innate immune response we will review current knowledge regarding the interplay between the host innate immune response and nw arenavirus infection in vitro and in vivo with emphasis on viral encoded proteins and their effect on the type i interferon response
