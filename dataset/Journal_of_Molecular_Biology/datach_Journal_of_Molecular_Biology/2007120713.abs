ultrastructural analysis of the nuclear localization sequences on influenza a ribonucleoprotein complexes
the influenza a genome consists of eight single stranded rna molecules each associated with an oligomeric core of the structural protein nucleoprotein to form a distinct viral ribonucleoprotein vrnp complex vrnps are the entities responsible for the transcription and replication of the influenza viral rnas in the nuclei of host cells thus nuclear targeting and localization of the vrnps are a critical step in the infection and life cycle of influenza a we have recently shown that the nuclear import of vrnps derived from influenza a virions is independently mediated by two nuclear localization sequences nlss on nucleoprotein nls  spanning residues    at the n terminus and nls  spanning residues      in the middle of the protein with nls being the principal mediator to better understand the structural basis for the differences in the ability of nls and that of nls to mediate nuclear import of influenza vrnps we analyzed the levels of surface exposure of these nlss on vrnps by both dot blotting and immunogold labeling of vrnps in their native state we found that nls is much more accessible to its corresponding antibody compared with nls  electron microscopy of immunogold labeled vrnps further showed that   of vrnps were labeled with one to six gold particles located throughout the vrnp for nls  in contrast less than   of vrnps were labeled with an antibody against nls  usually with a single gold particle located at one end of the vrnp in addition a regular periodicity of repeat was observed with gold particles labeling for nls  indicative of a highly regular helical conformation present in the vrnps these findings provide the underlying structural basis for the enhanced ability of nls in mediating nuclear import of influenza vrnps and add to our understanding of the ultrastructural features of vrnp complexes derived from influenza a virions
