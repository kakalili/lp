biochemical properties of single stranded dna binding protein from mycobacterium smegmatis a fast growing mycobacterium and its physical and functional interaction with uracil dna glycosylases
the single stranded dna binding proteins ssbs are vital to virtually all dna functions here we report on the biochemical properties of ssb from a fast growing mycobacteria mycobacterium smegmatis and the interaction of the homotetrameric ssbs with uracil dna glycosylases udgs from m smegmatis msm  mycobacterium tuberculosis mtu and escherichia coli eco  udg is a crucial dna repair enzyme which removes the promutagenic uracil residues msmssb stimulates activity of the homologous msmudg and of the heterologous mtu  and eco udgs on the contrary while the mtussb stimulates the mtuudg it inhibits the other two udgs although the msmssb shares   identity with mtussb the two are strikingly different in that msmssb contains a glycine rich segment   out of  residues in the spacer connecting the n terminal dna binding domain with the c terminal acidic tail while the dna binding properties of msmssb such as its affinity to oligomeric dna requirement of minimum size dna and the modes of interaction are indistinguishable from those of eco  and mtu ssbs it is unclear if the glycine rich segment confers structural advantage to msmssb responsible for its stimulatory effect on all udgs tested more importantly by using a small polypeptide inhibitor of udgs and the deletion mutants of ssbs we suggest that the c terminal acidic tail of the ssbs interacts within the dna binding groove of the udgs and propose a role for ssbs in the recruitment of udgs to the damaged dna
