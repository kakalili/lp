increased stability and lifetime of the complex formed between dna and meta phenyl substituted hoechst dyes as studied by fluorescence titrations and stopped flow kinetics edited by i tinoco
the large increase in fluorescence upon binding of five para and meta phenyl substituted hydroxy and methoxy derivatives of the hoechst dye with poly d a t  d cgcgaattcgcg  and its corresponding t looped  mer hairpin was used to monitor the binding by equilibrium titrations and by stopped flow kinetics the affinity increases in the same order for the three dnas p oh lt m och  p oh lt m oh lt m oh p och  lt bis m oh the association constants ka are three to  times larger for the aatt site than for poly d a t  the aatt site binds m oh hoechst with ka       m   and bis m oh hoechst with ka        m   which are seven and  times higher than p oh hoechst hoechst     respectively the high ka values determined at equilibrium agree with the kinetically defined association constants kkin  kon koff the association rate parameters kon were obtained by stopped flow kinetics and the dissociation rate parameters koff by dissociation kinetics using poly d a bru  for binding to the aatt site kon values are similar and nearly diffusion controlled       m   s   to      m   s    while koff values    s   to    s   depend on the phenyl substitution and determine the affinity at the aatt site the longest living complex is formed when the dye carries a bis m oh phenyl group that probably integrates in a hydrogen bonding network of water molecules with poly da  poly dt  poly d a t  and poly d a bru  kon between      m   s   and      m   s   depends on the dna
