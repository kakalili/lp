mechanism of pkr activation by dsrna
protein kinase r pkr is a central component of the interferon antiviral defense pathway upon binding double stranded rna dsrna  pkr undergoes autophosphorylation reactions that activate the kinase pkr then phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor   thus inhibiting protein synthesis in virally infected cells using a series of dsrnas of increasing length we define the mechanism of pkr activation a minimal dsrna of   bp is required to bind two pkr monomers and   bp is the smallest dsrna that elicits autophosphorylation activity thus the ability of dsrnas to function as pkr activators is correlated with binding of two or more pkr monomers sedimentation velocity data fit a model where pkr monomers sequentially attach to a single dsrna these results support an activation mechanism where the role of the dsrna is to bring two or more pkr monomers in close proximity to enhance dimerization via the kinase domain this model explains the inhibition observed at high dsrna concentrations and the strong dependence of maximum activation on dsrna binding affinity binding affinities increase dramatically upon reducing the salt concentration from   to   mm nacl and we observe that a second pkr can bind to the  bp dsrna nonspecific assembly of pkr on dsrna occurs stochastically without apparent cooperativity
