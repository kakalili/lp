an unusual mode of galactose recognition by a family  carbohydrate binding module
carbohydrate binding modules cbms are ancillary modules commonly associated with carbohydrate active enzymes cazymes that function to mediate the adherence of the parent enzyme to its carbohydrate substrates cbm family   cbm  is one of the most diverse cbm families whose members are commonly found in bacterial cazymes that modify eukaryotic glycans one such example is the putative  toxin cpgh a of the family  glycoside hydrolases which comprises an n terminal putative  n acetylglucosaminidase catalytic module and four tandem cbm s here we report a unique mode of galactose recognition by the first cbm  cbm   from cpgh a solution nmr based analyses of cpgh a cbm   indicate a divergent subset of residues located in ordered loops at the apex of the cbm conferring specificity for the galacto configured sugars galactose galnac and lacnac that differs from those of the canonical galactose binding cbm s this study showcases the impressive variability in ligand binding by this cbm family and offers insight into the growing role of these modules in the interaction of cazymes with eukaryotic glycans
