the three dimensional solution structure of nad  a new floral defensin from nicotiana alata and its application to a homology model of the crop defense protein alfafp
nmr spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations have been used to determine the three dimensional structure of nad  a novel antifungal and insecticidal protein isolated from the flowers of nicotiana alata nad is a basic cysteine rich protein of  residues and is the first example of a plant defensin from flowers to be characterized structurally its three dimensional structure consists of an  helix and a triple stranded antiparallel  sheet that are stabilized by four intramolecular disulfide bonds nad features all the characteristics of the cysteine stabilized   motif that has been described for a variety of proteins of differing functions ranging from antibacterial insect defensins and ion channel perturbing scorpion toxins to an elicitor of the sweet taste response the protein is biologically active against insect pests which makes it a potential candidate for use in crop protection nad shares   sequence identity with alfafp an antifungal protein from alfalfa that confers resistance to a fungal pathogen in transgenic potatoes the structure of nad was used to obtain a homology model of alfafp since nad has the highest level of sequence identity with alfafp of any structurally characterized antifungal defensin the structures of nad and alfafp were used in conjunction with structure  activity data for the radish defensin rs afp to provide an insight into structure  function relationships in particular a putative effector site was identified in the structure of nad and in the corresponding homology model of alfafp
