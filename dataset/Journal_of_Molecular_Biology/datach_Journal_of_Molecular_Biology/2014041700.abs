determination of the self association residues within a homomeric and a heteromeric aaa enhancer binding protein
the   dependent transcription in bacteria requires specific activator proteins bacterial enhancer binding protein bebp  members of the aaa  atpases associated with various cellular activities protein family the bebps usually form oligomers in order to hydrolyze atp and make open promoter complexes the bebp formed by hrpr and hrps activates transcription from the   dependent hrpl promoter responsible for triggering the type three secretion system in pseudomonas syringae pathovars unlike other bebps that usually act as homohexamers hrpr and hrps operate as a highly co dependent heterohexameric complex to understand the organization of the hrprs complex and the hrpr and hrps strict co dependence we have analyzed the interface between subunits using the random and directed mutagenesis and available crystal structures of several closely related bebps we identified key residues required for the self association of hrpr d  e  and k   with hrps d  e  and k   showed that the hrpr d  and hrps k  residues form interacting pairs directly involved in an hrpr  hrps association and that the change in side chain length at position   in hrps affects self association and interaction with the hrpr and demonstrated that the hrps d  e  and k  are not involved in negative regulation imposed by hrpv we established that the equivalent residues k  e  and e  in a homo oligomeric bebp pspf are required for the subunit communication and formation of an oligomeric lock that cooperates with the atp  phosphate sensing pspf residue r   providing insights into their roles in the heteromeric hrprs co complex
