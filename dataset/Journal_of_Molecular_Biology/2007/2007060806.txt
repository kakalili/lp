The bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is a key enzyme for the biosynthesis of sialic acids, the terminal sugars of glycoconjugates associated with a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as cell adhesion, development, inflammation and cancer. In this study, we characterized rat GNE by different biophysical methods, analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light-scattering and size-exclusion chromatography, all revealing the native hydrodynamic behavior and molar mass of the protein. We show that GNE is able to reversibly self-associate into different oligomeric states including monomers, dimers and tetramers. Additionally, it forms non-specific aggregates of high molecular mass, which cannot be unequivocally assigned a distinct size. Our results also indicate that ligands of the epimerase domain of the bifunctional enzyme, namely UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, stabilize the protein against aggregation and are capable of modulating the quaternary structure of the protein. The presence of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine strongly favors the tetrameric state, which therefore likely represents the active state of the enzyme in cells.
