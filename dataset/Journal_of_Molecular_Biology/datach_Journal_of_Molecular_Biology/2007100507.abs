quantification of the elevated rate of domain rearrangements in metazoa
most eukaryotic proteins consist of multiple domains created through gene fusions or internal duplications the most frequent change of a domain architecture da is insertion or deletion of a domain at the n or c terminus still the mechanisms underlying the evolution of multidomain proteins are not very well studied here we have studied the evolution of multidomain architectures mda  guided by evolutionary information in the form of a phylogenetic tree our results show that pfam domain families and mdas have been created with comparable rates     per million years my  the major changes in da evolution have occurred in the process of multicellularization and within the metazoan lineage in contrast creation of domains seems to have been frequent already in the early evolution furthermore most of the architectures have been created from older domains or architectures whereas novel domains are mainly found in single domain proteins however a particular group of exon bordering domains may have contributed to the rapid evolution of novel multidomain proteins in metazoan organisms finally mdas have evolved predominantly through insertions of domains whereas domain deletions are less common in conclusion the rate of creation of multidomain proteins has accelerated in the metazoan lineage which may partly be explained by the frequent insertion of exon bordering domains into new architectures however our results indicate that other factors have contributed as well
