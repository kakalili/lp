specificity of the traa  dna interaction in the regulation of the ppd encoded sex pheromone response in enterococcus faecalis
the enterococcus faecalis conjugative plasmid ppd encodes proteins responsible for the mating response to the sex pheromone cpd secreted by a recipient cell this response involves the respectively negative and positive determinants traa and trae the pheromone inhibitor determinant ipd and structural genes participating in the conjugation process traa is capable of binding to key sites within the regulatory gene cluster the binding of traa to cognate sites is modulated by the pheromone cpd  and the pheromone inhibitor ipd  peptides using atomic force microscopy and classic biochemical techniques we mapped and characterized the traa  dna interactions within the ppd regulatory gene cluster and the role of traa in the transcription regulation of the sex pheromone response a previous report showed that traa binds to three adjacent sites tab  tab and tab  located upstream of the ipd promoter region here we provide direct evidence for such interactions and show that traa alone or in the presence of ipd inhibits ipd transcription by preferentially binding to tab  whereas in the presence of saturating cpd  the overall binding to the tab sites decreases traa preferentially binds to tab and the ipd repression is relieved moreover traa alone or in the presence of ipd binds to two non adjacent sites within the ipd terminators t and t  an interaction that is also relieved in the presence of cpd  the binding of traa to the termination region of ipd may play an important role in controlling trae and traf expression via a transcriptional read through mechanism already postulated for the pad plasmid traa may also regulate its own expression by binding to a site in the proximity of the traa promoter which has been relocated   bp downstream of the ipd gene a model for the traa mediated regulation of the ppd encoded sex pheromone response is presented
