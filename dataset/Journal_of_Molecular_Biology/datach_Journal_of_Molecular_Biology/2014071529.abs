stable dna methylation boundaries and expanded trinucleotide repeats role of dna insertions
the human genome segment upstream of the fmr  fragile x mental retardation  gene xq   contains several genetic signals among them is a dna methylation boundary that is located     cpgs upstream of the cgg repeat in fragile x syndrome fxs  the boundary is lost and the promoter is inactivated by methylation spreading here we document boundary stability in spite of critical expansions of the cgg trinucleotide repeat in male or female premutation carriers and in high functioning males hfms  hfms carry a full cgg repeat expansion but exhibit an unmethylated promoter and lack the fxs phenotype the boundary is also stable in turner   x females a ctcf binding site is located slightly upstream of the methylation boundary and carries a unique g to a polymorphism single nucleotide polymorphism  which occurs   times more frequently in genomes with cgg expansions the increased frequency of this single nucleotide polymorphism might have functional significance in cgg expansions the ctcf region does not harbor additional mutations in fxs individuals and often in cells transgenomic for ebv epstein barr virus dna or for the telomerase gene the large number of normally methylated cpgs in the far upstream region of the boundary is decreased about  fold a methylation boundary is also present in the human genome segment upstream of the htt huntingtin promoter  p   and is stable both in normal and huntington disease chromosomes hence the vicinity of an expanded repeat does not per se compromise methylation boundaries methylation boundaries exert an important function as promoter safeguards
