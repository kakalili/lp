protein protein interaction revealed by nmr t relaxation experiments the lipoyl domain and e component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of bacillus stearothermophilus edited by p e wright
t relaxation experiments in combination with chemical shift and site directed mutagenesis data were used to identify sites involved in weak but specific protein protein interactions in the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of bacillus stearothermophilus the pyruvate decarboxylase component a heterotetramer e      is responsible for the first committed and irreversible catalytic step the accompanying reductive acetylation of the lipoyl group attached to the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase e  component involves weak transient but specific interactions between e and the lipoyl domain of the e polypeptide chain the interactions between the free lipoyl domain  kda and free e    kda  e    kda and intact e       kda components all the products of genes or sub genes over expressed in escherichia coli were investigated using heteronuclear d nmr spectroscopy the experiments were conducted with uniformly  n labeled lipoyl domain and unlabeled e components major contact points on the lipoyl domain were identified from changes in the backbone  n spin spin relaxation time in the presence and absence of e     or its individual e  or e  components although the e  subunit houses the sequence motif associated with the essential cofactor thiamin diphosphate recognition of the lipoyl domain was distributed over sites in both e  and e   a single point mutation n a on the lipoyl domain significantly reduces its ability to be reductively acetylated by the cognate e  none the less the n a mutant domain appears to interact with e similarly to the wild type domain this suggests that the lipoyl group of the n a lipoyl domain is not being presented to e in the correct orientation owing perhaps to slight perturbations in the lipoyl domain structure especially in the lipoyl lysine  turn region as indicated by chemical shift data interaction with e and subsequent reductive acetylation are not necessarily coupled
