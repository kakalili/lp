the role of dna binding specificity in the evolution of bacterial regulatory networks
understanding the mechanisms by which transcriptional regulatory networks trns change through evolution is a fundamental problem here we analyze this question using data from escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and find that paralogy relationships are insufficient to explain the global or local role observed for transcription factors tfs within regulatory networks our results provide a picture in which dna binding specificity a molecular property that can be measured in different ways is a predictor of the role of transcription factors in particular we observe that global regulators consistently display low levels of binding specificity while displaying comparatively higher expression values in microarray experiments in addition we find a strong negative correlation between binding specificity and the number of co regulators that help coordinate genetic expression on a genomic scale a close look at several orthologous tfs including fnr a regulator found to be global in e coli and local in b subtilis confirms the diagnostic value of specificity in order to understand their regulatory function and highlights the importance of evaluating the metabolic and ecological relevance of effectors as another variable in the evolutionary equation of regulatory networks finally a general model is presented that integrates some evolutionary forces and molecular properties aiming to explain how regulons grow and shrink as bacteria tune their regulation to increase adaptation
