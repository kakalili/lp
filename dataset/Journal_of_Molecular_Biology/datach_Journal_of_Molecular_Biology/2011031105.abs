tracing the detail how mutations affect binding modes and thermodynamic signatures of closely related aldose reductase inhibitors
improvements on the computational methods for affinity prediction from the structure of protein  ligand complexes require a better understanding of the nature of molecular interactions and biomolecular recognition principles in the present contribution the binding of two chemically closely related human aldose reductase inhibitors had been studied by high resolution x ray analysis          and isothermal titration calorimetry against a series of single site mutants of the wild type protein a crucial threonine thought to be involved in a short bromine to oxygen halogen bond to the inhibitors in the wild type has been mutated to the structurally similar residues alanine cysteine serine and valine overall structurally the binding mode of the inhibitors is conserved however small but significant geometrical adaptations are observed as a consequence of the spatial and electronic changes at the mutation site they involve the opening of a central bond angle and shifts in consequence of the lost or gained halogen bonds remarkably the tiny structural changes are responded by partly strong modulation of the thermodynamic profiles even though the free energy of binding is maximally perturbed by only  kj mol much stronger modulations and shifts in the enthalpy and entropy signatures are revealed which indicate a pronounced enthalpy entropy compensation however an explanatory correlation can be detected when facing these perturbances against the small structural changes this also provides deeper insights into how single site mutations can alter the selectivity profile of closely related ligands against a target protein
