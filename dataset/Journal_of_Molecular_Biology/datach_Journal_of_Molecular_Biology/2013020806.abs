targeted methylation and gene silencing of vegf a in human cells by using a designed dnmt a  dnmt l single chain fusion protein with increased dna methylation activity
the c terminal domain of the dnmt a de novo dna methyltransferase dnmt a c forms a complex with the c terminal domain of dnmt l which stimulates its catalytic activity we generated and characterized single chain sc fusion proteins of both these domains with linker lengths between  and  amino acid residues the purified sc proteins showed about  fold higher dna methylation activities than dnmt a c in vitro and were more active in bacterial cells as well after fusing the dnmt a l sc enzyme to an artificial zinc finger protein targeting the vascular endothelial cell growth factor a vegf a promoter we demonstrate successful targeting of dna methylation to the vegf a promoter in human cells and observed that almost complete methylation of  cpg sites in the gene promoter could be achieved targeted methylation by the dnmt a l sc enzymes was about twofold higher than that of dnmt a c indicating that dnmt a l sc variants are more efficient as catalytic modules in chimeric dna methyltransfeases than dnmt a c targeted methylation of the vegf a promoter with the dnmt a l sc variant led to a strong silencing of vegf a expression indicating that the artificial dna methylation of an endogenous promoter is a powerful strategy to achieve silencing of the corresponding gene in human cells
