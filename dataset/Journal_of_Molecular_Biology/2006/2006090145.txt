Yeast has proven to be a powerful system for investigation of chromatin structure. However, the extent to which yeast chromatin can serve as a model for mammalian chromatin is limited by the significant number of differences that have been reported. To further investigate the structural relationship between the two chromatins, we have performed a DNA topological analysis of pRSSVO, a 5889 base-pair plasmid that can replicate in either yeast or mammalian cells. When grown in mammalian cells, pRSSVO contains an average of 33 negative supercoils, consistent with one nucleosome per 181 bp. This is close to the measured nucleosome repeat length of 190 bp. However, when grown in yeast cells, pRSSVO contains an average of only 23 negative supercoils, which is indicative of only one nucleosome per 256 bp. This is dramatically different from the measured nucleosome repeat length of 165 bp. To account for these observations, we suggest that yeast chromatin is composed of relatively short ordered arrays of nucleosomes with a repeat of 165 bp, separated by substantial gaps, possibly corresponding to regulatory regions.
