puf acceleration of deadenylation in vivo can operate independently of ccr activity possibly involving effects on the pab  mrnp structure
the evolutionarily conserved puf proteins stimulate ccr mrna deadenylation through binding to   untranslated region sequences of specific mrna we have investigated the mechanisms by which puf in saccharomyces cerevisiae accelerates deadenylation of the cox  mrna puf was shown to affect pan deadenylation of the cox  mrna independent of the presence of ccr  suggesting that puf acts through a general mechanism to affect deadenylation similarly eif e the cap binding translation initiation factor known to control ccr deadenylation was shown to affect pan activity in vivo puf was found to be required for eif e effects on cox  deadenylation both eif e and puf effects on deadenylation were shown in turn to necessitate a functional poly a binding protein pab  in which removal of the rrm  rna recognition motif  domain of pab blocked both their effects on deadenylation while removal of the proline rich region p domain of pab substantially reduces ccr deadenylation at non puf controlled mrna and correspondingly blocked eif e effects on deadenylation puf essentially bypassed this p domain requirement these results indicate that the pab  mrnp structure is critical for puf action we also found that multiple components of the ccr  not deadenylase complex but not pan  interacted with puf  puf appears therefore both to act independently of ccr activity possibly through effects on pab  mrnp structure and to be capable of retaining the ccr  not complex
