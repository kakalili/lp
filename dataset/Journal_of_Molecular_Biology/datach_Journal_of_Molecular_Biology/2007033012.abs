the central cavity from the alpha alpha  barrel structure of anabaena sp ch n acetyl d glucosamine  epimerase contains two key histidine residues for reversible conversion
n acetyl d glucosamine  epimerase glcnac  epimerase catalyzes the reversible epimerization between n acetyl d glucosamine glcnac and n acetyl d mannosamine mannac  we report here the     resolution crystal structure of the glcnac  epimerase from anabaena sp ch  the structure demonstrates an     barrel fold which shows structural homology with porcine glcnac  epimerase as well as a number of glycoside hydrolase enzymes and other sugar metabolizing enzymes one side of the barrel structure consists of short loops involved in dimer interactions the other side of the barrel structure is comprised of long loops containing six short beta sheets which enclose a putative central active site pocket site directed mutagenesis of conserved residues near the n terminal region of the inner alpha helices shows that r  h   e   and h  are strictly required for activity e  and r  are also essential in catalysis based on the structure and kinetic analysis h  and h  may serve as the key active site acid base catalysts these results suggest that the alpha alpha  barrel represents a steady fold for presenting active site residues in a cleft at the n terminal ends of the inner alpha helices thus forming a fine tuned catalytic site in glcnac  epimerase
