structure of thiocyanate hydrolase a new nitrile hydratase family protein with a novel five coordinate cobalt iii center
thiocyanate hydrolase scnase of thiobacillus thioparus thi  is a cobalt iii containing enzyme catalyzing the degradation of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide and ammonia we determined the crystal structures of the apo and native scnases at a resolution of     scnases in both forms had a conserved hetero dodecameric structure       four    hetero trimers were structurally equivalent one    hetero trimer was composed of the core domain and the  n domain which was located at the center of the molecule and linked the hetero trimers with novel quaternary interfaces in both the apo and native scnases the core domain was structurally conserved between those of iron and cobalt types of nitrile hydratase nhase  native scnase possessed the post translationally modified cysteine ligands  cys  so h and  cys  soh like nhases however the low spin cobalt iii was found to be in the distorted square pyramidal geometry which had not been reported before in any protein the size as well as the electrostatic properties of the substrate binding pocket was totally different from nhases with respect to the charge distribution and the substrate accessibility which rationally explains the differences in the substrate preference between scnase and nhase
