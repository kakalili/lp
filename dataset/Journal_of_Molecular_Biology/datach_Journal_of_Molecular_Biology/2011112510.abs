interactions of interleukin  with the human chemokine receptor cxcr in phospholipid bilayers by nmr spectroscopy
cxcr is a receptor for the chemokine interleukin  il   a mediator of immune and inflammatory responses strategically located in the cell membrane cxcr binds to il  with high affinity and subsequently transduces a signal across the membrane bilayer to a g protein activated second messenger system here we describe nmr studies of the interactions between il  and human cxcr in lipid environments functional full length and truncated constructs of cxcr and full length il  were uniformly  n labeled by expression in bacteria followed by purification and refolding the residues responsible for interactions between il  and the n terminal domain of cxcr were identified by specific chemical shift perturbations of assigned resonances on both il  and cxcr  solution nmr signals from il  in q   isotropic bicelles disappeared completely when cxcr in lipid bilayers was added in a   molar ratio indicating that binding to the receptor containing bilayers immobilizes il  on the     hz timescale and broadens the signals beyond detection the same solution nmr signals from il  were less affected by the addition of n terminal truncated cxcr in lipid bilayers demonstrating that the n terminal domain of cxcr is mainly responsible for binding to il  the interaction is tight enough to immobilize il  along with the receptor in phospholipid bilayers and is specific enough to result in well aligned samples in oriented sample solid state nmr spectra a combination of solution nmr and solid state nmr studies of il  in the presence of various constructs of cxcr enables us to propose a model for the multistep binding process
