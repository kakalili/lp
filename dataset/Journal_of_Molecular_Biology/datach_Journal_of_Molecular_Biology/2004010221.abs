specific interaction of the antiapoptotic protein nr  with phospholipid monolayers is prevented by the bh domain of bax
members of the bcl  protein family regulate apoptosis by controlling the release of apoptogenic proteins such as cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space proapoptotic members induce release by increasing outer membrane permeability while antiapoptotic members prevent this the activity of bcl  proteins depends mostly on their insertion into the mitochondrial membrane which is reported to occur via putative channels formed by the two central hydrophobic helices the pro and antiapoptotic activity of bcl  proteins can also be modulated by heterodimerization between antagonists through the bh domain of proapoptotic members though the position of the heterodimer with respect to the membrane has never been elucidated in this work the membrane insertion capacity of the antiapoptotic bcl  related protein nr  was explored using monolayer expansion measurements nr  penetrates into the monolayer with a molecular cross section of     thereby implicating almost all  helical domains of the molecule in this process a mutant protein bearing neutral instead of acidic residues in the loop between the two putative channel forming fifth and sixth  helices retained the ability to interact with the lipid monolayer suggesting that the membrane insertion of nr  is not exclusively     dependent in contrast the specific interaction of nr  with the monolayer was prevented by heterodimer formation with the bh domain of proapoptotic bax these findings are discussed in terms of a model for monolayer insertion in which the antiapoptotic nr  and proapoptotic proteins exert their antagonistic effects by preventing each other from reaching the membrane
