Many small proteins fold fast and without detectable intermediates. This is frequently taken as evidence against the importance of partially folded states, which often transiently accumulate during folding of larger proteins. To get insight into the properties of free energy barriers in protein folding we analyzed experimental data from 23 proteins that were reported to show non-linear activation free-energy relationships. These non-linearities are generally interpreted in terms of broad transition barrier regions with a large number of energetically similar states. Our results argue against the presence of a single broad barrier region. They rather indicate that the non-linearities are caused by sequential folding pathways with consecutive distinct barriers and a few obligatory high-energy intermediates. In contrast to a broad barrier model the sequential model gives a consistent picture of the folding barriers for different variants of the same protein and when folding of a single protein is analyzed under different solvent conditions. The sequential model is also able to explain changes from linear to non-linear free energy relationships and from apparent two-state folding to folding through populated intermediates upon single point mutations or changes in the experimental conditions. These results suggest that the apparent discrepancy between two-state and multi-state folding originates in the relative stability of the intermediates, which argues for the importance of partially folded states in protein folding.
