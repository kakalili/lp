a novel allosteric mechanism on protein  dna interactions underlying the phosphorylation dependent regulation of ets target gene expressions
cooperative assemblies of transcription factors tfs on target gene enhancers coordinate cell proliferation fate specification and differentiation through precise and complicated transcriptional mechanisms chemical modifications such as phosphorylation of tfs induced by cell signaling further modulate the dynamic cooperativity of tfs in this study we found that various ets containing tf  dna complexes respond differently to calcium induced phosphorylation of ets  which is known to inhibit ets  dna binding crystallographic analysis of a complex comprising ets  runx  and cbf  at the tcr  enhancer revealed that ets acquires robust binding stability in the runx and dna complexed state via allosteric mechanisms this allows phosphorylated ets to be retained at the tcr  enhancer with runx  in contrast to other ets target gene enhancers including mb  and stromelysin  this study provides a structure based model for cell signaling dependent regulation of target genes mediated via chemical modification of tfs
