structural analysis of the human golgi associated plant pathogenesis related protein gapr  implicates dimerization as a regulatory mechanism
the plant pathogenesis related proteins group  pr  and a variety of related mammalian proteins constitute a pr  protein family that share sequence and structural similarities gapr  is a unique family member as thus far it is the only pr  family member that is not co translationally targeted to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum before trafficking to either vacuoles or secretion here we report that gapr  may form dimers in vitro and in vivo as determined by yeast two hybrid screening biochemical and biophysical assays the    crystal structure demonstrates that gapr  is structurally homologous to the other pr  family members previously solved p a and ves v   through an examination of inter molecular interactions between gapr  molecules in the crystal lattice we propose a number of the highly conserved amino acid residues of the pr  family to be involved in the regulation of dimer formation of gapr  with potential implications for other pr  family members we show that mutagenesis of these conserved amino acid residues leads to a greatly increased dimer population a recent report suggests that pr  family members may exhibit serine protease activity and further examination of the dimer interface of gapr  indicates that a catalytic triad similar to that of serine proteases may be formed across the dimer interface by residues from both molecules within the dimer
