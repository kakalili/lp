conservation and variation in superantigen structure and activity highlighted by the three dimensional structures of two new superantigens from streptococcus pyogenes edited by i a wilson
bacterial superantigens sags are a structurally related group of protein toxins secreted by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes they are implicated in a range of human pathologies associated with bacterial infection whose symptoms result from sag mediated stimulation of a large number      of t cells at the molecular level bacterial sags bind to major histocompatability class ii mhc ii molecules and disrupt the normal interaction between mhc ii and t cell receptors tcrs  we have determined high resolution crystal structures of two newly identified streptococcal superantigens spe h and smez  both structures conform to the generic bacterial superantigen folding pattern comprising an ob fold n terminal domain and a  grasp c terminal domain spe h and smez  also display very similar zinc binding sites on the outer concave surfaces of their c terminal domains structural comparisons with other sags identify two structural sub families sub families are related by conserved core residues and demarcated by variable binding surfaces for mhc ii and tcr smez  is most closely related to the streptococcal sag spe c and together they constitute one structural sub family in contrast spe h appears to be a hybrid whose n terminal domain is most closely related to the seb sub family and whose c terminal domain is most closely related to the spe c smez  sub family mhc ii binding for both spe h and smez  is mediated by the zinc ion at their c terminal face whereas the generic n terminal domain mhc ii binding site found on many sags appears not to be present structural comparisons provide evidence for variations in tcr binding between spe h smez  and other members of the sag family the extreme potency of smez  active at     g ml   levels is likely to be related to its tcr binding properties the smez gene shows allelic variation that maps onto a considerable proportion of the protein surface this allelic variation coupled with the varied binding modes of sags to mhc ii and tcr highlights the pressure on sags to avoid host immune defences
