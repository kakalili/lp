thermodynamics and folding kinetics analysis of the sh domain form discrete molecular dynamics
we perform a detailed analysis of the thermodynamics and folding kinetics of the sh domain fold with discrete molecular dynamic simulations we propose a protein model that reproduces some of the experimentally observed thermodynamic and folding kinetic properties of proteins specifically we use our model to study the transition state ensemble of the sh fold family of proteins a set of unstable conformations that fold to the protein native state with probability   we analyze the participation of each secondary structure element formed at the transition state ensemble we also identify the folding nucleus of the sh fold and test extensively its importance for folding kinetics we predict that a set of amino acid contacts between the rt loop and the distal hairpin are the critical folding nucleus of the sh fold and propose a hypothesis that explains this result
