homotypic interaction and amino acid distribution of unilaterally conserved transmembrane helices
formation of non covalent functional complexes of integral membrane proteins is frequently supported by sequence specific interaction of their transmembrane helices here we aligned human single span membrane proteins with orthologs from other eukaryotes we find that almost half of the human single span membrane proteins contain a transmembrane helix that exhibits significant non random unilateral conservation furthermore unilateral conservation of transmembrane domains tmds correlates well with their ability to self interact glycine polar non ionizable and aromatic amino acids are overrepresented in conserved versus non conserved helix faces hence our genome wide analysis indicates that these amino acid types generally support interaction of single span membrane protein tmds
