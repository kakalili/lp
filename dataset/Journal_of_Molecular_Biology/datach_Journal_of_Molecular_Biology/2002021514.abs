the sh domain of nebulin binds selectively to type ii peptides theoretical prediction and experimental validation edited by j thornton
nebulin a giant modular protein from muscle is thought to act as a molecular ruler in sarcomere assembly the c terminus of nebulin located in the sarcomere z disk comprises an sh domain a module well known for its r le in protein protein interactions sh domains are known to recognize proline rich ligands which have been classified as type i or type ii depending on their relative orientation with respect to the sh domain in the complex formed type i ligands are bound with their n terminus at the rt loop of the sh domain while type ii ligands are bound with their c terminus at the rt loop many sh domains can bind peptides of either class despite the potential importance of the sh domain for the function of nebulin as an integral part of a complex network of interactions no in vivo partner has been identified so far we have adopted an integrated approach which combines bioinformatic tools with experimental validation to identify possible partners of nebulin sh  using the program spot we performed an exhaustive screening of the muscle sequence databases this search identified a number of potential nebulin sh partners which were then tested experimentally for their binding affinity synthetic peptides were studied by both fluorescence and nmr spectroscopy our results show that nebulin sh domain binds selectively to type ii peptides the affinity for a type ii peptide   residues long spanning the sequence of a stretch of titin known to colocalise with nebulin in the z disk is in the submicromolar range    m  this affinity is among the highest found for sh peptide complexes suggesting that the identified stretch could have significance in vivo the strategy outlined here is of more general applicability and may provide a valuable tool to identify potential partners of sh domains and of other peptide binding modules
