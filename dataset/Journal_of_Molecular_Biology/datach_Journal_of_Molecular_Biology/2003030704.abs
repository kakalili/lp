dna polymerase x of african swine fever virus insertion fidelity on gapped dna substrates and ap lyase activity support a role in base excision repair of viral dna
dna polymerase x pol x from african swine fever virus asfv is the smallest naturally ocurring dna directed dna polymerase   amino acid residues described so far previous biochemical analysis has shown that asfv pol x is a highly distributive monomeric enzyme lacking a proofreading       exonuclease also asfv pol x binds intermediates of the single nucleotide base excision repair ber process and is able to efficiently repair single nucleotide gapped dna in this work we perform an extensive kinetic analysis of single correct and incorrect nucleotide insertions by asfv pol x using different dna substrates  i a primer template dna  ii a nt gapped dna  iii a   phosphorylated nt gapped dna the results obtained indicate that asfv pol x exhibits a general preference for insertion of purine deoxynucleotides especially dgtp opposite template c moreover asfv pol x shows higher catalytic efficiencies when filling in gapped substrates which are increased when a phosphate group is present at the   margin of the gap interestingly asfv pol x misinserts nucleotides with frequencies from    to     and the insertion fidelity varies depending on the substrate being more faithful on a phosphorylated nt gapped substrate we have analyzed the capacity of asfv pol x to act on intermediates of ber repair although no lyase activity could be detected on preincised   deoxyribose phosphate termini asfv pol x has lyase activity on unincised abasic sites altogether the results support a role for asfv pol x in reparative ber of damaged viral dna during asfv infection
