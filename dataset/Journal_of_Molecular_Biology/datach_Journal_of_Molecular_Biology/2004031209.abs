excision of incorporated nucleotide analogue chain terminators can diminish their inhibitory effects on viral rna dependent rna polymerases
bovine viral diarrhea virus bvdv is amongst the best characterized members of the flaviviridae that includes the hepatitis c virus hcv  the virally encoded rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp plays a crucial role during replication and therefore represents an important target for the development of antiviral drugs here we studied biochemical mechanisms associated with the inhibition of bvdv rna synthesis by   hydroxyl    deoxynucleoside triphosphates    dntps  all four nucleotide analogues are effectively incorporated and act as chain terminators however relatively low physiologically relevant concentrations of pyrophosphate ppi are sufficient to drive the reaction backwards which results in primer unblocking and rescue of rna synthesis metal ion requirements for nucleotide incorporation and pyrophosphorolysis are similar the efficiency of both reactions is higher with mn  as compared to mg  complexes containing chain terminated primer strands are stable in the presence of heparin which increases the probability that pyrophosphorolysis occurs before the enzyme can dissociate from its nucleic acid substrate in contrast to the reverse transcriptase of the human immunodeficiency virus type  hiv  rt  the bvdv rdrp may not recruit ntp pools as ppi donors conversely we found that the efficiency of primer unblocking is severely compromised in the presence of increasing concentrations of the ntp that is complementary to the next template position these data suggest that the incoming ntp can access its designated binding site which in turn prevents the catalytically competent complexation of ppi the results of this study provide novel insights into mechanisms involved in pyrophosphorolysis associated with viral rdrps and suggest that the excision reaction is likely to be an important parameter that can affect susceptibility to nucleotide analogue inhibitors directed against viral rdrps
