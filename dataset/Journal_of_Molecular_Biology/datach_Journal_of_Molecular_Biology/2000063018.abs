the spacing between functional cis elements of u snorna is critical for rrna processing edited by d e draper
the sequences and structural features of xenopus laevis u small nucleolar rna snorna necessary for pre rrna cleavage at sites  and  to form  s rrna were assayed by depletion rescue experiments in xenopus oocytes mutagenesis results demonstrated that the putative stem of u domain i is unnecessary for  s rrna processing a model consistent with earlier experimental data is proposed for the structure of domain i when u is not yet bound to pre rrna for its function in rrna processing a newly discovered element    hinge was revealed to be important but not as critical as the   hinge region in xenopus u snorna for  s rrna formation base pairing is proposed to occur between the u    hinge and   hinge and complementary regions in the external transcribed spacer ets  these interactions are phylogenetically conserved and are homologous to those previously described in yeast    hinge ets and trypanosomes    hinge ets  a model is presented where the base pairing of the   hinge and   hinge of u snorna with the ets of pre rrna helps to correctly position u boxes a   a for their function in rrna processing like an earlier proposal for yeast boxes a  and a of xenopus may base pair with  s sequences in pre rrna we present the first direct experimental evidence in any system that box a  is essential for u snorna function in  s rrna formation the analysis of insertions and deletions indicated that the spacing between the u elements is important suggesting that they base pair with the ets and  s regions of pre rrna at the same time
