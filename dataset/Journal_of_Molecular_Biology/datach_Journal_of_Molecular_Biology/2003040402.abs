pka dependent binding of mrna to the mitochondrial akap  protein
protein kinase a pka anchoring proteins akaps tether pka to various subcellular locations akap   which tethers pkaii to the outer mitochondrial membrane includes a k homology kh rna binding motif purified akap  kh domain binds the   untranslated regions   utrs of transcripts encoding the fo f subunit of mitochondrial atp synthase and manganese superoxide dismutase mnsod  binding requires a structural motif in the   utr and is stimulated by pka phosphorylation of the domain or a mutation that mimics this phosphorylation akap  expressed in hela cells promotes the translocation of mnsod mrna from cytosol to mitochondria and an increase in mitochondrial mnsod both reactions are stimulated by camp thus by focusing translation at the mitochondrial membrane akap  may facilitate import of mitochondrial proteins in response to camp stimulation
