cellular architecture of treponema pallidum novel flagellum periplasmic cone and cell envelope as revealed by cryo electron tomography
high resolution cryo electron tomography cryo et was utilized to visualize treponema pallidum the causative agent of syphilis at the molecular level three dimensional  d reconstructions from   infectious organisms revealed unprecedented cellular structures of this unusual member of the spirochetal family high resolution cryo et reconstructions provided detailed structures of the cell envelope which is significantly different from that of gram negative bacteria the  nm lipid bilayer of both outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane resolved in d reconstructions providing an important marker for interpreting membrane associated structures abundant lipoproteins cover the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane in contrast to the rare outer membrane proteins visible by scanning probe microscopy high resolution cryo et images also provided the first observation of t pallidum chemoreceptor arrays as well as structural details of the periplasmically located cone shaped structure at both ends of the bacterium furthermore  d subvolume averages of periplasmic flagellar motors and flagellar filaments from living organisms revealed the novel flagellar architectures that may facilitate their rotation within the confining periplasmic space our findings provide the most detailed structural understanding of periplasmic flagella and the surrounding cell envelope which enable this enigmatic bacterium to efficiently penetrate tissue and to escape host immune responses
