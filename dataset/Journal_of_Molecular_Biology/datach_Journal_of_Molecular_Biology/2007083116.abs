mutation of conserved charged residues in mitochondrial tim  subunits precludes tim  complex assembly but does not abolish growth of yeast cells
the saccharomyces cerevisiae tim  complex tim c is an atp independent chaperone of the mitochondrial intermembrane space involved in transport of polytopic membrane proteins the complex is an    hexamer of tim and tim  subunits we have generated specific mutations in charged residues in the central core domain of each subunit delineated by the characteristic twin cx c motif and investigated the effect of these mutations on subunit folding complex assembly and tim  function in vitro and in vivo any combination of mutations that included a specific glutamate residue conserved in all known tim and tim  sequences abolished assembly of the tim  complex in vivo complementation analyses using a met tim  strain that is selectively inactivated for the expression of wild type tim  showed that i an n terminal deleted version of tim  that was previously shown to be defective in substrate binding is lethal under all conditions but ii the charged residues mutant of tim  that is defective in assembly with tim can restore growth in glucose but not in non fermentable carbon sources these data suggest that formation of the hexamer is beneficial but not vital for tim  function whilst the n terminal substrate binding region of tim  is essential in vivo
