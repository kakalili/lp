novel interactions between the components of human and yeast tfiia tbp dna complexes
rna polymerase ii dependent transcription requires the assembly of a multi protein preinitiation complex on core promoter elements transcription factor iid tfiid comprising the tata box binding protein tbp and tbp associated factors tafs is responsible for promoter recognition in this complex subsequent association of tfiia and tfiib provides enhanced complex stability tfiia is required for transcriptional stimulation by certain viral and cellular activators and favors formation of the preinitiation complex in the presence of repressor nc  the x ray structures of human and yeast tbp tfiia dna complexes at    and    resolution respectively are presented here and seen to resemble each other closely the interactions made by human tfiia with tbp and dna within and upstream of the tata box including those involving water molecules are described and compared to the yeast structure of particular interest is a previously unobserved region of tfiia that extends the binding interface with tbp in the yeast but not in the human complex and that further elucidates biochemical and genetic results
