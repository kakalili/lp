structure dynamics and folding of an immunoglobulin domain of the gelation factor abp   from dictyostelium discoideum
we have carried out a detailed structural and dynamical characterisation of the isolated fifth repeat of the gelation factor abp   from dictyostelium discoideum ddfln  by nmr spectroscopy to provide a basis for studies of co translational folding on the ribosome of this immunoglobulin like domain the isolated ddfln can fold autonomously in solution into a structure that resembles very closely the crystal structure of the domain in a construct in which the adjacent sixth repeat ddfln  is covalently linked to its c terminus in tandem but deviates locally from a second crystal structure in which ddfln is flanked by ddfln and ddfln at both n and c termini conformational fluctuations were observed via  n relaxation methods and are primarily localised in the interstrand loops that encompass the c terminal hemisphere these fluctuations are distinct in location from the region where line broadening is observed in ddfln when attached to the ribosome as part of a nascent chain this observation supports the conclusion that the broadening is associated with interactions with the ribosome surface hsu s t d  fucini p  cabrita l d  launay h  dobson c m  amp christodoulou j     structure and dynamics of a ribosome bound nascent chain by nmr spectroscopy proc natl acad sci usa            the unfolding of ddfln induced by high concentrations of urea shows a low population of a folding intermediate as inferred from an intensity based analysis a finding that differs from that of ddfln as a ribosome bound nascent chain these results suggest that interesting differences in detail may exist between the structure of the domain in isolation and when linked to the ribosome and between protein folding in vitro and the folding of a nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome
