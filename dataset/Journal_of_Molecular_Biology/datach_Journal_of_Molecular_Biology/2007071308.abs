mutations in capsid major homology region affect assembly and membrane affinity of hiv  gag
we introduced mutations into the hiv  major homology region mhr capsids      and adjacent c terminal region to analyze their effects on virus like particle vlp assembly membrane affinity and the multimerization of the gag structural protein results indicate that alanine substitutions at k   f  or e  significantly diminished vlp production all assembly defective gag mutants had markedly reduced membrane binding capacities but results from a velocity sedimentation analysis suggest that most of the membrane bound gag proteins were present primarily in a higher order multimerized form the membrane binding capacity of the k  a f  a and e  a gag proteins increased sharply upon removal of the ma globular domain while demonstrating improved multimerization capability the two ma deleted versions of f  a and e  a did not show marked improvement in vlp production presumably due to a defect in association with the raft like membrane domain however k  a bound to detergent resistant raft like membrane this was accompanied by noticeably improved vlp production following ma removal our results suggest that the hiv  mhr and adjacent downstream region facilitate multimerization and tight gag packing enhanced gag multimerization may help expose the membrane binding domain and thus improve gag membrane binding thereby promoting gag multimerization into higher order assembly products
