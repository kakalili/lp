intrinsic disorder in cell signaling and cancer associated proteins
the number of intrinsically disordered proteins known to be involved in cell signaling and regulation is growing rapidly to test for a generalized involvement of intrinsic disorder in signaling and cancer we applied a neural network predictor of natural disordered regions pondr vl xt to four protein datasets human cancer associated proteins hcap  signaling proteins afcs  eukaryotic proteins from swiss prot eu sw and non homologous protein segments with well defined ordered  d structure o pdb s   pondr vl xt predicts    consecutive disordered residues for               and     of the proteins from hcap afcs eu sw and o pdb s  respectively indicating significantly more intrinsic disorder in cancer associated and signaling proteins as compared to the two control sets the disorder analysis was extended to  additional functionally diverse categories of human proteins from swiss prot the proteins involved in metabolism biosynthesis and degradation together with kinases inhibitors transport g protein coupled receptors and membrane proteins are predicted to have at least twofold less disorder than regulatory cancer associated and cytoskeletal proteins in contrast to    of the proteins from representative non membrane categories just    of the cancer associated proteins had sequence alignments with structures in the protein data bank covering at least   of their lengths this relative lack of structural information correlated with the greater amount of predicted disorder in the hcap dataset a comparison of disorder predictions with the experimental structural data for a subset of the hcap proteins indicated good agreement between prediction and observation our data suggest that intrinsically unstructured proteins play key roles in cell signaling regulation and cancer where coupled folding and binding is a common mechanism
