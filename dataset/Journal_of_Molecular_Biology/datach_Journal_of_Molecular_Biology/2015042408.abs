structure of an apc  apc  complex insights into assembly of the anaphase promoting complex cyclosome
the anaphase promoting complex cyclosome apc c is a massive e ligase that controls mitosis by catalyzing ubiquitination of key cell cycle regulatory proteins the apc c assembly contains two subcomplexes the  platform  centers around a cullin ring like e ligase catalytic core the  arc lamp  is a hub that mediates transient association with regulators and ubiquitination substrates the arc lamp contains the small subunits apc  cdc  and apc  and tetratricopeptide repeat tpr proteins apc  apc  apc  and apc  that homodimerize and stack with quasi  fold symmetry within the apc c complex apc serves as center for regulation apc s tpr motifs recruit substrate binding coactivators cdc  and cdh  via their c terminal conserved ile arg ir tail sequences human apc also binds apc  and apc and contains a gt   residue loop that is heavily phosphorylated during mitosis although the basis for apc interactions and whether loop phosphorylation is required for ubiquitination are unclear here we map the basis for human apc assembly with apc  and apc  report crystal structures of apc  loop alone and in complex with the c terminal domain of apc  and test roles of apc s loop and ir tail binding surfaces in apc c catalyzed ubiquitination the structures show how one apc  binds asymmetrically to the symmetric apc dimer and together with biochemistry and prior data explain how apc  recruits apc to apc  show how apc s c terminal domain is rearranged in the full apc c assembly and visualize residues in the ir tail binding cleft important for coactivator dependent ubiquitination overall the results provide insights into assembly regulation and interactions of tpr proteins and the apc c
