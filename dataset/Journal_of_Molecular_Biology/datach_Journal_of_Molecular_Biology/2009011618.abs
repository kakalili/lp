in silico vaccine design based on molecular simulations of rhinovirus chimeras presenting hiv  gp  epitopes
a cluster of promising epitopes for the development of human immunodeficiency virus hiv vaccines is located in the membrane proximal external region mper of the gp  subunit of the hiv envelope spike structure the crystal structure of the peptide corresponding to the so called eldkwa epitope hiv  hxb gp  residues       in complex with the corresponding broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody f  provides a target for structure based vaccine design strategies aimed at finding macromolecular carriers that are able to present this mper derived epitope with optimal antigenic activity to this end a series of replica exchange molecular dynamics computer simulations was conducted to characterize the distributions of conformations of eldkwa based epitopes inserted into a rhinovirus carrier and to identify those with the highest fraction of conformations that are able to bind f  the length hydrophobic character and precise site of insertion were found to be critical for achieving structural similarity to the target crystal structure a construct with a high degree of complementarity to the corresponding determinant region of f was obtained this construct was employed to build a high resolution structural model of the complex between the f antibody and the chimeric human rhinovirus type  hiv  eldkwa virus particle additional simulations which were conducted to study the conformational propensities of the eldkwa region in solution confirm the hypothesis that the eldkwa region of gp  is highly flexible and capable of assuming helical conformations as in the postfusion helical bundle structure and  turn conformations as in the complex with the f antibody  these results also suggest that the eldkwa epitope can be involved in intramolecular  and likely intermolecular  hydrophobic interactions this tendency offers an explanation for the observation that mutations decreasing the hydrophobic character of the mper in many cases result in conformational changes that increase the affinity of this region for the f antibody
