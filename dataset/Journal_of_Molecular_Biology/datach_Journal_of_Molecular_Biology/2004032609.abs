substrate and metal complexes of  deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate synthase from saccharomyces cerevisiae provide new insights into the catalytic mechanism
deoxy d arabino heptulosonate  phosphate dahp synthases are metal dependent enzymes that catalyse the first committed step in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in microorganisms and plants the condensation of  phophoenolpyruvate pep and d erythrose  phosphate e p to dahp the dahp synthases are possible targets for fungicides and represent a model system for feedback regulation in metabolic pathways to gain further insight into the role of the metal ion and the catalytic mechanism in general the crystal structures of several complexes between the tyrosine regulated form of dahp synthase from saccharomyces cerevisiae and different metal ions and ligands have been determined the crystal structures provide evidence that the simultaneous presence of a metal ion and pep result in an ordering of the protein into a conformation that is prepared for binding the second substrate e p the site and binding mode of e p was derived from the    resolution crystal structure of dahp synthase in complex with pep co  and the e p analogue glyceraldehyde  phosphate our data suggest that the oxygen atom of the reactive carbonyl group of e p replaces a water molecule coordinated to the metal ion strongly favouring a reaction mechanism where the initial step is a nucleophilic attack of the double bond of pep on the metal activated carbonyl group of e p mutagenesis experiments substituting specific amino acids coordinating pep the divalent metal ion or the second substrate e p result in stable but inactive aro p derivatives and show the importance of these residues for the catalytic mechanism
