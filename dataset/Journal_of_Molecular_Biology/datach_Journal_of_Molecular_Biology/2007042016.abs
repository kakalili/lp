forces controlling the rate of dna ejection from phage
the goal of this work was to investigate how internal and external forces acting on dna affect the rate of genome ejection from bacteriophage  after the ejection is triggered in vitro by a  receptor the rate of ejection was measured with time resolved static and dynamic light scattering while varying such parameters as temperature and packaged dna length as well as adding dna binding proteins to the host solution we found that temperature has a strong effect on the ejection rate with an exponential increase of the initial ejection rate as a function of temperature this can possibly be explained by the temperature induced conformational changes in the tail pore forming proteins where the  open  conformation dominates over  closed   at elevated temperatures the dna length also had an effect on initial ejection rate with a nearly linear dependence comparing the three different genomes       and    kb dna  with faster ejection rate for longer genomes since the initial rate of ejection increases in an almost direct relationship with the length of the genome the total time needed to eject dna completely appeared to be nearly constant for all three dna length phage mutants the increased initial rate of ejection with increasing dna length is due to the increased dna bending and inter strand repulsion forces for the longer dna chains finally we also show that addition of non specific dna binding proteins hu and dnase i increases the rate of ejection by exerting additional  pulling  forces on the dna that is being ejected
