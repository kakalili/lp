a pocket on the surface of the n terminal brct domain of mcph is required to prevent abnormal chromosome condensation
mcph is mutated in autosomal recessive primary microcephaly and premature chromosome condensation pcc syndrome increased chromosome condensation is a common feature of cells isolated from patients afflicted with either disease normal cells depleted of mcph also exhibit pcc phenotype human mcph contains three brca carboxyl terminal brct domains the first of which mcph n is necessary for the prevention of pcc the only known disease associated missense mutation in mcph resides in this domain t r  we have determined the x ray crystal structure of human mcph n to    resolution compared with other brct domain structures the most striking differences are an elongated ordered      loop and an adjacent hydrophobic pocket this pocket is in the equivalent structural position to the phosphate binding site of brct domains that recognize phospho proteins although the phosphate binding residues are absent in mcph n mutations in the pocket abrogate the ability of full length mcph to rescue the pcc phenotype of mcph     mouse embryonic fibroblast cells suggesting that it forms an essential part of a protein  protein interaction site necessary to prevent pcc
