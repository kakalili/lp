the filamentous phages fd and if use different mechanisms to infect escherichia coli
the filamentous phage fd uses its gene  protein g p to target escherichia coli cells in a two step process first the n domain of g p attaches to an f pilus and then the n domain binds to tola c n and n are tightly associated rendering the phage robust but noninfectious because the binding site for tola c is buried at the domain interface binding of n to the f pilus initiates partial unfolding domain disassembly and prolyl cis to trans isomerization in the hinge between n and n  this activates the phage and trans pro  maintains this state long enough for n to reach tola c phage if targets i pili and its g p contains also an n domain and an n domain the pilus binding n domains of the phages if and fd are unrelated and the n domains share a   sequence identity we show that n of phage if mediates binding to the i pilus and that n targets tola crystallographic and nmr analyses of the complex between n and tola c indicate that phage if interacts with the same site on tola c as phage fd in if g p n and n are independently folding units however and the tola binding site on n is permanently accessible activation by unfolding and prolyl isomerization as in the case of phage fd is not observed in if g p the absence of stabilizing domain interactions is compensated for by a strong increase in the stabilities of the individual domains apparently these closely related filamentous phages evolved different mechanisms to reconcile robustness with high infectivity
