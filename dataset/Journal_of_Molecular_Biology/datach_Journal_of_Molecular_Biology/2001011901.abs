a kinetic folding intermediate probed by native state hydrogen exchange edited by a r fersht
stopped flow fluorescence studies on the n terminal domain of rat cd  cd d  have demonstrated that folding from the fully denatured state u proceeds via the transient accumulation of an apparent intermediate i in a so called burst phase that precedes the rate limiting transition leading to the native state n  a previous ph dependent equilibrium hydrogen exchange hx study identified a subset of amides in cd d which under ex conditions exchange from n with free energies greater than or equal to the free energy difference between the n and i states calculated from the stopped flow data under ex conditions the rates of hx for these amides tend towards an asymptote that matches the global unfolding rate calculated from the stopped flow data suggesting that exchange for these amides requires traversing the n to i transition state barrier exchange for these amides presumably occurs from exchange competent forms comprising the kinetic burst phase therefore to explore this idea further native state hx nhx data have been collected for cd d under ex conditions using denaturant concentrations which span either side of the denaturant concentration where according to the stopped flow data the apparent u and i states are iso energetic the data fit to a two component sub global sg global g nhx mechanism yielding  g and m value parameters where the m value is a measure of hydrocarbon solvation  regression analysis demonstrates that the msg  gsg and mg  gg values calculated for this subset of amides correspond with those describing the kinetic burst phase transition this result confirms the ability of the nhx technique to explore the structural and energetic properties of kinetic folding intermediates
