role of the n and c terminal strands of beta  microglobulin in amyloid formation at neutral ph
beta  microglobulin   m is known to form amyloid fibrils de novo in vitro under acidic conditions below ph    fibril formation at neutral ph however has only been observed by deletion of the n terminal six residues by the addition of pre assembled seeds or in the presence of cu  based on these observations and other structural data models for fibril formation of  m have been proposed that involve the fraying of the n and c terminal  strands and the consequent loss of edge strand protective features here we examine the role of the n and c terminal strands in the initiation of fibrillogenesis of  m by creating point mutations in strands a and g and comparing the properties of the resulting proteins with variants containing similar mutations elsewhere in the protein we show that truncation of buried hydrophobic side chains in strands a and g promotes rapid fibril formation at neutral ph even in unseeded reactions and increases the rate of fibril formation under acidic conditions by contrast similar mutations created in the remaining seven  strands of the native protein have little effect on the rate or ph dependence of fibril formation the data are consistent with the view that perturbation of the n and c terminal edge strands is an important feature in the generation of assembly competent states of  m
