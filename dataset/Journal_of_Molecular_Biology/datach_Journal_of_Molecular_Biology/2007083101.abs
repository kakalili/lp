alternative conformations of the archaeal nop   fibrillarin complex imply flexibility in box c d rnps
the nop    fibrillarin heterocomplex is a core protein complex of the box c d ribonucleoprotein particles that modify and process ribosomal rnas the previous crystal structure of the archaeoglobus fulgidus complex revealed a symmetric dimer of two nop    fibrillarin complexes linked by the coiled coil domains of the nop   proteins however because the a fulgidus nop   protein lacks some domains found in most other species it was thought that the bipartite architecture of the heterocomplex was not likely a general phenomenon here we report the crystal structure of the nop    fibrillarin complex bound with methylation cofactor s adenosyl l methionine from pyrococcus furiosus at     the new complex confirms the generality of the previously observed bipartite arrangement in addition however the conformation of nop   in the new structure differs substantially from that in the earlier structure the distinct conformations of nop   suggest potential flexibility in nop    computational normal mode analysis supports this view importantly fibrillarin is repositioned within the two complexes we propose that hinge motion within nop   has important implications for the possibility of simultaneously positioning two catalytic sites at the two target sites of a bipartite box c d guide rna
