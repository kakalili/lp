the conformations of polypeptide chains where the main chain parts of successive residues are enantiomeric their occurrence in cation and anion binding regions of proteins edited by j thornton
we have investigated the shapes of polypeptides where successive residues have main chain    conformations of opposite hand a graph not unlike a ramachandran plot is presented illustrating the various possible conformations all are ring shaped or extended some of these conformations occur in native proteins the commonest approximating to a feature we propose calling a nest described in the accompanying paper where the main chain nh groups point inwards relative to the ring and give rise to an anion binding site another conformation is related but more extended and is found uniquely in the four stretches of polypeptide that line the tetrameric k channel their co groups bind the k ions in the channel in a different ring shaped conformation that we propose calling a catgrip the main chain co groups point into the ring this is employed for specific ca ion binding in the annexin phospholipase a and subtilisin loops and the regularly arranged  roll loops of the serralysin protease family
