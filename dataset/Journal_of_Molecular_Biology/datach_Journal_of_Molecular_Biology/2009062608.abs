genetically derepressed nucleoplasmic stellate protein in spermatocytes of d melanogaster interacts with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase  and carries histone like lysine methylated mark
summarythe x chromosome linked clusters of the tandemly repeated testis specific stellate genes of drosophila melanogaster encoding proteins homologous to the regulatory  subunit of the protein kinase casein kinase  ck  are repressed in wild type males derepression of stellate genes in the absence of the y chromosome or y linked crystal locus crystal line causes accumulation of abundant protein crystals in testes and different meiotic abnormalities which lead to partial or complete male sterility to understand the cause of abnormalities in chromosome behavior owing to stellate overexpression we studied subcellular localization of stellate proteins by biochemical fractionation and immunostaining of whole testes we showed that apart from the known accumulation of stellate in crystalline form soluble stellate was located exclusively in the nucleoplasm whereas stellate crystals were located mainly in the cytoplasm coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the  subunit of the protein kinase ck  ck   was associated with soluble stellate interaction between soluble stellate and ck  in the nucleus could lead to modulations in the phosphorylation of nuclear targets of ck and abnormalities in the meiotic segregation of chromosomes we also observed that stellate underwent lysine methylation and mimicked trimethyl h k epigenetic modification of histone h tail
