direct probing of rna structure and rna protein interactions in purified hela cell  s and yeast spliceosomal u u u tri snrnp particles edited by j doudna
the u u u tri snrnp is a key component of spliceosomes by using chemical reagents and rnases we performed the first extensive experimental analysis of the structure and accessibility of u and u snrnas in tri snrnps these were purified from hela cell nuclear extract and saccharomyces cerevisiae cellular extract u accessibility was also investigated for both species data demonstrate the formation of the u u y shaped structure in the human tri snrnp and u u snrnp u forms the long range interaction that was previously proposed to be responsible for dissociation of the deproteinized u u duplex in both yeast and human tri snrnps u is more protected than u and u  suggesting that the u snrnp specific protein complex and other components of the tri snrnp wrapped the   stem loop of u  loop i of u is partially accessible and chemical modifications of loop i were identical in yeast and human tri snrnps this reflects a strong conservation of the interactions of proteins with the functional loop i only some parts of the u u y shaped motif the   stem loop of u and helix ii are protected due to difference of protein composition of yeast and human tri snrnp the u segment linking the   stem loop to the y shaped structure and the u central single stranded segment are more accessible in the yeast than in the human tri snrnp especially the phylogenetically conserved acagag sequence of u  data are discussed taking into account knowledge on rna and protein components of yeast and human snrnps and their involvement in splicesome assembly
