dissecting the molecular mechanism of ivig therapy the interaction between serum igg and dc sign is independent of antibody glycoform or fc domain
intravenous immunoglobulin ivig therapy is used to treat a wide range of autoimmune conditions and consists of pooled immunoglobulin g igg from healthy donors the immunosuppressive effects of ivig are in part attributed to terminal    linked sialic acid residues on the n linked glycans of the igg fc fragment crystallizable domain this    sialylated fc sfc has been reported to bind to the carbohydrate recognition domain crd of the cell surface lectin dc sign dendritic cell specific intercellular adhesion molecule  grabbing non integrin and its murine orthologue sign r  specific intracellular adhesion molecule grabbing non integrin r  and via this interaction to signal the downstream expression of immunosuppressive cytokines and receptors consistent with this model the antiinflammatory effect of ivig treatment is abolished in a murine knock out of sign r and can be restored by a knock in with human dc sign in contrast however existing glycan array and x ray crystallographic studies indicate that the crds of both sign r and dc sign bind to a restricted set of primarily oligomannose type glycans that does not include the glycans found on sfc we attempted to reconcile these immunological and biophysical observations we first generated hypersialylated desialylated deglycosylated and untreated serum igg and found that the affinity for the complete extracellular region of the dc sign tetramer was similar for all antibody glycoforms moreover the binding could be attributed to cross reactive polyclonal fab fragment antigen binding specificities in serum as neither recombinant fc nor sfc bound to dc sign in addition serum igg exhibited no competition against known ligands of the dc sign crd these findings lead us to suggest that ivig therapy does not involve binding of igg fc to dc sign and that alternative cell surface lectins are required for the antiinflammatory activity of sfc
