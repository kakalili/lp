crystal structure of the lg domain of endorepellin an angiogenesis inhibitor
endorepellin the c terminal region of perlecan inhibits angiogenesis by disrupting actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions the c terminal laminin like globular domain lg  of endorepellin directs most of this antiangiogenic activity to investigate the angiostatic mechanism and to identify structural determinants we have solved crystal structures of the lg domain in both apo and calcium bound forms at resolutions of     and     respectively the conserved core has the jellyroll fold characteristic of lg domains the calcium induced structural changes seem very restricted and the calcium binding site appears to be preformed suggesting that the bound calcium ion rather than structural rearrangements contributes to antiangiogenesis we have identified h   on the ef loop as a key residue for the biochemical function of lg  since its mutation abolishes antiangiogenic activity and mutant lg can no longer form a direct interaction with integrin taken together we propose that these two distinct structural elements contribute to the angiostatic effect of endorepellin
