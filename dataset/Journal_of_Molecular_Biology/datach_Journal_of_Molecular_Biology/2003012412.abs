mg  sensing by the mg  sensor phoq of salmonella enterica
the phop phoq two component regulatory system governs the adaptation to low mg  environments and virulence in several gram negative species during growth in low mg  the sensor phoq modifies the activity of the response regulator phop promoting gene transcription whereas growth in high mg  represses transcription of phop activated genes the phoq protein harbors a periplasmic domain of   amino acid residues that binds mg in vitro and is required for mg  mediated repression in vivo here we identify periplasmic mutants of the salmonella phoq protein that allow transcription of phop activated genes even under high mg  concentrations when expressed in a strain harboring a phop variant that is phosphorylated from acetyl phosphate some of the mutants failed to repress phop promoted transcription in high mg  whereas others displayed a wild type ability to do so mutant phoq proteins that allowed expression of phop activated genes in high mg  displayed a pattern of iron mediated cleavage in vitro that was different from that displayed by wild type phoq indicative of altered mg  binding a phoq protein with the conserved histidine residue h   substituted by alanine could not promote transcription of phop activated genes in low mg  but could turn off expression in response to high mg  our studies demonstrate that residues g  w  h  and t  are required for a wild type response to mg  and suggest that mg  binding to the periplasmic domain regulates several activities in the phoq protein
