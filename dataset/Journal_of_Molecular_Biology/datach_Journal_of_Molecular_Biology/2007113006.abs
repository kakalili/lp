structural characterization of the atpase reaction cycle of endosomal aaa protein vps
the multivesicular body mvb pathway functions in multiple cellular processes including cell surface receptor down regulation and viral budding from host cells an important step in the mvb pathway is the correct sorting of cargo molecules which requires the assembly and disassembly of endosomal sorting complexes required for transport escrts on the endosomal membrane disassembly of the escrts is catalyzed by atpase associated with various cellular activities aaa protein vps  vps contains a single aaa domain and undergoes atp dependent quaternary structural change to disassemble the escrts structural and biochemical analyses of the vps atpase reaction cycle are reported here crystal structures of saccharomyces cerevisiae vps in both the nucleotide free form and the adp bound form provide the first structural view illustrating how nucleotide binding might induce conformational changes within vps that lead to oligomerization and binding to its substrate escrt iii subunits in contrast to previous models characterization of the vps structure now supports a model where the ground state of vps in the atpase reaction cycle is predominantly a monomer and the activated state is a dodecamer comparison with a previously reported human vps b structure suggests that vps functions in the mvb pathway via a highly conserved mechanism supported by similar protein  protein interactions during its atpase reaction cycle
