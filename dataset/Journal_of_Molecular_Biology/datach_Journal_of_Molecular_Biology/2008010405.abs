the ybin gene of escherichia coli encodes adenine n methyltransferase specific for modification of a   of  s ribosomal rna a methylated residue located close to the ribosomal exit tunnel
n methyladenosine   of escherichia coli  s rrna is located in a cluster of modified nucleotides    away from the nascent peptide tunnel of the ribosome here we describe the identification of gene ybin encoding an enzyme responsible for methylation of a   knockout of the ybin gene leads to loss of modification at a   the modification is restored if ybin knock out strain has been co transformed with a plasmid expressing the ybin gene on the basis of these results we suggest that ybin gene should be renamed to rlmf in accordance with the accepted nomenclature for rrna methyltransferases recombinant ybin protein is able to methylate partially deproteinized  s ribosomal subunit so called   m licl core particle in vitro but neither the completely assembled  s subunits nor completely deproteinized  s rrna both lack of the ybin gene and it s over expression leads to growth retardation and loss of cell fitness comparative to the parental strain it might be suggested that a   modification could be necessary for the exit tunnel interaction with some unknown regulatory peptides
