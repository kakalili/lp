protein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane role of import receptors in the structural organization of the tom complex edited by m yaniv
the mitochondrial outer membrane contains a multi subunit machinery responsible for the specific recognition and translocation of precursor proteins this translocase of the outer membrane tom consists of three receptor proteins tom  tom  and tom  the channel protein tom  and several small tom proteins single particle electron microscopy analysis of the neurospora tom complex has led to different views with two or three stain filled centers resembling channels based on biochemical and electron microscopy studies of the tom complex isolated from yeast mitochondria we have discovered the molecular reason for the different number of channel like structures the tom complex from wild type yeast contains up to three stain filled centers while from a mutant yeast selectively lacking tom  the tom complex particles contain only two channel like structures from mutant mitochondria lacking tom  native electrophoresis separates an    kda subcomplex that consists of tom  only and is functional for accumulation of a precursor protein we conclude that while tom  forms the import channels the two receptors tom  and tom  are required for the organization of tom  dimers into larger tom structures
