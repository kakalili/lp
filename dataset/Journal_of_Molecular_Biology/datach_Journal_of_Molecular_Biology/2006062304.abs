structural recognition between a four way dna junction and a resolving enzyme
resolving enzymes bind highly selectively to four way dna junctions but the mechanism of this structural specificity is poorly understood in this study we have explored the role of interactions between the dimeric enzyme and the helical arms of the junction using junctions with either shortened arms or circular permutation of arms we find that dna  protein contacts in the arms containing the   ends of the continuous strands are very important conferring a significant level of sequence discrimination upon both the choice of conformer and the order of strand cleavage we have exploited these properties to obtain hydroxyl radical footprinting data on endonuclease i  junction complexes that are not complicated by the presence of alternative conformers with results that are in good agreement with the arm permutation and shortening experiments substitution of phosphate groups at the center of the junction reveals the importance of electrostatic interactions at the point of strand exchange in the complex our data show that the form of the complex between endonuclease i and a dna junction depends on the core of the junction and on interactions with the first six base pairs of the arms containing the   ends of the continuous strands
