late steps in the formation of e coli rna polymerase   pr promoter open complexes characterization of conformational changes by rapid perturbant upshift experiments
the formation of the transcriptionally competent open complex rpo by escherichia coli rna polymerase at the  pr promoter involves at least three steps and two kinetically significant intermediates i and i  understanding the sequence of conformational changes rearrangements in the jaws of rna polymerase dna opening that occur in the conversion of i to rpo requires   dissecting the rate constant kd for the dissociation of rpo into contributions from individual steps and   isolating and characterizing i  to deconvolute kd we develop experiments involving rapid upshifts to elevated concentrations of rpo destabilizing solutes   perturbants   urea and kcl to create a burst in the population of i  at high concentrations of either perturbant kd approaches the same perturbant independent value interpreted as the elementary rate constant k   for i  i  the large effects of urea and salt on k  the equilibrium constant for i  rpo indicate that a large scale folding transition in polymerase occurs and a new interface with the dna forms late in the mechanism we deduce that i at the  pr promoter is always unstable relative to rpo even at   c explaining previous difficulties in detecting it by using temperature downshifts the division of the large positive enthalpy change between the late steps of the mechanism suggests that an additional unstable intermediate i  may exist between i and rpo
