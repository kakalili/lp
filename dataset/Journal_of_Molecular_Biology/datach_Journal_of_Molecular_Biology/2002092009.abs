solution structure of a luteoviral p  p frameshifting mrna pseudoknot
a hairpin type messenger rna pseudoknot from pea enation mosaic virus rna  pemv  regulates the efficiency of programmed   ribosomal frameshifting the solution structure and  n relaxation rates reveal that the pemv  pseudoknot is a compact folded structure composed almost entirely of rna triple helix a three nucleotide reverse turn in loop  positions a protonated cytidine c  in the correct orientation to form an a n    c  g cn major groove base quadruple like that found in the beet western yellows virus pseudoknot and the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme despite distinct structural contexts a novel loop   loop  a u hoogsteen base pair stacks on the c   g  base pair of the a  c   g  c  quadruple and forms a wedge between the pseudoknot stems stabilizing a bent and over rotated global conformation substitution of key nucleotides that stabilize the unique conformation of the pemv  pseudoknot greatly reduces ribosomal frameshifting efficacy
