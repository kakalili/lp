functional architecture of the major light harvesting complex from higher plants edited by r huber
light harvesting complexes lhc catalyse sunlight harvesting for photosynthesis as well as other essential functions including photoprotection by quenching of harmful chlorophyll triplet states and prevention of photoinhibition by dissipation of excitation energy in excess in addition folding of lhc proteins depends on the availability of both xanthophylls and carotenoids thus preventing the potential formation of harmful chlorophyll protein complexes lacking photoprotectors we have used the mutation analysis in order to study the association of the different functions to three protein domains each composed of a xanthophyll molecule and of neighbour chlorophylls a and b within the major antenna complex of photosystem ii i e lhcii we have found that the xanthophyll to chlorophyll energy transfer is a shared property of the whole pigment protein complex and occurs with similar efficiency in each of the three structural domains photoprotection by quenching of chlorophyll triplets is catalysed mainly by lutein bound to site l  and occurs via energy transfer from chlorophylls a and b  this domain is essential for pigment induced protein folding the domains l and n weakly influence either the protein stability or the photoprotection however replacement of xanthophyll species bound to these structural domains modulates the fluorescence quantum yield of lhcii and suggests that non radiative dissipation of excess energy can be regulated through allosteric modification of the protein structure by exchanging xanthophylls in these sites
