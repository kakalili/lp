identification of two interaction sites in secy that are important for the functional interaction with seca
the motor protein seca drives the translocation of pre proteins across the secyeg channel in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane by nucleotide dependent cycles of conformational changes often referred to as membrane insertion de insertion despite structural data on seca and an archaeal homolog of secyeg the identity of the sites of interaction between seca and secyeg are unknown here we show that seca can be cross linked to several residues in cytoplasmic loop  c  of secy and that seca directly interacts with a part of transmembrane segment  tms  of secy that is buried in the membrane region of secyeg mutagenesis of either the conserved arg  in c or glu  in tms interferes with the catalytic activity of seca but not with binding of seca to secyeg our data explain how conformational changes in seca could be directly coupled to the previously proposed opening mechanism of the secyeg channel
