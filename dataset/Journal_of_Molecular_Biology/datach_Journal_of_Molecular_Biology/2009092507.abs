coupling molecular dynamics simulations with experiments for the rational design of indolicidin analogous antimicrobial peptides
antimicrobial peptides amps have attracted much interest in recent years because of their potential use as new generation antibiotics indolicidin il is a  residue cationic amp that is effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria fungi and even viruses unfortunately its high hemolytic activity retards its clinical applications in this study we adopted molecular dynamics md simulations as an aid toward the rational design of il analogues exhibiting high antimicrobial activity but low hemolysis we employed long timescale multi trajectory all atom md simulations to investigate the interactions of the peptide il with model membranes the lipid bilayer formed by the zwitterionic  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphocholine popc was chosen as the model erythrocyte membrane lipid bilayers formed from a mixture of popc and the negatively charged  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphoglycerol were chosen to model bacterial membranes md simulations with a total simulation time of up to   s revealed the mechanisms of the processes of il adsorption onto and insertion into the membranes the packing order of these lipid bilayers presumably correlated to the membrane stability upon il adsorption and insertion we used the degree of local membrane thinning and the reduction in the order parameter of the acyl chains of the lipids to characterize the membrane stability the order of the mixed  palmitoyl  oleoyl sn glycero  phosphoglycerol popc lipid bilayer reduced significantly upon the adsorption of il on the other hand although the order of the pure popc lipid bilayer was perturbed slightly during the adsorption stage the value was reduced more dramatically upon the insertion of il into the membrane s hydrophobic region the results imply that enhancing il adsorption on the microbial membrane may amplify its antimicrobial activity while the degree of hemolysis may be reduced through inhibition of il insertion into the hydrophobic region of the erythrocyte membrane in addition through simulations we identified the amino acids that are most responsible for the adsorption onto or insertion into the two model membranes positive charges are critical to the peptide s adsorption whereas the presence of hydrophobic trp and trp leads to its deeper insertion combining the hypothetical relationships between the membrane disordering and the antimicrobial and hemolytical activities with the simulated results we designed three new il analogous peptides il k  pro  lys  il f  trp and trp  phe  and il k f  pro  lys trp and trp  phe  the hemolytic activity of il f  is considerably lower than that of il whereas the antimicrobial activity of il k is greatly enhanced in particular the de novo peptide il k f  exhibits higher antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli its hemolytic activity decreased to only   of that of il our simulated and experimental results correlated well this approach  coupling md simulations with experimental design  is a useful strategy toward the rational design of amps for potential therapeutic use
