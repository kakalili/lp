p  regulates rapid apoptosis in human pluripotent stem cells
human pluripotent stem cells hpscs are sensitive to dna damage and undergo rapid apoptosis compared to their differentiated progeny cells here we explore the underlying mechanisms for the increased apoptotic sensitivity of hpscs that helps to determine pluripotent stem cell fate apoptosis was induced by exposure to actinomycin d etoposide or tunicamycin with each agent triggering a distinct apoptotic pathway we show that hpscs are more sensitive to all three types of apoptosis induction than are lineage non specific retinoic acid differentiated hpscs also bax activation and pro apoptotic mitochondrial intermembrane space protein release which are required to initiate the mitochondria mediated apoptosis pathway are more rapid in hpscs than in retinoic acid differentiated hpscs surprisingly bak and not bax is essential for actinomycin d induced apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells finally p  is degraded rapidly in an ubiquitin proteasome dependent pathway in hpscs at steady state but quickly accumulates and induces apoptosis when mdm function is impaired rapid degradation of p  ensures the survival of healthy hpscs but avails these cells for immediate apoptosis upon cellular damage by p  stabilization altogether we provide an underlying interconnected molecular mechanism that primes hpscs for quick clearance by apoptosis to eliminate hpscs with unrepaired genome alterations and preserves organismal genomic integrity during the early critical stages of human embryonic development
