overexpression of phage hk  nun protein is toxic for escherichia coli
the nun protein of coliphage hk  excludes superinfecting  phage nun recognizes and binds to the n utilization nut sites on phage  nascent rna and induces transcription termination overexpression of nun from a high copy plasmid is toxic for escherichia coli despite the fact that nut sites are not encoded in the e coli genome cells expressing nun cannot exit stationary phase toxicity is related to transcription termination since host and nun mutations that block termination also suppress cell killing nun inhibits expression of wild type lacz but not lacz expressed from the crp camp independent lacuv promoter microarray and proteomic analyses show that nun down regulates crp and tnaa crp overexpression and high indole concentrations partially reverse nun mediated toxicity and restore lacz expression
