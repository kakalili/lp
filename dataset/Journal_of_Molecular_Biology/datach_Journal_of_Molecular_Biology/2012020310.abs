effects of pathogenic proline mutations on myosin assembly
laing distal myopathy mpd  is a genetically dominant myopathy characterized by early and selective weakness of the distal muscles mutations in the myh gene encoding for the  myosin heavy chain are the underlying genetic cause of mpd  however their pathogenic mechanisms are currently unknown here we measure the biological effects of the r  p and l  p mpd mutations in different cellular systems we show that while the two mutations inhibit myosin self assembly in non muscle cells they do not prevent incorporation of the mutant myosin into sarcomeres nevertheless we find that the l  p mutation affects proper antiparallel myosin association by accumulating in the bare zone of the sarcomere furthermore bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay shows that the  helix containing the r  p mutation folds into homodimeric mutant mutant and heterodimeric mutant wild type wt  myosin molecules that are competent for sarcomere incorporation both mutations also form aggregates consisting of cytoplasmic vacuoles surrounding paracrystalline arrays and amorphous rod like inclusions that sequester wt myosin myosin aggregates were also detected in transgenic nematodes expressing the r  p mutation by showing that the two mpd mutations can have dominant effects on distinct components of the contractile apparatus our data provide the first insights into the pathogenesis of the disease
