an alternative mechanism for amidase signature enzymes
the peptide amidase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia catalyses predominantly the hydrolysis of the c terminal amide bond in peptide amides peptide bonds or amide functions in amino acid side chains are not hydrolysed this specificity makes peptide amidase pam interesting for different biotechnological applications pam belongs to the amidase signature as family it is the first protein within this family whose tertiary structure has been solved the structure of the native pam has been determined with a resolution of    and in complex with the competitive inhibitor chymostatin at a resolution of    chymostatin which forms acyl adducts with many serine proteases binds non covalently to this enzyme pam folds as a very compact single domain protein the as sequence represents a core domain that is covered by  helices this as domain contains the catalytic residues it is topologically homologous to the phosphoinositol phosphatase domain the structural data do not support the recently proposed ser lys catalytic dyad mechanism for as enzymes our results are in agreement with the role of ser  as the primary nucleophile but differ concerning the roles of ser  and lys   ser   with direct contact both to the substrate molecule and to ser   presumably serves as an acid bases catalyst lys   with direct contact to ser  but no contact to ser  or the substrate molecule most likely acts as an acid catalyst
