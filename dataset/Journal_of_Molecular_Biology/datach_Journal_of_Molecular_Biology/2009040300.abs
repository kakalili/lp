structural characterization of clostridium acetobutylicum  oxoguanine dna glycosylase in its apo form and in complex with  oxodeoxyguanosine
dna is subject to a multitude of oxidative damages generated by oxidizing agents from metabolism and exogenous sources and by ionizing radiation guanine is particularly vulnerable to oxidation and the most common oxidative product  oxoguanine  oxog is the most prevalent lesion observed in dna molecules  oxog can form a normal watson  crick pair with cytosine  oxog c  but it can also form a stable hoogsteen pair with adenine  oxog a  leading to a g c  t a transversion after replication fortunately  oxog is recognized and excised by either of two dna glycosylases of the base excision repair pathway formamidopyrimidine  dna glycosylase and  oxoguanine dna glycosylase ogg  while clostridium acetobutylicum ogg cacogg dna glycosylase can specifically recognize and remove  oxog it displays little preference for the base opposite the lesion which is unusual for a member of the ogg family this work describes the crystal structures of cacogg in its apo form and in complex with  oxo   deoxyguanosine a structural comparison between the apo form and the liganded form of the enzyme reveals a structural reorganization of the c terminal domain upon binding of  oxog similar to that reported for human ogg  a structural comparison of cacogg with human ogg  in complex with  oxog containing dna provides a structural rationale for the lack of opposite base specificity displayed by cacogg
