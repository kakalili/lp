substrate dependent millisecond domain motions in dna polymerase
dna polymerase   pol   is a   kda enzyme that performs the vital cellular function of repairing damaged dna mutations in pol  have been linked to various cancers and these mutations are further correlated with altered pol  enzymatic activity the fidelity of correct nucleotide incorporation into damaged dna is essential for pol  repair function and several studies have implicated conformational changes in pol  as a determinant of this repair fidelity in this work the rate constants for domain motions in pol  have been determined by solution nmr relaxation dispersion for the apo and substrate bound binary forms of pol   in apo pol   molecular motions primarily isolated to the dna lyase domain are observed to occur at     s   additional analysis suggests that these motions allow apo pol  to sample a conformation similar to the gapped dna substrate bound form upon binding dna these lyase domain motions are significantly quenched whereas evidence for conformational motions in the polymerase domain becomes apparent these nmr studies suggest an alteration in the dynamic landscape of pol  due to substrate binding moreover a number of the flexible residues identified in this work are also the location of residues which upon mutation lead to cancer phenotypes in vivo which may be due to the intimate role of protein motions in pol  fidelity
