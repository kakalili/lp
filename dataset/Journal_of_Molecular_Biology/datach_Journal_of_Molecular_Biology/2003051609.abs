energetics of lesion recognition by a dna repair protein thermodynamic characterization of formamidopyrimidine glycosylase fpg interactions with damaged dna duplexes
as part of an overall effort to map the energetic landscape of the base excision repair pathway we report the first thermodynamic characterization of repair enzyme binding to lesion containing duplexes isothermal titration calorimetry itc in conjunction with spectroscopic measurements and protease protection assays have been employed to characterize the binding of escherichia coli formamidopyrimidine glycosylase fpg  a bifunctional repair enzyme to a series of  mer dna duplexes to resolve energetically the binding and the catalytic events several of these duplexes are constructed with non hydrolyzable lesion analogs that mimic the natural  oxo dg substrate and the abasic like intermediates specifically one of the duplexes contains a central non hydrolyzable tetrahydrofuran thf abasic site analog while another duplex contains a central carbocyclic substrate analog carba  oxo dg  itc binding studies conducted between   c and    c reveal that fpg association with the thf containing duplex is characterized by binding free energies that are relatively invariant to temperature  g     kcalmol    in contrast to both the reaction enthalpy and entropy that are strongly temperature dependent complex formation between fpg and the thf containing duplex at   c exhibits an unfavorable association enthalpy  h   kcalmol   that is compensated by a favorable association entropy t s   kcalmol    the entropic nature of the binding interaction coupled with the large negative heat capacity  cp    kcaldeg  mol    is consistent with fpg complexation to the thf containing duplex involving significant burial of non polar surface areas by contrast under the high ionic strength buffer conditions employed herein   mm nacl  no appreciable fpg affinity for the carba  oxo dg substrate analog is detected our results suggest that initial fpg recognition of a damaged dna site is predominantly electrostatic in nature and does not involve large contact interfaces subsequent base excision presumably facilitates accommodation of the resulting lesion site into the binding pocket as the enzyme interaction with the thf containing duplex is characterized by high affinity and a large negative heat capacity change our data are consistent with a pathway in which fpg glycosylase activity renders the base excision product a preferred ligand relative to the natural substrate thereby ensuring the fidelity of removing highly reactive and potentially mutagenic abasic like intermediates through catalytic elimination reactions
