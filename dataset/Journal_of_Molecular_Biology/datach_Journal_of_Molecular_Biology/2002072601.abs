a conserved tyrosine residue aids ternary complex formation but not catalysis in phage t flap endonuclease
the flap endonucleases or   nucleases are involved in dna replication and repair they possess both      exonucleolytic activity and the ability to cleave bifurcated or branched dna in an endonucleolytic structure specific manner these enzymes share a great degree of structural and sequence similarity conserved acidic amino acids whose primary role appears to be chelation of essential divalent cation cofactors lie at the base of the active site a loop or helical archway is located above the active site a conserved tyrosine residue lies at the base of the archway in phage t flap endonuclease this residue is conserved in the structures of all flap endonucleases analysed to date we mutated the tyrosine  codon in the cloned t    nuclease to one encoding phenylalanine detailed analysis of the purified y f protein revealed only a modest   fold decrease in binding affinity for dna compared with wild type in the absence of cofactor the modified nuclease retains both structure specific endonuclease and exonuclease activities kinetic analysis was performed using a newly developed single cleavage assay based on hydrolysis of a fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide substrate substrate and products were resolved by denaturing hplc steady state kinetic analysis revealed that loss of the tyrosine hydroxyl function did not significantly impair kcat pre steady state analysis under single turnover conditions also demonstrated little change in the rate of reaction compared to the wild type protein the ph dependence of the kinetic parameters for the y f enzyme catalysed reaction was bell shaped as for the wild type protein thus y  does not play a role in catalysis however steady state analysis did detect a large     fold defect in km these results imply that this conserved tyrosine plays a key role in ternary complex formation protein  dna  metal ion  a prerequisite for catalysis
