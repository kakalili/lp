optimization of the in silico designed kemp eliminase ke  by computational design and directed evolution
although de novo computational enzyme design has been shown to be feasible the field is still in its infancy the kinetic parameters of designed enzymes are still orders of magnitude lower than those of naturally occurring ones nonetheless designed enzymes can be improved by directed evolution as recently exemplified for the designed kemp eliminase ke  random mutagenesis and screening resulted in variants with gt   fold higher catalytic efficiency and provided insights about features missing in the designed enzyme here we describe the optimization of ke  another designed kemp eliminase amino acid substitutions predicted to improve catalysis in design calculations involving extensive backbone sampling were individually tested those proven beneficial were combinatorially incorporated into the originally designed ke  along with random mutations and the resulting libraries were screened for improved eliminase activity nine rounds of mutation and selection resulted in gt   fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency of the original ke  design reflected in both higher kcat values and lower km values with the best variants exhibiting kcat km values of gt     s   m   the optimized ke  variants were characterized structurally and biochemically providing insights into the origins of the improvements in catalysis three primary contributions were identified first the reshaping of the active site cavity to achieve tighter substrate binding second the fine tuning of electrostatics around the catalytic his asp dyad and third the stabilization of the active site dyad in a conformation optimal for catalysis
