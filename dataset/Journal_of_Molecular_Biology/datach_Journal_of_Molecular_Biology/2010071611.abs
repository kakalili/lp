an mcp like protein interacts with the mamk cytoskeleton and is involved in magnetotaxis in magnetospirillum magneticum amb
magnetotactic bacteria have the unique capacity of aligning and swimming along geomagnetic field lines a behavior called magnetotaxis although this behavior has been observed for   years little is known about its mechanism magnetotactic bacteria synthesize unique organelles magnetosomes which are magnetic crystals enveloped by membrane they form chains with the help of the filamentous cytoskeletal protein mamk and impart a net magnetic dipole moment to the bacterium the current model proposes that magnetotaxis comprises passive magnetic orientation and active swimming due to flagellar rotation we thought that magnetic sensing via the widely used chemotaxis mechanism might be actively involved in magnetotaxis we found that the methyl accepting chemotaxis protein amb   of magnetospirillum magneticum amb  was capable of carrying out such a function amb   is encoded by a gene in the magnetosome island in which genes essential for magnetosome biosynthesis and magnetotaxis are concentrated amb   lacks periplasmic sensing domain which is generally involved in sensing stimuli from outside of cells by constructing fusions with a derivative of yellow fluorescent protein we showed that amb   localizes to the cell poles where methyl accepting chemotaxis proteins are usually clustered we then showed that amb   specifically interacts via its c terminal domain with mamk using a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay moreover overproduction of amb   slowed down the response of the bacterium to changes in the direction of the magnetic field most importantly the c terminal domain of amb   which interacts with mamk is responsible for this phenotype suggesting that the interaction between amb   and mamk plays a key role in magnetotaxis these results lead to a novel explanation for magnetotaxis at the molecular level
