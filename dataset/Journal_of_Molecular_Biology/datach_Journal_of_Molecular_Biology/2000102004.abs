the essential function of not lies within the ccr not complex edited by j karn
the five saccharomyces cerevisiae not proteins are associated with the ccr and caf proteins in   mda and  mda complexes the not proteins have been proposed to repress transcription of promoters that do not contain a canonical tata sequence while the ccr and caf proteins are required for non fermentative gene expression the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the ccr not complex is unknown and the role of its different components is unclear only not p is essential for yeast viability here we show that most strains carrying combinations of two null alleles of the non essential ccr not genes are non viable this would suggest that the ccr not complex is essential we find that not p consists of at least two domains a c terminal domain that is essential for yeast viability and a n terminal domain that is dispensable but required for yeast wild type growth the essential c terminal domain of not p can associate with not p and both proteins are present in   and  mda complexes in the absence of the n terminal not p domain in contrast in the absence of the n terminal domain of not p ccr p does not efficiently associate in large complexes nor with the c terminal domain of not p healthy growth is observed when both domains of not p are expressed in trans and is correlated with their physical association together with ccr p in large complexes these results are consistent with the essential function of not p lying within the ccr not complex
