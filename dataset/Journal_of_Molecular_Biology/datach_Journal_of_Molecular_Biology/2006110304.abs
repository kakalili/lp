one protein two enzymes revisited a structural entropy switch interconverts the two isoforms of acireductone dioxygenase
acireductone dioxygenase ard catalyzes different reactions between o and   dihydroxy  oxo  methylthio pent  ene acireductone depending upon the metal bound in the active site ni   ard cleaves acireductone to formate co and methylthiopropionate if fe  is bound ard   the same substrates yield methylthioketobutyrate and formate the two forms differ in structure and are chromatographically separable paramagnetism of fe  renders the active site of ard  inaccessible to standard nmr methods the structure of ard  has been determined using fe  binding parameters determined by x ray absorption spectroscopy and nmr restraints from h s ard a metal free diamagnetic protein that is isostructural with ard   ard  retains the  sandwich fold of ard but a structural entropy switch increases order at one end of a two helix system that bisects the  sandwich and decreases order at the other upon interconversion of ard and ard   causing loss of the c terminal helix in ard  and rearrangements of residues involved in substrate orientation in the active site
