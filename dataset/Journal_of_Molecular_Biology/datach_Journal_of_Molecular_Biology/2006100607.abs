analysis of molecular recognition features morfs
several proteomic studies in the last decade revealed that many proteins are either completely disordered or possess long structurally flexible regions many such regions were shown to be of functional importance often allowing a protein to interact with a large number of diverse partners parallel to these findings during the last five years structural bioinformatics has produced an explosion of results regarding protein  protein interactions and their importance for cell signaling we studied the occurrence of relatively short     residues  loosely structured protein regions within longer largely disordered sequences that were characterized as bound to larger proteins we call these regions molecular recognition features morfs also known as molecular recognition elements mores  interestingly upon binding to their partner s  morfs undergo disorder to order transitions thus in our interpretation morfs represent a class of disordered region that exhibits molecular recognition and binding functions this work extends previous research showing the importance of flexibility and disorder for molecular recognition we describe the development of a database of morfs derived from the rcsb protein data bank and present preliminary results of bioinformatics analyses of these sequences based on the structure adopted upon binding at least three basic types of morfs are found   morfs   morfs and  morfs which form  helices   strands and irregular secondary structure when bound respectively our data suggest that functionally significant residual structure can exist in morf regions prior to the actual binding event the contribution of intrinsic protein disorder to the nature and function of morfs has also been addressed the results of this study will advance the understanding of protein  protein interactions and help towards the future development of useful protein  protein binding site predictors
