solution structure of the r h domain from human s bp
the r h domain is a conserved sequence motif identified in over   proteins that is thought to be involved in polynucleotide binding including dna rna and single stranded dna in this work the d structure of the r h domain from human s bp  was determined by nmr spectroscopy it is the first d structure determination of an r h domain the fold presents a small motif consisting of a three stranded antiparallel  sheet and two  helices which is related to the structures of the yhhp protein and the c terminal domain of the translational initiation factor if  the similarities are non trivial as the amino acid identities are below   three conserved basic residues cluster on the same face of the r h domain and could play a role in nucleic acid recognition an extended hydrophobic area at a different site of the molecular surface could act as a protein binding site a strong correlation between conservation of hydrophobic amino acids and side chain solvent protection indicates that the structure of the s bp  r h domain is representative of r h domains in general
