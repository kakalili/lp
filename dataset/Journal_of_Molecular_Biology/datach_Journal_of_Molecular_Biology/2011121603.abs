human cardiac myosin binding protein c structural flexibility within an extended modular architecture
new insights into the modular organization and flexibility of the n terminal half of human cardiac myosin binding protein c cmybp c and information on the association state of the full length protein have been deduced from a combined small angle x ray scattering saxs and nmr study saxs data show that the first five immunoglobulin domains of cmybp c which include those implicated in interactions with both myosin and actin remain monodisperse and monomeric in solution and have a highly extended yet distinctively  bent  modular arrangement that is similar to the giant elastic muscle protein titin analyses of the nmr and saxs data indicate that a proline alanine rich linker connecting the cardiac specific n terminal c domain to the c domain provides significant structural flexibility at the n terminus of the human isoform while the modular arrangement of domains c  c  c  c is relatively fixed domain fragments from the c terminal half of the protein have a propensity to self associate in vitro while full length bacterially expressed cmybp c forms flexible extended dimers at micromolar protein concentrations in summary our studies reveal that human cmybp c combines a distinctive modular architecture with regions of flexibility and that the n terminal half of the protein is sufficiently extended to span the range of interfilament distances sampled within the dynamic environment of heart muscle these structural features of cmybp c could facilitate its putative role as a molecular switch between actin and myosin and may contribute to modulating the transverse pliancy of the c zone of the a band across muscle sarcomeres
