molecular mechanisms of innate immune inhibition by non segmented negative sense rna viruses
the host innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against viral infections germline encoded pattern recognition receptors detect molecular patterns associated with pathogens and activate innate immune responses of particular relevance to viral infections are those pattern recognition receptors that activate type i interferon responses which establish an antiviral state the order mononegavirales is composed of viruses that possess single stranded non segmented negative sense nns rna genomes and are important human pathogens that consistently antagonize signaling related to type i interferon responses nns viruses have limited encoding capacity compared to many dna viruses and as a likely consequence most open reading frames encode multifunctional viral proteins that interact with host factors in order to evade host cell defenses while promoting viral replication in this review we will discuss the molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion by select nns viruses a greater understanding of these interactions will be critical in facilitating the development of effective therapeutics and viral countermeasures
