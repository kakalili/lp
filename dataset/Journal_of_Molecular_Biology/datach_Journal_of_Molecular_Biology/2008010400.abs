xyls  pm promoter interactions through two helix  turn  helix motifs identifying xyls residues important for dna binding and activation
the xyls protein is the positive transcription regulator of the tol plasmid meta cleavage pathway operon pm xyls belongs to the arac family of transcriptional regulators and exhibits an n terminal domain involved in effector recognition and a c terminal domain made up of seven  helices conforming two helix  turn  helix dna binding domains   helix  and  helix  are the recognition helices in consonance with xyls structural organization pm exhibits a bipartite dna binding motif consisting of two boxes called a and b whose sequences are tgca and ggnta respectively this bipartite motif is repeated at the pm promoter so that one of the xyls monomers binds to each of the repeats an extensive series of genetic epistasis assays combining mutant pm promoters and xyls single substitution mutant proteins revealed that  helix  contacts a box nucleotides whereas  helix  residues contact b box nucleotides in  helix  asn  and arg  are involved in specific contacts with the tg dinucleotide at box a whereas arg  and glu  contact the second g and t nucleotides at box b on the basis of our results and of the three dimensional model of the xyls c terminal domain we propose that ser   glu  and lys  in  helix  and asn  and arg  in  helix  contact the phosphate backbones alanine substitutions at the predicted phosphate backbone contacting residues yielded mutants with low levels of activity suggesting that xyls  pm binding specificity not only involves specific amino acid  base interactions but also relies on secondary dna structure which although at another level also comes into play we propose a model in which a xyls dimer binds to the direct repeats in pm in a head to tail conformation that allows the direct interaction of the xyls proximal subunit with the rna polymerase sigma factor
