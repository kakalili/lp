structure of the dissimilatory sulfite reductase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus
conservation of energy based on the reduction of sulfate is of fundamental importance for the biogeochemical sulfur cycle a key enzyme of this ancient anaerobic process is the dissimilatory sulfite reductase dsir  which catalyzes the six electron reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfide under participation of a unique magnetically coupled siroheme   fe  s center we determined the crystal structure of the enzyme from the sulfate reducing archaeon archaeoglobus fulgidus at   resolution and compared it with that of the phylogenetically related assimilatory sir asir  dsir is organized as a heterotetrameric     complex composed of two catalytically independent   heterodimers in contrast asir is a monomeric protein built of two fused modules that are structurally related to subunits  and  except for a ferredoxin domain inserted only into the subunits of dsir the  fe  s cluster of this ferredoxin domain is considered as the terminal redox site of the electron transfer pathway to the siroheme   fe  s center in dsir while asir binds one siroheme   fe  s center dsir harbors two of them within each   heterodimer surprisingly only one siroheme   fe  s center in each   heterodimer is catalytically active whereas access to the second one is blocked by a tryptophan residue the spatial proximity of the functional and structural siroheme   fe  s centers suggests that the catalytic activity at one active site was optimized during evolution at the expense of the enzymatic competence of the other the sulfite binding mode and presumably the mechanism of sulfite reduction appear to be largely conserved between dsir and asir in addition a scenario for the evolution of sirs is proposed
