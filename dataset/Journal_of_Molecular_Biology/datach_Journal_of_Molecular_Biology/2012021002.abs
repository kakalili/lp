two immunoglobulin tandem proteins with a linking  strand reveal unexpected differences in cooperativity and folding pathways
the study of the folding of single domains in the context of their multidomain environment is important because more than   of eukaryotic proteins are composed of multiple domains the structures of the tandem immunoglobulin ig domain pairs a   a  and a   a   from the a band of the giant muscle protein titin reveal that they form tightly associated domain arrangements connected by a continuous  strand we investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these tandem domain pairs while a   a  apparently behaves as a single cooperative unit at equilibrium unfolding without the accumulation of a large population of intermediates domains in a   a  behave independently although a  appears to be stabilized in the tandem protein we show that this is due to nonspecific stabilization by extension we elucidate the folding and unfolding pathways of both tandem pairs and show that cooperativity in a   a  is a manifestation of the relative refolding and unfolding rate constants of each individual domain we infer that the differences between the two tandem pairs result from a different pattern of interactions at the domain domain interface
