atf creb sites present in sub telomeric regions of saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosomes are part of promoters and act as uas urs of highly conserved cos genes
a highly conserved  bp dna element was identified present at  chromosome ends of saccharomyces cerevisiae each element harbours an ideal or a mutated atf creb site which is a well known target sequence for bzip transcription factors in all cases the sub telomeric atf creb site element sace is a direct extension of the respective sub telomeric corex element eight saces are part of very long quasi identical regions of several kilobases including a sub telomeric cos open reading frame three of these eight saces harbour an ideal atf creb site four a triple exchange variant    atggtatcat    gta variant  and one a single exchange variant with a c to g exchange at the left side of the center of symmetry we analyzed the function of the sace of the left arm of chromosome viii in vivo and found its atf creb site to act as uas urs of the cos promoter effected by the yeast bzip proteins sko p aca p and aca p cos protein was found in proximity to the nuclear membrane where it accumulated especially during cell division when the atf creb site of the cos promoter was exchanged with the gta variant the regulation was changed cos was then regulated by hac p a bzip protein known to be involved in the unfolded protein response of s cerevisiae indicating for the first time a possible functional category for the cos proteins of s cerevisiae
