RNA hairpins of the HIV-1 packaging signal and their complexes with the nucleocapsid protein p7 (NC) were probed by solvent-accessibility reagents and electrospray ionization-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (ESI-FTMS). The combination of dimethylsulfate, kethoxal, and 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)-carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) offers the full range of information on base-pairing and solvent exposure concerning the four more abundant ribonucleotides. ESI-FTMS provides a universal method to achieve a direct and unambiguous characterization of alkylated structures, with no need for the different probe-specific procedures required by established methodologies based on gel electrophoresis. It enables us to streamline the optimization of the conditions for probe administration to minimize the incidence of probe-induced distortion of the structures under investigation.Nucleotides located in the single-stranded loops of hairpins SL2, SL3 and SL4 manifested different levels of protection, which were correlated directly to their conformation and structural surroundings. A common feature noted for all the hairpins was the limited susceptibility observed for the guanine base located at the 5′-end of each tetraloop, which assumes a stacked position upon the last base-pair of the double-stranded stems.The remaining loop bases were found to be clearly accessible by modifying reagents in free RNA, but were effectively protected in the NC–hairpin complexes. While this finding is consistent with the proven participation of SL2 and SL3 loops in interactions with NC, it contrasts with prior suggestions that tetraloop bases in SL4 might not be involved directly in NC binding.Alkylation was detected for stem nucleotides, which are not involved in the normal base-pairing and stacking typical of double-stranded structures, such as adenine 15 of the SL2 triple-base platform. Modification of the blunt ends of the double-stranded stems was found to be absent or extremely limited, due to the annealing stabilization introduced by the presence of G–C pairs at the end of the stems structures. Previously undetected alkylation of guanine 3 and guanine 13 in SL4 provides direct evidence of the destabilizing effects induced by the tandem G·U wobbles on the double-stranded structure of this stem, which is thought to be important for the hairpin's biological function.
