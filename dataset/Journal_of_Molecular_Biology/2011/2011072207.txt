We reported recently that activation of the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) is required for efficient HIV-1 Gag trafficking and viral particle release. IP3R activation requires phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 to IP3 and diacylglycerol. We show that Sprouty2 (Spry2), which binds PI(4,5)P2 and PLCγ, interfered with PI(4,5)P2 in a manner similar to that of U73122, an inhibitor of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, suggesting that Spry2 negatively regulates IP3R by preventing formation of its activating ligand, IP3. Mutation to Asp of R252, a crucial determinant of PI(4,5)P2 binding in the C-terminal domain of Spry2, prevented the interference, indicating that binding to the phospholipid is required. By contrast, deletion of the PLCγ binding region or mutation of a critical Tyr residue in the region did not prevent the interference but Spry2-PI(4,5)P2 colocalization was not detected, suggesting that PLC binding is required for their stable association. Like U73122, Spry2 over-expression inhibited wild type Gag release as virus-like particles. Disrupting either binding determinant relieved the inhibition. IP3R-mediated Ca2+signaling, in turn, was found to influence Spry2 subcellular distribution and ERK, a Spry2 regulator. Our findings suggest that Spry2 influences IP3R function through control of PI(4,5)P2 and IP3R influences Spry2 function by controlling its distribution and ERK activation.
