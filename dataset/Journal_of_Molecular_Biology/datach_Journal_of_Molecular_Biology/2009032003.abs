structural and functional studies of the biotin protein ligase from aquifex aeolicus reveal a critical role for a conserved residue in target specificity
biotin protein ligase bpl ec      catalyses the formation of biotinyl   amp from biotin and atp and the succeeding biotinylation of the biotin carboxyl carrier protein we describe the crystal structures at     resolution of the class i bpl from the hyperthermophilic bacteria aquifex aeolicus aabpl in its ligand free form and in complex with biotin and atp the solvent exposed   and  phosphates of atp are located in the inter subunit cavity formed by the n and c terminal domains the arg  residue from the conserved gxgrxg motif is shown to interact with the carboxyl group of biotin and to stabilise the   and  phosphates of the nucleotide the structure of the mutant aabpl r g in both the ligand free and biotin bound forms reveals that the mutated loop has collapsed thus hindering atp binding isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the presence of biotin is not required for atp binding to wild type aabpl in the absence of mg  and the binding of biotin and atp has been determined to occur via a random but cooperative process the affinity for biotin is relatively unaffected by the r g mutation in contrast the thermodynamic data indicate that binding of atp to aabpl r g is very weak in the absence or in the presence of biotin the aabpl r g mutant remains catalytically active but shows poor substrate specificity mass spectrometry and western blot studies revealed that the mutant biotinylates both the target a aeolicus bccp   fragment and bsa and is subject to self biotinylation
