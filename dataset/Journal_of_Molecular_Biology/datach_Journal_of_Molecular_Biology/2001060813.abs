four way junctions in antisense rna mrna complexes involved in plasmid replication control a common theme
in several groups of bacterial plasmids antisense rnas regulate copy number through inhibition of replication initiator protein synthesis in plasmid r  we have recently shown that the inhibitory complex between the antisense rna copa and its target mrna copt is characterized by the formation of two intermolecular helices resulting in a four way junction structure and a side by side helical alignment based on lead induced cleavage and ribonuclease rnase v probing combined with molecular modeling a strikingly similar topology is supported for the complex formed between the antisense rna inc and mrna repz of plasmid col b p  in particular the position of the four way junction and the location of divalent ion binding site s indicate that the structural features of these two complexes are essentially the same in spite of sequence differences comparisons of several target and antisense rnas in other plasmids further indicate that similar binding pathways are used to form the inhibitory antisense target rna complexes thus in all these systems the structural features of both antisense and target rnas determine the topologically possible and kinetically favored pathway that is essential for efficient in vivo control
