novel dimerization fold of rap  rap  in human tfiif at    resolution edited by k nagai
general transcription factor iif tfiif is required for transcription by rna polymerase ii it consists minimally of a heterodimer of rna polymerase associated proteins rap  and rap  according to solution and mutagenesis studies the multiple domains of rap  and rap  bind polii tfiib taf  and dna in interactions that are essential for transcription initiation and elongation the x ray structure of the rap  rap  interaction domains at    resolution reveals a novel  triple barrel  dimerization fold and suggests with mutant data that interactions with the transcription apparatus are mediated not only by this tripartite  barrel but also via flexible loops and  and  structures extending from it
