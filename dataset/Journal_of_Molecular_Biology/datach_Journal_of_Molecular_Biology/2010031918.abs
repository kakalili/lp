functional interaction of the ras effector rassf with the tyrosine kinase lck critical role in nucleocytoplasmic transport and cell cycle regulation
rassf is a member of the ras association domain family which is known to be involved in cell growth regulation expression of rassf is extinguished selectively by epigenetic mechanism s in different cancers and cell lines and reexpression usually suppresses cell proliferation and tumorigenicity to date the mechanism regulating rassf nuclear transport and its role in cell growth regulation remains unclear using heterokaryon assay we have demonstrated that rassf shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and its export from the nucleus is sensitive to leptomycin b suggesting that rassf is exported from the nucleus by a crm  dependent export pathway we further demonstrate that rassf contains a hydrophobic rich nuclear export signal nes towards the c terminus and two nuclear localization signals  one each at the n terminus and the c terminus combination of mutational and immunofluorescence analyses suggests that the functional nes residing between amino acids   and   in the c terminus is necessary for the efficient export of rassf from the nucleus in addition substitution of conserved hydrophobic residues within the minimal nes impaired rassf export from the nucleus furthermore exchange of proline residues within the putative src homology  binding motifs altered the export of rassf from the nucleus despite the presence of functional nes suggesting that multiple domains independently modulate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of rassf  interestingly the present investigation provided evidence that rassf interacts with the tyrosine kinase lck through its c terminal src homology  binding motif and showed that lck mediated phosphorylation is critical for the efficient translocation of rassf into the nuclear compartment interestingly our data demonstrate that wild type and nuclear export defective  nes mutant of rassf but not the import defective mutant of accumulate the cells at g s phase and induce apoptosis furthermore the lck interaction defective mutant of rassf induces apoptosis without altering cell cycle progression suggesting that rassf induces apoptosis independent of cell cycle arrest together our data demonstrate that interaction with lck is critical for rassf phosphorylation which in turn regulates the cell growth control activity of rassf  finally we have shown that rassf encodes four splice variants and is translocated to the nucleus by the classical nuclear import pathway one of the splice variants rassf c was found to be localized in the cytoplasm and translocated into the nucleus upon leptomycin b treatment despite the absence of n terminal nuclear localization signal suggesting that distribution of rassf variants in different cellular compartments may be critical for ras dependent cell growth regulation collectively the present investigation provided evidence that lck mediated phosphorylation regulates the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and cell growth control activities of rassf
