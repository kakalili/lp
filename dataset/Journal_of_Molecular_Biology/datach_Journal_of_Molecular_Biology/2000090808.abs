characterization of a tn pre cleavage synaptic complex edited by m gottesman
protein catalyzed dna rearrangements typically require assembly of complex nucleoprotein structures in transposition and integration reactions these structures termed synaptic complexes are mandatory for catalysis we characterize the tn pre cleavage synaptic complex the simplest transposition complex described to date we identified this complex by gel retardation assay using short linear fragments and have shown that it contains a dimer of transposase two dna molecules and is competent for dna cleavage in the presence of mg  we also used hydroxyl radical footprinting and interference techniques to delineate the protein dna contacts made in the tn synaptic and monomer complexes all positions except position  of the end sequence are contacted by transposase in the synaptic complex we have determined that positions    of the end sequence are specifically required for synaptic complex formation as they are not required for monomer complex formation in addition in the synaptic complex there is a strong local distortion centered around position  which likely facilitates cleavage
