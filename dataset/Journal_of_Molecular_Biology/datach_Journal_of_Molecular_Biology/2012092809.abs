ph  dependent dimerization of spider silk n terminal domain requires relocation of a wedged tryptophan side chain
formation of spider silk from its constituent proteins  spidroins  involves changes from soluble helical coil conformations to insoluble  sheet aggregates this conversion needs to be regulated to avoid precocious aggregation proximally in the silk gland while still allowing rapid silk assembly in the distal parts lowering of ph from about  to  is apparently important for silk formation the spidroin n terminal domain nt undergoes stable dimerization and structural changes in this ph region but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood here we determine the nmr and crystal structures of euprosthenops australis nt mutated in the dimer interface a r  also the nmr structure of wild  type wt e australis nt at ph  and  mm sodium chloride was determined the wt nt and a r structures are monomers and virtually identical but they differ from the subunit structure of dimeric wt nt mainly by having a tryptophan w  buried between helix  and helix  while w  is surface exposed in the dimer wedging of the w  side chain in monomeric nt tilts helix  approximately     into a position that is incompatible with that of the observed dimer structure the structural differences between monomeric and dimeric nt domains explain the tryptophan fluorescence patterns of nt at ph and ph and indicate that the biological function of nt depends on conversion between the two conformations
