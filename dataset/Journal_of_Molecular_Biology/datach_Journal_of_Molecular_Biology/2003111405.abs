segg endonuclease promotes marker exclusion and mediates co conversion from a distant cleavage site
bacteriophages t and t are closely related t even phages however t genetic markers predominate in the progeny of mixed infections a phenomenon termed marker exclusion one region previously mapped where the frequency of t markers in the progeny is extremely low is located around gene   here we describe segg a giy yig family endonuclease adjacent to gene  of phage t that is absent from phage t  in co infections with t and t  cleavage in t gene  by t encoded segg initiates a gene conversion event that results in replacement of t gene  markers with the corresponding t sequence interestingly segg inheritance is limited apparently because of the physical separation of its cleavage and insertion sites which are   base pairs apart this contrasts with efficient inheritance of the phage t td group i intron and its endonuclease i tevi for which the distance separating the i tevi cleavage site and td insertion site is  base pairs furthermore we show that co conversion tracts generated by repair of segg and i tevi double strand breaks contribute to the localized exclusion of t markers our results demonstrate that the endonuclease activities of segg and i tevi promote the spread of these two endonucleases to progeny phage consistent with their role as selfish genetic elements and also provide a mechanism by which the genetic contribution of t markers to progeny phage is reduced
