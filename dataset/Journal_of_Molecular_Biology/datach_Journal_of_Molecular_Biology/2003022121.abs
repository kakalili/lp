involvement of retinoid x receptor  in coenzyme q metabolism
the nuclear retinoid x receptor   rxr  is the heterodimer partner in several nuclear receptors some of them regulating lipid biosynthesis since coenzyme q coq levels are greatly modified in aging and a number of diseases we have investigated the involvement of rxr  in the biosynthetic regulation of this lipid by using a hepatocyte specific rxr  deficient mouse strain rxr  def  in the receptor deficient liver the amount of coq decreased to half of the control and it was demonstrated that this decrease was caused by a significantly lowered rate of biosynthesis on the other hand induction of coq was extensive in both control and rxr  def liver using the peroxisomal inducer di  ethylhexyl phthalate dehp  since the rxr  deficiency was specific to liver no change in coq content or biosynthesis was observed in kidney the other mevalonate pathway lipids cholesterol and dolichol were unchanged in the rxr  def liver upon treatment with dehp cholesterol decreased in the control but remained unchanged in the receptor deficient mice in control mice cold exposure elevated coq levels by   but this induction did not occur in the liver of rxr  def mice in contrast ppar  null mice which lack induction upon treatment with peroxisomal inducers respond to cold exposure and coq content is increased the amount of cholesterol decreased in both control and rxr  def liver upon cold treatment the results demonstrate that rxr  is required for coq biosynthesis and for its induction upon cold treatment but does not appear to be involved in the basic synthesis of cholesterol and dolichol the receptor is not involved in the elevated coq biosynthesis during peroxisomal induction
