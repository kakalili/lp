destabilization and recovery of a yeast prion after mild heat shock
yeast prion psi  is a self perpetuating amyloid of the translational termination factor sup  although psi  propagation is modulated by heat shock proteins hsps  high temperature was previously reported to have little or no effect on psi  our results show that short term exposure of exponentially growing yeast culture to mild heat shock followed by immediate resumption of growth leads to psi  destabilization sometimes persisting for several cell divisions after heat shock prion loss occurring in the first division after heat shock is preferentially detected in a daughter cell indicating the impairment of prion segregation that results in asymmetric prion distribution between a mother cell and a bud longer heat shock or prolonged incubation in the absence of nutrients after heat shock led to psi  recovery both prion destabilization and recovery during heat shock depend on protein synthesis maximal prion destabilization coincides with maximal imbalance between hsp  and other hsps such as hsp  ssa deletions of individual ssa genes increase prion destabilization and or counteract recovery the dynamics of prion aggregation during destabilization and recovery are consistent with the notion that efficient prion fragmentation and segregation require a proper balance between hsp  and other e g  hsp  ssa chaperones in contrast to heat shock  psi  destabilization by osmotic stressors does not always depend on cell proliferation and or protein synthesis indicating that different stresses may impact the prion via different mechanisms our data demonstrate that heat stress causes asymmetric prion distribution in a cell division and confirm that the effects of hsps on prions are physiologically relevant
