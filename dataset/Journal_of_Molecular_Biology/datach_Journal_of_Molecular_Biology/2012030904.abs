crystal structure of the urokinase receptor in a ligand free form
the urokinase receptor urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor upar is a surface receptor capable of not only focalizing urokinase type plasminogen activator upa mediated fibrinolysis to the pericellular micro environment but also promoting cell migration and chemotaxis consistent with this multifunctional role upar binds several extracellular ligands including upa and vitronectin structural studies suggest that upar possesses structural flexibility it is however not clear whether this flexibility is an inherent property of the upar structure per se or whether it is induced upon ligand binding the crystal structure of human upar in its ligand free state would clarify this issue but such information remains unfortunately elusive we now report the crystal structures of a stabilized human upar h c n  c in its ligand free form to     and in complex with amino terminal fragment atf to     the structure of uparh c n  c in complex with atf resembles the wild type upar atf complex demonstrating that these mutations do not perturb the upa binding properties of upar the present structure of uparh c n  c provides the first structural definition of upar in its ligand free form which represents one of the biologically active conformations of upar as defined by extensive biochemical studies the domain boundary between upar di  dii domains is more flexible than the dii  diii domain boundary two important structural features are highlighted by the present upar structure first the di  diii domain boundary may face the cell membrane second loop      of upar plays a dynamic role during ligand loading unloading together these studies provide new insights into upar structure  function relationships emphasizing the importance of the inter domain dynamics of this modular receptor
